7705,study region hong kong is a megalopolis located on the southeast coast of china study focus megalopolis located in low lying coastal areas such as hong kong is especially vulnerable to compound flood risks from multiple flood drivers e g heavy rainstorms and extreme sea levels using long term hydrological observations and socio economic data this study aims to reveal the risks causes and socio economic impacts of compound floods from precipitation and sea level in hong kong new hydrological insights for the region we find that the most extreme sea levels are mostly accompanied by heavy precipitation and thus lead to compound floods while the most extreme precipitation events are less likely to coincide with extreme sea levels tcs are the major trigger of compound floods with fractional contributions ranging from 48 8 to 83 8 in the gauges typhoon wanda 1962 triggered the most severe compound flood with a joint return period of 178 years which is much shorter than the return period 10 000 years without the consideration of the dependence between the extremes during the past decades hong kong has experienced an increase in compound flood hazards which is mainly attributed to the mean sea level rise socio economic data reveals that tcs associated with compound floods are more destructive than tcs that induced single type floods highlighting the urgent need to establish a multi hazard flood risk management strategy graphical abstract ga1 keywords compound floods extreme sea levels tropical cyclones socio economic damage hong kong data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction coastal areas are usually affected by several types of floods such as fluvial floods and pluvial floods associated with precipitation as well as coastal floods caused by extreme sea levels when two or more different types of floods i e fluvial floods pluvial floods coastal floods occur simultaneously or in succession their impacts on society and the environment are usually enlarged by the interplay between different floods these kinds of floods are known as compound floods even though compound floods sometimes occur by accident in more cases the interdependency between different extremes is associated with certain conditions such as meteorological drivers and regional features the dependence between precipitation river discharge and storm surges sea levels has been examined by many previous studies at regional and global scales bevacqua et al 2020a couasnon et al 2020 lai et al 2021b svensson and jones 2002 2004 ward et al 2018 zheng et al 2013 based on multivariate probability functions many studies have assessed the joint probability of compound floods with the consideration of the dependence between different extremes across the world bevacqua et al 2019 lai et al 2021b ridder et al 2020 wahl et al 2015 these studies in general agree that coastal areas including southern and eastern europe the coast of the us east asia and northern australia are experiencing a higher probability of compound floods one of the most important weather systems that trigger compound floods in coastal areas is cyclones such as tropical cyclones tcs and extratropical cyclones etcs lai et al 2021b many compound floods that caused substantial damage in coastal areas are associated with cyclones for example the compound flood with heavy precipitation and extreme storm surge caused by hurricane harvey 2017 in texas resulted in an economic loss of more than 125 billion us dollars and at least 68 fatalities huang et al 2021 anon 2018 another example is typhoon mangkhut 2018 which is the costliest typhoon in hong kong that caused the highest economic loss of 910 million hong kong dollars hkd hko 2022a based on long term observations lai et al 2021b examined the role of cyclones on compound floods and found that tcs contribute to most compound floods in mid latitude coastal areas while etcs mainly affect high latitude areas such as europe and the coast of canada using the hydrodynamic models gori et al 2020a 2020b explored the impact of factors such as astronomical tides time lag and tc characteristics e g landfalling angle forward speed rainfall radius maximum wind speed on water levels of compound floods in a river basin on the east coast of the us and found that rainfall rate and time lag are important predictors of compound flood impacts these studies are important for better understanding the compound flood risks and the physical mechanisms however considering the great regional variations of compound flood risk more regional studies that consider the regional features are necessary for regional flood management furthermore although compound floods have caused substantial damage to society e g floods caused by hurricane harvey in 2017 and typhoon mangkhut in 2018 limited studies have systematically analyzed the socio economic impact of compound floods based on long term socio economic data hong kong is a densely populated and rapidly developing city located on the southeast coast of china hong kong is susceptible to compound floods from heavy precipitation and extreme sea levels caused by tcs the annual total precipitation amount in hong kong is 2400 mm with 4 5 extreme precipitation days i e 100 mm day per year hko 2022b the total area of hong kong is 1110 18 km2 with more than 50 of them being hilly areas and developed areas less than 25 chan et al 2013 much of the urbanized land is in low lying flood prone areas making hong kong highly vulnerable to flooding hong kong has suffered large economic losses and fatalities due to tc associated floods for example the typhoons in 1906 and 1937 causing about 15 000 and 11 000 deaths respectively are the deadliest typhoons in hong kong hko 2022c typhoon wanda in 1962 one of the most intense typhoons after world war ⅱ resulted in 150 deaths and 55 people missing hko 2022d in terms of economic losses typhoon mangkhut in 2018 is the costliest typhoon that resulted in an economic loss of more than 900 million hkd damage in monetary terms hko 2022a to adapt to climate change and increase the city s resilience to floods a three pronged flood prevention strategy has been proposed to enhance the stormwater drainage capacities considering the diverse terrain and land use conditions in hong kong dsd 2022a li et al 2022 that is the rainwater drainage tunnel is used to intercept and drain the stormwater from the upstream to the sea or river directly the underground stormwater storage tanks are set in midstream to store extra stormwater temporarily to mitigate the flood peak and the river downstream is trained to increase the drainage capacities based on this strategy a series of engineering projects such as village flood pumping schemes and the happy valley underground stormwater storage scheme has been adopted and effectively increased the flood protection capacity of hong kong dsd 2022a 2022b furthermore many non structural measures such as the extreme weather alerts provided by hong kong observatory hko and the emergency response drills are also critical for flood risk mitigation chan et al 2013 2018 under climate change the precipitation becomes more intense sea level rise is expected to accelerate and the frequency of intense tcs may increase as reported by hko the mean sea level in victoria harbour increased by 31 mm decade during 1954 2020 hko 2022e the short duration heavy rainfall has become more intense and extreme precipitation days have increased during the past decades hko 2022f these changes further aggravate different types of floods e g coastal pluvial and flash floods in hong kong making flood risk management more challenging the occurrence of typhoon mangkhut in 2018 makes people aware of the destructive power of compound floods the heavy precipitation and extreme sea levels during mangkhut caused widespread flooding in many low lying coastal areas resulting in more than 400 people injured and enormous economic losses hko 2022a in recent years compound floods from multiple flood drivers hazards have received more and more attention previous studies have discussed the compound flood potential in hong kong by analyzing the dependence between precipitation and storm surge which was limited to only one tide gauge fang et al 2021 another recent study simulated the inundation process of compound floods during typhoon mangkhut 2018 illustrating the effect of a proper drainage system in mitigating flood severity qiang et al 2021 even though there are more questions about the compound flood in hong kong needed to be answered for example what is the joint probability of compound floods and what is the contribution of tcs how do compound floods change during past decades how does the sea level rise affect compound floods and what is the impact of compound floods on society and the environment here we assess the compound flood hazards in hong kong by estimating the joint return periods the contribution of tcs to triggering compound floods is analyzed the temporal evolution of compound floods and the impact of sea level rise are evaluated based on long term observations especially the impact of compound floods on the socio economy is analyzed based on recorded damages including persons affected and economic losses caused by tc events in hong kong the data and methods used in this study are introduced in section 2 section 3 elaborated and discussed the results in section 4 the main findings of this study are summarized 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 daily precipitation and sea level data the daily higher high water level data recorded as meters above the chart datum of 6 tide gauges namely quarry bay qub tsim bei tsui tbt shek pik shp tai miu wan tmw tai po kau tpk and waglan island wag are collected from hko https www hko gov hk en cis climat htm the water level records from 1954 to 1985 at qub are based on the data of the tide gauge north point which was relocated to qub in 1986 the consistency of the data before and after 1986 at this tide gauge has been checked by ip and wai 1990 and ding et al 2001 moreover the annual mean sea levels at the 6 gauges are obtained from the hko to evaluate the impact of sea level rise on the evolution of compound floods the daily precipitation data of 53 stations in hong kong are collected the locations of the tide gauges and precipitation stations are shown in fig 1 each tide gauge is paired with the nearest precipitation station in case the record length of the nearest precipitation station cannot cover that of the tide gauge the second nearest precipitation station is used and so on the largest distance between the tide gauge and the paired precipitation station cannot exceed 10 km the years with a missing data rate larger than 25 are removed the tide gauge qub has the longest 60 overlapping years of precipitation and sea level records while the length of overlapping years ranges from 18 to 34 years in other tide gauges the overlapping years of precipitation and sea level data in each tide gauge are shown in fig 2 2 1 2 tc tracks and the maximum storm surge during tcs the tc tracks indicated by the longitude and latitude of tc centers provided by the international best track archive for climate stewardship ibtracs version 4 https www ncdc noaa gov ibtracs knapp et al 2010 are used in this study to analyze the impact of tcs on compound floods when a tc center is located within 500 km of a tide gauge the precipitation and sea levels of that day and 1 day are considered associated with that tc khouakhi et al 2017 lai et al 2020 2021b zhang et al 2018a 2018b the maximum storm surges caused by tcs from 1961 to 2019 are collected from hko to examine the impact of meteorological driven storm surge on extreme sea level compound floods https www hko gov hk en wservice tsheet pms stormsurgedb htm although the sea level data in 1964 is missing at qub fig 2 the highest sea levels of the 5 tc events in 1964 are available on the website storm surge records in hong kong during the passage of tropical cyclones provided by hko https www hko gov hk en wservice tsheet pms stormsurgedb htm t search v 1964 1964 given these 5 tc events were extreme and caused damage in hong kong the 5 tc events are included when analyzing the joint return periods of compound floods and socio economic damage induced by tc events 2 1 3 socio economic damage caused by tcs tc induced socio economic damage data including the persons dead missing and persons injured from 1961 to 2019 and economic losses in money from 1988 to 2019 is collected from tropical cyclone annual report published by hko http www hko gov hk en publica pubtc htm to investigate the socio economic impact of tc induced compound floods https www hko gov hk en informtc historical tc cdtc htm with the socio economic development in hong kong the population and property exposed to natural hazards have been increasing significantly in this study the economic losses are normalized by dividing the actual losses by the gross domestic product gdp of the year when the losses occurred neumayer and barthel 2011 sajjad and chan 2020 the gdp information is obtained from the census and statistics department of hong kong https www censtatd gov hk en the fatalities and persons injured caused by lightning stroke are excluded because they are less related to the floods the information including the record periods and data sources of all datasets used in this study are summarized in table 1 it has to be noted that this damage dataset only contains the damage caused by tc events and the damage unrelated to tcs is not included for example the damage caused by heavy rainstorms triggered by monsoons is not covered in this analysis besides the reported damages might not be caused by floods since tcs can cause different disasters such as floods landslides strong winds etc nevertheless this dataset is one acceptable option to approximately explore the socio economic impact of compound floods in hong kong because tcs are one of the most important triggers of compound floods in hong kong see results therefore tc induced damage can be used as a proxy for the damage caused by compound floods this study aims to provide a preliminary understanding of the impact of compound floods on the socio economy in hong kong 2 2 methods 2 2 1 identification of compound floods compound floods are defined as the co occurrences of extreme precipitation and extreme sea levels that exceed their 95th percentile values this definition of compound floods based on the peak over threshold method has been used in many previous studies for example bevacqua et al 2019 defined compound floods as the co occurrences of extreme precipitation and extreme storm surges exceeding their 99 7th percentile values and fang et al 2021 applied the same definition using the 98th percentile values as the threshold extreme precipitation and extreme sea levels are also sampled using the peak over threshold method separately in the analysis of the temporal changes of compound floods the impact of the selection of threshold on the results is evaluated by using the 85th 90th and 95th percentile values to define compound flood days fang et al 2021 gori et al 2022 lai et al 2021a extreme sea levels are used in this study because the flood prevention standards in hong kong are based on sea levels and the sea levels are better associated with the socio economic impacts and damages of coastal floods dsd 2022a 2022b 2 2 2 estimation of return periods of compound floods to estimate the joint return periods of compound floods compound events with precipitation and sea levels simultaneously exceeding the 95th percentile values are selected to establish the copula functions between precipitation and sea levels clusters of selected compound floods separated by 3 days are taken as one compound flood to ensure the independence between compound floods bevacqua et al 2019 the copula based joint return periods of compound floods are calculated following the method used by bevacqua et al 2019 and lai et al 2021b at each tide gauge we choose the best fit copula function from a pool including five types of copula functions i e normal t clayton gumbel and frank copula functions according to the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 the marginal cumulative distribution of precipitation and sea levels of selected compound floods are modeled using the generalized pareto distribution a widely used distribution for modeling the peaks over threshold bezak et al 2014 dsd 2018 the parameters of copula and marginal functions are estimated using the maximum likelihood estimator bevacqua et al 2020b xu et al 2018 goodness of fit is tested using the cramer von mises test genest et al 2009 the joint return period is calculated as salvadori and de michele 2004 1 t r r s s 1 p r r s s 1 1 f r r f s s f r s where f r r and f s s are the cumulative distribution functions of precipitation and sea levels respectively f r s is the copula function representing the dependence between precipitation and sea levels 2 2 3 examination of the temporal evolution of compound floods the changes in compound flood risks are interpreted by the trends of the annual number of compound flood days i e days when compound floods occur because the increase of compound flood days implies more frequent and or longer lasting compound flood events and vice versa similar indices based on the frequency of extremes are often used to reflect the changes in extreme events in previous studies e g fatichi and caporali 2009 lai et al 2021a li et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 when a high sea level event occurs the probability of compound floods increases as precipitation increases and when heavy precipitation happens the higher the sea levels the greater the occurrence probability of compound floods therefore the trends in precipitation on days with extreme sea levels and the trends in sea levels on days with extreme precipitation are also estimated to explore their relationship with changes in compound floods to explore the impact of mean sea level rise on the temporal trends in compound floods the component of mean sea level of the daily maximum sea level data is replaced by the long term mean sea level to remove the yearly changes in mean sea level rise pasquier et al 2019 for each year the sea level series excluding the mean sea level rise can be calculated as 2 sl sl msl 1 msl 2 where sl is the sea level series excluding the mean sea level rise sl is the original sea level data msl 1 is the mean sea level of that year and msl 2 is the long term mean sea level of all years a nonparametric trend detection method the modified mann kendall mk test is employed to detect the trends of the annual number of compound flood days precipitation on days with extreme sea levels and sea levels on days with extreme precipitation hamed and rao 1998 the advantage of the modified mk test is that it considers the autocorrelation of time series the magnitudes of trends are estimated using sen s slope method sen 1968 when examining the trends of socio economic damage caused by tcs we use both the modified mk test and the linear regression method ross 2017 to examine the trends 2 2 4 identification of the type of extreme events that caused damage tcs can cause different types of floods e g compound floods extreme precipitation without extreme sea levels or extreme sea levels without extreme precipitation at different stations however the casualties and total economic losses in hong kong are reported for each tcs i e there is no detailed information about where and when the damage occurred within the city to categorize casualties and economic losses into damage caused by different flood types we take the flood type at the majority of gauges during a tc event as the dominant flood type and assume that the damage was resulted from the dominant flood type if a tc caused two or more types of floods at the same number of gauges the flood type that occurred at the gauge with the longest record length is regarded as the dominant flood type caused by that tc then the damage caused by different types of floods is analyzed 3 results and discussion 3 1 joint probability and trigger of compound flood hazards in hong kong 3 1 1 heavy precipitation extreme sea level and their cooccurrence in hong kong and the contribution of tcs the cumulative probability of precipitation and sea levels at the 6 gauges are shown in fig 3 the panel is divided into 4 zones by the 95th percentile precipitation and sea level values compound floods in zone 1 extreme precipitation without extreme sea level in zone 2 extreme sea level without extreme precipitation in zone 3 and non extreme events in zone 4 to examine the relationships between different types of extreme events and tcs the fractional contributions of tc associated events to different types of floods are calculated and shown in the corresponding zones fig 3 shows that the most extreme precipitation events are found in zone 2 which contains extreme precipitation without extreme sea level for example the highest precipitation at qub is 411 3 mm day which is found in zone 2 i e the extreme precipitation event occurs without extreme sea level the most extreme precipitation in zone 1 i e concurrent extreme precipitation and extreme sea levels is 322 8 mm day which is lower than that in zone 2 by contrast the most extreme sea levels are more likely to be accompanied by extreme precipitation and thus are mostly found in the compound flood zone i e zone 1 for example the highest sea level in zone 1 is 3 96 m at qub which is much higher than the highest sea level 3 32 m in zone 3 i e the extreme sea level event occurs without extreme precipitation similar patterns can be found at other tide gauges when looking at the relationship between extreme events and tcs it can be found most compound floods were associated with tcs the fractional contributions of tcs to compound floods zone 1 at 5 out of the 6 gauges exceed 50 and those at qub tpk and wag reach 72 6 83 8 and 81 8 respectively the tc s contributions to the non compound extreme events in zone 2 and zone 3 are much lower ranging from 7 5 to 21 4 these results indicate that the extreme sea levels triggered by tcs are very likely to co occur with extreme precipitation and therefore lead to compound floods i e triangles in zone 1 however the most extreme precipitation does not tend to coincide with extreme sea levels because tcs are not the only weather system that causes extreme precipitation in hong kong located on the southeast coast of china hong kong is surrounded by the south china sea and is affected by the east asia summer monsoon chang et al 2012 li et al 2015 yu et al 2020 during the summer monsoon season the abundant warm moisture from the western north pacific and the hilly and mountainous terrain in hong kong provide favourable conditions for convectional and orographic extreme precipitation convectional precipitation characterized by short duration and high intensity is also common in hong kong and is likely to be intensified by rapid urbanization in hong kong li et al 2021 3 1 2 joint return periods of compound floods based on the extreme events in zone 1 the joint probability distributions of compound floods at the 6 gauges are estimated by employing the copula functions the joint return periods of compound floods are illustrated in fig 4 since the tide gauge qub has the longest record length the following analysis mainly focuses on the results at qub for brevity the most severe i e the longest return period compound flood in history with the longest joint return period i e 178 years was induced by typhoon wanda 1962 the maximum sea level caused by wanda reached 3 96 m with a univariate return period exceeding 200 years according to the estimates of dsd 2018 the highest daily precipitation during typhoon wanda is 203 mm day which exceeds the annual level the mean annual maximum daily precipitation is 190 mm day dsd 2018 the other over 1 in 100 year compound flood was caused by typhoon mangkhut in 2018 with a maximum daily precipitation of 167 5 mm and a maximum sea level of 3 88 m these two tcs caused enormous damage in hong kong see section 3 3 for details if precipitation and sea levels are assumed to be statistically independent the return periods of compound floods caused by wanda and mangkhut are 10 000 years i e reciprocal of the product of the probability of heavy precipitation and the probability of extreme sea level this demonstrates the necessity of considering the dependence on precipitation and sea levels otherwise the risks of compound flood hazards may be significantly underestimated the combinations of precipitation and sea levels that cause compound floods can be various as discussed above the sea levels of the compound floods caused by wanda and mangkhut are the most extreme among all compound floods comparatively the heavy precipitation caused by these two tcs i e 190 mm day for wanda and 167 5 mm day for mangkhut is not the most extreme since there are many other compound flood events with more intense precipitation for example the maximum daily precipitation caused by typhoon brenda 1989 is 323 mm day which is much higher than that caused by wanda and mangkhut however the joint return period of compound flood caused by brenda is 81 years due to the relatively lower sea levels i e 2 79 m moreover there are a total of 10 compound floods with a joint return period between 20 and 50 years in qub with their sea levels ranging from 2 6 m to 3 6 m and the precipitation between 44 mm and 250 mm this result demonstrates the considerable variations in the combination of precipitation and sea levels for compound floods with similar return levels extreme sea levels are jointly determined by tc triggered storm surges and the astronomical tide the most extreme sea levels are usually associated with the highest storm surge as shown by the color in fig 4 such as those of typhoon wanda 1962 hato 2017 and mangkhut 2018 at the same time astronomical tides also play an important role in extreme sea levels for example typhoon mangkhut triggered a maximum storm surge height of 2 35 m at qub which is much higher than the maximum storm surge of 1 18 m during typhoon hato however the occurrence of typhoon hato coincided with the high water of astronomical tide resulting in a maximum total sea level of 3 57 m which is comparable to the highest sea level of 3 88 m during typhoon mangkhut it shall be noted that the time when the maximum storm surge occurred might be different from the time when the maximum sea level occurred comparing the joint return period of compound floods in all six tide gauges we found that the joint return period of the compound flood event caused by typhoon mangkhut exceeds 50 years at tbt shp tmw and tpk differences also exist between different locations for example the maximum sea level caused by typhoon mangkhut is higher than that triggered by typhoon hato at qub tmw and tpk however the maximum sea level of hato exceeds that of mangkhut at tbt the joint return period of typhoon mangkhut is abnormally large at tpk i e 500 years as a matter of fact the highest sea level at tpk recorded by hko is 5 03 m during typhoon wanda in 1962 however this event is not included in this study because there is no corresponding precipitation data at tpk at that time in this case the return periods of compound floods caused by mangkhut at tpk may be overestimated the data after 2017 is not available at wag thus the data of the compound flood associated with mangkhut is not available for the probability distribution of this tide gauge the compound flood caused by hato at wag is not as severe as that at other locations such as qub tbt and tpk at wag the most extreme compound flood with a return period of 86 years was triggered by typhoon utor 2001 the differences in the results between different tide gauges are affected by many factors including the differences in record length the approaching way i e from west or east of tcs and topographic conditions such as the elevation water depth and the shape of the coastline for example the tcs sweeping hong kong from the west and south side may cause storm surges higher than from the east side due to the anti clockwise wind of tcs in the northern hemisphere and the geographic condition of hong kong hko 2022g and in general the storm surge in tpk would be higher than in other tide gauges due to the special bag shape bay lee and wong 2007 the annual mean precipitation amount is relatively higher over the mountain ranges in hong kong because of the orographic enhancement effect yeung et al 2011 3 2 temporal evolution of compound floods in hong kong the trends in the number of compound flood days with extreme precipitation and sea levels are calculated to examine the temporal evolution of compound floods in hong kong as shown in table 2 increasing trends in the number of compound flood days defined using the 85th and 90th percentile values can be found at all 6 gauges and most of them are significant at the 95 level α 0 05 the rates of increase in compound floods exceeding the 85th percentile values range from 1 2 to 4 69 days decade and 0 37 2 86 days decade for those exceeding the 90th percentile when a higher threshold of the 95th percentile is used significant upward trends are found at tbt and tmw meanwhile the sample size of compound flood days reduces when a higher threshold is used leading to a less robust trend analysis the changes in precipitation under extreme sea levels and sea levels under extreme precipitation are also examined since they reflect the probability and intensity of compound floods precipitation under extreme sea levels i e precipitation in days with sea levels exceeding the 85th 90th or 95th percentiles shows insignificant trends in most of the gauges during past decades table 2 at qub the precipitation under extreme sea levels defined by the 90th percentile increased significantly by 0 78 mm decade while that defined by the 95th percentile decreased significantly by 1 43 mm decade by contrast increases in sea level under extreme precipitation i e sea levels in days with precipitation exceeding the 85th 90th or 95th percentiles are detected in all gauges the increasing trends are significant at qub tbt tpk and wag with rates of 18 7 65 2 37 8 and 78 9 mm decade respectively the comparison of the trends in compound flood days precipitation and sea levels suggests that the increase in compound flood days is very likely caused by elevated sea levels tables 2 and 3 show that the rates of increasing sea levels under extreme precipitation are close to the rates of annual mean sea level rise for example the annual mean sea levels at qub have risen by 23 9 mm per decade while the rising rates of the sea levels under extreme precipitation exceeding the 85th 90th and 95th percentile at qub are 18 0 18 7 and 18 3 mm decade respectively therefore mean sea level rise is an important cause of the increase in sea level under extreme precipitation and the number of compound flood days to further examine the impact of sea level rise on the changes in compound floods we replace the annual mean sea level component of sea level data with the long term mean sea level and hence carry out trend analysis on the detrended sea level see methods after excluding the impact of mean sea level rise the trends in sea levels under extreme precipitation become insignificant or even decreasing table 4 for example the significant increasing trends in the sea levels under extreme precipitation at qub tpk and wag shift to decreasing trends after removing the effect of mean sea level rise at the same time the significant increasing trends in the number of compound flood days become insignificant and the change rates also decrease and even turn to 0 3 3 damages associated with tcs the damage information including the economic losses in money and persons dead missing caused by tc associated hazards is collected from hko http www hko gov hk en publica pubtc htm to explore the social and economic impact of the compound floods in hong kong a total of 181 tcs were reported to have caused damages in hong kong during 1961 2019 and economic losses in money have been reported since 1988 our results show that the annual absolute number of tcs reported damage and its ratio to the total number of tcs affecting hong kong significantly increased by 0 021 and 0 006 per year during 1961 2019 respectively fig 5 the year 1988 is found to be the change point of the rate of tcs reported damage which shifted from 0 37 before 1988 0 56 after 1988 besides between 1988 and 2019 the absolute number and the ratio of tcs reported damages do not show any significant trend these results indicate that fewer tcs were reported to cause damage before 1988 and the higher and relatively stable ratio after 1988 adds more confidence to the reliability of the damage information after 1988 the time series of damage caused by tcs that associated with different types of extreme events are shown in figs 6 and 7 the statistical trends of socio economic damage are shown in table 5 the economic losses in money caused by all tcs tend to increase during 1988 2019 even though the monotonic increasing trends based on modified mk test are not statistically significant the linear upward trends are significant at the 90 level table 5 significant linear increasing trend is also detected in the economic losses in money caused by tcs associated with compound floods by contrast there is no trend detected in economic losses caused by tcs induced extreme precipitation or extreme sea levels typhoon mangkhut 2018 which triggered severe compound floods caused the highest economic loss of 910 million hkd hko 2022a typhoon dot 1993 and typhoon sam 1999 triggered the two most costly tc associated extreme precipitation with actual economic losses of 128 2 and 131 5 million hkd respectively the time series of normalized and actual economic losses show similar results but the normalization magnified the economic losses in the earlier years because of the corresponding lower gdp sajjad and chan 2020 in total the economic losses caused by tcs associated with compound floods extreme precipitation only and extreme sea levels only contribute to 54 7 39 4 and 4 3 of the total amount of economic losses respectively calculated based on the normalized economic losses when it comes to the persons dead missing the significant decreasing trends in the persons dead missing caused by tcs associated with compound floods during 1961 2019 can be detected by both the modified mk test and linear regression method fig 7a and table 5 a significant linear decreasing trend was also detected in the number of persons dead missing caused by all tcs the annual number of persons dead missing is 40 since 1972 and 10 after 1983 typhoon wanda in 1962 triggered the most severe compound flood and resulted in the most persons dead missing i e 130 fatalities and 53 persons missing fig 7a overall tcs associated with compound floods extreme precipitation only and extreme sea level only are responsible for 61 8 31 5 and 4 4 of the total fatalities and missing persons respectively as shown in fig 7b the year 1999 has the largest number of persons injured mainly due to typhoon york 500 persons and typhoon sam 328 persons and these two typhoons caused extreme precipitation only typhoon mangkhut 2018 resulted in 458 persons injured which is only second to typhoon york in 1999 typhoon ellen in 1983 caused 333 persons injured the sea level data at qub during this event is missing while in gauges that have sea level records the corresponding precipitation data is not available even though as reported in the tropical cyclone annual report published by hko the highest tide recorded at tbt and tpk are 3 62 and 3 06 m both exceeding their 95th percentile values the recorded highest daily precipitation at hko precipitation stations paired with qub is 172 4 mm which also reached the extreme precipitation level therefore typhoon ellen 1983 is classified as a compound flood event in this study in this case the fractional contribution of tcs associated with compound floods to persons injured in hong kong is 52 1 which is higher than the other two types of extremes i e 35 5 for tcs associated with extreme precipitation and 10 4 for tcs associated with extreme sea levels more than half of the economic losses and people affected dead missing and injured were caused by tcs related to compound floods and the most costly and deadliest disasters were also associated with tcs that triggered compound floods this result is consistent with fang et al 2021 who also found that tc events with high compound flood potential caused most of the economic damage and casualties in hong kong the difference between fang et al 2021 and this study is that fang et al 2021 evaluated the contribution of compound floods on the tc induced socio economic damage while this study focuses on the changes in compound floods associated socio economic consequences during the past decades with different focuses both studies are significant in improving our understanding on the extent and trends of compound flood associated hazards in a city scale which are important scientific references for enhancing flood risk mitigation reduction strategies one important caveat is that since the reported socio economic damage caused by tc events in hong kong does not contain information such as when and where the damage occurred or what kind of disasters caused the damage it is difficult to exactly quantify the contributions of compound floods on socio economic damage even though this analysis illustrated the increasing threats of tcs associated with compound floods to society and the economy based on the records of historical events the increasing economic losses caused by tcs associated with compound floods in hong kong implies that holistic flood risk management is needed to improve a city s flood resistance and resilience under climate change and socio economic development the traditional flood management designed for a single flood hazard should evolve toward a more comprehensive and holistic flood risk management frame that considers the connections between multiple flood factors e g precipitation and sea levels multiple hazards e g floods strong winds and landslides during typhoons and the various ways the damage occurs raymond et al 2020 zscheischler et al 2018 for example the design of flood protection should fully consider the different occurrence probabilities of various combinations of extreme precipitation and sea levels given that the most extreme sea levels are often accompanied by extreme precipitation it is necessary to consider how the accompanying extreme precipitation may affect the designed scheme when designing flood protection against extreme sea levels e g seawall embankment etc besides the increasing compound flood hazards due to sea level rise indicate that the design of flood protection relying on historical records should further consider the impact of climate change and update design criteria such as intensity duration frequency curve with consideration of sea level rise zhao et al 2022 the socio economic impacts of disasters like typhoon mangkhut and typhoon hato tell us that only flood prevention infrastructures are not enough to cope with the flood risks because extreme events become more intense and population and economy grow rapidly therefore in addition to engineering measures more non structural measures are recommended to reduce the socio economic losses caused by floods such as improving early warning systems and strengthening public awareness and capacity for flood risk prevention and mitigation chan et al 2018 4 conclusions in this study compound floods from extreme precipitation and extreme sea levels in hong kong are analyzed in terms of the joint probability the temporal evolutions over past decades the contribution of tcs and the socio economic consequences our main findings can be concluded as follows 1 the analysis of the joint occurrences of precipitation and sea levels indicates that tcs are the major trigger of compound floods in hong kong the most extreme sea levels tend to be accompanied by heavy precipitation while the most extreme precipitation is less likely to coincide with extreme sea levels that is because the most extreme sea levels were associated with tcs and tcs usually bring about precipitation but the most extreme precipitation events were triggered by other weather systems rather than tcs most compound floods were associated with tcs in hong kong the percentage of tc induced compound floods defined using the 95th percentiles ranges from 48 8 to 83 8 in the tide gauges 2 with the consideration of the statistical dependence between precipitation and sea levels we identified that the most severe compound flood was triggered by typhoon wanda 1962 with a joint return period of 178 years which is much shorter compared to the return period 10 000 years estimated without taking into account of the interdependence of the extremes the return periods of compound floods are jointly determined by the return levels of precipitation and sea levels for instance even though the maximum daily precipitation caused by typhoon brenda 1989 is much higher than that caused by typhoon wanda the joint return period of compound floods caused by brenda is shorter due to its relatively lower sea level 3 the analysis of the temporal evolution shows that the number of compound flood days has increased significantly during past decades which is primarily attributed to sea level rise after the component of sea level rise is removed the increasing trends in compound flood days become insignificant for example the numbers of compound flood days at qub and tpk increased significantly by 0 37 and 1 11 days per year respectively table 2 however after the trend in mean sea levels is removed i e 23 9 mm year at qub and 42 9 mm year at tpk the change rates of the number of compound flood days turn to 0 at both tide gauges 4 based on the historical record of socio economic damage caused by tc events in hong kong we found that the socio economic losses caused by tcs associated with compound floods are higher than that caused by extreme precipitation or extreme sea level only for example tcs associated with compound floods are responsible for 54 7 of the total amount of tc induced economic losses 61 8 of the total number of persons dead missing and 52 1 of the total number of persons injured caused by tcs our analysis of the temporal changes shows that the economic losses caused by tcs associated with compound floods tend to increase during 1988 2019 while the economic losses caused by tcs that induced extreme precipitation and extreme sea levels show no trend we also found that the annual number of persons dead missing caused by tcs associated with compound floods has been reduced significantly during 1961 2019 in this study we analyzed the socio economic impacts of compound floods based on historical records nevertheless the socio economic data we collected contains only tc induced damage in hong kong and thus our analysis is limited to those tc induced compound floods besides considering the data availability and the important socio economic status this study focuses on hong kong as a case study in the future it is of great importance to conduct more studies based on socio economic data derived from multiple sources such as data from social media and in other coastal cities across the world even so the findings presented in this study can help to better understand the potential risk and socio economic impact of compound floods in hong kong and serve as a scientific reference for the flood management design the methods used in this study can also be applied in other coastal areas to explore compound flood risks in different areas credit

7705,study region hong kong is a megalopolis located on the southeast coast of china study focus megalopolis located in low lying coastal areas such as hong kong is especially vulnerable to compound flood risks from multiple flood drivers e g heavy rainstorms and extreme sea levels using long term hydrological observations and socio economic data this study aims to reveal the risks causes and socio economic impacts of compound floods from precipitation and sea level in hong kong new hydrological insights for the region we find that the most extreme sea levels are mostly accompanied by heavy precipitation and thus lead to compound floods while the most extreme precipitation events are less likely to coincide with extreme sea levels tcs are the major trigger of compound floods with fractional contributions ranging from 48 8 to 83 8 in the gauges typhoon wanda 1962 triggered the most severe compound flood with a joint return period of 178 years which is much shorter than the return period 10 000 years without the consideration of the dependence between the extremes during the past decades hong kong has experienced an increase in compound flood hazards which is mainly attributed to the mean sea level rise socio economic data reveals that tcs associated with compound floods are more destructive than tcs that induced single type floods highlighting the urgent need to establish a multi hazard flood risk management strategy graphical abstract ga1 keywords compound floods extreme sea levels tropical cyclones socio economic damage hong kong data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction coastal areas are usually affected by several types of floods such as fluvial floods and pluvial floods associated with precipitation as well as coastal floods caused by extreme sea levels when two or more different types of floods i e fluvial floods pluvial floods coastal floods occur simultaneously or in succession their impacts on society and the environment are usually enlarged by the interplay between different floods these kinds of floods are known as compound floods even though compound floods sometimes occur by accident in more cases the interdependency between different extremes is associated with certain conditions such as meteorological drivers and regional features the dependence between precipitation river discharge and storm surges sea levels has been examined by many previous studies at regional and global scales bevacqua et al 2020a couasnon et al 2020 lai et al 2021b svensson and jones 2002 2004 ward et al 2018 zheng et al 2013 based on multivariate probability functions many studies have assessed the joint probability of compound floods with the consideration of the dependence between different extremes across the world bevacqua et al 2019 lai et al 2021b ridder et al 2020 wahl et al 2015 these studies in general agree that coastal areas including southern and eastern europe the coast of the us east asia and northern australia are experiencing a higher probability of compound floods one of the most important weather systems that trigger compound floods in coastal areas is cyclones such as tropical cyclones tcs and extratropical cyclones etcs lai et al 2021b many compound floods that caused substantial damage in coastal areas are associated with cyclones for example the compound flood with heavy precipitation and extreme storm surge caused by hurricane harvey 2017 in texas resulted in an economic loss of more than 125 billion us dollars and at least 68 fatalities huang et al 2021 anon 2018 another example is typhoon mangkhut 2018 which is the costliest typhoon in hong kong that caused the highest economic loss of 910 million hong kong dollars hkd hko 2022a based on long term observations lai et al 2021b examined the role of cyclones on compound floods and found that tcs contribute to most compound floods in mid latitude coastal areas while etcs mainly affect high latitude areas such as europe and the coast of canada using the hydrodynamic models gori et al 2020a 2020b explored the impact of factors such as astronomical tides time lag and tc characteristics e g landfalling angle forward speed rainfall radius maximum wind speed on water levels of compound floods in a river basin on the east coast of the us and found that rainfall rate and time lag are important predictors of compound flood impacts these studies are important for better understanding the compound flood risks and the physical mechanisms however considering the great regional variations of compound flood risk more regional studies that consider the regional features are necessary for regional flood management furthermore although compound floods have caused substantial damage to society e g floods caused by hurricane harvey in 2017 and typhoon mangkhut in 2018 limited studies have systematically analyzed the socio economic impact of compound floods based on long term socio economic data hong kong is a densely populated and rapidly developing city located on the southeast coast of china hong kong is susceptible to compound floods from heavy precipitation and extreme sea levels caused by tcs the annual total precipitation amount in hong kong is 2400 mm with 4 5 extreme precipitation days i e 100 mm day per year hko 2022b the total area of hong kong is 1110 18 km2 with more than 50 of them being hilly areas and developed areas less than 25 chan et al 2013 much of the urbanized land is in low lying flood prone areas making hong kong highly vulnerable to flooding hong kong has suffered large economic losses and fatalities due to tc associated floods for example the typhoons in 1906 and 1937 causing about 15 000 and 11 000 deaths respectively are the deadliest typhoons in hong kong hko 2022c typhoon wanda in 1962 one of the most intense typhoons after world war ⅱ resulted in 150 deaths and 55 people missing hko 2022d in terms of economic losses typhoon mangkhut in 2018 is the costliest typhoon that resulted in an economic loss of more than 900 million hkd damage in monetary terms hko 2022a to adapt to climate change and increase the city s resilience to floods a three pronged flood prevention strategy has been proposed to enhance the stormwater drainage capacities considering the diverse terrain and land use conditions in hong kong dsd 2022a li et al 2022 that is the rainwater drainage tunnel is used to intercept and drain the stormwater from the upstream to the sea or river directly the underground stormwater storage tanks are set in midstream to store extra stormwater temporarily to mitigate the flood peak and the river downstream is trained to increase the drainage capacities based on this strategy a series of engineering projects such as village flood pumping schemes and the happy valley underground stormwater storage scheme has been adopted and effectively increased the flood protection capacity of hong kong dsd 2022a 2022b furthermore many non structural measures such as the extreme weather alerts provided by hong kong observatory hko and the emergency response drills are also critical for flood risk mitigation chan et al 2013 2018 under climate change the precipitation becomes more intense sea level rise is expected to accelerate and the frequency of intense tcs may increase as reported by hko the mean sea level in victoria harbour increased by 31 mm decade during 1954 2020 hko 2022e the short duration heavy rainfall has become more intense and extreme precipitation days have increased during the past decades hko 2022f these changes further aggravate different types of floods e g coastal pluvial and flash floods in hong kong making flood risk management more challenging the occurrence of typhoon mangkhut in 2018 makes people aware of the destructive power of compound floods the heavy precipitation and extreme sea levels during mangkhut caused widespread flooding in many low lying coastal areas resulting in more than 400 people injured and enormous economic losses hko 2022a in recent years compound floods from multiple flood drivers hazards have received more and more attention previous studies have discussed the compound flood potential in hong kong by analyzing the dependence between precipitation and storm surge which was limited to only one tide gauge fang et al 2021 another recent study simulated the inundation process of compound floods during typhoon mangkhut 2018 illustrating the effect of a proper drainage system in mitigating flood severity qiang et al 2021 even though there are more questions about the compound flood in hong kong needed to be answered for example what is the joint probability of compound floods and what is the contribution of tcs how do compound floods change during past decades how does the sea level rise affect compound floods and what is the impact of compound floods on society and the environment here we assess the compound flood hazards in hong kong by estimating the joint return periods the contribution of tcs to triggering compound floods is analyzed the temporal evolution of compound floods and the impact of sea level rise are evaluated based on long term observations especially the impact of compound floods on the socio economy is analyzed based on recorded damages including persons affected and economic losses caused by tc events in hong kong the data and methods used in this study are introduced in section 2 section 3 elaborated and discussed the results in section 4 the main findings of this study are summarized 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 daily precipitation and sea level data the daily higher high water level data recorded as meters above the chart datum of 6 tide gauges namely quarry bay qub tsim bei tsui tbt shek pik shp tai miu wan tmw tai po kau tpk and waglan island wag are collected from hko https www hko gov hk en cis climat htm the water level records from 1954 to 1985 at qub are based on the data of the tide gauge north point which was relocated to qub in 1986 the consistency of the data before and after 1986 at this tide gauge has been checked by ip and wai 1990 and ding et al 2001 moreover the annual mean sea levels at the 6 gauges are obtained from the hko to evaluate the impact of sea level rise on the evolution of compound floods the daily precipitation data of 53 stations in hong kong are collected the locations of the tide gauges and precipitation stations are shown in fig 1 each tide gauge is paired with the nearest precipitation station in case the record length of the nearest precipitation station cannot cover that of the tide gauge the second nearest precipitation station is used and so on the largest distance between the tide gauge and the paired precipitation station cannot exceed 10 km the years with a missing data rate larger than 25 are removed the tide gauge qub has the longest 60 overlapping years of precipitation and sea level records while the length of overlapping years ranges from 18 to 34 years in other tide gauges the overlapping years of precipitation and sea level data in each tide gauge are shown in fig 2 2 1 2 tc tracks and the maximum storm surge during tcs the tc tracks indicated by the longitude and latitude of tc centers provided by the international best track archive for climate stewardship ibtracs version 4 https www ncdc noaa gov ibtracs knapp et al 2010 are used in this study to analyze the impact of tcs on compound floods when a tc center is located within 500 km of a tide gauge the precipitation and sea levels of that day and 1 day are considered associated with that tc khouakhi et al 2017 lai et al 2020 2021b zhang et al 2018a 2018b the maximum storm surges caused by tcs from 1961 to 2019 are collected from hko to examine the impact of meteorological driven storm surge on extreme sea level compound floods https www hko gov hk en wservice tsheet pms stormsurgedb htm although the sea level data in 1964 is missing at qub fig 2 the highest sea levels of the 5 tc events in 1964 are available on the website storm surge records in hong kong during the passage of tropical cyclones provided by hko https www hko gov hk en wservice tsheet pms stormsurgedb htm t search v 1964 1964 given these 5 tc events were extreme and caused damage in hong kong the 5 tc events are included when analyzing the joint return periods of compound floods and socio economic damage induced by tc events 2 1 3 socio economic damage caused by tcs tc induced socio economic damage data including the persons dead missing and persons injured from 1961 to 2019 and economic losses in money from 1988 to 2019 is collected from tropical cyclone annual report published by hko http www hko gov hk en publica pubtc htm to investigate the socio economic impact of tc induced compound floods https www hko gov hk en informtc historical tc cdtc htm with the socio economic development in hong kong the population and property exposed to natural hazards have been increasing significantly in this study the economic losses are normalized by dividing the actual losses by the gross domestic product gdp of the year when the losses occurred neumayer and barthel 2011 sajjad and chan 2020 the gdp information is obtained from the census and statistics department of hong kong https www censtatd gov hk en the fatalities and persons injured caused by lightning stroke are excluded because they are less related to the floods the information including the record periods and data sources of all datasets used in this study are summarized in table 1 it has to be noted that this damage dataset only contains the damage caused by tc events and the damage unrelated to tcs is not included for example the damage caused by heavy rainstorms triggered by monsoons is not covered in this analysis besides the reported damages might not be caused by floods since tcs can cause different disasters such as floods landslides strong winds etc nevertheless this dataset is one acceptable option to approximately explore the socio economic impact of compound floods in hong kong because tcs are one of the most important triggers of compound floods in hong kong see results therefore tc induced damage can be used as a proxy for the damage caused by compound floods this study aims to provide a preliminary understanding of the impact of compound floods on the socio economy in hong kong 2 2 methods 2 2 1 identification of compound floods compound floods are defined as the co occurrences of extreme precipitation and extreme sea levels that exceed their 95th percentile values this definition of compound floods based on the peak over threshold method has been used in many previous studies for example bevacqua et al 2019 defined compound floods as the co occurrences of extreme precipitation and extreme storm surges exceeding their 99 7th percentile values and fang et al 2021 applied the same definition using the 98th percentile values as the threshold extreme precipitation and extreme sea levels are also sampled using the peak over threshold method separately in the analysis of the temporal changes of compound floods the impact of the selection of threshold on the results is evaluated by using the 85th 90th and 95th percentile values to define compound flood days fang et al 2021 gori et al 2022 lai et al 2021a extreme sea levels are used in this study because the flood prevention standards in hong kong are based on sea levels and the sea levels are better associated with the socio economic impacts and damages of coastal floods dsd 2022a 2022b 2 2 2 estimation of return periods of compound floods to estimate the joint return periods of compound floods compound events with precipitation and sea levels simultaneously exceeding the 95th percentile values are selected to establish the copula functions between precipitation and sea levels clusters of selected compound floods separated by 3 days are taken as one compound flood to ensure the independence between compound floods bevacqua et al 2019 the copula based joint return periods of compound floods are calculated following the method used by bevacqua et al 2019 and lai et al 2021b at each tide gauge we choose the best fit copula function from a pool including five types of copula functions i e normal t clayton gumbel and frank copula functions according to the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 the marginal cumulative distribution of precipitation and sea levels of selected compound floods are modeled using the generalized pareto distribution a widely used distribution for modeling the peaks over threshold bezak et al 2014 dsd 2018 the parameters of copula and marginal functions are estimated using the maximum likelihood estimator bevacqua et al 2020b xu et al 2018 goodness of fit is tested using the cramer von mises test genest et al 2009 the joint return period is calculated as salvadori and de michele 2004 1 t r r s s 1 p r r s s 1 1 f r r f s s f r s where f r r and f s s are the cumulative distribution functions of precipitation and sea levels respectively f r s is the copula function representing the dependence between precipitation and sea levels 2 2 3 examination of the temporal evolution of compound floods the changes in compound flood risks are interpreted by the trends of the annual number of compound flood days i e days when compound floods occur because the increase of compound flood days implies more frequent and or longer lasting compound flood events and vice versa similar indices based on the frequency of extremes are often used to reflect the changes in extreme events in previous studies e g fatichi and caporali 2009 lai et al 2021a li et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 when a high sea level event occurs the probability of compound floods increases as precipitation increases and when heavy precipitation happens the higher the sea levels the greater the occurrence probability of compound floods therefore the trends in precipitation on days with extreme sea levels and the trends in sea levels on days with extreme precipitation are also estimated to explore their relationship with changes in compound floods to explore the impact of mean sea level rise on the temporal trends in compound floods the component of mean sea level of the daily maximum sea level data is replaced by the long term mean sea level to remove the yearly changes in mean sea level rise pasquier et al 2019 for each year the sea level series excluding the mean sea level rise can be calculated as 2 sl sl msl 1 msl 2 where sl is the sea level series excluding the mean sea level rise sl is the original sea level data msl 1 is the mean sea level of that year and msl 2 is the long term mean sea level of all years a nonparametric trend detection method the modified mann kendall mk test is employed to detect the trends of the annual number of compound flood days precipitation on days with extreme sea levels and sea levels on days with extreme precipitation hamed and rao 1998 the advantage of the modified mk test is that it considers the autocorrelation of time series the magnitudes of trends are estimated using sen s slope method sen 1968 when examining the trends of socio economic damage caused by tcs we use both the modified mk test and the linear regression method ross 2017 to examine the trends 2 2 4 identification of the type of extreme events that caused damage tcs can cause different types of floods e g compound floods extreme precipitation without extreme sea levels or extreme sea levels without extreme precipitation at different stations however the casualties and total economic losses in hong kong are reported for each tcs i e there is no detailed information about where and when the damage occurred within the city to categorize casualties and economic losses into damage caused by different flood types we take the flood type at the majority of gauges during a tc event as the dominant flood type and assume that the damage was resulted from the dominant flood type if a tc caused two or more types of floods at the same number of gauges the flood type that occurred at the gauge with the longest record length is regarded as the dominant flood type caused by that tc then the damage caused by different types of floods is analyzed 3 results and discussion 3 1 joint probability and trigger of compound flood hazards in hong kong 3 1 1 heavy precipitation extreme sea level and their cooccurrence in hong kong and the contribution of tcs the cumulative probability of precipitation and sea levels at the 6 gauges are shown in fig 3 the panel is divided into 4 zones by the 95th percentile precipitation and sea level values compound floods in zone 1 extreme precipitation without extreme sea level in zone 2 extreme sea level without extreme precipitation in zone 3 and non extreme events in zone 4 to examine the relationships between different types of extreme events and tcs the fractional contributions of tc associated events to different types of floods are calculated and shown in the corresponding zones fig 3 shows that the most extreme precipitation events are found in zone 2 which contains extreme precipitation without extreme sea level for example the highest precipitation at qub is 411 3 mm day which is found in zone 2 i e the extreme precipitation event occurs without extreme sea level the most extreme precipitation in zone 1 i e concurrent extreme precipitation and extreme sea levels is 322 8 mm day which is lower than that in zone 2 by contrast the most extreme sea levels are more likely to be accompanied by extreme precipitation and thus are mostly found in the compound flood zone i e zone 1 for example the highest sea level in zone 1 is 3 96 m at qub which is much higher than the highest sea level 3 32 m in zone 3 i e the extreme sea level event occurs without extreme precipitation similar patterns can be found at other tide gauges when looking at the relationship between extreme events and tcs it can be found most compound floods were associated with tcs the fractional contributions of tcs to compound floods zone 1 at 5 out of the 6 gauges exceed 50 and those at qub tpk and wag reach 72 6 83 8 and 81 8 respectively the tc s contributions to the non compound extreme events in zone 2 and zone 3 are much lower ranging from 7 5 to 21 4 these results indicate that the extreme sea levels triggered by tcs are very likely to co occur with extreme precipitation and therefore lead to compound floods i e triangles in zone 1 however the most extreme precipitation does not tend to coincide with extreme sea levels because tcs are not the only weather system that causes extreme precipitation in hong kong located on the southeast coast of china hong kong is surrounded by the south china sea and is affected by the east asia summer monsoon chang et al 2012 li et al 2015 yu et al 2020 during the summer monsoon season the abundant warm moisture from the western north pacific and the hilly and mountainous terrain in hong kong provide favourable conditions for convectional and orographic extreme precipitation convectional precipitation characterized by short duration and high intensity is also common in hong kong and is likely to be intensified by rapid urbanization in hong kong li et al 2021 3 1 2 joint return periods of compound floods based on the extreme events in zone 1 the joint probability distributions of compound floods at the 6 gauges are estimated by employing the copula functions the joint return periods of compound floods are illustrated in fig 4 since the tide gauge qub has the longest record length the following analysis mainly focuses on the results at qub for brevity the most severe i e the longest return period compound flood in history with the longest joint return period i e 178 years was induced by typhoon wanda 1962 the maximum sea level caused by wanda reached 3 96 m with a univariate return period exceeding 200 years according to the estimates of dsd 2018 the highest daily precipitation during typhoon wanda is 203 mm day which exceeds the annual level the mean annual maximum daily precipitation is 190 mm day dsd 2018 the other over 1 in 100 year compound flood was caused by typhoon mangkhut in 2018 with a maximum daily precipitation of 167 5 mm and a maximum sea level of 3 88 m these two tcs caused enormous damage in hong kong see section 3 3 for details if precipitation and sea levels are assumed to be statistically independent the return periods of compound floods caused by wanda and mangkhut are 10 000 years i e reciprocal of the product of the probability of heavy precipitation and the probability of extreme sea level this demonstrates the necessity of considering the dependence on precipitation and sea levels otherwise the risks of compound flood hazards may be significantly underestimated the combinations of precipitation and sea levels that cause compound floods can be various as discussed above the sea levels of the compound floods caused by wanda and mangkhut are the most extreme among all compound floods comparatively the heavy precipitation caused by these two tcs i e 190 mm day for wanda and 167 5 mm day for mangkhut is not the most extreme since there are many other compound flood events with more intense precipitation for example the maximum daily precipitation caused by typhoon brenda 1989 is 323 mm day which is much higher than that caused by wanda and mangkhut however the joint return period of compound flood caused by brenda is 81 years due to the relatively lower sea levels i e 2 79 m moreover there are a total of 10 compound floods with a joint return period between 20 and 50 years in qub with their sea levels ranging from 2 6 m to 3 6 m and the precipitation between 44 mm and 250 mm this result demonstrates the considerable variations in the combination of precipitation and sea levels for compound floods with similar return levels extreme sea levels are jointly determined by tc triggered storm surges and the astronomical tide the most extreme sea levels are usually associated with the highest storm surge as shown by the color in fig 4 such as those of typhoon wanda 1962 hato 2017 and mangkhut 2018 at the same time astronomical tides also play an important role in extreme sea levels for example typhoon mangkhut triggered a maximum storm surge height of 2 35 m at qub which is much higher than the maximum storm surge of 1 18 m during typhoon hato however the occurrence of typhoon hato coincided with the high water of astronomical tide resulting in a maximum total sea level of 3 57 m which is comparable to the highest sea level of 3 88 m during typhoon mangkhut it shall be noted that the time when the maximum storm surge occurred might be different from the time when the maximum sea level occurred comparing the joint return period of compound floods in all six tide gauges we found that the joint return period of the compound flood event caused by typhoon mangkhut exceeds 50 years at tbt shp tmw and tpk differences also exist between different locations for example the maximum sea level caused by typhoon mangkhut is higher than that triggered by typhoon hato at qub tmw and tpk however the maximum sea level of hato exceeds that of mangkhut at tbt the joint return period of typhoon mangkhut is abnormally large at tpk i e 500 years as a matter of fact the highest sea level at tpk recorded by hko is 5 03 m during typhoon wanda in 1962 however this event is not included in this study because there is no corresponding precipitation data at tpk at that time in this case the return periods of compound floods caused by mangkhut at tpk may be overestimated the data after 2017 is not available at wag thus the data of the compound flood associated with mangkhut is not available for the probability distribution of this tide gauge the compound flood caused by hato at wag is not as severe as that at other locations such as qub tbt and tpk at wag the most extreme compound flood with a return period of 86 years was triggered by typhoon utor 2001 the differences in the results between different tide gauges are affected by many factors including the differences in record length the approaching way i e from west or east of tcs and topographic conditions such as the elevation water depth and the shape of the coastline for example the tcs sweeping hong kong from the west and south side may cause storm surges higher than from the east side due to the anti clockwise wind of tcs in the northern hemisphere and the geographic condition of hong kong hko 2022g and in general the storm surge in tpk would be higher than in other tide gauges due to the special bag shape bay lee and wong 2007 the annual mean precipitation amount is relatively higher over the mountain ranges in hong kong because of the orographic enhancement effect yeung et al 2011 3 2 temporal evolution of compound floods in hong kong the trends in the number of compound flood days with extreme precipitation and sea levels are calculated to examine the temporal evolution of compound floods in hong kong as shown in table 2 increasing trends in the number of compound flood days defined using the 85th and 90th percentile values can be found at all 6 gauges and most of them are significant at the 95 level α 0 05 the rates of increase in compound floods exceeding the 85th percentile values range from 1 2 to 4 69 days decade and 0 37 2 86 days decade for those exceeding the 90th percentile when a higher threshold of the 95th percentile is used significant upward trends are found at tbt and tmw meanwhile the sample size of compound flood days reduces when a higher threshold is used leading to a less robust trend analysis the changes in precipitation under extreme sea levels and sea levels under extreme precipitation are also examined since they reflect the probability and intensity of compound floods precipitation under extreme sea levels i e precipitation in days with sea levels exceeding the 85th 90th or 95th percentiles shows insignificant trends in most of the gauges during past decades table 2 at qub the precipitation under extreme sea levels defined by the 90th percentile increased significantly by 0 78 mm decade while that defined by the 95th percentile decreased significantly by 1 43 mm decade by contrast increases in sea level under extreme precipitation i e sea levels in days with precipitation exceeding the 85th 90th or 95th percentiles are detected in all gauges the increasing trends are significant at qub tbt tpk and wag with rates of 18 7 65 2 37 8 and 78 9 mm decade respectively the comparison of the trends in compound flood days precipitation and sea levels suggests that the increase in compound flood days is very likely caused by elevated sea levels tables 2 and 3 show that the rates of increasing sea levels under extreme precipitation are close to the rates of annual mean sea level rise for example the annual mean sea levels at qub have risen by 23 9 mm per decade while the rising rates of the sea levels under extreme precipitation exceeding the 85th 90th and 95th percentile at qub are 18 0 18 7 and 18 3 mm decade respectively therefore mean sea level rise is an important cause of the increase in sea level under extreme precipitation and the number of compound flood days to further examine the impact of sea level rise on the changes in compound floods we replace the annual mean sea level component of sea level data with the long term mean sea level and hence carry out trend analysis on the detrended sea level see methods after excluding the impact of mean sea level rise the trends in sea levels under extreme precipitation become insignificant or even decreasing table 4 for example the significant increasing trends in the sea levels under extreme precipitation at qub tpk and wag shift to decreasing trends after removing the effect of mean sea level rise at the same time the significant increasing trends in the number of compound flood days become insignificant and the change rates also decrease and even turn to 0 3 3 damages associated with tcs the damage information including the economic losses in money and persons dead missing caused by tc associated hazards is collected from hko http www hko gov hk en publica pubtc htm to explore the social and economic impact of the compound floods in hong kong a total of 181 tcs were reported to have caused damages in hong kong during 1961 2019 and economic losses in money have been reported since 1988 our results show that the annual absolute number of tcs reported damage and its ratio to the total number of tcs affecting hong kong significantly increased by 0 021 and 0 006 per year during 1961 2019 respectively fig 5 the year 1988 is found to be the change point of the rate of tcs reported damage which shifted from 0 37 before 1988 0 56 after 1988 besides between 1988 and 2019 the absolute number and the ratio of tcs reported damages do not show any significant trend these results indicate that fewer tcs were reported to cause damage before 1988 and the higher and relatively stable ratio after 1988 adds more confidence to the reliability of the damage information after 1988 the time series of damage caused by tcs that associated with different types of extreme events are shown in figs 6 and 7 the statistical trends of socio economic damage are shown in table 5 the economic losses in money caused by all tcs tend to increase during 1988 2019 even though the monotonic increasing trends based on modified mk test are not statistically significant the linear upward trends are significant at the 90 level table 5 significant linear increasing trend is also detected in the economic losses in money caused by tcs associated with compound floods by contrast there is no trend detected in economic losses caused by tcs induced extreme precipitation or extreme sea levels typhoon mangkhut 2018 which triggered severe compound floods caused the highest economic loss of 910 million hkd hko 2022a typhoon dot 1993 and typhoon sam 1999 triggered the two most costly tc associated extreme precipitation with actual economic losses of 128 2 and 131 5 million hkd respectively the time series of normalized and actual economic losses show similar results but the normalization magnified the economic losses in the earlier years because of the corresponding lower gdp sajjad and chan 2020 in total the economic losses caused by tcs associated with compound floods extreme precipitation only and extreme sea levels only contribute to 54 7 39 4 and 4 3 of the total amount of economic losses respectively calculated based on the normalized economic losses when it comes to the persons dead missing the significant decreasing trends in the persons dead missing caused by tcs associated with compound floods during 1961 2019 can be detected by both the modified mk test and linear regression method fig 7a and table 5 a significant linear decreasing trend was also detected in the number of persons dead missing caused by all tcs the annual number of persons dead missing is 40 since 1972 and 10 after 1983 typhoon wanda in 1962 triggered the most severe compound flood and resulted in the most persons dead missing i e 130 fatalities and 53 persons missing fig 7a overall tcs associated with compound floods extreme precipitation only and extreme sea level only are responsible for 61 8 31 5 and 4 4 of the total fatalities and missing persons respectively as shown in fig 7b the year 1999 has the largest number of persons injured mainly due to typhoon york 500 persons and typhoon sam 328 persons and these two typhoons caused extreme precipitation only typhoon mangkhut 2018 resulted in 458 persons injured which is only second to typhoon york in 1999 typhoon ellen in 1983 caused 333 persons injured the sea level data at qub during this event is missing while in gauges that have sea level records the corresponding precipitation data is not available even though as reported in the tropical cyclone annual report published by hko the highest tide recorded at tbt and tpk are 3 62 and 3 06 m both exceeding their 95th percentile values the recorded highest daily precipitation at hko precipitation stations paired with qub is 172 4 mm which also reached the extreme precipitation level therefore typhoon ellen 1983 is classified as a compound flood event in this study in this case the fractional contribution of tcs associated with compound floods to persons injured in hong kong is 52 1 which is higher than the other two types of extremes i e 35 5 for tcs associated with extreme precipitation and 10 4 for tcs associated with extreme sea levels more than half of the economic losses and people affected dead missing and injured were caused by tcs related to compound floods and the most costly and deadliest disasters were also associated with tcs that triggered compound floods this result is consistent with fang et al 2021 who also found that tc events with high compound flood potential caused most of the economic damage and casualties in hong kong the difference between fang et al 2021 and this study is that fang et al 2021 evaluated the contribution of compound floods on the tc induced socio economic damage while this study focuses on the changes in compound floods associated socio economic consequences during the past decades with different focuses both studies are significant in improving our understanding on the extent and trends of compound flood associated hazards in a city scale which are important scientific references for enhancing flood risk mitigation reduction strategies one important caveat is that since the reported socio economic damage caused by tc events in hong kong does not contain information such as when and where the damage occurred or what kind of disasters caused the damage it is difficult to exactly quantify the contributions of compound floods on socio economic damage even though this analysis illustrated the increasing threats of tcs associated with compound floods to society and the economy based on the records of historical events the increasing economic losses caused by tcs associated with compound floods in hong kong implies that holistic flood risk management is needed to improve a city s flood resistance and resilience under climate change and socio economic development the traditional flood management designed for a single flood hazard should evolve toward a more comprehensive and holistic flood risk management frame that considers the connections between multiple flood factors e g precipitation and sea levels multiple hazards e g floods strong winds and landslides during typhoons and the various ways the damage occurs raymond et al 2020 zscheischler et al 2018 for example the design of flood protection should fully consider the different occurrence probabilities of various combinations of extreme precipitation and sea levels given that the most extreme sea levels are often accompanied by extreme precipitation it is necessary to consider how the accompanying extreme precipitation may affect the designed scheme when designing flood protection against extreme sea levels e g seawall embankment etc besides the increasing compound flood hazards due to sea level rise indicate that the design of flood protection relying on historical records should further consider the impact of climate change and update design criteria such as intensity duration frequency curve with consideration of sea level rise zhao et al 2022 the socio economic impacts of disasters like typhoon mangkhut and typhoon hato tell us that only flood prevention infrastructures are not enough to cope with the flood risks because extreme events become more intense and population and economy grow rapidly therefore in addition to engineering measures more non structural measures are recommended to reduce the socio economic losses caused by floods such as improving early warning systems and strengthening public awareness and capacity for flood risk prevention and mitigation chan et al 2018 4 conclusions in this study compound floods from extreme precipitation and extreme sea levels in hong kong are analyzed in terms of the joint probability the temporal evolutions over past decades the contribution of tcs and the socio economic consequences our main findings can be concluded as follows 1 the analysis of the joint occurrences of precipitation and sea levels indicates that tcs are the major trigger of compound floods in hong kong the most extreme sea levels tend to be accompanied by heavy precipitation while the most extreme precipitation is less likely to coincide with extreme sea levels that is because the most extreme sea levels were associated with tcs and tcs usually bring about precipitation but the most extreme precipitation events were triggered by other weather systems rather than tcs most compound floods were associated with tcs in hong kong the percentage of tc induced compound floods defined using the 95th percentiles ranges from 48 8 to 83 8 in the tide gauges 2 with the consideration of the statistical dependence between precipitation and sea levels we identified that the most severe compound flood was triggered by typhoon wanda 1962 with a joint return period of 178 years which is much shorter compared to the return period 10 000 years estimated without taking into account of the interdependence of the extremes the return periods of compound floods are jointly determined by the return levels of precipitation and sea levels for instance even though the maximum daily precipitation caused by typhoon brenda 1989 is much higher than that caused by typhoon wanda the joint return period of compound floods caused by brenda is shorter due to its relatively lower sea level 3 the analysis of the temporal evolution shows that the number of compound flood days has increased significantly during past decades which is primarily attributed to sea level rise after the component of sea level rise is removed the increasing trends in compound flood days become insignificant for example the numbers of compound flood days at qub and tpk increased significantly by 0 37 and 1 11 days per year respectively table 2 however after the trend in mean sea levels is removed i e 23 9 mm year at qub and 42 9 mm year at tpk the change rates of the number of compound flood days turn to 0 at both tide gauges 4 based on the historical record of socio economic damage caused by tc events in hong kong we found that the socio economic losses caused by tcs associated with compound floods are higher than that caused by extreme precipitation or extreme sea level only for example tcs associated with compound floods are responsible for 54 7 of the total amount of tc induced economic losses 61 8 of the total number of persons dead missing and 52 1 of the total number of persons injured caused by tcs our analysis of the temporal changes shows that the economic losses caused by tcs associated with compound floods tend to increase during 1988 2019 while the economic losses caused by tcs that induced extreme precipitation and extreme sea levels show no trend we also found that the annual number of persons dead missing caused by tcs associated with compound floods has been reduced significantly during 1961 2019 in this study we analyzed the socio economic impacts of compound floods based on historical records nevertheless the socio economic data we collected contains only tc induced damage in hong kong and thus our analysis is limited to those tc induced compound floods besides considering the data availability and the important socio economic status this study focuses on hong kong as a case study in the future it is of great importance to conduct more studies based on socio economic data derived from multiple sources such as data from social media and in other coastal cities across the world even so the findings presented in this study can help to better understand the potential risk and socio economic impact of compound floods in hong kong and serve as a scientific reference for the flood management design the methods used in this study can also be applied in other coastal areas to explore compound flood risks in different areas credit

control in regions with seasonal river flow the high andean lake sibinacocha has been regulated since 1988 to increase energy production of the machupicchu hydropower plant in this study river streamflow changes are evaluated by analyzing precipitation and discharge trends using indicators of hydrologic alteration and ecoflow for natural 1965 1987 and altered 1988 2016 flow regimes new hydrological insights for the region for the altered flow regime an ecodeficit of about 20 compared to natural river flow and an ecosurplus 30 were found during the wet season december february and dry season june august respectively these changes have reduced the risk of water shortage dry season and flood wet season and contribute to increasing water use including hydropower production irrigation and drinking water however river alteration might lead to considerable impacts on riverine ecosystems despite major limitations related to data scarcity and complex environmental processes in the basin our results highlight the usefulness of combined methods of hydrological alteration and ecoflow to effectively evaluate water regime changes in regulated basins an integrated scientific

alteration combining iha and ecoflow methods to identify changes in the flow regime under hydropower regulation in this study we address this gap by analyzing precipitation and discharge trends using indicators of hydrologic alteration and ecoflow for natural 1965 1987 and altered 1988 2016 flow regime series in the vilcanota urubamba river basin southern peru to understand the drivers of hydrological change and provide useful information for future water resource planning 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the tropical andes are home to more than 99 of all tropical glaciers in the world of which around 70 are located in peru condom et al 2012 rabatel et al 2013 yarleque et al 2018 these glaciers have been subject of several studies to understand the possible consequences of glacier retreat on current and future water availability drenkhan et al 2019 kronenberg et al 2016 mark et al 2017 sagredo and lowell 2012 the vilcanota mountain range is the second largest glacierized mountain range in peru with an approximate glacier surface of about 255 km2 in 2016 which has decreased by 48 since 1962 inaigem 2018 glaciers in the upper vilcanota feed the vilcanota urubamba river basin fig 1a where glacier area has been reduced by 37 from 226 km2 in 1988 142 km2 in 2016 consequently glacier lakes have increased in area and number by about 16 and 18 respectively from 23 km2 460 lakes in 1988 27 km2 544 lakes in 2016 drenkhan et al 2018 the lake sibinacocha dammed since 1988 fig 1b drains into the vilcanota urubamba river basin together with the langui layo

season in austral winter april to october due to strong westerlies drenkhan et al 2018 at interannual timescale enso represents an important driver of rainfall variability with dry conditions during warm phase el niño events and an opposite behavior during the cold phase la niña events rau et al 2017 rosas et al 2016 however the enso phenomenon and its feedback are not clearly understood and superimpose with other climatic features such as the pacific decadal oscillation pdo vuille et al 2008 in the study area average annual precipitation accounts for of 749 mm 1985 2015 with about 80 of total rainfall occurring between the months of october to march which leads to a highly variable hydrological regime fernandez palomino et al 2021 hydraulic and dam infrastructure has been established in the study basin fig 2 i the machupicchu i hydropower plant fig 1c was built in two stages with a total installed capacity of 107 2 mw ii the sibinacocha dam was constructed located at 147 km southeast of the cusco city and at an elevation of 4680 m asl in 1988 formally inaugurated in june 1996 by the energy generation company machupicchu s a egemsa to guarantee the operation of the hydropower plant with a volume of 120 million m3 iii the reconstruction of the machupicchu ii hydropower plant built in two phases with a total installed power of 192 45 mw the debris flow in 1998 damaged the former hydropower plant iv further downstream the santa teresa hydropower plant luz del sur started operation in 2015 with an installed capacity of 98 mw 2 2 data the flow and precipitation datasets period 1965 2016 used in this study belong to the national hydrology and meteorology service of peru senamhi the flow dataset corresponds to daily observations of the hydrometric station km 105 which collects continuous data series in the lower vilcanota urubamba river since 1964 fig 1a for lake sibinacocha daily outflow series are available from 1965 to 2020 provided by the committee for economic operation of the peruvian interconnected energy coes for its acronym in spanish the precipitation dataset for this study was obtained from monthly records of 19 rainfall stations of which 12 stations are located in the study area and another seven stations in adjacent basins fig 1a and table 1 for the hydrological analysis the flow and precipitation information was arranged considering the hydrological year from september year i to august year i 1 which matches with the beginning of the wet season 2 3 data processing the flow and precipitation datasets were submitted to an exploratory data analysis eda to summarize main data characteristics and to detect outliers using univariate graphical techniques histograms and boxplot in addition all precipitation information was quality checked using a regional vector method rvm brunet moret 1979 we selected the stations located in the study area the quality of the stations was evaluated based on their correlation coefficient r² 0 5 and missing data were filled to build the rvm a minimum of three values per year station and a minimum of three years in a station were required the rvm assumes that annual rainfall in the same climate zone is pseudo proportional with a small random variation each year due to the rainfall distribution within the area villar et al 2009 the rvm with the available data create a virtual station vector that is representative for the entire study area under the concept of extended precipitation average rau et al 2017 it uses the minimum squares method to find the yearly regional pluviometric indices z i and extended precipitation average pi through the following formula rau et al 2017 i 1 n j 1 m pij pi z i where i is the year index j is the station index n is the number of years and m is the number of stations pij is the annual precipitation for station j in the year i pi is the mean precipitation extended to the period of n years and z i is the regional pluviometric index for the year i additionally all monthly precipitation data was interpolated using an inverse distance weighting idw approach to estimate the mean areal precipitation of the vilcanota urubamba basin river subsequently the generated series were accumulated and precipitation anomalies were calculated using the difference of annual precipitation and the multiannual average of mean precipitation for each period 2 4 statistical analysis the statistical analysis included table 2 the use of parametric tests i e a linear regression montgomery et al 2012 and spearman rho and non parametric tests i e man kendall mann 1945 kendall 1955 and the distribution free cumulative sum mcgilchrist and woodyer 1975 these tests were applied to determine the possible existence of statistically significant trends and the change point in the flow and precipitation dataset with significance confidence levels at 90 95 and 99 for the seasonal analysis the data is organized in four quarters i e september november son december february djf march may mam and june august jja to average flow and a cumulative volume for precipitation are calculated for the annual analysis the totalized precipitation and the average flow were estimated using the hydrological year additionally we considered the maximum ammax and minimum ammin average monthly flow 2 5 hydrologic alteration one of the most robust approaches to determine hydrologic alteration is the specific comparison of pre impact natural and post impact altered flow data mcmanamay et al 2012 the natural period was defined based on the water resources management projects implemented in the study area fig 2 considering 1965 1987 as a natural period and 1988 2016 as the altered period therefore the ecoflow method and the iha indicators were used to characterize and quantify the hydrological change of the flow regime in the vilcanota urubamba river basin 2 5 1 ecoflow in this study we used the ecoflow method based on non dimensional measurements of ecodeficit i e the amount of water that is needed but unavailable for ecological flow and ecosurplus i e the amount of water that exceeds the ecosystem requirement which are constructed using flow duration curves fdcs gao et al 2012 2018 the fdcs were estimated based on the daily flow record of vrb and provide a measure of the percentage of time duration during which a specific flow equals or exceeds a value the qi flow is graphed with the corresponding excess probability pi calculated by the following formula p i i n 1 where i is the rank position corresponding to each flow after being arranged in descending order and n is the total number of days therefore annual and seasonal fdcs fig 3 of each year were estimated to analyze changes in the flow regime the fdcs for the natural period 1965 1987 were used to obtain the 25th and 75th percentile fdcs for the annual ecoflow ecosurplus is defined as the area between the 75th percentile fdc and the annual fdc which occurs when the fdc of a given year is above the 75th percentile fdc conversely when the fdc is below the 25th percentile fdc the area between the 25th percentile fdc and the annual fdc is defined as the ecodeficit for the seasonal ecoflow we proceeded similarly to the annual ecoflow assessment with the difference that the accumulated values of quarterly periods were considered all ecodeficit and ecosurplus values were divided by the annual average or seasonal flow to make them non dimensional the ecosurplus represents the amount of water in excess gain and the ecodeficit corresponds to the amount of water that is not available loss due to the alteration of the flow regime 2 5 2 indicators of hydrologic alteration the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha were formulated by richter et al 1996 to compare the inter and intraannual variation of the flow regime they include 33 parameters table 3 lumped into five groups i magnitude of monthly hydrological conditions ii magnitude and duration of annual hydrological extreme conditions iii date of annual extreme hydrological conditions iv frequency and duration of high and low pulses and v rate and frequency of changes in hydrological conditions we used the software iha tnc 2009 to compare the hydrological series before natural period and after altered period the construction of the reservoir all parameters were included in the analysis except for the days with zero flow conditions that did not occur in the study period we adopted a presumptive standard with a moderate level of ecological protection flow changes ranging from 10 to 20 established by richter et al 2011 finally in order to assess the changes in the flows during the natural and altered period with respect to the total flows the anomalies were determined at monthly scale expressed as anomaly evaluation period referenc e period where is the anomaly expressed in m3 s evaluation period is the natural and altered flow in m3 s and the reference period is the average flow of the entire series in m3 s 3 results 3 1 data analysis the flow boxplot at seasonal level shows a symmetric distribution fig 4a with some atypical values e g 1100 m3 s fig 4b these values represent the extreme hydrological events that occurred in january 2010 due to various consecutive days of precipitation lavado et al 2010 based on this technical support all the historical flow data were considered daily discharge in the study area is highly variable with a minimum of 20 m3 s in the dry season and up to 1100 m3 s in the wet season 1985 2016 period km 105 station shows an unimodal seasonal flow regime fig 4a with high flow during december april and low flow in the remaining months fig 5 shows the amplitude range of annual and seasonal precipitation per year the annual precipitation ranges from 466 mm to 934 mm during mam precipitation varies from 73 mm to 257 mm in son precipitation ranges from 53 to 215 mm jja djf shows the lowest highest values of precipitation between 1 and 60 mm 208 542 mm 3 2 statistical analysis annual and djf precipitation series show significant positive trends at 95 and 99 confidence level for all applied tests table 4 analyzed flow changes show an increasing trend of maximum and minimum flows of the vilcanota urubamba river basin table 5 this trend was also detected during son at 90 mann kendall and at 95 spearman rho confidence level and during jja at 99 confidence level for all statistical tests clear changes in the mean for the ammin ammax son and jja flows were detected in the hydrological years 1997 98 99 1998 99 90 1978 79 90 and 1988 89 99 respectively 3 3 hydrologic alteration 3 3 1 ecoflow at the interannual scale ecoflow analysis revealed fig 6 a temporal variation in low annual flows ecodeficits that matches with negative anomalies of average annual precipitation in most years and it is opposite in other years however in some years large ecodeficits are not justified by minor negative precipitation anomalies the high annual flows ecosurplus show a relatively different behavior not strictly associated with positive precipitation anomalies this behavior could particularly be observed between 1999 and 2000 and in a lower degree some years after 2003 2005 2008 2009 and 2012 for the natural period 1981 1986 high annual flows ecosurplus were observed which did not match the precipitation anomalies for the same period this mismatch could suggest an error during the data flow collection nonetheless all flow data recorded during 1981 1986 was considered for the analysis since information with a record length of at least twenty years is required for evaluation of both the natural and altered period moreover km 105 was the only hydrometric station that provided flow data in the study area before the construction of the sibinacocha dam at the seasonal scale fig 7a and b show the changes in the ecoflow for djf and mam ecodeficits occurred in most years with variable magnitudes related to negative precipitation anomalies and more ecodeficits during the altered period were observed particularly in mam ecosurplus values were smaller in magnitude without notable variation between the compared periods natural and altered flow following positive precipitation anomalies in jja and son fig 7c and d a lower number of ecodeficit occurred during the altered period than in the natural period while the predominance of ecosurplus is observed since 1988 altered period which is not related to the values of precipitation anomalies overall in the altered period the low flows ecodeficits are most likely associated with negative rainfall anomalies in djf and mam while high flows ecosurplus which occurred during jja and son are likely related to the operation of the sibinacocha dam 3 3 2 indicators of hydrologic alteration at the interannual scale an average increase of 5 3 m3 s from june to november and an average reduction of 35 2 m3 s from january to february were observed for the altered period 1988 2016 compared to the natural period 1965 1987 table 6 shows the percentage of change of the 32 iha parameters for monthly flow group 1 a positive change between 12 and 27 was observed from july to november this trend matches with the ecosurplus presented in fig 7c and d which cannot be explained by precipitation regime fig 8 for december a flow increase 7 can be observed while ecodeficit with considerable flow reduction can be found for january 18 4 and february 7 4 fig 7a between march and may the change ratios were positive and in the range of 2 1 to 7 1 for the extreme flows condition group 2 there was an increase in the percentage number of days of minimum flow with an absolute variation higher than 10 the timing of annual extreme flow conditions group 3 showed a variation in the date of maximum and minimum flows occurrence during the altered period in the frequency and duration of high and low pulses group 4 a reduction in extreme low flow events was observed in terms of duration and frequency for the altered period while extreme high flow events increased their frequency but reduced their duration the rate and frequency of flow changes group 5 decreased due to lower increase in flows during the high flow events finally the sibinacocha outflow series were used to validate the influence of the dam on river discharge at km 105 fig 9a before the lake was dammed in 1988 high lake outflows occurred during january march peak outflow 6 0 m3 s in january and low outflows during july september minimum outflow 0 8 m3 s in september conversely this behavior reversed after 2002 with high lake outflows during july november peak outflow 6 27 m3 s in september and low outflows during december june minimum outflow 0 37 m³ s in march following river flow regulation to meet the demand for the machupicchu and santa teresa hydropower plants in addition monthly flow anomalies at km 105 were computed for the entire period 1965 2016 based on parameter group 1 of table 6 the anomalies for the period before the construction of the dam 1965 1987 were positive during january april peak anomaly 7 1 m3 s in january and negative from may to october minimum anomaly 4 9 m3 s in august this flow pattern clearly changed for the altered period 1988 2016 with positive anomalies prevailing from may to september and december peak anomaly 4 2 m3 s in august and negative anomalies from january to april minimum anomaly 6 0 m3 s in january these patterns are consistent with observed outflows at sibinacocha dam fig 9a 4 discussion this study analyzes the hydrological impact of dam regulation on hydropower production in a high mountain basin in southern peru based on instrumental precipitation records period 1965 2016 our data suggest that annual and wet season djf precipitation has increased since 1998 99 table 4 these findings stand in contrast to the results of salzmann et al 2013 who observed a decreasing precipitation trend for the vilcanota region during the period 1965 2009 however the comparability between both studies is limited due to the different number of stations considered a total of 19 stations in this research compared to only one station in the other study furthermore the analyzed precipitation trends in the andes often lack strong significance cf salzmann et al 2014 and do not show clear unique patterns arias et al 2021 rabatel et al 2013 vuille et al 2003 due to large spatial variability and limited process understanding results need therefore to be carefully revised we also observed strong negative precipitation anomalies for the hydrological years 1980 1983 and 1987 and high positive anomalies during 2001 2003 several of which match with pronounced enso events fig 6 the influence of enso on precipitation patterns in the vilcanota mountain range was previously analyzed by perry et al 2014 using in situ stations and satellite information they concluded that precipitation would likely decrease during la niña events and increase during el niño events which represent a distinct pattern compared to other andean regions such as the cordillera blanca further north vuille et al 2008 this particular pattern in the vilcanota region could be associated to the influence of coupled climatic oceanic processes including changes in the tropical atlantic sea surface temperature lavado casimiro et al 2013 rau et al 2017 our results follow this pattern indicating an increase in the flow during the hydrological year 1997 1998 that matches with a strong el niño event table 5 shows the flow trend and change point in the study area for 1965 2016 the observed change point for the ammax in the hydrological year 1998 99 is related to a positive precipitation trend at 90 confidence found during djf table 4 changes in mean flow in the hydrological year 1978 79 90 confidence during son are attributed to precipitation variability this mean change was also displayed in 5 year moving average curves of son flow and precipitation result not shown in the paper which exhibited strong negative anomalies during 1968 1978 in both variables our findings suggest that dam operation was the main factor that controlled the hydrological flow regime variability in the vilcanota urubamba river basin as from 1988 to 89 when dam operation had started we found a significant increasing trend of dry season jja flow despite of distinct precipitation patterns fig 8 in line with drenkhan et al 2015 who reported positive non significant discharge anomalies for the period 1958 2013 considerable flow increase during the dry season is associated with increasing water release to meet drinking irrigation and hydroelectric water demand additionally the average precipitation during the altered period fig 9b reveal an increase by more than 10 mm between december and february that might influence the baseflow fernandez palomino et al 2021 found important baseflow contribution to the water yield which confirms the role of baseflow and the contribution of groundwater on the modulation of the flow regime during the dry season for this study the relatively short precipitation records including inconsistent or missing data that represent a limitation to fully understand precipitation trends and related impacts on river flow in this region similarly we found inconsistency in flow data annual high flow anomaly ecosurplus observed between 1981 and 1986 natural period most likely corresponds to inhomogeneities related to flow data collection or calibration errors nonetheless we decided to use the entire dataset as km 105 represents the only gauge in the study area with a minimum series of 20 years of daily flow data which is a necessary benchmark to evaluate significant alteration in the hydrological regime these data limitations reveal a clear need for a well established and strategically distributed network of in situ stations that increases our understanding of the flow regime and its potential changes in view of the combined impacts from climate change and human interventions such an effort is necessary for urgently needed robust development of future scenarios of water resource changes in the vilcanota urubamba river basin to support local decision making and climate change adaptation new data collection strategies are required that use alternative often more flexible and cost effective approaches such as low cost sensor technology participatory monitoring and frameworks that deal with high uncertainties drenkhan et al 2022 muñoz et al 2021 our results of hydrological alteration induced by dams are in line compared to other studies in the andes region vega jácome et al 2018 and beyond li et al 2020 pfeiffer and ionita 2017 yin et al 2020 low and high flows were altered group 2 since 1 day 3 day 7 day and 30 day minimum flows increased by more than 20 similar to this 1 day 3 day 7 day weekly monthly and 3 monthly maximum flow statistics increased by up to 7 this low flow increase is related to the increase in monthly mean flows group 1 during the dry season jja we also observed a reduction in the low flow pulses group 4 for both counts and duration during the post dam period possibly associated with the release of water during the dry season our results highlight that the major changes in the flow regimen of the vilcanota urubamba river basin were rather related to the increase of flows during the dry season jja than to precipitation changes as shown in fig 7c table 6 group 1 and fig 8 these results show a divergence between precipitation and flows in the vilcanota urubamba river basin due to the regulation of the basin associated with the operation of the dam 1988 in this study we have not assessed the associated ecological impacts downstream due to dam operation and hydrological alteration richter et al 2011 affirm that if is not possible to establish a relationship between hydrological alterations and possible ecological impacts instead it is possible to adopt a presumptive standard ranging from 10 to 20 moderate level of ecological protection of hydrologic alteration beyond which there may be relevant impacts on ecological functions based on this criterion the hydrological changes identified in the vilcanota urubamba river basin may generate ecological impact more studies need to confirm this hypothesis however only a limited body of studies includes impacts of hydrological changes on biological communities e g ochoa tocachi et al 2016 and none of them cover our study area future studies require to integrated biota response and river ecosystems to these alterations including their relationship with e g the morphology nutrient cycling sediment transport groundwater the risk of climate change and flow variability a better grasp of such responses and processes combined with robust approaches to address uncertainties would allow for developing more meaningful future water availability scenarios to improve water and energy security in the peruvian andes understanding the hydrologic alteration of streamflow is therefore important to design appropriate strategies for improved water resources management and ecosystem conservation an integrated evidence based scientific approach is necessary that tackles with social environmental risks concerning environmental degradation climate change and socio economic development drenkhan et al 2022 associated with the construction and management of dams such an approach must support decision making to promote infrastructure projects that have minimal impacts on natural ecosystems while maximizing future options for sustainable water and energy use 5 conclusions this study evaluated for the first time a combined assessment of streamflow alteration as a consequence of hydropower regulation in the vilcanota urubamba river basin southern peru our multi decadal 1965 2016 analysis of interannual flow variability ecoflow method highlights that at seasonal timescale an ecodeficit of about 20 compared to average natural river flow occurred during the wet season djf as a result of water storage regulation of lake sibinacocha during the altered period 1988 2016 meanwhile an ecosurplus of 30 compared to average natural river flow predominated during the dry season jja as a result of additional lake water outflow for hydropower production in absence of rainfall in the altered period our analysis confirms that the operation of lake sibinacocha was the main factor of hydrological flow regime alteration in the vilcanota urubamba river basin during the dry season jja these findings provide useful insights for local and regional water resource planning and adaptation given combined and increasingly adverse impacts from climate land use and land cover changes however there an evident lack of data collection and limited knowledge hampers a detailed process understanding to conduct systematic research on hydrological alteration in the peruvian andes these limitations are further exacerbated by challenges of complex hydrometeorological processes linked to high spatial and temporal gradients and variability our approach compares the performance of two methods indicators of hydrologic alteration and ecoflow and shows that both are complementary and effective in evaluating the water regime in a regulated high andean basin therefore this methodology provides a reference for assessing hydrological alteration in peru and beyond with similar basin conditions this framework may be used as a case to develop a standard procedure of ecological flow regime estimation applied to other

7706,study region vilcanota urubamba river basin southern peru study focus hydraulic infrastructure plays a fundamental role for energy production drinking and irrigation water storage and flood control in regions with seasonal river flow the high andean lake sibinacocha has been regulated since 1988 to increase energy production of the machupicchu hydropower plant in this study river streamflow changes are evaluated by analyzing precipitation and discharge trends using indicators of hydrologic alteration and ecoflow for natural 1965 1987 and altered 1988 2016 flow regimes new hydrological insights for the region for the altered flow regime an ecodeficit of about 20 compared to natural river flow and an ecosurplus 30 were found during the wet season december february and dry season june august respectively these changes have reduced the risk of water shortage dry season and flood wet season and contribute to increasing water use including hydropower production irrigation and drinking water however river alteration might lead to considerable impacts on riverine ecosystems despite major limitations related to data scarcity and complex environmental processes in the basin our results highlight the usefulness of combined methods of hydrological alteration and ecoflow to effectively evaluate water regime changes in regulated basins an integrated scientific approach is necessary to address uncertainties and develop meaningful future water availability scenarios that guide hydropower projects with improved water and energy security considering minimal

and wallace 2001 hydraulic infrastructure is designed to provide services such as drinking water provision reduction of flood risks and hydropower production among others rakhmatullaev et al 2010 nevertheless the presence of dams and reservoirs alters natural flow variability and biogeochemical processes mainly through changes in the ecological parameters of the hydrological regime black et al 2005 gao et al 2018 christer et al 2005 timpe and kaplan 2017 zhang et al 2015 hydraulic infrastructure can also lead to substantial social conflicts often associated with unequal power relations and control over water resources due to poor water governance boelens et al 2019 carey et al 2012 therefore it is crucial to understand how hydraulic interventions change natural hydrological regimes passaia et al 2020 to anticipate undesired effects and reduce adverse impacts from climate change moran et al 2018 consequently strategic planning taking into account key drivers and potential changes of the hydrological regime is paramount to operate hydraulic infrastructure jiang et al 2019 such an endeavor can then support adaptive measures for sustainable hydropower management moran et al 2018

ecoflow in the pangor basin ecuador changes in streamflow in the last decades 1963 2009 have been mostly linked to anthropogenic disturbances rather than direct climatic impacts due to substantial land cover changes molina et al 2015 for the peruvian andes only a few studies address hydrological alteration castello and macedo 2016 ochoa tocachi et al 2016 vega jácome et al 2018 nevertheless not all basins indicate major changes in streamflow due to land cover changes as the vilcanota urubamba river basin highlights here less than 3 1988 2001 and 6 2001 2014 can be attributed to land cover changes with projections that suggest minor land cover changes below 1 for the next fifteen years 2030 aybar 2016 to our knowledge no studies exist for the central andes that examine hydrological alteration combining iha and ecoflow methods to identify changes in the flow regime under hydropower regulation in this study we address this gap by analyzing precipitation and discharge trends using indicators of hydrologic alteration and ecoflow for natural 1965 1987 and altered 1988 2016 flow regime series in the vilcanota urubamba river basin southern peru to understand the drivers of hydrological change and provide useful information for future water resource planning 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the tropical andes are home to more than 99 of all tropical glaciers in the world of which around 70 are located in peru condom et al 2012 rabatel et al 2013 yarleque et al 2018 these glaciers have been subject of several studies to understand the possible consequences of glacier retreat on current and future water availability drenkhan et al 2019 kronenberg et al 2016 mark et al 2017 sagredo and lowell 2012 the vilcanota mountain range is the second largest glacierized mountain range in peru with an approximate glacier surface of about 255 km2 in 2016 which has decreased by 48 since 1962 inaigem 2018 glaciers in the upper vilcanota feed the vilcanota urubamba river basin fig 1a where glacier area has been reduced by 37 from 226 km2 in 1988 142 km2 in 2016 consequently glacier lakes have increased in area and number by about 16 and 18 respectively from 23 km2 460 lakes in 1988 27 km2 544 lakes in 2016 drenkhan et al 2018 the lake sibinacocha dammed since 1988 fig 1b drains into the vilcanota urubamba river basin together with the langui layo and piuray lakes sibinacocha represents the main sources of water provision for human livelihoods irrigation and energy production in the cusco region salzmann et al 2013 drenkhan et al 2019 the vilcanota urubamba river basin fig 1a covers an area of 9617 km2 with an elevation range of 2136 6301 m asl fernandez palomino et al 2021 the climate is highly variable driven by complex orography precipitation distribution is highly seasonal marked by a wet season in austral summer november to march when the bolivian high generates easterly flow transporting moisture from the amazon and a dry season in austral winter april to october due to strong westerlies drenkhan et al 2018 at interannual timescale enso represents an important driver of rainfall variability with dry conditions during warm phase el niño events and an opposite behavior during the cold phase la niña events rau et al 2017 rosas et al 2016 however the enso phenomenon and its feedback are not clearly understood and superimpose with other climatic features such as the pacific decadal oscillation pdo vuille et al 2008 in the study area average annual precipitation accounts for of 749 mm 1985 2015 with about 80 of total rainfall occurring between the months of october to march which leads to a highly variable hydrological regime fernandez palomino et al 2021 hydraulic and dam infrastructure has been established in the study basin fig 2 i the machupicchu i hydropower plant fig 1c was built in two stages with a total installed capacity of 107 2 mw ii the sibinacocha dam was constructed located at 147 km southeast of the cusco city and at an elevation of 4680 m asl in 1988 formally inaugurated in june 1996 by the energy generation company machupicchu s a egemsa to guarantee the operation of the hydropower plant with a volume of 120 million m3 iii the reconstruction of the machupicchu ii hydropower plant built in two phases with a total installed power of 192 45 mw the debris flow in 1998 damaged the former hydropower plant iv further downstream the santa teresa hydropower plant luz del sur started operation in 2015 with an installed capacity of 98 mw 2 2 data the flow and precipitation datasets period 1965 2016 used in this study belong to the national hydrology and meteorology service of peru senamhi the flow dataset corresponds to daily observations of the hydrometric station km 105 which collects continuous data series in the lower vilcanota urubamba river since 1964 fig 1a for lake sibinacocha daily outflow series are available from 1965 to 2020 provided by the committee for economic operation of the peruvian interconnected energy coes for its acronym in spanish the precipitation dataset for this study was obtained from monthly records of 19 rainfall stations of which 12 stations are located in the study area and another seven stations in adjacent basins fig 1a and table 1 for the hydrological analysis the flow and precipitation information was arranged considering the hydrological year from september year i to august year i 1 which matches with the beginning of the wet season 2 3 data processing the flow and precipitation datasets were submitted to an exploratory data analysis eda to summarize main data characteristics and to detect outliers using univariate graphical techniques histograms and boxplot in addition all precipitation information was quality checked using a regional vector method rvm brunet moret 1979 we selected the stations located in the study area the quality of the stations was evaluated based on their correlation coefficient r² 0 5 and missing data were filled to build the rvm a minimum of three values per year station and a minimum of three years in a station were required the rvm assumes that annual rainfall in the same climate zone is pseudo proportional with a small random variation each year due to the rainfall distribution within the area villar et al 2009 the rvm with the available data create a virtual station vector that is representative for the entire study area under the concept of extended precipitation average rau et al 2017 it uses the minimum squares method to find the yearly regional pluviometric indices z i and extended precipitation average pi through the following formula rau et al 2017 i 1 n j 1 m pij pi z i where i is the year index j is the station index n is the number of years and m is the number of stations pij is the annual precipitation for station j in the year i pi is the mean precipitation extended to the period of n years and z i is the regional pluviometric index for the year i additionally all monthly precipitation data was interpolated using an inverse distance weighting idw approach to estimate the mean areal precipitation of the vilcanota urubamba basin river subsequently the generated series were accumulated and precipitation anomalies were calculated using the difference of annual precipitation and the multiannual average of mean precipitation for each period 2 4 statistical analysis the statistical analysis included table 2 the use of parametric tests i e a linear regression montgomery et al 2012 and spearman rho and non parametric tests i e man kendall mann 1945 kendall 1955 and the distribution free cumulative sum mcgilchrist and woodyer 1975 these tests were applied to determine the possible existence of statistically significant trends and the change point in the flow and precipitation dataset with significance confidence levels at 90 95 and 99 for the seasonal analysis the data is organized in four quarters i e september november son december february djf march may mam and june august jja to average flow and a cumulative volume for precipitation are calculated for the annual analysis the totalized precipitation and the average flow were estimated using the hydrological year additionally we considered the maximum ammax and minimum ammin average monthly flow 2 5 hydrologic alteration one of the most robust approaches to determine hydrologic alteration is the specific comparison of pre impact natural and post impact altered flow data mcmanamay et al 2012 the natural period was defined based on the water resources management projects implemented in the study area fig 2 considering 1965 1987 as a natural period and 1988 2016 as the altered period therefore the ecoflow method and the iha indicators were used to characterize and quantify the hydrological change of the flow regime in the vilcanota urubamba river basin 2 5 1 ecoflow in this study we used the ecoflow method based on non dimensional measurements of ecodeficit i e the amount of water that is needed but unavailable for ecological flow and ecosurplus i e the amount of water that exceeds the ecosystem requirement which are constructed using flow duration curves fdcs gao et al 2012 2018 the fdcs were estimated based on the daily flow record of vrb and provide a measure of the percentage of time duration during which a specific flow equals or exceeds a value the qi flow is graphed with the corresponding excess probability pi calculated by the following formula p i i n 1 where i is the rank position corresponding to each flow after being arranged in descending order and n is the total number of days therefore annual and seasonal fdcs fig 3 of each year were estimated to analyze changes in the flow regime the fdcs for the natural period 1965 1987 were used to obtain the 25th and 75th percentile fdcs for the annual ecoflow ecosurplus is defined as the area between the 75th percentile fdc and the annual fdc which occurs when the fdc of a given year is above the 75th percentile fdc conversely when the fdc is below the 25th percentile fdc the area between the 25th percentile fdc and the annual fdc is defined as the ecodeficit for the seasonal ecoflow we proceeded similarly to the annual ecoflow assessment with the difference that the accumulated values of quarterly periods were considered all ecodeficit and ecosurplus values were divided by the annual average or seasonal flow to make them non dimensional the ecosurplus represents the amount of water in excess gain and the ecodeficit corresponds to the amount of water that is not available loss due to the alteration of the flow regime 2 5 2 indicators of hydrologic alteration the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha were formulated by richter et al 1996 to compare the inter and intraannual variation of the flow regime they include 33 parameters table 3 lumped into five groups i magnitude of monthly hydrological conditions ii magnitude and duration of annual hydrological extreme conditions iii date of annual extreme hydrological conditions iv frequency and duration of high and low pulses and v rate and frequency of changes in hydrological conditions we used the software iha tnc 2009 to compare the hydrological series before natural period and after altered period the construction of the reservoir all parameters were included in the analysis except for the days with zero flow conditions that did not occur in the study period we adopted a presumptive standard with a moderate level of ecological protection flow changes ranging from 10 to 20 established by richter et al 2011 finally in order to assess the changes in the flows during the natural and altered period with respect to the total flows the anomalies were determined at monthly scale expressed as anomaly evaluation period referenc e period where is the anomaly expressed in m3 s evaluation period is the natural and altered flow in m3 s and the reference period is the average flow of the entire series in m3 s 3 results 3 1 data analysis the flow boxplot at seasonal level shows a symmetric distribution fig 4a with some atypical values e g 1100 m3 s fig 4b these values represent the extreme hydrological events that occurred in january 2010 due to various consecutive days of precipitation lavado et al 2010 based on this technical support all the historical flow data were considered daily discharge in the study area is highly variable with a minimum of 20 m3 s in the dry season and up to 1100 m3 s in the wet season 1985 2016 period km 105 station shows an unimodal seasonal flow regime fig 4a with high flow during december april and low flow in the remaining months fig 5 shows the amplitude range of annual and seasonal precipitation per year the annual precipitation ranges from 466 mm to 934 mm during mam precipitation varies from 73 mm to 257 mm in son precipitation ranges from 53 to 215 mm jja djf shows the lowest highest values of precipitation between 1 and 60 mm 208 542 mm 3 2 statistical analysis annual and djf precipitation series show significant positive trends at 95 and 99 confidence level for all applied tests table 4 analyzed flow changes show an increasing trend of maximum and minimum flows of the vilcanota urubamba river basin table 5 this trend was also detected during son at 90 mann kendall and at 95 spearman rho confidence level and during jja at 99 confidence level for all statistical tests clear changes in the mean for the ammin ammax son and jja flows were detected in the hydrological years 1997 98 99 1998 99 90 1978 79 90 and 1988 89 99 respectively 3 3 hydrologic alteration 3 3 1 ecoflow at the interannual scale ecoflow analysis revealed fig 6 a temporal variation in low annual flows ecodeficits that matches with negative anomalies of average annual precipitation in most years and it is opposite in other years however in some years large ecodeficits are not justified by minor negative precipitation anomalies the high annual flows ecosurplus show a relatively different behavior not strictly associated with positive precipitation anomalies this behavior could particularly be observed between 1999 and 2000 and in a lower degree some years after 2003 2005 2008 2009 and 2012 for the natural period 1981 1986 high annual flows ecosurplus were observed which did not match the precipitation anomalies for the same period this mismatch could suggest an error during the data flow collection nonetheless all flow data recorded during 1981 1986 was considered for the analysis since information with a record length of at least twenty years is required for evaluation of both the natural and altered period moreover km 105 was the only hydrometric station that provided flow data in the study area before the construction of the sibinacocha dam at the seasonal scale fig 7a and b show the changes in the ecoflow for djf and mam ecodeficits occurred in most years with variable magnitudes related to negative precipitation anomalies and more ecodeficits during the altered period were observed particularly in mam ecosurplus values were smaller in magnitude without notable variation between the compared periods natural and altered flow following positive precipitation anomalies in jja and son fig 7c and d a lower number of ecodeficit occurred during the altered period than in the natural period while the predominance of ecosurplus is observed since 1988 altered period which is not related to the values of precipitation anomalies overall in the altered period the low flows ecodeficits are most likely associated with negative rainfall anomalies in djf and mam while high flows ecosurplus which occurred during jja and son are likely related to the operation of the sibinacocha dam 3 3 2 indicators of hydrologic alteration at the interannual scale an average increase of 5 3 m3 s from june to november and an average reduction of 35 2 m3 s from january to february were observed for the altered period 1988 2016 compared to the natural period 1965 1987 table 6 shows the percentage of change of the 32 iha parameters for monthly flow group 1 a positive change between 12 and 27 was observed from july to november this trend matches with the ecosurplus presented in fig 7c and d which cannot be explained by precipitation regime fig 8 for december a flow increase 7 can be observed while ecodeficit with considerable flow reduction can be found for january 18 4 and february 7 4 fig 7a between march and may the change ratios were positive and in the range of 2 1 to 7 1 for the extreme flows condition group 2 there was an increase in the percentage number of days of minimum flow with an absolute variation higher than 10 the timing of annual extreme flow conditions group 3 showed a variation in the date of maximum and minimum flows occurrence during the altered period in the frequency and duration of high and low pulses group 4 a reduction in extreme low flow events was observed in terms of duration and frequency for the altered period while extreme high flow events increased their frequency but reduced their duration the rate and frequency of flow changes group 5 decreased due to lower increase in flows during the high flow events finally the sibinacocha outflow series were used to validate the influence of the dam on river discharge at km 105 fig 9a before the lake was dammed in 1988 high lake outflows occurred during january march peak outflow 6 0 m3 s in january and low outflows during july september minimum outflow 0 8 m3 s in september conversely this behavior reversed after 2002 with high lake outflows during july november peak outflow 6 27 m3 s in september and low outflows during december june minimum outflow 0 37 m³ s in march following river flow regulation to meet the demand for the machupicchu and santa teresa hydropower plants in addition monthly flow anomalies at km 105 were computed for the entire period 1965 2016 based on parameter group 1 of table 6 the anomalies for the period before the construction of the dam 1965 1987 were positive during january april peak anomaly 7 1 m3 s in january and negative from may to october minimum anomaly 4 9 m3 s in august this flow pattern clearly changed for the altered period 1988 2016 with positive anomalies prevailing from may to september and december peak anomaly 4 2 m3 s in august and negative anomalies from january to april minimum anomaly 6 0 m3 s in january these patterns are consistent with observed outflows at sibinacocha dam fig 9a 4 discussion this study analyzes the hydrological impact of dam regulation on hydropower production in a high mountain basin in southern peru based on instrumental precipitation records period 1965 2016 our data suggest that annual and wet season djf precipitation has increased since 1998 99 table 4 these findings stand in contrast to the results of salzmann et al 2013 who observed a decreasing precipitation trend for the vilcanota region during the period 1965 2009 however the comparability between both studies is limited due to the different number of stations considered a total of 19 stations in this research compared to only one station in the other study furthermore the analyzed precipitation trends in the andes often lack strong significance cf salzmann et al 2014 and do not show clear unique patterns arias et al 2021 rabatel et al 2013 vuille et al 2003 due to large spatial variability and limited process understanding results need therefore to be carefully revised we also observed strong negative precipitation anomalies for the hydrological years 1980 1983 and 1987 and high positive anomalies during 2001 2003 several of which match with pronounced enso events fig 6 the influence of enso on precipitation patterns in the vilcanota mountain range was previously analyzed by perry et al 2014 using in situ stations and satellite information they concluded that precipitation would likely decrease during la niña events and increase during el niño events which represent a distinct pattern compared to other andean regions such as the cordillera blanca further north vuille et al 2008 this particular pattern in the vilcanota region could be associated to the influence of coupled climatic oceanic processes including changes in the tropical atlantic sea surface temperature lavado casimiro et al 2013 rau et al 2017 our results follow this pattern indicating an increase in the flow during the hydrological year 1997 1998 that matches with a strong el niño event table 5 shows the flow trend and change point in the study area for 1965 2016 the observed change point for the ammax in the hydrological year 1998 99 is related to a positive precipitation trend at 90 confidence found during djf table 4 changes in mean flow in the hydrological year 1978 79 90 confidence during son are attributed to precipitation variability this mean change was also displayed in 5 year moving average curves of son flow and precipitation result not shown in the paper which exhibited strong negative anomalies during 1968 1978 in both variables our findings suggest that dam operation was the main factor that controlled the hydrological flow regime variability in the vilcanota urubamba river basin as from 1988 to 89 when dam operation had started we found a significant increasing trend of dry season jja flow despite of distinct precipitation patterns fig 8 in line with drenkhan et al 2015 who reported positive non significant discharge anomalies for the period 1958 2013 considerable flow increase during the dry season is associated with increasing water release to meet drinking irrigation and hydroelectric water demand additionally the average precipitation during the altered period fig 9b reveal an increase by more than 10 mm between december and february that might influence the baseflow fernandez palomino et al 2021 found important baseflow contribution to the water yield which confirms the role of baseflow and the contribution of groundwater on the modulation of the flow regime during the dry season for this study the relatively short precipitation records including inconsistent or missing data that represent a limitation to fully understand precipitation trends and related impacts on river flow in this region similarly we found inconsistency in flow data annual high flow anomaly ecosurplus observed between 1981 and 1986 natural period most likely corresponds to inhomogeneities related to flow data collection or calibration errors nonetheless we decided to use the entire dataset as km 105 represents the only gauge in the study area with a minimum series of 20 years of daily flow data which is a necessary benchmark to evaluate significant alteration in the hydrological regime these data limitations reveal a clear need for a well established and strategically distributed network of in situ stations that increases our understanding of the flow regime and its potential changes in view of the combined impacts from climate change and human interventions such an effort is necessary for urgently needed robust development of future scenarios of water resource changes in the vilcanota urubamba river basin to support local decision making and climate change adaptation new data collection strategies are required that use alternative often more flexible and cost effective approaches such as low cost sensor technology participatory monitoring and frameworks that deal with high uncertainties drenkhan et al 2022 muñoz et al 2021 our results of hydrological alteration induced by dams are in line compared to other studies in the andes region vega jácome et al 2018 and beyond li et al 2020 pfeiffer and ionita 2017 yin et al 2020 low and high flows were altered group 2 since 1 day 3 day 7 day and 30 day minimum flows increased by more than 20 similar to this 1 day 3 day 7 day weekly monthly and 3 monthly maximum flow statistics increased by up to 7 this low flow increase is related to the increase in monthly mean flows group 1 during the dry season jja we also observed a reduction in the low flow pulses group 4 for both counts and duration during the post dam period possibly associated with the release of water during the dry season our results highlight that the major changes in the flow regimen of the vilcanota urubamba river basin were rather related to the increase of flows during the dry season jja than to precipitation changes as shown in fig 7c table 6 group 1 and fig 8 these results show a divergence between precipitation and flows in the vilcanota urubamba river basin due to the regulation of the basin associated with the operation of the dam 1988 in this study we have not assessed the associated ecological impacts downstream due to dam operation and hydrological alteration richter et al 2011 affirm that if is not possible to establish a relationship between hydrological alterations and possible ecological impacts instead it is possible to adopt a presumptive standard ranging from 10 to 20 moderate level of ecological protection of hydrologic alteration beyond which there may be relevant impacts on ecological functions based on this criterion the hydrological changes identified in the vilcanota urubamba river basin may generate ecological impact more studies need to confirm this hypothesis however only a limited body of studies includes impacts of hydrological changes on biological communities e g ochoa tocachi et al 2016 and none of them cover our study area future studies require to integrated biota response and river ecosystems to these alterations including their relationship with e g the morphology nutrient cycling sediment transport groundwater the risk of climate change and flow variability a better grasp of such responses and processes combined with robust approaches to address uncertainties would allow for developing more meaningful future water availability scenarios to improve water and energy security in the peruvian andes understanding the hydrologic alteration of streamflow is therefore important to design appropriate strategies for improved water resources management and ecosystem conservation an integrated evidence based scientific approach is necessary that tackles with social environmental risks concerning environmental degradation climate change and socio economic development drenkhan et al 2022 associated with the construction and management of dams such an approach must support decision making to promote infrastructure projects that have minimal impacts on natural ecosystems while maximizing future options for sustainable water and energy use 5 conclusions this study evaluated for the first time a combined assessment of streamflow alteration as a consequence of hydropower regulation in the vilcanota urubamba river basin southern peru our multi decadal 1965 2016 analysis of interannual flow variability ecoflow method highlights that at seasonal timescale an ecodeficit of about 20 compared to average natural river flow occurred during the wet season djf as a result of water storage regulation of lake sibinacocha during the altered period 1988 2016 meanwhile an ecosurplus of 30 compared to average natural river flow predominated during the dry season jja as a result of additional lake water outflow for hydropower production in absence of rainfall in the altered period our analysis confirms that the operation of lake sibinacocha was the main factor of hydrological flow regime alteration in the vilcanota urubamba river basin during the dry season jja these findings provide useful insights for local and regional water resource planning and adaptation given combined and increasingly adverse impacts from climate land use and land cover changes however there an evident lack of data collection and limited knowledge hampers a detailed process understanding to conduct systematic research on hydrological alteration in the peruvian andes these limitations are further exacerbated by challenges of complex hydrometeorological processes linked to high spatial and temporal gradients and variability our approach compares the performance of two methods indicators of hydrologic alteration and ecoflow and shows that both are complementary and effective in evaluating the water regime in a regulated high andean basin therefore this methodology provides a reference for assessing hydrological alteration in peru and beyond with similar basin conditions this framework may be used as a case to develop a standard procedure of ecological flow regime estimation applied to other

7707,study region sg kedah basin malaysia study focus this study proposed a novel method to estimate the flood susceptibility index based on topographical conditions using multi criteria decision making approach with a specific hazard classification to determine the paddy flood vulnerability index considering all paddy growth periods and to establish risk classification by integrating flood inundation and damage as risk is a combination of probability and impact of an event to occur new hydrological insights flood occurrences at paddy fields are not uncommon and pose a serious threat because rice is a staple food for most asian countries in a tropical environment paddy cultivation normally undergoes three growth stages namely vegetation reproductive and ripening these stages have different water requirements therefore it is essential to include the paddy growth stages in the risk assessment as well as the inundated duration and depth which are unique to the specific location and the paddy seed variety these parameters have not been investigated in previous studies the risk indices were classified into 5 major classes namely very low low moderate high and very high a comprehensive flood risk map developed in this study can be used by all relevant authorities and stake holders to evaluate the level of flood risk graphical abstract ga1 keywords flood susceptibility index paddy flood vulnerability index paddy flood risk index multi criteria analysis analytical hierarchy process data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the increasing frequency of extreme rainfall due to climate change is very alarming as of late xu et al 2022 agricultural lands all over of the world are experiencing lower gross production due to extreme climate change bairagi et al 2020 boonwichai et al 2019 ghosh et al 2019 under extreme rainfall conditions paddy cultivation is at high risk from flooding and high salinity due to its location on flat terrain thuy and anh 2015 and clay soils ouma and tateishi 2014 which may cause waterlogging for example from the end of june to october paddy cultivation at the mekong river delta faces huge production loss due to flooding triet et al 2018 the quality of the rice will reduce when extreme rainfall occurs during the heading stage as it will interrupt the pollination and maturing process of the rice kotera et al 2015 in terms of growth quality and the evapotranspiration process alam et al 2014 masud et al 2012 wang et al 2018 subsequently rice production will be reduced if rain is prolonged until the ripening phase kotera et al 2015 singha et al 2020 moreover the water requirement for the heading to ripening phases is zero unlike the prior stages that require extensive water supply mada 2020 and if inundation occurs during these stages it will significantly hinder rice production hence the production of paddy will strictly follow the cropping calendar to achieve all the mentioned stages of growth flood risk assessment is vital to analyse the spatial and temporal paddy at risk due to flooding comprehensive flood risk management for agriculture particularly for staple foods such as rice grain wheat etc is crucial to reduce the damage caused by flood events through the identification of flood hotspots and the determination of severity levels for mitigation purposes studies investigating the impact of flooding in agriculture typically concentrate on the effect of climate change on agricultural production tang 2019 wang et al 2018 shokoohi et al 2018 triet et al 2018 wassmann et al 2019 for instance wang et al 2018 assessed the flood risk at jilin province china on multi grain i e maize rice soybean and several researchers e g shokoohi et al 2018 triet et al 2018 wassmann et al 2019 studied the flood risk in paddy cultivation flood occurrences on agricultural land are a serious threat ahmed et al 2016 especially for paddy cultivation as rice is the staple food for most asian countries che omar et al 2019 alternatively having expert judgement and experience from various specialist loss estimation can still be achievable through the index method in flood risk assessment there is a need for risk classification based on the inundation depth and damage chau et al 2013 however current studies for paddy cultivation have not yet included this element hence using the multi criteria decision making mcdm approach in flood risk assessment allows the risks to be ranked and the evaluation of all possible alternatives for flood mitigation arabameri et al 2019 jato espino et al 2019 santos et al 2019 in this study we investigate the hypothesis made by previous researchers as stated in the previous paragraph and develop a novel methodology to evaluate the flood risk at paddy cultivation that combines susceptibility index and vulnerability index there are three objectives in this study 1 to determine the flood susceptibility index based on topographical conditions using the mcdm approach 2 to determine the paddy flood vulnerability index considering all growth periods and 3 to perform risk classification based on flood inundation and flood damage as risk is a combination of the likelihood and the impact of an event occurring a comprehensive flood risk map is developed which can serve as a means of communication to all authorities and relevant agencies to evaluate the level of flood risk particularly in paddy cultivation areas 2 material and methods 2 1 study area one of the biggest paddy plantation and production areas in malaysia is located in the sg kedah basin kedah a northern state of the peninsular malaysia as shown in fig 1 this area contributes 38 8 of local paddy production in malaysia che omar et al 2019 and therefore is known as the rice bowl of malaysia it consists of 5 sub basins namely kubang pasu kota setar pendang pokok sena and padang terap the largest paddy production area is located in kota setar and pendang under the management of the muda agricultural development authority mada by muda irrigation scheme did 2011 meanwhile mini granary areas in kubang pasu pokok sena and pedang terap are managed by the department of irrigation and drainage did kedah did 2011 rainfall events in the sg kedah basin are highly influenced by the monsoon seasons this area is expected to receive a significant amount of rainfall at the end of the south west monsoon september inter monsoon months april and october and at the beginning of the north east monsoon november and december the months of january and february are considered to be dry periods for the sg kedah basin 2 2 methodology in general this study utilised secondary data multi criteria analysis and gis to achieve its objectives secondary input data such as rainfall historical flood events flood depths flood duration and river maps were collected from did malaysia geological data such as soil map slope map elevation map and landuse landcover map were collected from the department of survey and mapping malaysia jupem the resolution of the study area is 30 m and the spatial reference is gdm2000 for peninsular malaysia this information was used in preparing all required data for this study such as slope soil type elevation land use land cover distance from river and annual rainfall distribution paddy cropping calendar and map were provided by mada 2020 paddy growth is determined from mada the organisation in the study area responsible for advising the farmers of the most suitable time to start planting paddy fertilize and crop flood occurrence is based on the total monthly rainfall because during the initial stage of a paddy plantation the paddy field needs to be flooded with water to suppress the grass and weeds so that the paddy can grow well as the paddy grows less water is needed therefore planning needs to be performed so that the harvesting season falls in a dry month i e less rainfall the overall methodology is divided into three major steps namely determination of flood susceptibility index fsi determination of paddy flood vulnerability index pfvi and development of paddy flood risk index pfri a flow chart of the methodology is shown in fig 2 each step to establish these indices was validated using historical flood data paddy damage and 100 years of ari data produced by did respectively the calculated indices fsi pfvi and pfri were divided into five colour coded classifications and all these indices were then mapped onto the sg kedah basin map to illustrate their spatial distribution pattern a detailed methodology is given in the following sub sections 2 2 1 selection of susceptibility factors through our extensive literature review e g abu el magd et al 2020 mahmoud and gan 2018a wu et al 2019 we concluded that the following susceptibility factors should be considered in this study namely total annual rainfall slope soil type landuse landcover elevation and distance from the river these parameters were chosen based on studies related to susceptibility vulnerability flood risk and flood index that have been published by other researchers since 2015 these factors are the most prominent elements in determining flood hazards according to our knowledge of the study area and data availability 2 2 1 1 total annual rainfall rainfall is one of the most important input parameters regarding location susceptibility to flooding normally it is included in the development of flood inundation maps through hydrological modelling abdullah et al 2018 2019 choubin et al 2019 total annual rainfall data in this study were collected from 2010 to 2017 from 27 rainfall stations of which 18 stations are located in the sg kedah basin 6 stations in the sg muda basin and 3 stations in perlis to achieve good interpolation these values were then used to develop the classification of total annual rainfall sub factor 2 2 1 2 distance from the river mustafa et al 2018 popa et al 2019 and wang et al 2018 found that distance from the river is another important criterion to be included to determine the flood susceptibility index this is because the volume of the river increases as a result of accumulation of water that will eventually inundate the nearby area quickly the lesser the buffer zone the higher the probability for the area to be exposed to flooding to construct the map the euclidean tool in arcgis desktop 10 3 was used this factor follows the minimum allowable limit of buffer distance of 50 m as stipulated by did malaysia 2 2 1 3 topography conditions all topography related conditions such as slope elevation soil type and landuse landcover are considered in this study slope depends on the rate of change of elevation and flooding is inversely proportional to slope high slope will lessen the accumulation of water within the area since it influences the flow direction and increases the water surface velocity blistanova et al 2016 jato espino et al 2019 reclassification of the slope sub factor was carried out based on past studies abu el magd et al 2020 kazakis et al 2015 ouma and tateishi 2014 with consideration of the current slope at the study area elevation influences the terrain behaviour as a result of the difference in geographic heights it affects the water flow direction from a higher level to a lower level and eventually results in flow accumulation if the terrain is flat in other words this reflects an inverse proportional relationship between elevation and flood events and its reclassification was performed according to past studies abu el magd et al 2020 mahmoud and gan 2018a wu et al 2019 soil type is another important parameter that needs to be considered when developing a flood susceptibility index as it significantly influences the infiltration rate of water arabameri et al 2019 mahmoud and gan 2018a pourghasemi et al 2019 previous studies described soil type using percentage of clay blistanova et al 2016 and infiltration capacity ouma and tateishi 2014 however in this study the soil type is represented by the surface runoff coefficient and how effectively water is drained into the river system this is estimated based on the landuse landcover map as stipulated in chow et al 1988 urban storm water management did 2012 and harley and samantha 2018 changes in landuse landcover will result in a lot of harm rather than good if not managed properly for example urbanisation is one of the most obvious change in landuse landcover jacinto et al 2015 nga et al 2018 and it will alter the infiltration rate and surface runoff due to smooth surfaces from cement as a result of higher soil curve number as paddy fields are normally located downstream near the river delta triet et al 2017 2020 changes in landuse landcover will impose greater vulnerability to paddy fields 2 2 2 development of ahp mcdm model the analytical hierarchy process ahp is a type of decision making model developed by saaty 1984 that recognises a parameter and its priority in a given array according to the expertise knowledge and skill set this method suggests the application of pairwise comparison between parameters numerically ranging from 1 i e equal importance between two parameters to 9 i e one parameter is much more important compared to other parameter to support quantitative decision making the basis of pairwise comparison is to adopt a linear combination and produce a best fit to the weight set by normalizing all the parameters in this study the pairwise comparison is performed based the researchers expert knowledge and further verified using the annual flood reports published by did malaysia the pairwise comparison is checked concurrently with consistency ratio to ensure that it does not exceed the maximum allowable limit of 10 as suggested by ouma and tateishi 2014 once the priority level is determined the sub factor for each parameter was assigned accordingly from highest most influence 5 to the lowest least influence 1 2 2 3 flood susceptibility index fsi the application of ahp mcdm assists in the estimation of fsi through the weightage value given to each parameter in the multi attribute function indices were calculated according to cell attributes in google earth pro ge pro at a bird s eye view elevation of 37 m to get detailed features of the study area colour coded mapping was applied to differentiate the level of susceptibility as listed in table 1 the water level in table 1 refers to the historical flood depth records provided by did malaysia which is a part of the validation analysis validation of fsi was performed based on historical flood data at the study area from 2010 to 2017 with events having flooded from a rainfall intensity of more than 60 mm in more than 4 h duration to ensure that only significant rainfall events were included based on the reported flood occurrence by did malaysia this rainfall intensity and duration were rainfall characteristics that contributed to the inundated area a similar approach has been used by harley and samanta 2018 skilodimou et al 2019 and ghosh et al 2017 2 2 4 selection of paddy flood vulnerability parameter we combined the approaches proposed by triet et al 2018 and wan mohtar et al 2020 to estimate the paddy flood vulnerability index while a guideline prepared by did 2003 was used to evaluate the damage as a result three parameters such as flood depth flood duration and paddy growth were chosen to represent the vulnerability parameters the paddy seed grade was assumed to be the same throughout the study area since the study area has a relatively similar environmental condition this means that throughout the area all paddy growth has roughly the same maturity period of 120 days where the heading period is within 90 days mada 2020 a five point likert scale based score was used to assign each of the vulnerability parameters for the development of the vulnerability index as shown in table 2 definition of the color coded paddy vulnerability index is given in table 3 since the growth period is closely related to paddy age the basis of the growth period will be monthly a higher level of score was given at may june october and november as the heading phase was expected to occur within these months according to the mada paddy schedule also a high score was given to higher flood depths as well as to longer flood durations because it was found to cause higher damage values 2 2 5 paddy flood vulnerability index pfvi pfvi is estimated based on direct damage to paddy production only and the index is calculated based on multi attribute functions with all the parameters having the same weightage value as shown in eq 4 the definition of each level is tabulated in table 3 validation of the pfvi was performed according to the damage factor for paddy cultivation in relation to the water level as stipulated by did 2003 4 direct damage paddy index paddy flood vulnerability index pfvi score m score r score d 3 2 2 6 paddy flood risk index paddy flood risk index was calculated using eq 5 where the product shows the degree of severity given the likelihood of an area to be hazardous the degree of risks was classified into 5 categories namely very low low moderate high and very high paddy risk index as tabulated in table 4 5 pfri fsi i x pfvi i 2 2 7 mapping of indexes fsi pfvi and pfri flood susceptibility maps were developed using arcgis desktop 10 3 to reclassify the parameters according to each sub factor the spatial analyst tool function was used for all the reclassification processes the total annual rainfall distribution map required an additional tool in the software known as the inverse distance weightage idw method to map the rainfall distribution maps of these susceptibility parameters are shown in fig 3 a fig 3 f the flood susceptibility locations were mapped on the sg kedah basin map using google earth ge pro software at a bird s eye view elevation of 37 m the same method was used for the construction of paddy flood vulnerability and paddy flood risk maps using ge pro software notably all locations were mapped in point feature instead of polygon as most of the locations are localised all points were colour coded in green teal yellow orange or red depending on the level of susceptibility vulnerability and risk as defined in table 1 and table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 fsi for the sungai kedah basin the selected susceptibility factors used in this study are total annual rainfall slope soil type elevation distance from river and land use land cover these factors need to be given priority element based on the analytical hierarchy parameter multi criteria decision making ahp mcdm as shown in table 5 the pairwise comparison of flood susceptibility factors for the sg kedah basin was then verified based on consistency ratio cr analysis as suggested by ouma and tateishi 2014 in this study the cr is equivalent to 0 05 which is lower than the acceptable limit of 0 10 saaty 2016 this cr value was selected to give better accuracy and minimise error to ensure that the estimated indices were reliable following this the fsi equation refer to eq 6 was developed according to weightage calculated in the ahp mcdm and decision sub factors of each critical susceptibility factor these parameters are summarised in table 6 6 fsi 0 343 total annual rainfall 0 123 slope 0 134 soil type 0 073 elevation 0 226 distance from river 0 101 landuse land cover fig 4 illustrates the flood susceptibility classes i e from low level to very high level with index values of 2 6 5 0 the majority of the points have fsi values within the moderate level indicated in yellow in fig 4 particularly at kubang pasu kota setar and pendang sub basins however paddy cultivation areas are found to be within low to moderate classes having index values of 1 81 3 4 respectively this can be due to paddy cultivation being located in low terrain and the fact that paddy soils are made up mostly of clay clay tends to hold up water for longer due to its poor permeability network in the soil structure ouma and tateishi 2014 but there is still enough vegetation cover to encourage water storage through infiltration processes unlike those in urban areas gao et al 2020 hence making it favourable to be saturated in a short period of time in addition according to the risk classification it was estimated that the paddy cultivations are exposed to flood depths of 0 25 0 75 m nevertheless it should be noted that the vulnerability and paddy risk vary according to the flood duration and paddy growth apart from that paddy fields are exposed to flood hazards since most of the paddy fields are located at the downstream area and near the main canals which are situated near to rivers as stated earlier the distance to the river is the second highest level of priority vector this condition should be of concern as the distance to the river basin and paddy fields could be within the hazard area and this can potentially place the paddy fields at a vulnerable stage among all flood susceptibility points three locations having red point symbols are in the city centre namely kota setar at alor setar pendang at pendang and jitra at kubang pasu as shown in fig 4 the city centre is developed with roads and buildings where impervious surfaces from cements and smooth surfaces are higher areas as compared to other locations the increase of these surfaces is a result of urbanisation where it increases the surface runoff coefficient shortens the lag time and increases the rising limb of a hydrograph hazarika et al 2015 mahmoud and gan 2018b blue colour symbols show that the areas have low fsi and are subject to low flood susceptibility for instance for pokok sena jabi the area is colour coded in blue as shown in fig 4 this may be due to good landcover that surrounds the area the area is well surrounded by forest on the northern side and agricultural land nearby this good landcover helps to reduce the direct rainfall flow to the land as well as increase the water storage in the soil 3 2 pfvi for the sg kedah basin vulnerability is crucial in flood risk management as it enables the estimation of the level of damage caused by an event the landuse map is usually the main element to determine the vulnerability based on the exposed surface area vulnerability analysis was performed on the paddy production damage factor according to three parameters namely flood depth flood duration and paddy growth all the vulnerable paddy locations were mapped on the sg kedah basin map in points symbols as all the areas are localised as shown in fig 5 the vulnerability of the paddy to flooding is more concentrated on the northern side of kota setar to the river mouth of the sg kedah river namely paddy cultivation near kampung bohor kampung anak bukit kampung darat and kepala batas also on northern side of pendang paddy cultivation near kampung banggol besi kampung bukit raya dalam pendang kampung perupok alor punti kampung lahar tunjung and kampung dalam baroh in padang terap the majority of paddy cultivation that is susceptible to flooding is within kampung alor kampung kubang panjang kampung petani as for kubang pasu the exposed paddy cultivation areas are located near kampung paya nongmi changlun kampung bukit kampung padang kampung darat kampung binjai city centre of jitra taman melur and kampung hilir meanwhile there are fewer paddy locations in pokok sena that are exposed to flooding events namely located at kampung yoi nearby sungai nawa and taman puteri in addition this study confirms the findings found by hadi et al 2017 that the areas along the rivers and within the kota setar are the most vulnerable areas compared to other sub basins according to the risk classification areas with pfvi values between 1 0 and 3 4 indicate that the flood depth at paddy cultivation is roughly 0 25 0 75 m only and this results in 30 37 of paddy damage respectively the majority of paddy cultivation is exposed to flood events in october and november when it is said to be within the most vulnerable paddy growth period however due to the short flood duration the paddy damage is not severe all green point areas experienced flood durations that lasted 2 3 days maximum as well as flood depth less than 0 25 m meanwhile those areas having paddy flood vulnerability in yellow indicate that the flood depth is 0 5 0 75 m and flood duration of more than 5 days this resulted in slightly higher paddy damage as compared to green points due to a longer period of flood duration and flood depth this damage rank also proves the level of ineffectiveness of the flood mitigation in place rather than widening the river perhaps local authorities can consider other flood mitigation such as dikes park et al 2020 or closing a sluice gate to safeguard the paddy cultivations this study disagrees with the findings of shrestha et al 2016 which stated that paddy damage only occurs in vegetation or maturing phases when water reaches over 0 2 m or 0 5 m respectively this is because this study found that throughout the period of paddy growth in flood depths of more than 0 25 m the paddy cultivation potentially risks losses of 30 37 however the exact details of flood indicators flood duration and flood depth that will result in a total loss is missing in this study further study can be performed to evaluate the factors that influence the total loss of rice production current damage in this study only accounts for direct damage of rice production however a study performed by nga et al 2018 found that the intangible risks are 1 5 2 5 times higher as opposed to direct tangible elements such risks include business interruption cost of repair and clean up and environmental pollution following this the actual paddy damage can be more severe than the estimated damage as most of the farmers rely heavily on the rice production profits ghosh et al 2019 specifically for paddy the consideration of inundation depth that corresponds to the paddy damage for different areas is also important previous research such as wassmann et al 2019 chung et al 2019 nga et al 2018 and triet et al 2018 found that the paddy at their study area was facing shortfall when water depth exceeds 0 4 m in fact shrestha et al 2016 discovered that this damage occurs in the ripening phase and during the vegetation phase when inundated water depth of more than 0 2 m will start to result in low grain quality yet rehan et al 2020 found that paddy damage will only occur for inundation depths of more than 2 0 m at any stage of paddy growth thus it can be said that the level of inundation is unique to its specific location and paddy seed varieties this shows that it is best to have a wide range of hazard classification to evaluate the level of severity clearly 3 3 paddy flood risk in paddy cultivation for the sg kedah basin the overall paddy flood risk index for extreme rainfall in the sg kedah basin is within the very low to moderate classes as only 3 colour coded points are found in fig 6 these locations are coded in green blue and yellow this means that the damage factor is between 30 and 37 one area in kubang pasu known as changlun and two locations in pendang alor punti and kampung perupok have an average damage factor of 35 37 slightly higher than the rest as shown in fig 6 this is due to the flood event that occurred in 2012 that lasted for more than 5 days and cause inundation of 0 5 0 7 m in the paddy cultivation it was reported that around 17 2 ha of paddy cultivation was damaged due to the event did 2013 this finding supported the calculated pfri estimated in this study the paddy cultivation areas having yellow coded points indicate paddy areas experiencing a higher risk of flooding compared to other paddy areas the paddy flood risk indices were within 1 15 4 very low risk to moderate risk with higher distributions of index level at 5 81 10 6 low risk information on risk classification is important in flood risk assessment as it can provide information on the locations that are at risk of flooding so that appropriate flood mitigation can be implemented park et al 2020 it can also evaluate the existing condition of the area whether the current control measures are satisfactory or require an additional soft structure and hard engineering measure chan et al 2018 based on the paddy flood risk map most of the paddy cultivation at risk is located within kota setar and pendang local authorities can use this information to plan for river or drainage divergence and for suitable pathways to improve this situation resulting from landuse landcover change due to the expansion of urbanisation in the upstream zhou et al 2019 since we know that the monsoon floods have a high potential to impact paddy cultivation mada should review the existing paddy calendar so that the most vulnerable period of paddy growth will not encounter flood events and cause paddy production loss by changing the paddy calendar one should also take into consideration future climate change so that the condition of paddy cultivation will be sustainable changing the fertilizer is another option for instance the fertilizer that is more tolerant to being submerged in water can be used during the rainy or wet season xin et al 2020 found that nutrient use management is one of the vital contributing factors to increasing gpp rice yield in northern china the paddy flood risk assessment was performed in this study also provides an important aspect in the development for crop insurance schemes as it successfully delineates those impacted areas that face natural disasters such as flood events triet et al 2018 a comprehensive flood management policy can be initiated by the government based on the structure of flood risk assessment performed in this study where it integrates past flood events in the flood risk assessment and the current conditions of the study area akter et al 2018 having support from the government to initiate such a policy gives some reassurance to the farmers to continue working in the agricultural industry 3 4 validation of paddy flood risk index mapping this task was performed to validate the accuracy of pfri results estimated from the methodology proposed in this study since the main concern of this study is related to flood the researchers validated the pfri using an estimated distribution of water depth for 100 year average recurrence interval ari flood map prepared by did as shown in fig 7 in hydrology the 100 year ari flood map is often used to represent a major event and also the worst case scenario as the probability of the storm event occurring is 1 in 100 years the 100 year flood map as presented in fig 7 is developed from an integrated numerical hydraulic and hydrologic modelling exercise performed by did although the present study was validated using historical data from 2010 to 2017 the water depth for the 100 year ari map prepared by did is still acceptable as the flood which occurred in 2010 was the worst flood event that has happen up until today the parameters used in this modelling exercise include hydrological data such as storm events rainfall duration and rainfall intensity and physical characteristics of the basin such as slope digital elevation model dem river network land use and soil type therefore it can be seen that the parameters used in the hydraulic hydrologic model is very similar to the development of pfri except that the hydraulic hydrologic modelling exercise requires a long process of data preparation and model performance evaluation i e calibration and validation are strictly event based it does not take into account the paddy cropping calendar which is vital to ensure maximum productivity of paddy that leads to sustainable food security with reference to fig 7 the flood depths are generally categorised into 3 major classes i e minor impact 0 01 m slight water overtopping from the river medium impact 0 5 m limited road accessibility especially for small and medium sized vehicles and major impact 1 2 m equivalent to almost half of one storey building it can be seen that the major impacts are mostly concentrated near the river the paddy areas are mostly located further in land and therefore the impact is low to moderate these results are similar to the risk level estimated by pfri this shows that the methodology to estimate paddy flood risk index pfri developed in this study are acceptable and supported by recorded historical flood events in the study area 4 conclusions currently the flood inundation depths and damage estimation at paddy cultivation areas are highly dependent on integrated hydraulic hydrological modelling that concentrates more on event based simulations and this exercise can be expensive in terms of cost labour and time taken to complete the task as flood occurrences at paddy cultivation areas pose a serious threat as it may threat food security of a country a more rigorous and comprehensive method that considers the paddy growth stages in the risk assessment is needed therefore this study presents a novel methodology to estimate the flood risk at paddy cultivations known as the paddy flood risk index pfri that combines flood susceptibility fsi and paddy flood vulnerability pfvi indices the developed methodology uses the ahp mcdm approach that takes into consideration the critical susceptibility factors of the study area namely total annual rainfall slope soil type elevation distance from river and land use land cover the proposed methodology is able to estimate pfri that provides a vital information on detailed hazard classification all paddy growth period and a combination of crucial factors namely flood inundation and damage which indicate the likelihood and impact of an event to occur the initial finding reveals that the paddy cultivation areas in the sg kedah basin are estimated to be exposed to flood depths ranging between 0 25 25 m and 0 75 m it should be noted that vulnerability and paddy flood risk vary according to the flood duration and paddy growth period the pfvi analysis shows that this flood depth may result in paddy damage ranging between 30 and 37 respectively the majority of paddy cultivation is exposed to flood events in october and november within the most vulnerable paddy growth period but due to the flood duration not being extensive the paddy damage is not severe these areas that are within low level experienced flood durations that lasted 2 3 days and the flood depth of less than 0 25 0 5 m this study concluded that the overall paddy flood risk index for the sg kedah basin is within the very low to moderate class most vulnerable are paddy cultivation areas in kota setar and pendang as these locations are located on relatively very flat terrain many improvements and management plans can be made available based on the findings of this study for example local authorities can use this information to improve drainage conditions and land use planning additionally since we know that the monsoon floods have a high possibility to impact paddy cultivation mada may implement several management best practises in paddy cultivation such as reviewing the existing paddy calendar using high quality and high resistance paddy varieties and planning the most efficient fertilizer that is best suited to the natural conditions of the study area the methodology developed in this study enables any stakeholder and interested parties to clearly determine the flood extent and its impact on the paddy cultivation area more importantly the proposed methodology enables the quantification of fsi pfvi and pfri using local conditions input data detailed hazard classification paddy growth period and a combination of crucial factors namely flood inundation and damage the proposed method can be adopted by researchers around the globe by using data collected from their study area such as topography and hydrological characteristics paddy growth based on their seed variety and historical flood records credit authorship contribution statement adilah anuar

7707,study region sg kedah basin malaysia study focus this study proposed a novel method to estimate the flood susceptibility index based on topographical conditions using multi criteria decision making approach with a specific hazard classification to determine the paddy flood vulnerability index considering all paddy growth periods and to establish risk classification by integrating flood inundation and damage as risk is a combination of probability and impact of an event to occur new hydrological insights flood occurrences at paddy fields are not uncommon and pose a serious threat because rice is a staple food for most asian countries in a tropical environment paddy cultivation normally undergoes three growth stages namely vegetation reproductive and ripening these stages have different water requirements therefore it is essential to include the paddy growth stages in the risk assessment as well as the inundated duration and depth which are unique to the specific location and the paddy seed variety these parameters have not been investigated in previous studies the risk indices were classified into 5 major classes namely very low low moderate high and very high a comprehensive flood risk map developed in this study can be used by all relevant authorities and stake holders to evaluate the level of flood risk graphical abstract ga1 keywords flood susceptibility index paddy flood vulnerability index paddy flood risk index multi criteria analysis analytical hierarchy process data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the increasing frequency of extreme rainfall due to climate change is very alarming as of late xu et al 2022 agricultural lands all over of the world are experiencing lower gross production due to extreme climate change bairagi et al 2020 boonwichai et al 2019 ghosh et al 2019 under extreme rainfall conditions paddy cultivation is at high risk from flooding and high salinity due to its location on flat terrain thuy and anh 2015 and clay soils ouma and tateishi 2014 which may cause waterlogging for example from the end of june to october paddy cultivation at the mekong river delta faces huge production loss due to flooding triet et al 2018 the quality of the rice will reduce when extreme rainfall occurs during the heading stage as it will interrupt the pollination and maturing process of the rice kotera et al 2015 in terms of growth quality and the evapotranspiration process alam et al 2014 masud et al 2012 wang et al 2018 subsequently rice production will be reduced if rain is prolonged until the ripening phase kotera et al 2015 singha et al 2020 moreover the water requirement for the heading to ripening phases is zero unlike the prior stages that require extensive water supply mada 2020 and if inundation occurs during these stages it will significantly hinder rice production hence the production of paddy will strictly follow the cropping calendar to achieve all the mentioned stages of growth flood risk assessment is vital to analyse the spatial and temporal paddy at risk due to flooding comprehensive flood risk management for agriculture particularly for staple foods such as rice grain wheat etc is crucial to reduce the damage caused by flood events through the identification of flood hotspots and the determination of severity levels for mitigation purposes studies investigating the impact of flooding in agriculture typically concentrate on the effect of climate change on agricultural production tang 2019 wang et al 2018 shokoohi et al 2018 triet et al 2018 wassmann et al 2019 for instance wang et al 2018 assessed the flood risk at jilin province china on multi grain i e maize rice soybean and several researchers e g shokoohi et al 2018 triet et al 2018 wassmann et al 2019 studied the flood risk in paddy cultivation flood occurrences on agricultural land are a serious threat ahmed et al 2016 especially for paddy cultivation as rice is the staple food for most asian countries che omar et al 2019 alternatively having expert judgement and experience from various specialist loss estimation can still be achievable through the index method in flood risk assessment there is a need for risk classification based on the inundation depth and damage chau et al 2013 however current studies for paddy cultivation have not yet included this element hence using the multi criteria decision making mcdm approach in flood risk assessment allows the risks to be ranked and the evaluation of all possible alternatives for flood mitigation arabameri et al 2019 jato espino et al 2019 santos et al 2019 in this study we investigate the hypothesis made by previous researchers as stated in the previous paragraph and develop a novel methodology to evaluate the flood risk at paddy cultivation that combines susceptibility index and vulnerability index there are three objectives in this study 1 to determine the flood susceptibility index based on topographical conditions using the mcdm approach 2 to determine the paddy flood vulnerability index considering all growth periods and 3 to perform risk classification based on flood inundation and flood damage as risk is a combination of the likelihood and the impact of an event occurring a comprehensive flood risk map is developed which can serve as a means of communication to all authorities and relevant agencies to evaluate the level of flood risk particularly in paddy cultivation areas 2 material and methods 2 1 study area one of the biggest paddy plantation and production areas in malaysia is located in the sg kedah basin kedah a northern state of the peninsular malaysia as shown in fig 1 this area contributes 38 8 of local paddy production in malaysia che omar et al 2019 and therefore is known as the rice bowl of malaysia it consists of 5 sub basins namely kubang pasu kota setar pendang pokok sena and padang terap the largest paddy production area is located in kota setar and pendang under the management of the muda agricultural development authority mada by muda irrigation scheme did 2011 meanwhile mini granary areas in kubang pasu pokok sena and pedang terap are managed by the department of irrigation and drainage did kedah did 2011 rainfall events in the sg kedah basin are highly influenced by the monsoon seasons this area is expected to receive a significant amount of rainfall at the end of the south west monsoon september inter monsoon months april and october and at the beginning of the north east monsoon november and december the months of january and february are considered to be dry periods for the sg kedah basin 2 2 methodology in general this study utilised secondary data multi criteria analysis and gis to achieve its objectives secondary input data such as rainfall historical flood events flood depths flood duration and river maps were collected from did malaysia geological data such as soil map slope map elevation map and landuse landcover map were collected from the department of survey and mapping malaysia jupem the resolution of the study area is 30 m and the spatial reference is gdm2000 for peninsular malaysia this information was used in preparing all required data for this study such as slope soil type elevation land use land cover distance from river and annual rainfall distribution paddy cropping calendar and map were provided by mada 2020 paddy growth is determined from mada the organisation in the study area responsible for advising the farmers of the most suitable time to start planting paddy fertilize and crop flood occurrence is based on the total monthly rainfall because during the initial stage of a paddy plantation the paddy field needs to be flooded with water to suppress the grass and weeds so that the paddy can grow well as the paddy grows less water is needed therefore planning needs to be performed so that the harvesting season falls in a dry month i e less rainfall the overall methodology is divided into three major steps namely determination of flood susceptibility index fsi determination of paddy flood vulnerability index pfvi and development of paddy flood risk index pfri a flow chart of the methodology is shown in fig 2 each step to establish these indices was validated using historical flood data paddy damage and 100 years of ari data produced by did respectively the calculated indices fsi pfvi and pfri were divided into five colour coded classifications and all these indices were then mapped onto the sg kedah basin map to illustrate their spatial distribution pattern a detailed methodology is given in the following sub sections 2 2 1 selection of susceptibility factors through our extensive literature review e g abu el magd et al 2020 mahmoud and gan 2018a wu et al 2019 we concluded that the following susceptibility factors should be considered in this study namely total annual rainfall slope soil type landuse landcover elevation and distance from the river these parameters were chosen based on studies related to susceptibility vulnerability flood risk and flood index that have been published by other researchers since 2015 these factors are the most prominent elements in determining flood hazards according to our knowledge of the study area and data availability 2 2 1 1 total annual rainfall rainfall is one of the most important input parameters regarding location susceptibility to flooding normally it is included in the development of flood inundation maps through hydrological modelling abdullah et al 2018 2019 choubin et al 2019 total annual rainfall data in this study were collected from 2010 to 2017 from 27 rainfall stations of which 18 stations are located in the sg kedah basin 6 stations in the sg muda basin and 3 stations in perlis to achieve good interpolation these values were then used to develop the classification of total annual rainfall sub factor 2 2 1 2 distance from the river mustafa et al 2018 popa et al 2019 and wang et al 2018 found that distance from the river is another important criterion to be included to determine the flood susceptibility index this is because the volume of the river increases as a result of accumulation of water that will eventually inundate the nearby area quickly the lesser the buffer zone the higher the probability for the area to be exposed to flooding to construct the map the euclidean tool in arcgis desktop 10 3 was used this factor follows the minimum allowable limit of buffer distance of 50 m as stipulated by did malaysia 2 2 1 3 topography conditions all topography related conditions such as slope elevation soil type and landuse landcover are considered in this study slope depends on the rate of change of elevation and flooding is inversely proportional to slope high slope will lessen the accumulation of water within the area since it influences the flow direction and increases the water surface velocity blistanova et al 2016 jato espino et al 2019 reclassification of the slope sub factor was carried out based on past studies abu el magd et al 2020 kazakis et al 2015 ouma and tateishi 2014 with consideration of the current slope at the study area elevation influences the terrain behaviour as a result of the difference in geographic heights it affects the water flow direction from a higher level to a lower level and eventually results in flow accumulation if the terrain is flat in other words this reflects an inverse proportional relationship between elevation and flood events and its reclassification was performed according to past studies abu el magd et al 2020 mahmoud and gan 2018a wu et al 2019 soil type is another important parameter that needs to be considered when developing a flood susceptibility index as it significantly influences the infiltration rate of water arabameri et al 2019 mahmoud and gan 2018a pourghasemi et al 2019 previous studies described soil type using percentage of clay blistanova et al 2016 and infiltration capacity ouma and tateishi 2014 however in this study the soil type is represented by the surface runoff coefficient and how effectively water is drained into the river system this is estimated based on the landuse landcover map as stipulated in chow et al 1988 urban storm water management did 2012 and harley and samantha 2018 changes in landuse landcover will result in a lot of harm rather than good if not managed properly for example urbanisation is one of the most obvious change in landuse landcover jacinto et al 2015 nga et al 2018 and it will alter the infiltration rate and surface runoff due to smooth surfaces from cement as a result of higher soil curve number as paddy fields are normally located downstream near the river delta triet et al 2017 2020 changes in landuse landcover will impose greater vulnerability to paddy fields 2 2 2 development of ahp mcdm model the analytical hierarchy process ahp is a type of decision making model developed by saaty 1984 that recognises a parameter and its priority in a given array according to the expertise knowledge and skill set this method suggests the application of pairwise comparison between parameters numerically ranging from 1 i e equal importance between two parameters to 9 i e one parameter is much more important compared to other parameter to support quantitative decision making the basis of pairwise comparison is to adopt a linear combination and produce a best fit to the weight set by normalizing all the parameters in this study the pairwise comparison is performed based the researchers expert knowledge and further verified using the annual flood reports published by did malaysia the pairwise comparison is checked concurrently with consistency ratio to ensure that it does not exceed the maximum allowable limit of 10 as suggested by ouma and tateishi 2014 once the priority level is determined the sub factor for each parameter was assigned accordingly from highest most influence 5 to the lowest least influence 1 2 2 3 flood susceptibility index fsi the application of ahp mcdm assists in the estimation of fsi through the weightage value given to each parameter in the multi attribute function indices were calculated according to cell attributes in google earth pro ge pro at a bird s eye view elevation of 37 m to get detailed features of the study area colour coded mapping was applied to differentiate the level of susceptibility as listed in table 1 the water level in table 1 refers to the historical flood depth records provided by did malaysia which is a part of the validation analysis validation of fsi was performed based on historical flood data at the study area from 2010 to 2017 with events having flooded from a rainfall intensity of more than 60 mm in more than 4 h duration to ensure that only significant rainfall events were included based on the reported flood occurrence by did malaysia this rainfall intensity and duration were rainfall characteristics that contributed to the inundated area a similar approach has been used by harley and samanta 2018 skilodimou et al 2019 and ghosh et al 2017 2 2 4 selection of paddy flood vulnerability parameter we combined the approaches proposed by triet et al 2018 and wan mohtar et al 2020 to estimate the paddy flood vulnerability index while a guideline prepared by did 2003 was used to evaluate the damage as a result three parameters such as flood depth flood duration and paddy growth were chosen to represent the vulnerability parameters the paddy seed grade was assumed to be the same throughout the study area since the study area has a relatively similar environmental condition this means that throughout the area all paddy growth has roughly the same maturity period of 120 days where the heading period is within 90 days mada 2020 a five point likert scale based score was used to assign each of the vulnerability parameters for the development of the vulnerability index as shown in table 2 definition of the color coded paddy vulnerability index is given in table 3 since the growth period is closely related to paddy age the basis of the growth period will be monthly a higher level of score was given at may june october and november as the heading phase was expected to occur within these months according to the mada paddy schedule also a high score was given to higher flood depths as well as to longer flood durations because it was found to cause higher damage values 2 2 5 paddy flood vulnerability index pfvi pfvi is estimated based on direct damage to paddy production only and the index is calculated based on multi attribute functions with all the parameters having the same weightage value as shown in eq 4 the definition of each level is tabulated in table 3 validation of the pfvi was performed according to the damage factor for paddy cultivation in relation to the water level as stipulated by did 2003 4 direct damage paddy index paddy flood vulnerability index pfvi score m score r score d 3 2 2 6 paddy flood risk index paddy flood risk index was calculated using eq 5 where the product shows the degree of severity given the likelihood of an area to be hazardous the degree of risks was classified into 5 categories namely very low low moderate high and very high paddy risk index as tabulated in table 4 5 pfri fsi i x pfvi i 2 2 7 mapping of indexes fsi pfvi and pfri flood susceptibility maps were developed using arcgis desktop 10 3 to reclassify the parameters according to each sub factor the spatial analyst tool function was used for all the reclassification processes the total annual rainfall distribution map required an additional tool in the software known as the inverse distance weightage idw method to map the rainfall distribution maps of these susceptibility parameters are shown in fig 3 a fig 3 f the flood susceptibility locations were mapped on the sg kedah basin map using google earth ge pro software at a bird s eye view elevation of 37 m the same method was used for the construction of paddy flood vulnerability and paddy flood risk maps using ge pro software notably all locations were mapped in point feature instead of polygon as most of the locations are localised all points were colour coded in green teal yellow orange or red depending on the level of susceptibility vulnerability and risk as defined in table 1 and table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 fsi for the sungai kedah basin the selected susceptibility factors used in this study are total annual rainfall slope soil type elevation distance from river and land use land cover these factors need to be given priority element based on the analytical hierarchy parameter multi criteria decision making ahp mcdm as shown in table 5 the pairwise comparison of flood susceptibility factors for the sg kedah basin was then verified based on consistency ratio cr analysis as suggested by ouma and tateishi 2014 in this study the cr is equivalent to 0 05 which is lower than the acceptable limit of 0 10 saaty 2016 this cr value was selected to give better accuracy and minimise error to ensure that the estimated indices were reliable following this the fsi equation refer to eq 6 was developed according to weightage calculated in the ahp mcdm and decision sub factors of each critical susceptibility factor these parameters are summarised in table 6 6 fsi 0 343 total annual rainfall 0 123 slope 0 134 soil type 0 073 elevation 0 226 distance from river 0 101 landuse land cover fig 4 illustrates the flood susceptibility classes i e from low level to very high level with index values of 2 6 5 0 the majority of the points have fsi values within the moderate level indicated in yellow in fig 4 particularly at kubang pasu kota setar and pendang sub basins however paddy cultivation areas are found to be within low to moderate classes having index values of 1 81 3 4 respectively this can be due to paddy cultivation being located in low terrain and the fact that paddy soils are made up mostly of clay clay tends to hold up water for longer due to its poor permeability network in the soil structure ouma and tateishi 2014 but there is still enough vegetation cover to encourage water storage through infiltration processes unlike those in urban areas gao et al 2020 hence making it favourable to be saturated in a short period of time in addition according to the risk classification it was estimated that the paddy cultivations are exposed to flood depths of 0 25 0 75 m nevertheless it should be noted that the vulnerability and paddy risk vary according to the flood duration and paddy growth apart from that paddy fields are exposed to flood hazards since most of the paddy fields are located at the downstream area and near the main canals which are situated near to rivers as stated earlier the distance to the river is the second highest level of priority vector this condition should be of concern as the distance to the river basin and paddy fields could be within the hazard area and this can potentially place the paddy fields at a vulnerable stage among all flood susceptibility points three locations having red point symbols are in the city centre namely kota setar at alor setar pendang at pendang and jitra at kubang pasu as shown in fig 4 the city centre is developed with roads and buildings where impervious surfaces from cements and smooth surfaces are higher areas as compared to other locations the increase of these surfaces is a result of urbanisation where it increases the surface runoff coefficient shortens the lag time and increases the rising limb of a hydrograph hazarika et al 2015 mahmoud and gan 2018b blue colour symbols show that the areas have low fsi and are subject to low flood susceptibility for instance for pokok sena jabi the area is colour coded in blue as shown in fig 4 this may be due to good landcover that surrounds the area the area is well surrounded by forest on the northern side and agricultural land nearby this good landcover helps to reduce the direct rainfall flow to the land as well as increase the water storage in the soil 3 2 pfvi for the sg kedah basin vulnerability is crucial in flood risk management as it enables the estimation of the level of damage caused by an event the landuse map is usually the main element to determine the vulnerability based on the exposed surface area vulnerability analysis was performed on the paddy production damage factor according to three parameters namely flood depth flood duration and paddy growth all the vulnerable paddy locations were mapped on the sg kedah basin map in points symbols as all the areas are localised as shown in fig 5 the vulnerability of the paddy to flooding is more concentrated on the northern side of kota setar to the river mouth of the sg kedah river namely paddy cultivation near kampung bohor kampung anak bukit kampung darat and kepala batas also on northern side of pendang paddy cultivation near kampung banggol besi kampung bukit raya dalam pendang kampung perupok alor punti kampung lahar tunjung and kampung dalam baroh in padang terap the majority of paddy cultivation that is susceptible to flooding is within kampung alor kampung kubang panjang kampung petani as for kubang pasu the exposed paddy cultivation areas are located near kampung paya nongmi changlun kampung bukit kampung padang kampung darat kampung binjai city centre of jitra taman melur and kampung hilir meanwhile there are fewer paddy locations in pokok sena that are exposed to flooding events namely located at kampung yoi nearby sungai nawa and taman puteri in addition this study confirms the findings found by hadi et al 2017 that the areas along the rivers and within the kota setar are the most vulnerable areas compared to other sub basins according to the risk classification areas with pfvi values between 1 0 and 3 4 indicate that the flood depth at paddy cultivation is roughly 0 25 0 75 m only and this results in 30 37 of paddy damage respectively the majority of paddy cultivation is exposed to flood events in october and november when it is said to be within the most vulnerable paddy growth period however due to the short flood duration the paddy damage is not severe all green point areas experienced flood durations that lasted 2 3 days maximum as well as flood depth less than 0 25 m meanwhile those areas having paddy flood vulnerability in yellow indicate that the flood depth is 0 5 0 75 m and flood duration of more than 5 days this resulted in slightly higher paddy damage as compared to green points due to a longer period of flood duration and flood depth this damage rank also proves the level of ineffectiveness of the flood mitigation in place rather than widening the river perhaps local authorities can consider other flood mitigation such as dikes park et al 2020 or closing a sluice gate to safeguard the paddy cultivations this study disagrees with the findings of shrestha et al 2016 which stated that paddy damage only occurs in vegetation or maturing phases when water reaches over 0 2 m or 0 5 m respectively this is because this study found that throughout the period of paddy growth in flood depths of more than 0 25 m the paddy cultivation potentially risks losses of 30 37 however the exact details of flood indicators flood duration and flood depth that will result in a total loss is missing in this study further study can be performed to evaluate the factors that influence the total loss of rice production current damage in this study only accounts for direct damage of rice production however a study performed by nga et al 2018 found that the intangible risks are 1 5 2 5 times higher as opposed to direct tangible elements such risks include business interruption cost of repair and clean up and environmental pollution following this the actual paddy damage can be more severe than the estimated damage as most of the farmers rely heavily on the rice production profits ghosh et al 2019 specifically for paddy the consideration of inundation depth that corresponds to the paddy damage for different areas is also important previous research such as wassmann et al 2019 chung et al 2019 nga et al 2018 and triet et al 2018 found that the paddy at their study area was facing shortfall when water depth exceeds 0 4 m in fact shrestha et al 2016 discovered that this damage occurs in the ripening phase and during the vegetation phase when inundated water depth of more than 0 2 m will start to result in low grain quality yet rehan et al 2020 found that paddy damage will only occur for inundation depths of more than 2 0 m at any stage of paddy growth thus it can be said that the level of inundation is unique to its specific location and paddy seed varieties this shows that it is best to have a wide range of hazard classification to evaluate the level of severity clearly 3 3 paddy flood risk in paddy cultivation for the sg kedah basin the overall paddy flood risk index for extreme rainfall in the sg kedah basin is within the very low to moderate classes as only 3 colour coded points are found in fig 6 these locations are coded in green blue and yellow this means that the damage factor is between 30 and 37 one area in kubang pasu known as changlun and two locations in pendang alor punti and kampung perupok have an average damage factor of 35 37 slightly higher than the rest as shown in fig 6 this is due to the flood event that occurred in 2012 that lasted for more than 5 days and cause inundation of 0 5 0 7 m in the paddy cultivation it was reported that around 17 2 ha of paddy cultivation was damaged due to the event did 2013 this finding supported the calculated pfri estimated in this study the paddy cultivation areas having yellow coded points indicate paddy areas experiencing a higher risk of flooding compared to other paddy areas the paddy flood risk indices were within 1 15 4 very low risk to moderate risk with higher distributions of index level at 5 81 10 6 low risk information on risk classification is important in flood risk assessment as it can provide information on the locations that are at risk of flooding so that appropriate flood mitigation can be implemented park et al 2020 it can also evaluate the existing condition of the area whether the current control measures are satisfactory or require an additional soft structure and hard engineering measure chan et al 2018 based on the paddy flood risk map most of the paddy cultivation at risk is located within kota setar and pendang local authorities can use this information to plan for river or drainage divergence and for suitable pathways to improve this situation resulting from landuse landcover change due to the expansion of urbanisation in the upstream zhou et al 2019 since we know that the monsoon floods have a high potential to impact paddy cultivation mada should review the existing paddy calendar so that the most vulnerable period of paddy growth will not encounter flood events and cause paddy production loss by changing the paddy calendar one should also take into consideration future climate change so that the condition of paddy cultivation will be sustainable changing the fertilizer is another option for instance the fertilizer that is more tolerant to being submerged in water can be used during the rainy or wet season xin et al 2020 found that nutrient use management is one of the vital contributing factors to increasing gpp rice yield in northern china the paddy flood risk assessment was performed in this study also provides an important aspect in the development for crop insurance schemes as it successfully delineates those impacted areas that face natural disasters such as flood events triet et al 2018 a comprehensive flood management policy can be initiated by the government based on the structure of flood risk assessment performed in this study where it integrates past flood events in the flood risk assessment and the current conditions of the study area akter et al 2018 having support from the government to initiate such a policy gives some reassurance to the farmers to continue working in the agricultural industry 3 4 validation of paddy flood risk index mapping this task was performed to validate the accuracy of pfri results estimated from the methodology proposed in this study since the main concern of this study is related to flood the researchers validated the pfri using an estimated distribution of water depth for 100 year average recurrence interval ari flood map prepared by did as shown in fig 7 in hydrology the 100 year ari flood map is often used to represent a major event and also the worst case scenario as the probability of the storm event occurring is 1 in 100 years the 100 year flood map as presented in fig 7 is developed from an integrated numerical hydraulic and hydrologic modelling exercise performed by did although the present study was validated using historical data from 2010 to 2017 the water depth for the 100 year ari map prepared by did is still acceptable as the flood which occurred in 2010 was the worst flood event that has happen up until today the parameters used in this modelling exercise include hydrological data such as storm events rainfall duration and rainfall intensity and physical characteristics of the basin such as slope digital elevation model dem river network land use and soil type therefore it can be seen that the parameters used in the hydraulic hydrologic model is very similar to the development of pfri except that the hydraulic hydrologic modelling exercise requires a long process of data preparation and model performance evaluation i e calibration and validation are strictly event based it does not take into account the paddy cropping calendar which is vital to ensure maximum productivity of paddy that leads to sustainable food security with reference to fig 7 the flood depths are generally categorised into 3 major classes i e minor impact 0 01 m slight water overtopping from the river medium impact 0 5 m limited road accessibility especially for small and medium sized vehicles and major impact 1 2 m equivalent to almost half of one storey building it can be seen that the major impacts are mostly concentrated near the river the paddy areas are mostly located further in land and therefore the impact is low to moderate these results are similar to the risk level estimated by pfri this shows that the methodology to estimate paddy flood risk index pfri developed in this study are acceptable and supported by recorded historical flood events in the study area 4 conclusions currently the flood inundation depths and damage estimation at paddy cultivation areas are highly dependent on integrated hydraulic hydrological modelling that concentrates more on event based simulations and this exercise can be expensive in terms of cost labour and time taken to complete the task as flood occurrences at paddy cultivation areas pose a serious threat as it may threat food security of a country a more rigorous and comprehensive method that considers the paddy growth stages in the risk assessment is needed therefore this study presents a novel methodology to estimate the flood risk at paddy cultivations known as the paddy flood risk index pfri that combines flood susceptibility fsi and paddy flood vulnerability pfvi indices the developed methodology uses the ahp mcdm approach that takes into consideration the critical susceptibility factors of the study area namely total annual rainfall slope soil type elevation distance from river and land use land cover the proposed methodology is able to estimate pfri that provides a vital information on detailed hazard classification all paddy growth period and a combination of crucial factors namely flood inundation and damage which indicate the likelihood and impact of an event to occur the initial finding reveals that the paddy cultivation areas in the sg kedah basin are estimated to be exposed to flood depths ranging between 0 25 25 m and 0 75 m it should be noted that vulnerability and paddy flood risk vary according to the flood duration and paddy growth period the pfvi analysis shows that this flood depth may result in paddy damage ranging between 30 and 37 respectively the majority of paddy cultivation is exposed to flood events in october and november within the most vulnerable paddy growth period but due to the flood duration not being extensive the paddy damage is not severe these areas that are within low level experienced flood durations that lasted 2 3 days and the flood depth of less than 0 25 0 5 m this study concluded that the overall paddy flood risk index for the sg kedah basin is within the very low to moderate class most vulnerable are paddy cultivation areas in kota setar and pendang as these locations are located on relatively very flat terrain many improvements and management plans can be made available based on the findings of this study for example local authorities can use this information to improve drainage conditions and land use planning additionally since we know that the monsoon floods have a high possibility to impact paddy cultivation mada may implement several management best practises in paddy cultivation such as reviewing the existing paddy calendar using high quality and high resistance paddy varieties and planning the most efficient fertilizer that is best suited to the natural conditions of the study area the methodology developed in this study enables any stakeholder and interested parties to clearly determine the flood extent and its impact on the paddy cultivation area more importantly the proposed methodology enables the quantification of fsi pfvi and pfri using local conditions input data detailed hazard classification paddy growth period and a combination of crucial factors namely flood inundation and damage the proposed method can be adopted by researchers around the globe by using data collected from their study area such as topography and hydrological characteristics paddy growth based on their seed variety and historical flood records credit authorship contribution statement adilah anuar

7708,study region the pyrenees study focus the pyrenees is sensitive to changes in climate both natural and of anthropic origin and changes in land use and cover lulc these changes can influence the water resources the historical evolution 1980 2013 of the stream flows are studied using observed time series from non influenced gauging stations and two models saser and swat their comparison helps to detect and analyze changes in flow rates and their trends trends are computed using the sen s slope estimator the significance of which was evaluated using the mann kendall test furthermore it also allows to explore the question of attribution these models do not simulate lulc change new hydrological insights for the region a complex and diverse domain such as the pyrenees gives large differences between modelled trends revealing a large uncertainty that has been observed thanks to the use of two models for the study period mostly there are no significant trends when trends are present in the observations and are also simulated they are attributed to the effects of climate natural variability and human induced climate change when the significant trends observed are not simulated by the models they are mainly attributed to changes in lulc in general models have difficulties detecting observed trends leading to their attribution to changes in lulcs rather than climate but there are some notable exceptions graphical abstract ga1 keywords pyrenees stream flow trends hydrological modeling climate variability land use land cover data availability the links and doe of data are in the manuscript 1 introduction the pyrenees which extends from the atlantic to the mediterranean is particularly sensitive to changes in climate due to both natural variability and human induced climate change as well as to changes in land use and land cover lulc this territory is the primary source of water resources for a vast region in southern france and north east spain feeding the runoff and recharge zones of the region s main catchment basins ebro adour garonne environmental changes can influence the availability of water resources adding uncertainty to an already difficult water management situation due to high demand and variable supply which can result in water scarcity situations that can last several years several authors described the climate during the last decades in the pyrenees including morán tejeda et al 2017 who found that increasing temperatures are responsible for a lesser accumulation of snow over time lópez moreno et al 2020 noted a snow cover decline pérez zanón et al 2017 described the temperature trends in the central pyrenees lemus canovas et al 2019 described a statistically significant tendency towards a decrease in precipitation and vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2006 noted an increase in winter drought conditions in the eastern pyrenees thus in this climate change context it is especially important to assess possible changes in the water cycle particularly in surface flows as stressed by several authors garcía ruiz et al 2001 and lópez moreno et al 2011 detected a statistically significant decrease in the annual river contributions to the central south pyrenees and the ebro basin respectively likewise zabaleta et al 2019 detected a downward trend during all seasons in the basins close to the bay of biscay western pyrenees although in the last 20 years the average discharge increased in winter and spring in the french side of the pyrenees le treut 2013 reported a discharge decrease of 25 30 in the garonne river and lespinas et al 2010 and labrousse et al 2020 detected downward annual streamflow trends in the northern coastal mediterranean rivers stahl et al 2010 also detected decreasing streamflow trends in two northern pyrenean basins for the period 1952 2004 in addition to climatic circumstances non climatic factors such as changes in land use can also strongly affect river flows beguería et al 2003 estimated that 25 of streamflow decrease was caused by revegetation during the period 1945 1995 in the south central pyrenees likewise gallart and llorens 2003 estimated that 30 of the streamflow decrease in the ebro basin during the period 1945 1995 was due to an increase in evapotranspiration similarly buendia et al 2016 ascribed the streamflow decrease to the combined action of climate change and afforestation in three sub basins of the southern eastern pyrenees for the period 1987 2009 finally lópez moreno et al 2006 and vicente serrano et al 2021 also studied the predominantly negative streamflow trends in the central southern pyrenees and ascribed them to a combination of climate change and afforestation the main method for describing the hydrological regime of watercourses is by means of gauging station streamflow records when these records cover a sufficient period of time and are supplemented with tools such as hydrological modeling they can also be used to evaluate quantify and interpret possible hydrological changes over time as well as trends in water resource availability long time series several decades to study climate trends are needed to discern if the cause of the observed changes is due to natural variability or anthropic climate change however to separate the effects of lulc and those of climate without discriminating between natural and human induced changes in climate does not need time series as long at least in the pyrenees where the abandonment of agricultural areas has been rather fast lasanta et al 2021 hydrological modeling helps to understand the underlying processes by simulating variables that are difficult or impossible to observe such as soil moisture snowpack dynamics or land evaporation modeling also allows performing numerical experiments impossible to conduct in the real world such as fixing land use to assess the impacts of climate change only quintana seguí et al 2021 however all those valuable contributions are subjected to model uncertainty an issue that should not be neglected and thus be carefully assessed model uncertainty can be due to the model structure how the physical processes have been represented in the model and also due to the physiography which often is fixed in models while it changes in time in the real basin the objective of this study is to evaluate if models that correctly simulate the streamflow of the pyrenees in terms of kge are able to correctly simulate the observed streamflow trends this article characterizes the recent evolution 1980 2013 of river streamflow in the pyrenees analyzing streamflow time series of several gauging stations and compare them with model simulations two hydrological models saser and swat are used with different complexity and operating principles to analyze the uncertainty arising from the assumptions and errors of the models themselves and estimate the confidence in the results the agreement and disagreement of the models with the observations and between them enriches the discussion of the observed streamflow evolution and the attribution of the possible changes which can have climatic or non climatic origins i e lulc as well as the detection and quantification of the main sources of uncertainty in this case the time period studied is short and thus unable to disentangle the effects of the natural variability of climate due to decadal to centennial oscillations but it is enough to disentangle the effects of climate which affects both models and reality and lulc which is not simulated by these models 1 1 study area the pyrenees has a rugged relief that stretches approximately 415 kilometers from west to east from the atlantic ocean to the mediterranean sea and 150 kilometers wide along its north south axis it encompasses the basins of the ebro river which flows into the mediterranean sea the adour and the garonne rivers which flow into the atlantic ocean as well as all other smaller basins surrounding them fig 1 this singular geographical configuration confers the region a great climatic diversity giving the pyrenees a high environmental value the hydrographic network is characterized by numerous watercourses which generally adopt a north south disposition although some stretches are aligned in a west east direction in addition the pyrenees as a natural water tower is the major source of water resources to the surrounding regions providing the water needs of more than 15 million people and supplying electricity and irrigation water to a vast territory the climatic water balance difference between annual precipitation and atmospheric moisture demand in the pyrenees is essentially positive suggesting an absence of aridity and a clear water surplus with values above 1000 mm per year in most of the area especially near the watersheds and on the northern slope on the other hand the adjacent plains show much lower and even negative values most notably to the south therefore the rivers descending from the pyrenees are the main source of water resources in these surrounding areas annual precipitation presents important contrasts ranging between 500 and 3000 mm per year precipitation is spatially distributed according to a west east gradient which is related to the generation of precipitation by the humid atlantic air masses also there is the altitudinal gradient with increasing precipitation as altitude increases thus the maximum annual precipitation values are concentrated on the atlantic coast while the lowest values are found towards the mediterranean and in the interior depressions and foothills on the northern slope moreover the atlantic influence extends from the piedmont zone to the central sector increasing the mediterranean influence towards the piedmont zones and towards the east the seasonal rainfall regime has a very pronounced minimum in the summer months and a secondary minimum in winter the maximums occur in autumn and spring there are however important differences between sectors with a gradient again appearing from west to east thus in the westernmost valleys the most important maximum is in autumn while the spring maximum is secondary on the other hand in the eastern valleys the main maximum is the spring one while the autumn maximum is less pronounced there are also differences in the minimums since towards the west the main minimum occurs in summer while in the easternmost valleys the winter minimum is more pronounced the transition between the two regimes occurs gradually as the atlantic influence leads way to the mediterranean one in this work the pyrenees is divided into 8 sectors fig 1 and table 1 according to geographical and water management criteria the ebro basin is the largest of the pyrenees and collects water from the western to the eastern part of the mountain range so it is subdivided into 3 parts western web central ceb and eastern eeb ebro tributaries on the other hand the little basins in the cantabrian area are grouped in a single region can as well as the basins in the southeastern pyrenees internal catalan basins icb and the northeastern basin neb the adour and the garonne basins are each one a region ado and gar respectively 2 data and methods 2 1 datasets to achieve the objectives observational data is needed to validate the models and assess the actual trends beyond this data meteorological forcing data state of the atmosphere at each instant and physiographic information topography soil texture vegetation cover land use etc are also needed to feed the models all datasets used are presented and described below 2 1 1 hydrological data observations the region under study comprises three countries andorra france and spain and different administrative and management entities are involved in the administration of water resources streamflow data from these entities is collected harmonized and merged into a unique daily streamflow dataset named piragua indicators zabaleta et al 2022 not all the available data from gauging stations present in the study area were eligible to study streamflow evolution and trends the main criteria to make the final selection of gauging stations are 1 be in a natural or semi natural regime e g not influenced by dams or significant water extraction 2 do not present an altered hydrological regime e g maximum flows in august 3 do not have abrupt changes in their time series 4 have more than 20 years of data and do not have important gaps such as complete year gaps from this preliminary work a set of 67 quality time series from near natural gauging stations geographically dispersed across the study area fig 1 2 1 2 meteorological data the hydrological models were driven with a common forcing dataset the piragua atmos analysis dataset quintana seguí 2022 it is a meteorological dataset based on safran système d analyse fournissant des renseignements atmosphériques à la neige durand et al 1993 1999 that produces gridded datasets of screen level meteorological variables by combining the outputs of a meteorological model and all available observations using an optimal interpolation algorithm safran has been extensively used in france e g le moigne et al 2020 quintana seguí et al 2008 vidal et al 2010 and more recently it has also been applied in spain quintana seguí et al 2016 2017 tunicia tramblay et al 2019 and moroco moucha et al 2020 piragua atmos analysis was performed by taking the results of the optimal interpolation step of the french and spanish safran datasets and doing the final step of interpolation anew using a common grid that covers the study area enlarged pyrenees including all the basins that drain the range fig 2 the result is a gridded dataset of temperature precipitation relative humidity and wind speed that covers the area limited by 370000 m and 1085000 m in the y axis and 4465000 m and 5080000 m in the meridional axis according to the utm projection etrs89 datum 30 n epsg 25830 with a spatial resolution of 2 5 km and hourly time resolution 2 1 3 radiation data era5 ecmwf hersbach et al 2018 was used for radiation when creating piragua atmos analysis from safran spain and safran france because radiation values were not consistent with each other era5 covers the earth on a 0 25 resolution grid these data have been interpolated to the same grid as the piragua atmos analysis dataset 2 1 4 other data additional input data was required for simulations of the region such as topography and land cover which were obtained from several sources table 2 it should be noted as it will be relevant for the discussion of the results that these parameters are considered constant in time during the simulations 2 2 hydrological modeling as mentioned above this work used the results of the two hydrological models saser and swat over the pyrenees for the period 1981 2010 which are grouped in a dataset named piragua hydro analysis beguería et al 2022 these two models present different complexity and operational principles allowing to evaluate the results uncertainty and confidence level and both have been applied to several case studies and have a proven track record including choudhary and athira 2021 cui et al 2021 datok et al 2021 and olaoye et al 2021 for swat and guinaldo et al 2021 tóth and szintai 2021 and vural et al 2021 for surfex a brief introduction to these models is given here but for more details about the theory and implementation the reader is directed to their web pages http www umr cnrm fr surfex last access 13 12 2022 and https swat tamu edu last access 13 12 2022 2 2 1 saser the full modeling platform saser safran surfex eaudysee rapid is formed by a meteorological dataset based on safran already presented above the land surface model surfex rapid and eau dysee which will be introduced below the saser term will be used throughout this work following previous examples bhuiyan et al 2018 gaona et al 2022 quintana seguí et al 2020 2 2 2 surfex surfex surface externalisée is météo france s surface modeling platform le moigne et al 2020 masson et al 2013 it is a physical and fully distributed land surface model using a regular grid and computes the hydric and energy balance in continental surfaces for natural soils surfex uses the isba interaction sol biosphère atmosphère land surface scheme noilhan and mahfouf 1996 noilhan and planton 1989 the isba scheme calculates the surface energy and water budgets over natural areas there are different versions of isba but isba dif is used in this study which is the multi layer diffusion version boone et al 2000 habets et al 2003 surfex lacks a native routing scheme but it can use rapid routing application for parallel computation of discharge david cédric h 2013 as a routing model and the connection between surfex and rapid being eau dysée both tools are described below 2 2 3 rapid since surfex has no river routing scheme rapid david et al 2011 is chosen to do this rapid transfers surfex s total runoff surface and subsurface or drainage from the surfex grid cells to the river cells using its own isochrony algorithm then rapid uses a matrix based version of the muskingum method to calculate flow and volume of water for each reach of a river network as the current setup cannot simulate dams canals or irrigation the resulting river flows are estimations of the natural system that is the system without direct human intervention in the form of irrigation or hydraulic infrastructures such as dams or canals 2 2 4 eau dyssée eau dyssée is a framework that couples hydrological models flipo et al 2012 saleh et al 2011 in this case surfex and rapid managing the different space and time scales and exchanging the appropriate variables between them 2 2 5 swat swat soil and water assessment tool douglas mankin et al 2010 is a semi distributed basin scale time continuous hydrological model supported by the usda agricultural research service the minimum requirements for swat include topographic land use land cover soil and climate data as swat simulates at the basin scale the study area was divided into 20 basins fig 3 and in turn as a semi distributed model the catchment was divided into sub basins which are further divided into hydrological response units hrus which are homogeneous units of land use soil type and slope the basin discretization into sub basins is based on the catchment areas as defined in the european system directive 2000 60 ec these sub basin limits coincide with the gauging stations where the calibration validation and model analysis should be carried out the swat system as a conceptual model requires calibration and validation the corresponding time periods were model initialization warm up 1980 1985 calibration 1986 2005 and validation 2006 2013 the sensitive parameters were identified and calibrated using the literature of the region biancamaria et al 2019 cakir et al 2020 grusson et al 2015 2017a 2017b 2018 martin et al 2016 the main calibration target was objective function kge optimization for this the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm abbaspour et al 2004 was used because this method identifies an optimal parameter set in a limited number of iterations yang et al 2008 the calibration was made in 2 stages first a calibration with all stations together to find a general equilibrium of the sensitive parameters over all basins the second stage consisted of a separate calibration of those stations where the simulation performance was insufficient to adapt the calibration to the local particularities once the swat model was calibrated and validated the resulting parameters and configuration was applied to the full period 1980 2013 to compare the models results with observed streamflow series from the gauging stations due to the system requiring an initialization period the first five years of data 1980 1985 were artificially replicated to apply them to the period 1975 1979 and ensure a modeling period from 1980 to 2013 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 goodness of fit the performance of the simulated daily streamflow time series was evaluated using the non parametric variant of the kling gupta efficiency test kgenp pool et al 2018 this statistic considers different types of model errors namely the error in the mean the variability and the dynamics pool et al 2018 the calculation of kge standard parametric version is implicitly based on the assumptions of data linearity data normality and the absence of outliers but the streamflow time series do not necessarily follow these assumptions for this reason the non parametric version of kge is used in this study 1 kge np 1 r s 1 2 α np 1 2 β 1 2 2 α np 1 1 2 k 1 n q sim i k n q sim q obs j k n q obs 3 β μ sim μ obs 4 r s i 1 n r obs i r obs r sim i r sim i 1 n r obs i r obs 2 i 1 n r sim i r sim 2 the function is computed from three parameters the spearman s rank correlation as an indicator of general goodness of fit rs where robs and rsim are the ranks of the observed and simulated discharge time series respectively the normalized flow duration curve fdc as an indicator of discharge variability where i k and j k are the time steps when the kth largest flow occurs within the simulated and observed time series respectively and the quotient of the means division as an indicator of bias β the kgenp ranges from infinity kgenp 1 0 being kgenp 1 0 the perfect agreement between simulations and observations there is no benchmark from which a simulation is considered good or bad knoben et al 2019 although knoben et al 2019 consider that the model has predictive capacity if kgenp between the observations and the simulation is greater than the kgenp between the observations and their mean the python package hydroeval hallouin 2021 was used to compute the kgenp on the other hand the simulations made with swat need to be calibrated and validated therefore the kgenp can only be applied to the validation period consequently the kgenp for the swat simulations were calculated for the period 2006 2013 this is not the case for saser because it does not need calibration therefore the validation between observations and simulation could be performed over the whole modeled period 1980 2013 to make kgenp comparable the 2006 2013 period for both models is used 2 3 2 trend calculation daily time series of observations and simulations were transformed to monthly and seasonal descriptive statistics quantiles q10 q50 q90 and annual time series the statistics q10 q50 and q90 are chosen which are the thresholds that are not surpassed during 10 50 or 90 of the time respectively as proxies for low q10 medium q50 and high q90 flows these statistics were calculated for both of the study periods 1980 2013 period and 1990 2013 period and for all gauging stations to evaluate their trends over time the existence of a trend in a time series can be detected by several statistical tests bayazit 2015 the sen s slope estimator sen 1968 is used is this study assuming a linear trend over time the significance of the trends was assessed with the rank based non parametric mann kendall test mk mann 1945 which is the most widely used for trend analysis in hydrology before the test a pre whitening of the series is applied using the collaud coen et al 2020 methodology and vogt 2021 software library which involves three pre whitening methods the purpose of pre whitening is to eliminate from the analysis the influence of likely temporal autocorrelation in the data which would cause inflation of the statistical significance values and therefore generate a higher than expected number of false positives mk is applied on the pre whitened series at the 95 significance level p 0 05 2 3 3 graphical representation of trends as an aid to the interpretation of the trends a graphical representation of the trends is designed fig 4 the plot represents points on a two dimensional plane where the x axis and y axis correspond to the value of observed and simulated trends respectively therefore there will be two points for each observed trend one for saser filled symbol in fig 4 and one for swat empty symbol in fig 4 these two symbols are joined by a vertical line representing a proxy of the simulations uncertainty the shape of the symbol represents the statistic q10 is a circle q50 is a square and q90 is a star the color of the symbol represents the statistical significance fig 4 being gray when there is none red when both observations and simulations are significant blue when observations are statistically significant but simulations have no statistical significance and green when the observations and swat have statistical significance and yellow when the observations and saser have statistical significance points in the quadrant delimited by the upper right continuous gray lines represent positive trends in both observations and simulations equivalent to tp of m while points in the lower left quadrant represent negative trends in both observations and simulations equivalent to tn of m in these two cases the closer to the dashed line the more similar is the slope of the simulations and the observations on the other hand the fp of m are in the upper left quadrant and the fn are in the lower right quadrant 3 results 3 1 simulation performance the validation results are summarized in fig 5 regarding the validation of saser at the daily time step and considering the criteria previously established in the methodology more than 89 of the simulations had a better skill than the one obtained using the mean of the time series with a median value of kgenp 0 44 this percentage increased with swat reaching over 98 with a median of kgenp 0 51 at the seasonal level the median performance ranged between 0 39 summer to 0 55 winter for saser and between 0 46 autumn to 0 64 spring for swat the saser kgenp is better than using the mean in more than 77 winter cases being the maximum 92 summer for swat the kgenp ranged between 0 46 autumn to 0 64 spring with the best results in winter and spring 98 and the worst in autumn 91 considering months the percentages ranged between 70 sep to 92 jul for saser and between 58 sep to 97 dec jan and jun for swat with median kgenp ranging between 0 17 aug to 0 58 nov for saser and between 0 08 aug to 0 64 jan for swat going back to the annual scores one sees that the rs discharge dynamics indicator ranged between 0 05 and 0 97 for saser and between 0 52 and 0 95 for swat in most cases there is a moderate to strong positive association in both models although in swat there are 5 out of 1139 cases with negative values the values discharge variability of observations and simulations ranged between 0 98 and 0 38 this indicates short discharge variability between simulations and observations in contrast unlike the two previous parameters β values showed clear differences between models saser values ranged between 58 0 and 0 1 while for swat ranged between 9 7 and 0 1 fig 5 therefore the β parameter was the one that most clearly conditioned the final kgenp value and is the one that made swat models give better overall skill although it should be noted that during simulations saser conserves all the simulated water but swat can calibrate a variable that determines the amount of water that quits the system through deep percolation and thus determines the discharged volume β in general the best fits between observations and simulations were obtained in winter and spring while the worst fits were during summer and autumn table 3 this is expected as hydrogeology plays a more relevant role in sustaining streamflow during summer and this was not simulated by the models table 3 summarizes the results by region the best scores were found in the western pyrenees ado and can areas for the 2 models while the worst were located in the eeb and neb table 3 these regions have a marked mediterranean character and it is known that these models perform worse in a mediterranean context merheb et al 2016 looking seasonally the highest values are found in all basins in winter and spring and the lowest are in summer for saser and autumn for swat the only exception is the eeb which had lowest values in winter and maximum values in summer the worst values were in september and august the highest values were more dispersed and in general were found in the winter months djf therefore a spatial and temporal distribution of the kgenp can be seen with higher values in wetter areas and lower values in drier areas with dry months showing the worst values and wetter months showing the best values thus the models work better in the wetter climates and for the rainier seasons because they simulate rainfall runoff processes better except the extreme ones than the always more complex hydrogeology that is predominant in summer 3 2 comparing time periods focusing on the 1980 2013 time period fig 6 for a detailed representation see supplementary material out of the 804 measurements for all the gauging stations for 4 seasons and the 3 statistics q10 q50 and q90 89 8 of the observed time series do not have significant trends considering only the 82 observed significant trends 76 8 of these did not achieve statistical significance in the simulations by either model 20 7 were captured by swat but not by saser mainly in the q50 and only 1 2 were simulated by saser and not by swat observed trends with statistical significance simulated by both models represent 1 2 also the season with the least statistically significant trends is winter 11 and the one with the most is autumn 33 while spring and summer have similar values 27 and 29 respectively the quantile with the highest number of significant trends was q50 39 followed by q10 38 and finally q90 23 therefore the conclusion is that the simulations had poor skill in predicting the significant observed streamflow trends during 1980 2013 period similarly during the 1990 2013 time period 89 2 of the observed time series showed no significant trends fig 7 for a detailed representation see supplementary material taking into account only the significant trends 58 6 of these were not simulated with statistical significance by either model 13 8 were captured by swat but not by saser and 9 2 were simulated by saser and not by swat observed trends with statistical significance simulated by both models represented 18 4 also the season with the least observed significant trends is spring 14 9 and the one with the most is autumn 46 while winter and summer have similar values 20 7 and 18 4 respectively the statistical parameter with the highest number of significant trends is q10 43 7 followed by q50 41 4 and finally q90 14 9 the simulations again showed poor skill in predicting the observed streamflow trends during this period 3 3 seasonal distribution of the trends during autumn figs 6 and 7 for a detailed temporal and regional distribution of the trends see supplementary material the observations show a clear negative significant trend signal throughout the pyrenees this is especially true for the eastern part eeb and icb where the simulations show these trends in the 1990 2013 period as for the western parts simulated significant trends appear in this period during september in web for q90 fig 8 and october in gar for q10 fig 9 throughout winter figs 6 and 7 the observations and simulations in the south eastern areas eeb and icb have negative significant trends in the 1990 2013 period this is in contrast to the trends observed during this season in the western sectors can and web where they can be positive in this period especially in february s q90 spring is the season with more variability presenting positive and negative significant trends there is no clear pattern in the 1980 2013 period but in general terms it is observed that observations from the northern half have negative significant trends which are not simulated while in the southern sector web ceb and eeb they have positive significant trends the icb sector does not mainly present significant trends but when the observations have significant trends these are negative for the 1990 2013 period northern sectors do not mostly present significant trends except for can that shows them as well as the southern slope positive significant trends in the observations which are also simulated in the can and web fig 10 the significant trends distribution in summer shows negative values in observations affecting the mediterranean basins mainly cne and icb but also the eastern gauging stations of eeb and gar for the 1990 2013 period the northern half with the exception of those already mentioned has hardly any significant trend and the observed in the southern slope despite having some positive values are mostly negative overall the sectors most affected by negative significant trends are located in the mediterranean area especially the southern slope with negative values in all seasons with peaks in autumn and winter on the contrary the sectors less affected by negative significant trends are those located in the northern slope except for neb that even have positive significant trends in march in can this allows to see a distribution of trends by slope on the east west axis finding the extremes in icb and can 3 4 distribution of the trends by statistics q10 that is the low flows is the statistic that presents more significant trends followed by q50 and finally q90 mostly in the autumn months this distribution holds whether or not the trend has been correctly reproduced by the models i e when the significant trend has been observed and simulated the statistic with more significant trends is still q10 followed by q50 and q90 also in autumn regarding the monthly distributions of quantiles fig 11 a major number of negative significant trends in q10 low flows are in october this distribution is observable in both periods 1980 2013 and 1990 2013 as well as in observations and both simulations on the other hand positive trends are remarkable at february march and especially april for the q90 high flows in the 1990 2013 period this distribution is not so marked in the simulations as in the observations 3 5 attributions of the trends streamflow trends can arise from a number of causal factors but the attribution is not trivial there are different combinations of situations depending on whether the trends can be observed and or simulated the most common scenario in this study is when there are not statistically significant trends in either observations or simulations fig 12b in principle this should be interpreted as that there is no real increase or decrease in the river flow trend however it could be that there is a very subtle trend that is masked by noise or that the method used to calculate the trend is not adequate to capture it the easiest scenario to interpret is when significant trends are detected in both observations and simulations in this case this trend is attributed to the climate i e eeb in september for the 1990 2013 period shown in fig 12a because the models which have fixed parameters and physiography can only produce trends due to climate factors however there will always be a difference between the observed and simulated values due to model limitations or to other non climatic factors affecting the observed trends that are not simulated by the models e g web in september for the 1990 2013 period january of neb in the 1990 2013 period the distance between simulated trend values red lines joining symbols in fig 12a is a measure of model uncertainty the greater the distance the greater the uncertainty of the simulations another case is the existence of significant trends in the observations but not in the simulations fig 12c in this situation it is assumed that these trends as being due to non climatic causes which cannot be simulated by the models with stationary parameters these non climatic causes can be changes in land use reforestation of agricultural fields changes in infiltration due to human infrastructures etcetera there is a final situation when the observed significant trends are simulated only by one of the models either swat or saser in this case the situation is not easy to interpret this situation is probably caused by differences in model structure these are nonlinear models which may have many threshold effects thus it may happen that one model starts exhibiting a trend earlier than the other one depending on thresholds being surpassed finally it should be noted that both models used the same meteorological forcing thus errors in the meteorological forcing are propagated to both models in an equal manner if observed climate trends are not correctly reproduced by the forcing dataset the models will not be able to simulate them discussion and conclusions this study allowed to quantify the trends of streamflow statistics low medium and high flows of pyrenean rivers it has been done both in observed and simulated time series which have been computed using two very different hydrological models with the aim of analyzing how models with fixed physiography and very different structure simulate trends in this area of study the first and most important result is that most of the time series did not present statistically significant trends over the period 1980 2013 probably due to the high variability of the climate of the region which makes trend detection more difficult in such a relatively short time span then observations and models do not always reproduce the same trends the models do not show good skill in reproducing the observed trends interpreting these differences is not always easy however non simulated observed trends can be attributed to the parameters which are considered constant in the models mainly lulc which was considered static in the two models it is well known that the pyrenees has undergone major changes in land use and land cover since the mid 20th century changes that have continued during the current century although probably at a slower rate beguería et al 2003 buendia et al 2016 gallart and llorens 2004 2003 lópez moreno et al 2006 vicente serrano et al 2021 these changes are mostly due to the abandonment of non mechanizable or not very productive agricultural fields on the slopes of the pyrenees the abandoned lands have been artificially or naturally forested leading to an increase in rainfall interception and evapotranspiration among other changes if trends are observed in both simulations and observations they are mainly attributed to climate natural variability and anthropic causes without ruling out other sources that may affect the magnitude of the simulated trends autumn is the season more affected by trends in the climate forcing showing negative significant trends in the simulated and observed stream flows throughout the pyrenees especially affecting low flows q10 this pattern is even more marked in the southeastern part which maintains this negative trend during winter on the other hand the positive significant trends are located in the western part of the pyrenees at the end of winter in high flows q90 and beginning of spring in median flows q50 where without ruling out other factors a higher proportion of precipitation in liquid form and the earlier melting period have played an important role therefore both seasonal and regional changes of natural river flows are seen comparing the two time periods 1980 2013 and 1990 2013 and looking at the pyrenees as a whole the number of observed time series with significant trends is similar in both periods but it stands out that the models show more significant trends for the short period than for the long one this raises the question of whether this means that the condition of a monotonic trend necessary for the mk test is not satisfied which could be a limitation of the method as discussed above the fact that the simulations do not give significant trends although the observations do could be attributed to a set of parameters that are considered constant in the simulations those related to land cover therefore the differences between the two time periods are attributed to the fact that changes in land use and land cover have influenced flows more notably during the first decade than during the rest of the simulated time period and may be more remarkable than the effects of climate trends on pyrenean river flows during this period the results show that the mediterranean areas which are more arid are reducing their water flows and this process is accelerating as shown by the comparison between the 1980 2013 and 1990 2013 periods the progressive change to wetter conditions in the western and northern part of the domain is less affected by the streamflow decrease another conclusion is that when trends are present they often affect all percentiles however low flow trends tend to be stronger than higher flow trends finally the combination of climatic and non climatic causes in a complex geographical domain and climatically diverse as the pyrenees and with a not very long time series 33 years gives large differences between the results of the models revealing a large uncertainty and can complicate their interpretation using different models to properly quantify such uncertainties was a good choice studies based on a single model omit all these differences and can give a false sense of security the two models are robust common in the scientific literature and very different from each other with the available data it is not possible to say which model reproduces the overall water cycle best certainly swat produces the best streamflow series but it had to be expected since it was calibrated for that in any case both models are severely limited due to their fixed in time physiography and thus it has been shownus that there is a clear need to work towards future models that correctly reflect the actual evolution of the physiography this is essential if stakeholders want to base future decision on past data credit authorship contribution statement roger clavera gispert conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation writing

7708,study region the pyrenees study focus the pyrenees is sensitive to changes in climate both natural and of anthropic origin and changes in land use and cover lulc these changes can influence the water resources the historical evolution 1980 2013 of the stream flows are studied using observed time series from non influenced gauging stations and two models saser and swat their comparison helps to detect and analyze changes in flow rates and their trends trends are computed using the sen s slope estimator the significance of which was evaluated using the mann kendall test furthermore it also allows to explore the question of attribution these models do not simulate lulc change new hydrological insights for the region a complex and diverse domain such as the pyrenees gives large differences between modelled trends revealing a large uncertainty that has been observed thanks to the use of two models for the study period mostly there are no significant trends when trends are present in the observations and are also simulated they are attributed to the effects of climate natural variability and human induced climate change when the significant trends observed are not simulated by the models they are mainly attributed to changes in lulc in general models have difficulties detecting observed trends leading to their attribution to changes in lulcs rather than climate but there are some notable exceptions graphical abstract ga1 keywords pyrenees stream flow trends hydrological modeling climate variability land use land cover data availability the links and doe of data are in the manuscript 1 introduction the pyrenees which extends from the atlantic to the mediterranean is particularly sensitive to changes in climate due to both natural variability and human induced climate change as well as to changes in land use and land cover lulc this territory is the primary source of water resources for a vast region in southern france and north east spain feeding the runoff and recharge zones of the region s main catchment basins ebro adour garonne environmental changes can influence the availability of water resources adding uncertainty to an already difficult water management situation due to high demand and variable supply which can result in water scarcity situations that can last several years several authors described the climate during the last decades in the pyrenees including morán tejeda et al 2017 who found that increasing temperatures are responsible for a lesser accumulation of snow over time lópez moreno et al 2020 noted a snow cover decline pérez zanón et al 2017 described the temperature trends in the central pyrenees lemus canovas et al 2019 described a statistically significant tendency towards a decrease in precipitation and vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2006 noted an increase in winter drought conditions in the eastern pyrenees thus in this climate change context it is especially important to assess possible changes in the water cycle particularly in surface flows as stressed by several authors garcía ruiz et al 2001 and lópez moreno et al 2011 detected a statistically significant decrease in the annual river contributions to the central south pyrenees and the ebro basin respectively likewise zabaleta et al 2019 detected a downward trend during all seasons in the basins close to the bay of biscay western pyrenees although in the last 20 years the average discharge increased in winter and spring in the french side of the pyrenees le treut 2013 reported a discharge decrease of 25 30 in the garonne river and lespinas et al 2010 and labrousse et al 2020 detected downward annual streamflow trends in the northern coastal mediterranean rivers stahl et al 2010 also detected decreasing streamflow trends in two northern pyrenean basins for the period 1952 2004 in addition to climatic circumstances non climatic factors such as changes in land use can also strongly affect river flows beguería et al 2003 estimated that 25 of streamflow decrease was caused by revegetation during the period 1945 1995 in the south central pyrenees likewise gallart and llorens 2003 estimated that 30 of the streamflow decrease in the ebro basin during the period 1945 1995 was due to an increase in evapotranspiration similarly buendia et al 2016 ascribed the streamflow decrease to the combined action of climate change and afforestation in three sub basins of the southern eastern pyrenees for the period 1987 2009 finally lópez moreno et al 2006 and vicente serrano et al 2021 also studied the predominantly negative streamflow trends in the central southern pyrenees and ascribed them to a combination of climate change and afforestation the main method for describing the hydrological regime of watercourses is by means of gauging station streamflow records when these records cover a sufficient period of time and are supplemented with tools such as hydrological modeling they can also be used to evaluate quantify and interpret possible hydrological changes over time as well as trends in water resource availability long time series several decades to study climate trends are needed to discern if the cause of the observed changes is due to natural variability or anthropic climate change however to separate the effects of lulc and those of climate without discriminating between natural and human induced changes in climate does not need time series as long at least in the pyrenees where the abandonment of agricultural areas has been rather fast lasanta et al 2021 hydrological modeling helps to understand the underlying processes by simulating variables that are difficult or impossible to observe such as soil moisture snowpack dynamics or land evaporation modeling also allows performing numerical experiments impossible to conduct in the real world such as fixing land use to assess the impacts of climate change only quintana seguí et al 2021 however all those valuable contributions are subjected to model uncertainty an issue that should not be neglected and thus be carefully assessed model uncertainty can be due to the model structure how the physical processes have been represented in the model and also due to the physiography which often is fixed in models while it changes in time in the real basin the objective of this study is to evaluate if models that correctly simulate the streamflow of the pyrenees in terms of kge are able to correctly simulate the observed streamflow trends this article characterizes the recent evolution 1980 2013 of river streamflow in the pyrenees analyzing streamflow time series of several gauging stations and compare them with model simulations two hydrological models saser and swat are used with different complexity and operating principles to analyze the uncertainty arising from the assumptions and errors of the models themselves and estimate the confidence in the results the agreement and disagreement of the models with the observations and between them enriches the discussion of the observed streamflow evolution and the attribution of the possible changes which can have climatic or non climatic origins i e lulc as well as the detection and quantification of the main sources of uncertainty in this case the time period studied is short and thus unable to disentangle the effects of the natural variability of climate due to decadal to centennial oscillations but it is enough to disentangle the effects of climate which affects both models and reality and lulc which is not simulated by these models 1 1 study area the pyrenees has a rugged relief that stretches approximately 415 kilometers from west to east from the atlantic ocean to the mediterranean sea and 150 kilometers wide along its north south axis it encompasses the basins of the ebro river which flows into the mediterranean sea the adour and the garonne rivers which flow into the atlantic ocean as well as all other smaller basins surrounding them fig 1 this singular geographical configuration confers the region a great climatic diversity giving the pyrenees a high environmental value the hydrographic network is characterized by numerous watercourses which generally adopt a north south disposition although some stretches are aligned in a west east direction in addition the pyrenees as a natural water tower is the major source of water resources to the surrounding regions providing the water needs of more than 15 million people and supplying electricity and irrigation water to a vast territory the climatic water balance difference between annual precipitation and atmospheric moisture demand in the pyrenees is essentially positive suggesting an absence of aridity and a clear water surplus with values above 1000 mm per year in most of the area especially near the watersheds and on the northern slope on the other hand the adjacent plains show much lower and even negative values most notably to the south therefore the rivers descending from the pyrenees are the main source of water resources in these surrounding areas annual precipitation presents important contrasts ranging between 500 and 3000 mm per year precipitation is spatially distributed according to a west east gradient which is related to the generation of precipitation by the humid atlantic air masses also there is the altitudinal gradient with increasing precipitation as altitude increases thus the maximum annual precipitation values are concentrated on the atlantic coast while the lowest values are found towards the mediterranean and in the interior depressions and foothills on the northern slope moreover the atlantic influence extends from the piedmont zone to the central sector increasing the mediterranean influence towards the piedmont zones and towards the east the seasonal rainfall regime has a very pronounced minimum in the summer months and a secondary minimum in winter the maximums occur in autumn and spring there are however important differences between sectors with a gradient again appearing from west to east thus in the westernmost valleys the most important maximum is in autumn while the spring maximum is secondary on the other hand in the eastern valleys the main maximum is the spring one while the autumn maximum is less pronounced there are also differences in the minimums since towards the west the main minimum occurs in summer while in the easternmost valleys the winter minimum is more pronounced the transition between the two regimes occurs gradually as the atlantic influence leads way to the mediterranean one in this work the pyrenees is divided into 8 sectors fig 1 and table 1 according to geographical and water management criteria the ebro basin is the largest of the pyrenees and collects water from the western to the eastern part of the mountain range so it is subdivided into 3 parts western web central ceb and eastern eeb ebro tributaries on the other hand the little basins in the cantabrian area are grouped in a single region can as well as the basins in the southeastern pyrenees internal catalan basins icb and the northeastern basin neb the adour and the garonne basins are each one a region ado and gar respectively 2 data and methods 2 1 datasets to achieve the objectives observational data is needed to validate the models and assess the actual trends beyond this data meteorological forcing data state of the atmosphere at each instant and physiographic information topography soil texture vegetation cover land use etc are also needed to feed the models all datasets used are presented and described below 2 1 1 hydrological data observations the region under study comprises three countries andorra france and spain and different administrative and management entities are involved in the administration of water resources streamflow data from these entities is collected harmonized and merged into a unique daily streamflow dataset named piragua indicators zabaleta et al 2022 not all the available data from gauging stations present in the study area were eligible to study streamflow evolution and trends the main criteria to make the final selection of gauging stations are 1 be in a natural or semi natural regime e g not influenced by dams or significant water extraction 2 do not present an altered hydrological regime e g maximum flows in august 3 do not have abrupt changes in their time series 4 have more than 20 years of data and do not have important gaps such as complete year gaps from this preliminary work a set of 67 quality time series from near natural gauging stations geographically dispersed across the study area fig 1 2 1 2 meteorological data the hydrological models were driven with a common forcing dataset the piragua atmos analysis dataset quintana seguí 2022 it is a meteorological dataset based on safran système d analyse fournissant des renseignements atmosphériques à la neige durand et al 1993 1999 that produces gridded datasets of screen level meteorological variables by combining the outputs of a meteorological model and all available observations using an optimal interpolation algorithm safran has been extensively used in france e g le moigne et al 2020 quintana seguí et al 2008 vidal et al 2010 and more recently it has also been applied in spain quintana seguí et al 2016 2017 tunicia tramblay et al 2019 and moroco moucha et al 2020 piragua atmos analysis was performed by taking the results of the optimal interpolation step of the french and spanish safran datasets and doing the final step of interpolation anew using a common grid that covers the study area enlarged pyrenees including all the basins that drain the range fig 2 the result is a gridded dataset of temperature precipitation relative humidity and wind speed that covers the area limited by 370000 m and 1085000 m in the y axis and 4465000 m and 5080000 m in the meridional axis according to the utm projection etrs89 datum 30 n epsg 25830 with a spatial resolution of 2 5 km and hourly time resolution 2 1 3 radiation data era5 ecmwf hersbach et al 2018 was used for radiation when creating piragua atmos analysis from safran spain and safran france because radiation values were not consistent with each other era5 covers the earth on a 0 25 resolution grid these data have been interpolated to the same grid as the piragua atmos analysis dataset 2 1 4 other data additional input data was required for simulations of the region such as topography and land cover which were obtained from several sources table 2 it should be noted as it will be relevant for the discussion of the results that these parameters are considered constant in time during the simulations 2 2 hydrological modeling as mentioned above this work used the results of the two hydrological models saser and swat over the pyrenees for the period 1981 2010 which are grouped in a dataset named piragua hydro analysis beguería et al 2022 these two models present different complexity and operational principles allowing to evaluate the results uncertainty and confidence level and both have been applied to several case studies and have a proven track record including choudhary and athira 2021 cui et al 2021 datok et al 2021 and olaoye et al 2021 for swat and guinaldo et al 2021 tóth and szintai 2021 and vural et al 2021 for surfex a brief introduction to these models is given here but for more details about the theory and implementation the reader is directed to their web pages http www umr cnrm fr surfex last access 13 12 2022 and https swat tamu edu last access 13 12 2022 2 2 1 saser the full modeling platform saser safran surfex eaudysee rapid is formed by a meteorological dataset based on safran already presented above the land surface model surfex rapid and eau dysee which will be introduced below the saser term will be used throughout this work following previous examples bhuiyan et al 2018 gaona et al 2022 quintana seguí et al 2020 2 2 2 surfex surfex surface externalisée is météo france s surface modeling platform le moigne et al 2020 masson et al 2013 it is a physical and fully distributed land surface model using a regular grid and computes the hydric and energy balance in continental surfaces for natural soils surfex uses the isba interaction sol biosphère atmosphère land surface scheme noilhan and mahfouf 1996 noilhan and planton 1989 the isba scheme calculates the surface energy and water budgets over natural areas there are different versions of isba but isba dif is used in this study which is the multi layer diffusion version boone et al 2000 habets et al 2003 surfex lacks a native routing scheme but it can use rapid routing application for parallel computation of discharge david cédric h 2013 as a routing model and the connection between surfex and rapid being eau dysée both tools are described below 2 2 3 rapid since surfex has no river routing scheme rapid david et al 2011 is chosen to do this rapid transfers surfex s total runoff surface and subsurface or drainage from the surfex grid cells to the river cells using its own isochrony algorithm then rapid uses a matrix based version of the muskingum method to calculate flow and volume of water for each reach of a river network as the current setup cannot simulate dams canals or irrigation the resulting river flows are estimations of the natural system that is the system without direct human intervention in the form of irrigation or hydraulic infrastructures such as dams or canals 2 2 4 eau dyssée eau dyssée is a framework that couples hydrological models flipo et al 2012 saleh et al 2011 in this case surfex and rapid managing the different space and time scales and exchanging the appropriate variables between them 2 2 5 swat swat soil and water assessment tool douglas mankin et al 2010 is a semi distributed basin scale time continuous hydrological model supported by the usda agricultural research service the minimum requirements for swat include topographic land use land cover soil and climate data as swat simulates at the basin scale the study area was divided into 20 basins fig 3 and in turn as a semi distributed model the catchment was divided into sub basins which are further divided into hydrological response units hrus which are homogeneous units of land use soil type and slope the basin discretization into sub basins is based on the catchment areas as defined in the european system directive 2000 60 ec these sub basin limits coincide with the gauging stations where the calibration validation and model analysis should be carried out the swat system as a conceptual model requires calibration and validation the corresponding time periods were model initialization warm up 1980 1985 calibration 1986 2005 and validation 2006 2013 the sensitive parameters were identified and calibrated using the literature of the region biancamaria et al 2019 cakir et al 2020 grusson et al 2015 2017a 2017b 2018 martin et al 2016 the main calibration target was objective function kge optimization for this the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm abbaspour et al 2004 was used because this method identifies an optimal parameter set in a limited number of iterations yang et al 2008 the calibration was made in 2 stages first a calibration with all stations together to find a general equilibrium of the sensitive parameters over all basins the second stage consisted of a separate calibration of those stations where the simulation performance was insufficient to adapt the calibration to the local particularities once the swat model was calibrated and validated the resulting parameters and configuration was applied to the full period 1980 2013 to compare the models results with observed streamflow series from the gauging stations due to the system requiring an initialization period the first five years of data 1980 1985 were artificially replicated to apply them to the period 1975 1979 and ensure a modeling period from 1980 to 2013 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 goodness of fit the performance of the simulated daily streamflow time series was evaluated using the non parametric variant of the kling gupta efficiency test kgenp pool et al 2018 this statistic considers different types of model errors namely the error in the mean the variability and the dynamics pool et al 2018 the calculation of kge standard parametric version is implicitly based on the assumptions of data linearity data normality and the absence of outliers but the streamflow time series do not necessarily follow these assumptions for this reason the non parametric version of kge is used in this study

function is computed from three parameters the spearman s rank correlation as an indicator of general goodness of fit rs where robs and rsim are the ranks of the observed and simulated discharge time series respectively the normalized flow duration curve fdc as an indicator of discharge variability where i k and j k are the time steps when the kth largest flow occurs within the simulated and observed time series respectively and the quotient of the means division as an indicator of bias β the kgenp ranges from infinity kgenp 1 0 being kgenp 1 0 the perfect agreement between simulations and observations there is no benchmark from which a simulation is considered good or bad knoben et al 2019 although knoben et al 2019 consider that the model has predictive capacity if kgenp between the observations and the simulation is greater than the kgenp between the observations and their mean the python package hydroeval hallouin 2021 was used to compute the kgenp on the other hand the simulations made with swat need to be calibrated and validated therefore the kgenp can only be applied to the validation period consequently the kgenp for the swat simulations were calculated for the period 2006 2013 this is not the case for saser because it does not need calibration therefore the validation between observations and simulation could be performed over the whole modeled period 1980 2013 to make kgenp comparable the 2006 2013 period for both models is used 2 3 2 trend calculation daily time series of observations and simulations were transformed to monthly and seasonal descriptive statistics quantiles q10 q50 q90 and annual time series the statistics q10 q50 and q90 are chosen which are the thresholds that are not surpassed during 10 50 or 90 of the time respectively as proxies for low q10 medium q50 and high q90 flows these statistics were calculated for both of the study periods 1980 2013 period and 1990 2013 period and for all gauging stations to evaluate their trends over time the existence of a trend in a time series can be detected by several statistical tests bayazit 2015 the sen s slope estimator sen 1968 is used is this study assuming a linear trend over time the significance of the trends was assessed with the rank based non parametric mann kendall test mk mann 1945 which is the most widely used for trend analysis in hydrology before the test a pre whitening of the series is applied using the collaud coen et al 2020 methodology and vogt 2021 software library which involves three pre whitening methods the purpose of pre whitening is to eliminate from the analysis the influence of likely temporal autocorrelation in the data which would cause inflation of the statistical significance values and therefore generate a higher than expected number of false positives mk is applied on the pre whitened series at the 95 significance level p 0 05 2 3 3 graphical representation of trends as an aid to the interpretation of the trends a graphical representation of the trends is designed fig 4 the plot represents points on a two dimensional plane where the x axis and y axis correspond to the value of observed and simulated trends respectively therefore there will be two points for each observed trend one for saser filled symbol in fig 4 and one for swat empty symbol in fig 4 these two symbols are joined by a vertical line representing a proxy of the simulations uncertainty the shape of the symbol represents the statistic q10 is a circle q50 is a square and q90 is a star the color of the symbol represents the statistical significance fig 4 being gray when there is none red when both observations and simulations are significant blue when observations are statistically significant but simulations have no statistical significance and green when the observations and swat have statistical significance and yellow when the observations and saser have statistical significance points in the quadrant delimited by the upper right continuous gray lines represent positive trends in both observations and simulations equivalent to tp of m while points in the lower left quadrant represent negative trends in both observations and simulations equivalent to tn of m in these two cases the closer to the dashed line the more similar is the slope of the simulations and the observations on the other hand the fp of m are in the upper left quadrant and the fn are in the lower right quadrant 3 results 3 1 simulation performance the validation results are summarized in fig 5 regarding the validation of saser at the daily time step and considering the criteria previously established in the methodology more than 89 of the simulations had a better skill than the one obtained using the mean of the time series with a median value of kgenp 0 44 this percentage increased with swat reaching over 98 with a median of kgenp 0 51 at the seasonal level the median performance ranged between 0 39 summer to 0 55 winter for saser and between 0 46 autumn to 0 64 spring for swat the saser kgenp is better than using the mean in more than 77 winter cases being the maximum 92 summer for swat the kgenp ranged between 0 46 autumn to 0 64 spring with the best results in winter and spring 98 and the worst in autumn 91 considering months the percentages ranged between 70 sep to 92 jul for saser and between 58 sep to 97 dec jan and jun for swat with median kgenp ranging between 0 17 aug to 0 58 nov for saser and between 0 08 aug to 0 64 jan for swat going back to the annual scores one sees that the rs discharge dynamics indicator ranged between 0 05 and 0 97 for saser and between 0 52 and 0 95 for swat in most cases there is a moderate to strong positive association in both models although in swat there are 5 out of 1139 cases with negative values the values discharge variability of observations and simulations ranged between 0 98 and 0 38 this indicates short discharge variability between simulations and observations in contrast unlike the two previous parameters β values showed clear differences between models saser values ranged between 58 0 and 0 1 while for swat ranged between 9 7 and 0 1 fig 5 therefore the β parameter was the one that most clearly conditioned the final kgenp value and is the one that made swat models give better overall skill although it should be noted that during simulations saser conserves all the simulated water but swat can calibrate a variable that determines the amount of water that quits the system through deep percolation and thus determines the discharged volume β in general the best fits between observations and simulations were obtained in winter and spring while the worst fits were during summer and autumn table 3 this is expected as hydrogeology plays a more relevant role in sustaining streamflow during summer and this was not simulated by the models table 3 summarizes the results by region the best scores were found in the western pyrenees ado and can areas for the 2 models while the worst were located in the eeb and neb table 3 these regions have a marked mediterranean character and it is known that these models perform worse in a mediterranean context merheb et al 2016 looking seasonally the highest values are found in all basins in winter and spring and the lowest are in summer for saser and autumn for swat the only exception is the eeb which had lowest values in winter and maximum values in summer the worst values were in september and august the highest values were more dispersed and in general were found in the winter months djf therefore a spatial and temporal distribution of the kgenp can be seen with higher values in wetter areas and lower values in drier areas with dry months showing the worst values and wetter months showing the best values thus the models work better in the wetter climates and for the rainier seasons because they simulate rainfall runoff processes better except the extreme ones than the always more complex hydrogeology that is predominant in summer 3 2 comparing time periods focusing on the 1980 2013 time period fig 6 for a detailed representation see supplementary material out of the 804 measurements for all the gauging stations for 4 seasons and the 3 statistics q10 q50 and q90 89 8 of the observed time series do not have significant trends considering only the 82 observed significant trends 76 8 of these did not achieve statistical significance in the simulations by either model 20 7 were captured by swat but not by saser mainly in the q50 and only 1 2 were simulated by saser and not by swat observed trends with statistical significance simulated by both models represent 1 2 also the season with the least statistically significant trends is winter 11 and the one with the most is autumn 33 while spring and summer have similar values 27 and 29 respectively the quantile with the highest number of significant trends was q50 39 followed by q10 38 and finally q90 23 therefore the conclusion is that the simulations had poor skill in predicting the significant observed streamflow trends during 1980 2013 period similarly during the 1990 2013 time period 89 2 of the observed time series showed no significant trends fig 7 for a detailed representation see supplementary material taking into account only the significant trends 58 6 of these were not simulated with statistical significance by either model 13 8 were captured by swat but not by saser and 9 2 were simulated by saser and not by swat observed trends with statistical significance simulated by both models represented 18 4 also the season with the least observed significant trends is spring 14 9 and the one with the most is autumn 46 while winter and summer have similar values 20 7 and 18 4 respectively the statistical parameter with the highest number of significant trends is q10 43 7 followed by q50 41 4 and finally q90 14 9 the simulations again showed poor skill in predicting the observed streamflow trends during this period 3 3 seasonal distribution of the trends during autumn figs 6 and 7 for a detailed temporal and regional distribution of the trends see supplementary material the observations show a clear negative significant trend signal throughout the pyrenees this is especially true for the eastern part eeb and icb where the simulations show these trends in the 1990 2013 period as for the western parts simulated significant trends appear in this period during september in web for q90 fig 8 and october in gar for q10 fig 9 throughout winter figs 6 and 7 the observations and simulations in the south eastern areas eeb and icb have negative significant trends in the 1990 2013 period this is in contrast to the trends observed during this season in the western sectors can and web where they can be positive in this period especially in february s q90 spring is the season with more variability presenting positive and negative significant trends there is no clear pattern in the 1980 2013 period but in general terms it is observed that observations from the northern half have negative significant trends which are not simulated while in the southern sector web ceb and eeb they have positive significant trends the icb sector does not mainly present significant trends but when the observations have significant trends these are negative for the 1990 2013 period northern sectors do not mostly present significant trends except for can that shows them as well as the southern slope positive significant trends in the observations which are also simulated in the can and web fig 10 the significant trends distribution in summer shows negative values in observations affecting the mediterranean basins mainly cne and icb but also the eastern gauging stations of eeb and gar for the 1990 2013 period the northern half with the exception of those already mentioned has hardly any significant trend and the observed in the southern slope despite having some positive values are mostly negative overall the sectors most affected by negative significant trends are located in the mediterranean area especially the southern slope with negative values in all seasons with peaks in autumn and winter on the contrary the sectors less affected by negative significant trends are those located in the northern slope except for neb that even have positive significant trends in march in can this allows to see a distribution of trends by slope on the east west axis finding the extremes in icb and can 3 4 distribution of the trends by statistics q10 that is the low flows is the statistic that presents more significant trends followed by q50 and finally q90 mostly in the autumn months this distribution holds whether or not the trend has been correctly reproduced by the models i e when the significant trend has been observed and simulated the statistic with more significant trends is still q10 followed by q50 and q90 also in autumn regarding the monthly distributions of quantiles fig 11 a major number of negative significant trends in q10 low flows are in october this distribution is observable in both periods 1980 2013 and 1990 2013 as well as in observations and both simulations on the other hand positive trends are remarkable at february march and especially april for the q90 high flows in the 1990 2013 period this distribution is not so marked in the simulations as in the observations 3 5 attributions of the trends streamflow trends can arise from a number of causal factors but the attribution is not trivial there are different combinations of situations depending on whether the trends can be observed and or simulated the most common scenario in this study is when there are not statistically significant trends in either observations or simulations fig 12b in principle this should be interpreted as that there is no real increase or decrease in the river flow trend however it could be that there is a very subtle trend that is masked by noise or that the method used to calculate the trend is not adequate to capture it the easiest scenario to interpret is when significant trends are detected in both observations and simulations in this case this trend is attributed to the climate i e eeb in september for the 1990 2013 period shown in fig 12a because the models which have fixed parameters and physiography can only produce trends due to climate factors however there will always be a difference between the observed and simulated values due to model limitations or to other non climatic factors affecting the observed trends that are not simulated by the models e g web in september for the 1990 2013 period january of neb in the 1990 2013 period the distance between simulated trend values red lines joining symbols in fig 12a is a measure of model uncertainty the greater the distance the greater the uncertainty of the simulations another case is the existence of significant trends in the observations but not in the simulations fig 12c in this situation it is assumed that these trends as being due to non climatic causes which cannot be simulated by the models with stationary parameters these non climatic causes can be changes in land use reforestation of agricultural fields changes in infiltration due to human infrastructures etcetera there is a final situation when the observed significant trends are simulated only by one of the models either swat or saser in this case the situation is not easy to interpret this situation is probably caused by differences in model structure these are nonlinear models which may have many threshold effects thus it may happen that one model starts exhibiting a trend earlier than the other one depending on thresholds being surpassed finally it should be noted that both models used the same meteorological forcing thus errors in the meteorological forcing are propagated to both models in an equal manner if observed climate trends are not correctly reproduced by the forcing dataset the models will not be able to simulate them discussion and conclusions this study allowed to quantify the trends of streamflow statistics low medium and high flows of pyrenean rivers it has been done both in observed and simulated time series which have been computed using two very different hydrological models with the aim of analyzing how models with fixed physiography and very different structure simulate trends in this area of study the first and most important result is that most of the time series did not present statistically significant trends over the period 1980 2013 probably due to the high variability of the climate of the region which makes trend detection more difficult in such a relatively short time span then observations and models do not always reproduce the same trends the models do not show good skill in reproducing the observed trends interpreting these differences is not always easy however non simulated observed trends can be attributed to the parameters which are considered constant in the models mainly lulc which was considered static in the two models it is well known that the pyrenees has undergone major changes in land use and land cover since the mid 20th century changes that have continued during the current century although probably at a slower rate beguería et al 2003 buendia et al 2016 gallart and llorens 2004 2003 lópez moreno et al 2006 vicente serrano et al 2021 these changes are mostly due to the abandonment of non mechanizable or not very productive agricultural fields on the slopes of the pyrenees the abandoned lands have been artificially or naturally forested leading to an increase in rainfall interception and evapotranspiration among other changes if trends are observed in both simulations and observations they are mainly attributed to climate natural variability and anthropic causes without ruling out other sources that may affect the magnitude of the simulated trends autumn is the season more affected by trends in the climate forcing showing negative significant trends in the simulated and observed stream flows throughout the pyrenees especially affecting low flows q10 this pattern is even more marked in the southeastern part which maintains this negative trend during winter on the other hand the positive significant trends are located in the western part of the pyrenees at the end of winter in high flows q90 and beginning of spring in median flows q50 where without ruling out other factors a higher proportion of precipitation in liquid form and the earlier melting period have played an important role therefore both seasonal and regional changes of natural river flows are seen comparing the two time periods 1980 2013 and 1990 2013 and looking at the pyrenees as a whole the number of observed time series with significant trends is similar in both periods but it stands out that the models show more significant trends for the short period than for the long one this raises the question of whether this means that the condition of a monotonic trend necessary for the mk test is not satisfied which could be a limitation of the method as discussed above the fact that the simulations do not give significant trends although the observations do could be attributed to a set of parameters that are considered constant in the simulations those related to land cover therefore the differences between the two time periods are attributed to the fact that changes in land use and land cover have influenced flows more notably during the first decade than during the rest of the simulated time period and may be more remarkable than the effects of climate trends on pyrenean river flows during this period the results show that the mediterranean areas which are more arid are reducing their water flows and this process is accelerating as shown by the comparison between the 1980 2013 and 1990 2013 periods the progressive change to wetter conditions in the western and northern part of the domain is less affected by the streamflow decrease another conclusion is that when trends are present they often affect all percentiles however low flow trends tend to be stronger than higher flow trends finally the combination of climatic and non climatic causes in a complex geographical domain and climatically diverse as the pyrenees and with a not very long time series 33 years gives large differences between the results of the models revealing a large uncertainty and can complicate their interpretation using different models to properly quantify such uncertainties was a good choice studies based on a single model omit all these differences and can give a false sense of security the two models are robust common in the scientific literature and very different from each other with the available data it is not possible to say which model reproduces the overall water cycle best certainly swat produces the best streamflow series but it had to be expected since it was calibrated for that in any case both models are severely limited due to their fixed in time physiography and thus it has been shownus that there is a clear need to work towards future models that correctly reflect the actual evolution of the physiography this is essential if stakeholders want to base future decision on past data credit authorship contribution statement roger clavera gispert conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation writing

7709,study region the congo river basin in west central africa study focus traditional machine learning algorithms are recently being replaced by integrated learning techniques in pattern recognitions and predictions these updated tools or techniques which attempt to explore higher dimensions and uncover hidden patterns in considerably non linear datasets are the new normal in small medium and large dataset even in higher orders this study investigates the performance of a convolution based support vector machine in hydrological analysis to optimize forecast of terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa the linear polynomial and radial basis function rbf kernels were explored in reconstructing the three variants of twsa obtained from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace level 3 products using the original input training datasets we built and trained the convolution neural network cnn which is composed of convolution and fully connected layers and was integrated into the traditional support vector machine svm the network was trained with twenty two 22 datasets the original predictor datasets are composed of hydrological fluxes hf climate indices ci and sea surface temperature sst datasets whose influence on grace twsa was analyzed in the body of our work our results show that the polynomial kernel based on the convolution based support vector machine csvm outperformed the other regression models in the reconstruction of all variants of twsa the high accuracy achieved using the csvm demonstrates its promising potential to fill the gaps in the missing grace observations through its refined reconstruction capabilities new hydrological insight for the region in this study i sst variants or components e g those of east tropical atlantic were leading predictors of twsa ii increasing polynomial order does not increase accuracy in all polynomial kernel operations especially in cases of severe non linearity between predictors and predictands iii for the rbf kernels intermediate gamma values ranging from 0 05 to 0 5 are ideal for climatic analysis as very small or very large gamma values will either behave like a linear model or over fit respectively and iv overall the polynomial kernels reconstructed and predicted twsa better than the other kernels the other conventional machine learning procedures used to compare the fit of the csvm show significant insight for future twsa reconstruction processes their robustness can be explored by varying the independent variables fed into the machine learning framework and tuning their hyper parameters to result in better fitting index which promises to be much more useful than traditional learning methods graphical abstract ga1 keywords machine learning convolution based support vector machine hydrology terrestrial water storage anomalies data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction machine learning techniques tailored towards extensive examination and learning between considerably non linear datasets of varying quality have undergone significant advancements over the past decade its applications in medicine chang et al 2010 engineering guo et al 2021 image classification okwuashi and ndehedehe 2020 speech recognition el ayadi et al 2011 and bioinformatics guo 2014 is a pointer to its vast role and importance in various multi disciplinary studies among the numerous machine learning algorithms applied over the years the support vector machine technique has considerable relevance in pattern recognition for both small and big data analysis chen et al 2016 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission has been applied in various water related studies such as flood potential assessments drought monitoring groundwater storage estimates global sea level changes and ocean mass analysis see e g kalu et al 2021a ndehedehe and ferreira 2020 and references therein however the large number of corrections and uncertainties involved in the processing chain of this data results in the introduction of inherent errors which impose restrictions on its use for instance in the first 163 months of the mission s operation 24 monthly missing data were recorded ahi and cekim 2021 this lag in twsa makes room for the reconstruction of the grace time series using integrated machine learning procedures to improve the accuracy of hydrological studies based on the grace data several machine learning regression learners have been applied in predicting terrestrial water storage changes and this includes physically based algorithms fisher et al 2008 data assimilation da methods liu et al 2021 empirical semi empirical algorithms humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 yao et al 2015 traditionally physically based algorithms rely on data from satellite and meteorological observations for twsa learning therefore compared to data driven algorithms their simulation results differ substantially due to large errors from too many input variables and uncertainty in the model structures yao et al 2017 da models which are popularly known for the assimilation of satellite based parameters into biophysical or land surface models to improve estimations of a system state xu et al 2011 have been associated with a long standing limitation this limitation is that the model accuracy of the da systems has been reported to be severely affected by the accuracy of the satellite based input variables yao et al 2017 by dominating the effect of the model variables and thus impedes its robustness and efficiency in twsa reconstructions empirical semi empirical algorithms integrate ground measured observations key meteorological parameters and satellite based datasets in learning twsa patterns their modeling procedures establishes relationships between the input and output variable which is a sound theoretical process however they rely on a significant number of training datasets for all the behaviors found in the system which impedes their robustness also their large data requirement is not feasible in many data deficient regions and can equally reduce their computational efficiency and accuracy in making predictions kalu et al 2022c our study attempts to utilize data driven algorithms to bring a balance between satellite and model based data types this procedure promises to enhance the reconstruction process and improve predictions of the twsa variable for effective hydro geodetic operations and assessments kalu et al 2021b c our study introduces a convolution based support vector machine csvm for the grace time series reconstruction procedure the support vector machine has been reported to bring about a steady balance between satellite based and model based datasets in hydrological studies yao et al 2017 liu et al 2021 enhancing its modeling robustness and predictions capabilities even in severely non linear system states the goal is to attain reliable machine learning techniques with accuracy and efficiency that can successfully reconstruct observations from the grace mission apart from making up for the missing monthly grace time series our algorithm can also be relied on for making twsa predictions for 1 to 3 month lead times in our experiments i we utilized the three variants of the grace twsa i e gfz csr and jpl to observe which time series our algorithm favors the most ii our input dataset was segmented into hydrological fluxes climate indices and ssts so we can measure the impact of each set in reconstructing twsa iii to fine tune our reconstruction procedure we utilized various kernels of the svm in our proposed model iv we also made comparisons to other conventional regression models to ascertain the integrity and robustness of our proposed algorithm the procedures achieved from our study objectives sufficiently supported and actualized our study aim our proposed csvm employs a supervised learning technique based on the simplified swarm optimization model ssom this integrated technique promises to harness the advantages of both svm and deep learning to enhance the prediction capabilities accuracies and tests of the traditional svm technique the convolution based svm works by assimilating svm with the imperative operation techniques of convolution neural networks cnns including convolution and strides aimed at augmenting the capabilities of the traditional svm it also utilizes the one solution technique one filter and one variable greedy ssom update mechanism to inhibit the solutions that are near optimum not to achieve their current positions our proposed csvm also promises to reduce the run time of our entire system process in reconstructing terrestrial water storage 2 data and implementation the processing management and distribution of grace satellite data are jointly undertaken by the german research center for geosciences gfz the center for space research csr and the jet propulsion laboratory jpl which were all used in this study the grace products included several levels 0 1 a 1b 2 and 3 the current providers of mascon data include csr jpl and nasa goddard space flight center gsfc nevertheless we preferred to use the solutions based on the grace raw data and background models otherwise it would result in heterogeneousness of the tws anomalies generated by the different mascons fig 1 which also makes it difficult to compare them among themselves therefore we utilized the grace level 3 rl06 and water equivalent thickness produced by the gfz csr and jpl for our study https podaac tools jpl nasa gov drive files alldata tellus l3 grace land mass rl06 we attempt to use the three variants of our grace derived twsa fig 1 as independent predictand models this was to ascertain the performance of our csvm algorithm in reconstructing them individually especially given that the level 3 products have undergone gaussian smoothing and de correlation filtering to minimize correlation errors in them swenson and wahr 2006 this procedure however is a factor that hinders machine learning predictions reconstructions in most grace datasets our data testing and training period is january 2003 december 2012 for our study we made use of various input predictors for our reconstruction process which was segmented as i hydrological fluxes ii climate indices iii sea surface temperatures however we explored the result of the reconstruction process by integrating the three segments of these original input datasets 2 1 hydrological fluxes the following products formed part of the variables representing hydrological fluxes hf in our test bed i trmm base precipitation ii albedo iii wind speed at 10 m iv runoff v evapotranspiration vi atmospheric pressure vii soil moisture viii surface

formed part of the variables representing the global climate indices we also attach their download links as shown in table 1 below 2 3 sea surface temperatures the sea surface temperature sst products applied in this study include ninos 1 2 0 10 s 90 80 w 3 0 5 n 5s 150 90 w 3 4 5 n 5s 170 120 w and 4 0 5 n 5s 160e 150 w other sst products such as the nta north tropical atlantic eta east tropical atlantic and sta south tropical atlantic from the atlantic ocean were also used in our analysis the averaged sst datasets from 2003 to 2012 used in this study was downloaded from https www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data noaa oisst v2 html to reconstruct twsa using our csvm model we first explored a training model encompassing the datasets from the hydrological flux class climate indices class and the sea surface temperature class our attempt to reconstruct twsa was based on these 22 predictors table 2 aimed at having a strong regression model despite the severe non linearity of our model we explored first order kernel variants and higher order kernel variants to ascertain their regression strengths and also comment on their robustness in reconstructing the three variants of twsa which served as our dependent variables for the first order kernels we explored the linear kernel eq 6 the polynomial kernel of order 2 eq 7 and the rbf kernel eq 8 of gamma 0 05 then for the higher order kernels we implemented the polynomial kernel of order 3 eq 7 and the rbf kernels of gamma 0 03 and 0 02 respectively eq 8 for our training we made use of 70 of our total predictors hf ci sst these independent variables were trained with i twsa gfz ii twsa csr and iii twsa jpl which served as their corresponding dependent variables after estimating the performance of our different kernels on the three dependent variables we segmented our predictors into i hydrological fluxes ii climate indices and sea surface temperatures table 2 to be able to investigate the individual performance of these three sects in modeling twsa using both first and higher order kernels in our csvm 3 materials and methods 3 1 convolution based support vector machine framework our modeled csvm made use of a convolution product in its operation by combining the cnn method with the svm method cnns are popularly known for their ability to create good filters and extract the in depth features of their training dataset efficiently for each convolution layer we formalized the convolution operation as follows 1 h ij k f w k x ij b k where f represent the activation function w k and b k represents the weights and bias terms of the kth feature map respectively the svm is a robust machine learning technique that is largely based on the structural risk minimization approach it is characterized by a proficient non linear mapping performance which has the capabilities of efficiently mapping big data inputs into their respective high dimensional feature space as well as performing linear regression in its feature space mi et al 2019 the regression formula of the model is given by 2 f x w t φ x b where φ represents the non linear mapping function and the respective weights and bias terms are represented by w and b the svm optimization model is given by 3 min w b ξ ξ 0 5 w t w c i 1 n ξ i ξ i 4 s t y i w x i b ε ξ i w x i b y i ε ξ i i 1 2 l ξ i ξ i 0 where l and n represent the number of samples ξ i ξ i represents the upper and lower training errors respectively x i and y i represents the inputs and outputs of the training data respectively ε and c represents the insensitive loss factor and the regularized constant respectively to generate the prediction function f we utilize the lagrange multipliers a i and a i as follows 5 f x a i a i i 1 n a i a i k m x x i b m 1 2 3 where k m is the kernel function and in this study we made use of the linear k 1 the polynomial k 2 and the radial basis function gaussian k 3 kernels fig 2 whose formulas are given below 6 k 1 x x i x t x i 7 k 2 x x i 1 x t x i q where q represents the order of the polynomial kernel we used order 2 and 3 for this study 8 k 3 x x i exp x x i 2 2 γ 2 where γ represent the optimal gamma value we used gamma values 0 05 0 02 and 0 03 for this study eqs 6 7 and 8 represents the linear polynomial and rbf kernels respectively fig 2 fig 3 provides the computational steps of the csvm and is summarized as follows 1 use the original input training datasets to build and train the cnn model each cnn model is composed of three convolution layers and two fully connected layers the convolution layers occupy channels 4 8 and 16 respectively the relu and adam algorithms were used as the activation and optimization function for the first hidden layer and for the second hidden layer we employed the sigmoid algorithm as the activation function also we attempted to enhance the generalization performance of the cnn model by utilizing the capabilities of the dropout and lasso regularization techniques in our multi layered architecture as explained by cai and liu 2016 and ambach and schmid 2017 we used the drop out ratio of p 0 7 between the convolution layer 3 and fully connected layer 1 the lasso regularization maintained a proportion of 0 01 while the loss function represents the summation of the average mean squared error and lasso regularization 2 the fully connected layer 1 of the cnn model is extracted to serve as the input features of the svm then the modeling and training of the svm framework commence using the grid search optimizer we searched for ε and c the grid search searches in a random order using uniform sampling without replacement from the grid this was useful in improving the generalization and robustness of the svm model 3 save the training models of the cnn and svm fig 3 4 the training model is reloaded into the system and the testing model is rebuilt the building of the testing model is achieved by interfacing the fully connected layer 1 with the svm layer directly also the training and testing model parameters are shared to make predictions of twsa using hydrological flux h f components climate indices c i components and sea surface temperature ssts components this procedure is aimed at estimating the impact of each individual set of hydrological variables in regulating terrestrial water storage changes in the csvm framework we detail the relationship among the activation function f kernel functions k m x x i non linear mapping function φ and the prediction function f x a i a i as i six activation function phases are employed in the csvm frame with the relu algorithm powering the first input transfer functions to the convolutional layer 1 the second transfer function which is powered by the sigmoid algorithm is transferred to the convolution layer 2 the third function transfers the convolution layer 2 to the convolution layer 3 the fourth function transfers the convolution layer 3 to the fully connected layer 2 the fifth function transfers the fully connected layer 1 to the fully connected layer 2 while the sixth function transfers the fully connected layer 2 to the outputs note the fully connected layer 2 maintains the attributes and characteristic values of all the other prior connections which enhance the output predictions ii the non linear mapping function φ can convey the fully connected layer 1 to the svm layer while the kernel functions k m x x i represents the transformation of φ fig 2 iii our output reconstruction model is built on the prediction function f x a i a i obtained in eq 5 in our experiment we updated all values in filters of the proposed convolution products using the ssom the ssom is regarded as a classic machine learning method due to its update mechanism yeh 2013 originally introduced by yeh the simplicity and efficiency of the ssom have been corroborated by past studies to be very useful in optimization and even data mining problems yeh 2015 the central idea of the ssom is that each variable for example the jth variable in the ith solution x i j undergoes a step wise update routine as suggested by yeh 2013 9 x i j g j if ρ 0 1 ϵ 0 c g p i j if ρ 0 1 ϵ c g c p x i j if ρ 0 1 ϵ c p c w x otherwise the value ρ 0 1 ϵ 0 1 is randomly generated by the system while the parameters c g c p c g c w c p and 1 c w all have a range of 0 1 which equally represent the probabilities of the existing variables that are derived from the best of all solutions i e the optimal ith solution the existing solution and a randomly generated feasible value respectively using the no free lunch theorem we customized and reduced the four items in eq 9 to three items in a bid to improve efficiency the c g c p and c w parameters are self adapted special equations are selected to replace g j p i j x i j and x which means that only a certain number of variables are selected to be updated regardless the ssom update mechanism is largely based on the stepwise function 3 2 one filter one variable greedy update mechanism in our proposed csvm it is required that all values in filters are variables that must be determined before the implementation of the convolution products using the traditional ssom this operation takes a very long time to achieve to by pass this limitation we introduce the one filter one variable greedy update mechanism which will allow this update while saving time the one filter one variable greedy update mechanism attempts to randomly select one prior solution from the pool for updating in each generation of the proposed ssom let s select a solution sol to be updated based on the given model 10 sol gbest if ρ 0 1 ϵ 0 c g 1 p 1 nsol if ρ 0 1 ϵ c g 1 c p 1 sol if ρ 0 1 ϵ c p 1 c w 1 0 otherwise where ρ 0 1 represents a random floating point generated from the interval 0 1 and p 1 nsol is an element of a real number ranging from 1 to nsol and represents the index of the randomly selected solution gbest represents the index of the best solution found while we assign 0 as a new randomly generated solution the process described next allows us to either discard or replace the newly updated solution x sol with the prior x sol value from eq 10 we select sol as the solution to be updated in the proposed new ssom we select randomly only one filter fil in solution sol given that fil 1 2 pfilter fil j moreover one additional variable for instance x sol fil k where k is given by 1 2 n var in filter x sol fil is equally selected at random to undergo the update process based on the steps outlined below 11 max min x sol fil k 1 20 ρ 0 03 0 09 2 2 where ρ 0 03 0 09 represents a randomly generated number in the update mechanism with 0 03 and 0 09 depicting the lower and upper bounds of the random number ρ the ρ interval is gotten from the optimal value of multi randomized trial and error results we adopted a step size of 0 045 in the local search to ensure we achieve an adequate optimal solution for our system after changing all variables in these filters x sol h to random numbers generated from 2 2 for all h fil we derive 12 x sol h l x sol h l if h fil or h fil and l k max min x sol h l 1 20 ρ 0 03 0 09 2 2 if h fil and l k ρ 2 2 otherwise also f x sol l f x sol f 1 for all values of l f note the condition for discarding the updated solutions x sol including the newly updated filters and variables is if their fitness values are not better than that of x sol that means 13 x sol x sol if f x s f x sol x otherwise 3 3 conventional models in twsa regressions to compare our proposed csvm model 3 3 1 multi linear regression a multi linear regression mlr model is an extension of the basic linear regression model having multiple predictor inputs and one predictand x i 1 x i 2 x i p 1 y i for i 1 2 n units of observation it reinfornces a simultaneous statistical interaction between the single continuous outcome y and the predictor variables x k k 1 2 p 1 14 y i β 0 β 1 x i 1 β 2 x i 2 β p 1 x i p 1 ε i where ε i n 0 σ 2 β 0 is the intercept the mean of y when all x k 0 and each β k represents a gradient with respect to x k the magnitude of change in the mean of y when x k is greater by one unit and all other predictor variables are held as constant 3 3 2 partial least squares regression the partial least square regression plsr model is a two edged multivariate tool as it combines the features from pca and mlr it attempts to decompose the mean data of x predictor variable and y predictand as 15 x n p t n 1 p p 1 e n p y n q u n 1 q q 1 f n q where n is the corresponding dependent samples t and u are latent vectors for the n observations p and q are the loading vectors while e and f are the residual vectors 3 3 3 back propagation neural network the back propagation neural network bpnn framework allows network neurons from one layer to connect to all the neurons in subsequent layers but with no lateral links within any layer or the possibility of feedback connections asides the input neuron which links only one input value to the corresponding weights the net input for each discrete neuron is the total of all input parameters each multiplied by its weight and a bias term building for two hidden layers we have 16 h p 1 i 1 n w p 1 x i z p h q 1 f h p 1 17 h q 1 i 1 n w q 1 h p 1 z q y p q f h q 1 where p q 1 6 n 22 with eqs 16 and 17 being models of the first and second hidden layers respectively the output value y p q can be calculated by feeding the net input and the parameters from the hidden layers into the transfer function of the neurons where h p 1 h q 1 represents neurons in the first and second hidden layers respectively w p 1 w q 1 are the varying weights originating from the input parameters to the last hidden layers respectively z p z q represents the supplementary weight projected for better predictions for the first to last hidden layers respectively y p q is the output which is directly a function of the second hidden layer but indirectly a function of the entire bpnn model 3 3 4 gaussian process regression the gaussian process regression gpr is a supervised non parametric kernel based probabilistic model it is a machine learning method based on the bayes theory and statistical learning theory considering the training set x i y i i 1 2 3 n where x i r d and y i r drawn from an indefinite distribution the gpr algorithm attempts to predict the value of a response variable y new given the new input vector x new which form the 30 testing datasets used in our experiment and the 70 training dataset a linear regression model is of the form 18 y x t β ε where ε n 0 σ 2 the priori distribution of the observation y eq 1 and the joint prior distribution of the observed y value and the predicted value y new can be obtained by 19 y n 0 k x x σ n 2 i n 20 y y new n 0 k x x σ n 2 i n k x x new k x new x k x new x new n 0 k k t k k where k x x is a symmetric positive definitive covariance matrix whose elements estimate the correlation between x i and x j through the chosen kernel function k x x k x x t represents the covariance matrix between the test sets x new and the training set x k x x is the covariance matrix of the test set itself i n represents an n by n unit matrix 4 results 4 1 fitting our algorithms to the three level 3 grace products the convolution based support vector machine presented in this study is designed to mimic the operation of the cnn using svms as regression models applies the same principle as the classification based svm operations the training phase used 70 of the input datasets to find the best fit line between the predictor and predictand the best fit line is the hyper plane with the maximum number of points that the csvm attempts to fit within a threshold value the csvm is unlike other conventional regression models for example mlr plsr bpnn that try to minimize the error between the actual and predicted value the threshold value is the distance between the boundary line and the hyper plane the csvm technique maintains a fit time complexity of above quadratic normal with the number of samples making it challenging to scale to datasets with extremely large samples like 20000 samples in fig 4 we demonstrate the comparison of the resulting output of the first order training models i e linear polynomial order 2 and rbf gamma 0 05 on the three variants of grace twsa used as our predictand i e the target output following our model fits we observe that for twsa gfz csvm rbf 1 made the best fit when compared to other variants fig 4g for twsa csr csvm poly 1 maintained the best fit compared to other variants fig 4c and for twsa jpl csvm poly 1 maintained the best fit compared to other variants fig 4f overall we observe that the reconstruction fit with the minimal bias was between the csvm poly 1 and the twsa csr among other twsa variants the csr product also showed minimal bias with the other first order models better than other grace variants explored in this experiment fig 4b e h this could be attributed mainly to the c30 replacement solutions from satellite laser ranging for this grace solution loomis et al 2019 and the degree 1 coefficient corrections applied to the solution using the estimates in tn 13a behzadpour et al 2021 which inadvertently led to a better fitting index in our csvm linear mode also the state of the art mascon gridded grace twsa products fig 1 are known to undergo glacial isostatic adjustment peltier et al 2018 and the monthly averages of the modeled non tidal ocean bottom pressure deviation chambers and bonin 2012 save et al 2016 corrections which makes them more suitable for hydrology ice mass and ocean bottom pressure mass change applications the reconstruction phase undertaken in both the first fig 4 and higher order fig 5 csvm levels utilized the total 22 predictors composed of the hfs cis and the ssts the regularization parameter was used to initialize the model to ensure the balance of weights and biases in the csvm training phase eq 2 explains the interpretation of the varying weights and bias terms used in the training the weights represented as extracts from the svm hyper plane are determined by obtaining the coordinates of the corresponding vectors orthogonal to the hyper plane given that the directions provide us with useful information about our twsa reconstruction exercise we take the dot product of any point with the vector to check if it belongs to the positive or negative class eq 1 throws more light on the operation of the weight and bias terms of our csvm algorithm in the higher order training models fig 5 which is characterized by the polynomial order 3 rbf gamma 0 02 and rbf gamma 0 03 kernels we observe the fitting index of our actual 3 variant grace tws products and predicted reconstructed twsa information for our model fits we note that for twsa gfz csvm poly 2 made the best fit when compared to other variants fig 5a for twsa csr csvm rbf 2 maintained the best fit compared to other variants fig 5e and for twsa jpl csvm poly 2 maintained the best fit compared to other variants fig 5c from both the first and higher order reconstruction phases we observe that the polynomial kernel reconstructed and predicted twsa better than other kernels this corroborates the superior performance of the polynomial kernel in regression exercises as has been reported in previous studies e g khalil et al 2006 yao et al 2017 the rbf kernels on the other hand exhibited significant performance in reconstructing twsa as highlighted in the first fig 4 and higher order fig 5 samples the popularity of the rbf kernels stems from their close similarity to k nearest neighborhood knn algorithm it equally possesses the advantages of the knn as well as overcomes the space complexity problems in the model given that they store the support vectors during training and not the entire dataset 4 2 estimating the impact of hf ci and ssts in regulating twsa past studies have explored the impacts of hydrological fluxes kalu et al 2021a climate indices ndehedehe et al 2017 and sea surface temperatures ndehedehe and ferreira 2020 in regulating tws fluctuations in different sub regions our experiment also attempts to assess the impacts of these three sets of climate variables extracted from our predictor classes in modeling twsa discretely extreme hydro meteorological conditions and significant hydrological fluctuations are erratic outcomes of variations in global and sub regional climate modes that impact on twsa for example global precipitation records display a mean increase of approximately 9 mm of precipitation over land areas during the twentieth century however reports have shown a drastic and increased frequency of wet days in many sub regions of the world and the escalated proportion of total precipitation beginning from the largest precipitation events in many of the world s largest freshwater reservoirs knapp et al 2008 this also plays a crucial role in twsa regulation as confirmed by the water budget equation tws p r et where p r and et represents precipitation runoff and evapotranspiration respectively also we notice that one hydrological product has a directly proportional effect in regulating the behavior of other hydrological products for example an increase in latent heat transfer leads to increase in land surface temperature evapotranspiration rates soil temperature and a substantial decrease in soil moisture this interplay between hydrological products provides significant information on their relevance in either directly or indirectly affecting twsa fig 6 shows that rbf 3 provided the best fit between the hydrological parameters and the averaged twsa we however notice a significant fitting range from month 11 to month 24 in our training samples fig 6a f months 10 25 represent wet months extracted to form part of our testing dataset this is yet another significant pointer to the dominance of precipitation rates in regulating twsa amidst the impacts of other hydrological products used in the modeling process another important thing to note is that month 11 24 is dominated by annual signals which also shows that in complex hydrological modeling our csvms performs poorly in multi annual time series this is usually noticed in large freshwater basins where the dynamics of the hydrological process are significantly strong such as the amazon river basin ndehedehe and ferreira 2020 therefore performing a csvm modeling procedure for such regions may not give optimal results especially due to their strong land atmosphere interaction and dynamics which results in extreme hydrological fluctuations ndehedehe et al 2020 kalu et al 2022b the study conducted by ndehedehe et al 2017 provided evidence of rapid changes in the global atmosphere and hydrological cycle due to the influence of climate variability such changes influence water resources resulting in incessant extreme hydro meteorological conditions the dominant impact of enso amo and iod indices in grace derived twsa was pointed out in their study our csvm attempts to relate these datasets with an averaged grace twsa exploring both first and higher order kernels our results show that the csvm poly 1 figs 6h 7h made the best attempt to relate these two products however compared to the hydrological products performance in estimating twsa we observe that the cis did not do well on their own in this modeling phase this however is not surprising as their influence on twsa is usually augmented by other hydrological products which did not form part of the training also the effect of these indices is generally localized while only a few of them like enso has a more dominant widespread force sst datasets performed better than climate indices in estimating the average twsa trends this is because i spatially distributed observations of the sst better represent oceanic variations than the single indices produced by the teleconnection patterns ii the gridded sst datasets for each month are composed of severally averaged sst components which provided the csvm a more robust training dataset than the climate indices iii sst predicts precipitation better than the pressure anomaly often used in the development of climate indices given that precipitation plays a dominant role in regulating twsa therefore sst properties outperform climate indices in estimating twsa our results however show that out of the three kernels used to make this estimation the csvm poly 1 figs 6n 7n produced the best fit between ssts and the averaged twsa the polynomial kernel has been shown to perform well in modeling predictands whose predictors do not maintain sufficient relationships between them even more than the rbf kernels this also shows us that the assertion made by izabatene et al 2010 which postulates that the increasing polynomial order increases accuracy in regression does not apply in all cases especially in cases of severe non linearity between predictors and predictands 4 3 performance of the different kernel variants used in our system the robustness of the cnn and svm in pattern recognition has been severely corroborated in many aspects of science as explained in the introduction here we pay specific attention to the performance of the linear polynomial and rbf kernels in our integrated csvm system the linear kernel is regarded as the simplest of all kernels it does not project data into a higher dimension but only operates with the inner product of the x and xi terms eq 6 with an optional constant in some cases however the benefit of the linear kernel is in its incredible simplicity the linear kernel is typically used on datasets with a significant amount of correlation therefore increasing the dimensionality of these datasets does not necessarily improve regression accuracy in our case the csvm linear showed a considerable regression fit for the three variants of twsa using the integrated inputs from the hf s ci s and sst s as predictors over test points 4 20 and 26 in the linear kernel we observed a bias of twsa gfz 0 049 mm 0 502 mm and 0 305 mm twsa csr 0 202 mm 0 157 mm and 0 365 mm and twsa jpl 0 355 mm 0 202 mm and 0 022 mm respectively table 3 however as the input datasets were segmented to hfs cis and ssts we observed a reduction in their regression strength for example over test points 7 21 and 36 we recorded a bias of av twsa h f 26 29 and 24 av twsa ci 59 57 and 60 and av twsa sst 41 43 and 39 respectively see table 4 the most negligible bias was noticed in regressions where the x values have a notable relationship with the xi values as shown in eq 6 this clearly shows that the linear kernel performs better when the predictors are significantly correlated with the predictand as opined originally in most cases results from the polynomial kernels proved to be more significant than the linear and rbf kernels the poly 1 kernel as used in this study represents the polynomial kernel of order 2 from table 3 we observed that over test points 4 20 and 6 a bias of twsa gfz 0 000 mm 0 516 mm and 0 584 mm twsa csr 0 018 mm 0 000 mm 0 108 mm and tws jpl 0 000 mm 0 001 mm 0 082 mm respectively was achieved in the reconstruction process from the segmented test points in table 4 we recorded a bias of av twsa hf 26 27 23 av twsa ci 53 57 60 and av twsa sst 35 36 37 over test points 7 21 and 36 respectively the poly 2 kernel on the other hand represents polynomial kernel of order 3 over test point 4 20 and 36 we observed a bias of twsa gfz 0 000 mm 0 000 mm 0 000 mm twsa csr 0 000 mm 0 000 mm 0 001 mm and twsa jpl 0 000 mm 0 002 mm 0 000 mm respectively for the segmented datasets that estimated the impacts of hfs ci s and ssts we recorded over test points 7 21 and 36 a bias of av twsa hf 19 22 26 av twsa ci 52 49 51 and av twsa ssts 40 29 34 respectively was determined the results from the polynomial order 2 and 3 kernels are quite similar to the linear and rbf kernel in trends but differ in the fine tuned accuracy index especially in cases where the predictors are significantly correlated to the predictands tables 3 4 this is not surprising as the polynomial kernel unlike the other kernel takes the inner products from a higher dimensional space to aid regression fits this is why the csvm poly 2 fit which assessed order three outperformed the csvm poly 1 which only assessed order two in most cases this shows that the higher order we access the more fitted our predictors get to the predictands however this is not usually the best case as it commonly leads to over fitting therefore we avoided making use of polynomial orders higher than 3 to avoid over fitting and subsequent compromising of our result integrity we also explored the robustness of the rbf kernels which have been reported to have better fitting capabilities than other svm kernels khalil et al 2006 the rbf kernel is composed of a free parameter that scales the amount of effect two points have on each other it is usually represented as gamma γ unlike the polynomial kernel which looks at the extra dimensions that can be explored the rbf expands into an infinite number of dimensions this is as a result of the expansion of the polynomial for example from eq 8 let us use the gamma value γ assigned to csvm rbf 1 which is 1 20 and expand the exponential 21 k 3 x x i exp 1 2 γ 2 x x i 2 exp 1 200 x 2 x i 2 2 x x i exp x 2 x i 2 200 exp x x i we now expand exp x x i into infinite dimensions using a taylor series approximation like this 22 exp x x i 1 1 1 x x i 1 2 x x i 2 1 200 x x i 200 1 x x i this expansion helps to fine tune its reconstructive fitting index and minimizes regression loss significantly from our study we divided the csvm rbf kernel into three to explore the capabilities of three different intermediate gamma values csvm rbf 1 has gamma value of 0 05 csvm rbf 2 has gamma value of 0 02 and csvm rbf 3 has gamma of 0 03 for rbf 1 our results show that over test points 4 20 and 26 we observed a bias of twsa gfz 0 008 mm 0 004 mm 0 012 mm twsa csr 0 008 mm 0 016 mm 0 007 mm tws jpl 0 004 mm 0 000 mm 0 000 mm respectively for the segmented predictors that measured percentage impact table 4 over test points 7 21 and 36 we recorded a bias of av twsa hf 18 20 21 av twsa ci 46 49 48 av twsa sst 38 36 35 respectively for rbf 2 our results show that over test points 4 20 and 26 table 3 we recorded a bias of tws gfz 0 008 mm 0 002 mm 0 011 mm tws csr 0 001 mm 0 005 mm 0 002 mm tws jpl 0 001 mm 0 008 mm 0 010 mm respectively for the segmented predictors that measured percentage impact table 4 over test points 7 21 and 36 we recorded a bias of av twsa hf 25 16 12 av twsa ci 48 50 38 av twsa sst 30 28 31 respectively for rbf 3 our results show that over test points 4 20 and 26 table 3 we observed a bias of tws gfz 0 001 mm 0 007 mm 0 006 mm twsa csr 0 000 mm 0 001 mm 0 006 mm twsa jpl 0 041 mm 0 002 mm 0 001 mm respectively for the segmented predictors that measured percentage impact table 4 over test points 7 21 and 36 we observed a bias of av twsa hf 19 16 14 av twsa ci 44 47 40 av twsa sst 26 32 23 respectively the rbf kernel performed significantly better than the linear kernel in both cases this was to be expected given that the kernel is equivalent to the inner product of the two data points having an infinite number of dimensions as described in eq 15 our optimal gamma and epsilon values were generated using the grid search method fig 3 it generated the least bias between predictors and predictand even in the case of the segmented predictors to estimate the influence of hfs cis and ssts on the averaged twsa tables 3 4 the percentage fit represented in table 5 shows that all the kernels performed relatively well in fitting twsa in case 1 however the polynomial kernels were more consistent in fitting the trends of twsa gfz twsa csr and twsa jpl more than the linear and rbf kernels also in case 2 we noticed that the csvm poly 2 performed better in the sst a tws relationship while the rbfs dominated in percentage fits for the hydrological flux and climate indices associated to the averaged twsa this is in line with the assertion from previous studies that the rbf kernels are more robust in performing non linear regressions and this experiment has corroborated this assertion even in hydrological operations 4 4 comparison between csvm and other conventional models in tws regression the strength of our convolution based svm was tested with other conventional regression algorithms to determine their fit index using the same datasets in modeling twsa gfz using the mlr we observed that the mlr performed better in fitting testing months 15 36 than the testing months 1 14 however this was not the case for twsa csr and jpl as the prediction accuracy and fit dropped even in testing months 15 36 this bias in the csr and jpl predictions shows the unpredictability of the mlr in reconstructing several variants of the twsa given its significant non linearity the partial least square regression model has been shown to be extremely robust in hydrological predictions okwuashi et al 2020 ndehedehe and ferreira 2020 ndehedehe et al 2021 in our experiment the plsr model better reconstructed the twsa csr and twsa jpl than the twsa gfz its robustness is seen in the fitting index however significant regression errors were noticed in the fitting of the twsa especially in the first 30 months fig 8d f the csvm outperforms the plsr in the fitting index as shown in table 6 given that a standard deviation of twsa gfz 0 455 twsa csr 0 317 and twsa jpl 0 373 was recorded for the plsr in contrast the polynomial kernel of order 2 poly 2 showed a standard deviation of twsa gfz 0 147 twsa csr 0 111 and twsa jpl 0 124 this shows that the plsr is more affected in cases of disturbed predictor signals low concentration impacts and significant non linearity in the correlation estimates of predictor and predictands more than our csvm the bpnn s are historically known for performing a series of linear combinations integrated with non linear activation functions across several layers our experiment showed that they modeled twsa better than the csvm linear and csvm poly 1 kernel variants however the rbf kernels outperformed them as shown in table 6 regardless we suggest that the bpnn has the potential of outperforming the csvm in a case of high dimensional large data sets since this study made use of only 22 original input predictors however the performance of the bpnn in reconstructing twsa using a high dimensional large data set is left as possible dispute for further research the gpr is a new non parametric bayesian approach in reconstruction and regression exercises and is making waves in machine learning it performed significantly well in modeling twsa especially the twsa jpl fig 8l this is to be expected as the strength of the gpr is mostly dominant in cases of small to medium input datasets also given that the prediction is probabilistic it allows the system to estimate the confidence intervals and make decisions based on those that should go for re fitting the prediction regardless the robustness of the exponentiated quadratic kernel of the gpr which was applied in this regression outperformed all the csvm kernels used in this study except the csvm rbf 3 kernel this shows that in cases of kernel sampling of the gpr it is possible to achieve better results from the gpr than our csvm we also estimate the regression loss of all the system models in reconstructing twsa fig 9 shows that the model with the highest regression loss of the three twsa variants in the mlr which is not too robust in modeling significantly non linear systems like its counterparts the svm poly 2 performed best in this analysis as it shows the smallest regression loss regardless the new gpr is a potential algorithm that has the tendency of adequately predicting hydrological variables having small to medium input datasets however its application in a similar study exploring its different kernels will provide more information on its capabilities and robustness in twsa reconstructions 5 discussion 5 1 coupling the convolution neural network with support vector machine the convolution based support vector machine has proved to be a very useful tool in data science as it was shown to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of mining small to medium range yeh et al 2021 the csvm used in our study showed significant efficiency in performing non linear operations this shows that the assimilation of cnn methods with the svm is very robust in hydrological analysis the cnn is known for its proficiency in generating optimal filters that aid the extraction of in depth features of their corresponding datasets gu et al 2018 whereas the svm which has been shown to be a robust machine learning tool composed of a significant non linear mapping skill with the ability to efficiently map big data inputs into their corresponding high dimensional feature space and performing regression analysis in its feature space using a structural risk minimization approach mi et al 2019 therefore our idea of combining these two powerful algorithms is in line with the recent integrated and deep learning methods that are taking over the world of machine learning in recent times our original input datasets have 22 sets of data which were composed of hf datasets ci datasets and sst datasets using these original input datasets we built and trained our cnn model our cnn model was characterized by three convolution layers and two fully connected layers we utilized the relu and adam algorithms as the activation and optimization function for our first hidden layer while we used the sigmoid algorithm as the activation function for the second hidden layer the svm was fed with input features from the fully connected layer 1 of the cnn model after which the svm operation begins the svm used the grid search optimizer to investigate the ε and c values which helped in enhancing the robustness and generalization of the svm model after saving the cnn and svm models we reloaded the training model into the system while we rebuilt the testing model we also used the well known ssom in updating all the filter values of our proposed convolution products yeh 2013 has described the ssom as a classic machine learning technique as a result of its robust update mechanism which has been found to be effective in data science and even optimization problems we segmented the training and testing models to make predictions of an averaged twsa using hf s ci s and ssts this procedure was arranged to be able to estimate the extent and impact of these sets of climate observations in regulating region based twsa from our experiment we found that while the hf dataset provided the most significant impact on twsa regulation the ci dataset was the least the low rate of the sst in regulating twsa was attributed to the single indices parameters produced by teleconnection patterns the discrete monthly datasets provided by the ci s as opposed to the gridded datasets provided by ssts and rainfall datasets and the weak correlation of pressure anomaly used to develop ssts compared to sst used to predict precipitation these results also showed that the csvm provides better results in cases of more robust input parameters 5 2 csvm based kernels used for twsa reconstruction in our experiment we used the three variants of twsa to serve as our predictands i e twsa gfz twsa csr and twsa jpl we extracted the twsa from january 2003 to december 2012 grace data has been significantly applied to water related and hydrological studies over the years however a big problem for researchers is that significant data gaps are noticed in the mission from april 2002 to july 2019 a total of 163 monthly observations were made by the mission whereas 24 monthly datasets are missing see fig 1 of ahi and cekim 2021 this show over 14 of missing data and this value can affect accuracy and precision especially in hydro geodetic operations the purpose of using the three variants of the grace twsa as independent validation models was to ascertain the performance of our csvm algorithm in reconstructing them individually we leveraged on the gaussian smoothing and de correlation filtering that has been applied to the grace level 3 products to enable a swift and more robust regression of our proposed algorithm 70 of our original input variable was used to train our model while 30 was used for testing the model performance and the fitting index to our three variant twsa table 2 we refrained from training with more datasets to avoid over fitting and subsequent compromising our result integrity we segmented our linear polynomial and rbf kernels into six more parts having i csvm linear ii csvm poly 1 iii csvm poly 2 iv csvm rbf 1 v csvm rbf 2 vi csvm rbf 3 where ii and iii only differ as a result of the polynomial order of 2 and 3 used respectively and iv v and vi only differ as a result of the gamma value of 0 05 0 03 and 0 02 used respectively from fig 10 we observe that csvm poly 1 made the best fit for twsa gfz fig 10d twsa csr fig 10e and twsa jpl fig 10f when compared to the other kernel variants we attribute the difference in fitting index of these kernels to the prior corrections and de correlations that some of these twsa mascon products have undergone for example the twsa csr variant which maintained a minimal bias with the other first order models better than the other twsa variants was recorded to have undergone a c30 replacement solution from satellite laser ranging for the grace solution and have also had the degree 1 coefficient corrections applied to the solution using the estimates in the tn 13a loomis et al 2019 behzadpour et al 2021 this inadvertently led to a better fitting index in our first order csvm kernels for the csr solutions the weights and bias terms of our first and higher order csvm kernels were balanced using the regularization parameter eq 2 in our higher order training models shown in fig 11 we explored the robustness of csvm poly2 csvm rbf 2 and csvm rbf 3 in reconstructing our three variant twsa results from our analysis show that csvm poly 2 made the best fit for twsa gfz fig 11a twsa csr fig 11b and twsa jpl fig 11c patterns overall we observed that the polynomial kernels reconstructed and predicted twsa better that the other kernels the rbf kernels also performed well in reconstructing twsa especially in the first order kernels fig 10g i given that the rbf kernel bears a significant resemblance to the knn algorithm it equally retains the advantages of both knn as well this provides it with robust techniques for overcoming the space complexity problems postulated by most models thus their proficiency in reconstruction tasks nevertheless we must note that since the proposed model provided good performance in twsa reconstructions as clearly shown in the represented results fig 7 tables 3 5 we observe that the minimal bias is obtained in our experiment only when the twsa variant undergoes corrections in a case of raw twsa observations the fitting index of the csvm is likely to reduce the proposed model also poses significant restrictions on kernel use as the higher order kernels did not provide better results in all cases better than the first order kernels for example the polynomial kernel showed that its assessment of higher orders improved the relationship of the predicted models with hfs ci s and sst fig 6c i o tables 3 and 4 parameters while the rbf kernel was the opposite figs 10g i 11d i regardless we must note that the assessment of higher orders is not usually the best option in machine learning because the assessment of higher orders greater than 3 could lead to over fitting of the system model thus compromising the integrity of the output results kalu et al 2022a 5 3 impact assessment of the predictor signals on twsa we also explored the impact extent of hfs cis and ssts on twsa results from our analysis show that hydrological fluxes impact more on twsa than ci s and ssts this is due to the huge role that the precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff variables play in the water budget equation however we could not achieve a 100 fit between hydrological fluxes and twsa because of the contributing factors of other variables whose influences were not captured in our model as well as the result of non linear interaction between hydrological parameters however we see that the best fits for the hydrological fluxes were in months 11 24 which are dominated by annual signals therefore performing our proposed algorithm in regions with heightened dynamics of surface water and hydrological interactions may not be a good idea as a majority of those locations are mostly dominated by multi annual time series such as the congo river basin kalu et al 2021a and the amazon river basin ndehedehe and ferreira 2020 the ci s contributed the least in regulating twsa due to the localized nature of their data types even though some of them have dominant widespread influence like the enso however our algorithm shows that the csvm rbf 3 made the best fit in relating hfs and twsa figs 6f 7f the csvm poly 1 made the best fit in relating ci s with twsa figs 6h 7h while the csvm poly 1 also made the best fit in relating ssts with twsa figs 6n 7n this throws more light on the potential of the polynomial kernel in relating climate variables with hydrological variables especially given their tendency to look for extra dimensions that can be explored also we opine that the polynomial kernel tends to perform well in modeling predictands whose predictors don t maintain significant relationships between them therefore they can be very useful in modeling extremely non linear climate systems also the percentage fit index shown in table 5 clearly represents all the kernel variants in reconstructing twsa especially in case 1 we noticed however that the rbf kernels provided a more consistent fitting trend for our three variant predictand twsa more than the other kernels in case 2 we equally noticed that the csvm poly 2 performed better in estimating the impact of sst on the averaged twsa while the rbf kernels dominated in terms of percentage fits for both hydrological flux and climate indices impact estimation on the averaged twsa 5 4 comparing csvm with conventional methods we also compared our algorithm with other models that are well known for regression analysis such as the mlr plsr the bpnn and the gpr the bpnn and gpr outperformed our first order kernels in most cases fig 8 table 6 for example in modeling twsa gfz the gpr achieved a standard deviation of 0 110 which was only surpassed by a standard deviation of 0 097 achieved by the csvm rbf 3 kernel and 0 024 achieved by the csvm poly 2 in twsa csr the gpr achieved a standard deviation of 0 016 which was better than the results achieved from all of our kernel and for twsa jpl the gpr achieved a standard deviation of 0 021 but was outperformed by the csvm poly 1 0 009 csvm poly 2 0 004 csvm rbf 2 0 020 and the csvm rbf 3 0 011 variants this shows that on an average the csvm poly 2 and csvm rbf 3 kernels outperformed every other conventional kernel used fig 9 in reconstructing grace twsa however the gpr has proved to be significantly efficient in relating non linear climatic variables and poses to be a very interesting reconstruction tool even for higher order climate exercises 6 conclusion the increasing change in our global climate is evidenced in the severe non linearity noticed in the relationship between hydrological and climate datasets in recent times it is therefore pertinent to explore the capabilities of existing machine learning techniques to enhance their predictive abilities to comfortably tackle the growing non linearity in hydrological analysis our study introduced an integration of the convoluted neural network with the support vector machine to improve prediction and reconstruction of the grace twsa the major take away from our study are outlined below i the influence of climate variability over the congo river basin is evidenced in the rapid changes in the global atmosphere and hydrological cycle witnessed over the region this influence resulted in sst having a significantly stronger impact in regulating twsa over the basin when compared to climate indices ii the rbf kernel showed substantial strength in performing non linear regression as evidenced in its superior percentage fits for the hydrological flux and climate indices interaction with the averaged twsa case 2 the polynomial kernel on the other hand proved to be more consistent in fitting trends and reconstructing the twsa gfz twsa csr and twsa jpl more than the linear and rbf kernels iii for the rbf kernel the use of very small gamma values makes the model mimic the procedure of a linear model while the use of very large gamma values usually lead to over fitting the model the intermediate kernel values ranging from 0 05 to 0 5 are ideal for climatic and hydrological operations iv the superiority of the csvm over the compared traditional machine learning algorithms is evidence that the growing non linearity of climatic variables can be addressed by improving the efficiency and robustness of existing machine learning methods this could be achieved by tuning the hyper parameters of existing models increasing the neuron set in the hidden layer to deepen the network or coupling two robust algorithms regardless continuous mathematical operations are required to accommodate the growing non linearity in hydrological studies the conventional models used in comparing the csvm shows great promise in accurately reconstructing predicting or tracking twsa signals by exploring their full individual capabilities they possess the capability of challenging integrated learning methods in accurate hydrological regression operations one of such models is the gpr which is a relatively new regression approach whose impact in hydrological studies is yet to be fully explored we therefore recommend it for future applications in a similar operation to conclusively determine its strength robustness and

7709,study region the congo river basin in west central africa study focus traditional machine learning algorithms are recently being replaced by integrated learning techniques in pattern recognitions and predictions these updated tools or techniques which attempt to explore higher dimensions and uncover hidden patterns in considerably non linear datasets are the new normal in small medium and large dataset even in higher orders this study investigates the performance of a convolution based support vector machine in hydrological analysis to optimize forecast of terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa the linear polynomial and radial basis function rbf kernels were explored in reconstructing the three variants of twsa obtained from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace level 3 products using the original input training datasets we built and trained the convolution neural network cnn which is composed of convolution and fully connected layers and was integrated into the traditional support vector machine svm the network was trained with twenty two 22 datasets the original predictor datasets are composed of hydrological fluxes hf climate indices ci and sea surface temperature sst datasets whose influence on grace twsa was analyzed in the body of our work our results show that the polynomial kernel based on the convolution based support vector machine csvm outperformed the other regression models in the reconstruction of all variants of twsa the high accuracy achieved using the csvm demonstrates its promising potential to fill the gaps in the missing grace observations through its refined reconstruction capabilities new hydrological insight for the region in this study i sst variants or components e g those of east tropical atlantic were leading predictors of twsa ii increasing polynomial order does not increase accuracy in all polynomial kernel operations especially in cases of severe non linearity between predictors and predictands iii for the rbf kernels intermediate gamma values ranging from 0 05 to 0 5 are ideal for climatic analysis as very small or very large gamma values will either behave like a linear model or over fit respectively and iv overall the polynomial kernels reconstructed and predicted twsa better than the other kernels the other conventional machine learning procedures used to compare the fit of the csvm show significant insight for future twsa reconstruction processes their robustness can be explored by varying the independent variables fed into the machine learning framework and tuning their hyper

machine hydrology terrestrial water storage anomalies data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction machine learning techniques tailored towards extensive examination and learning between considerably non linear datasets of varying quality have undergone significant advancements over the past decade its applications in medicine chang et al 2010 engineering guo et al 2021 image classification okwuashi and ndehedehe 2020 speech recognition el ayadi et al 2011 and bioinformatics guo 2014 is a pointer to its vast role and importance in various multi disciplinary studies among the numerous machine learning algorithms applied over the years the support vector machine technique has considerable relevance in pattern recognition for both small and big data analysis chen et al 2016 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission has been applied in various water related studies such as flood potential assessments drought monitoring groundwater storage estimates global sea level changes and ocean mass analysis see e g kalu et al 2021a ndehedehe and ferreira 2020 and references therein however the large number of corrections and uncertainties involved in the processing chain of this data results in the introduction of inherent errors which impose restrictions on its use for instance in the first 163 months of the mission s operation 24 monthly missing data were recorded ahi and cekim 2021 this lag in twsa makes room for the reconstruction of the grace time series using integrated machine learning procedures to improve the accuracy of hydrological studies based on the grace data several machine learning regression learners have been applied in predicting terrestrial water storage changes and this includes physically based algorithms fisher et al 2008 data assimilation da methods liu et al 2021 empirical semi empirical algorithms humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 yao et al 2015 traditionally physically based algorithms rely on data from satellite and meteorological observations for twsa learning therefore compared to data driven algorithms their simulation results differ substantially due to large errors from too many input variables and uncertainty in the model structures yao et al 2017 da models which are popularly known for the assimilation of satellite based parameters into biophysical or land surface models to improve estimations of a system state xu et al 2011 have been associated with a long standing limitation this limitation is that the model accuracy of the da systems has been reported to be severely affected by the accuracy of the satellite based input variables yao et al 2017 by dominating the effect of the model variables and thus impedes its robustness and efficiency in twsa reconstructions empirical semi empirical algorithms integrate ground measured observations key meteorological parameters and satellite based datasets in learning twsa patterns their modeling procedures establishes relationships between the input and output variable which is a sound theoretical process however they rely on a significant number of training datasets for all the behaviors found in the system which impedes their robustness also their large data requirement is not feasible in many data deficient regions and can equally reduce their computational efficiency and accuracy in making predictions kalu et al 2022c our study attempts to utilize data driven algorithms to bring a balance between satellite and model based data types this procedure promises to enhance the reconstruction process and improve predictions of the twsa variable for effective hydro geodetic operations and assessments kalu et al 2021b c our study introduces a convolution based support vector machine csvm for the grace time series reconstruction procedure the support vector machine has been reported to bring about a steady balance between satellite based and model based datasets in hydrological studies yao et al 2017 liu et al 2021 enhancing its modeling robustness and predictions capabilities even in severely non linear system states the goal is to attain reliable machine learning techniques with accuracy and efficiency that can successfully reconstruct observations from the grace mission apart from making up for the missing monthly grace time series our algorithm can also be relied on for making twsa predictions for 1 to 3 month lead times in our experiments i we utilized the three variants of the grace twsa i e gfz csr and jpl to observe which time series our algorithm favors the most ii our input dataset was segmented into hydrological fluxes climate indices and ssts so we can measure the impact of each set in reconstructing twsa iii to fine tune our reconstruction procedure we utilized various kernels of the svm in our proposed model iv we also made comparisons to other conventional regression models to ascertain the integrity and robustness of our proposed algorithm the procedures achieved from our study objectives sufficiently supported and actualized our study aim our proposed csvm employs a supervised learning technique based on the simplified swarm optimization model ssom this integrated technique promises to harness the advantages of both svm and deep learning to enhance the prediction capabilities accuracies and tests of the traditional svm technique the convolution based svm works by assimilating svm with the imperative operation techniques of convolution neural networks cnns including convolution and strides aimed at augmenting the capabilities of the traditional svm it also utilizes the one solution technique one filter and one variable greedy ssom update mechanism to inhibit the solutions that are near optimum not to achieve their current positions our proposed csvm also promises to reduce the run time of our entire system process in reconstructing terrestrial water storage 2 data and implementation the processing management and distribution of grace satellite data are jointly undertaken by the german research center for geosciences gfz the center for space research csr and the jet propulsion laboratory jpl which were all used in this study the grace products included several levels 0 1 a 1b 2 and 3 the current providers of mascon data include csr jpl and nasa goddard space flight center gsfc nevertheless we preferred to use the solutions based on the grace raw data and background models otherwise it would result in heterogeneousness of the tws anomalies generated by the different mascons fig 1 which also makes it difficult to compare them among themselves therefore we utilized the grace level 3 rl06 and water equivalent thickness produced by the gfz csr and jpl for our study https podaac tools jpl nasa gov drive files alldata tellus l3 grace land mass rl06 we attempt to use the three variants of our grace derived twsa fig 1 as independent predictand models this was to ascertain the performance of our csvm algorithm in reconstructing them individually especially given that the level 3 products have undergone gaussian smoothing and de correlation filtering to minimize correlation errors in them swenson and wahr 2006 this procedure however is a factor that hinders machine learning predictions reconstructions in most grace datasets our data testing and training period is january 2003 december 2012 for our study we made use of various input predictors for our reconstruction process which was segmented as i hydrological fluxes ii climate indices iii sea surface temperatures however we explored the result of the reconstruction process by integrating the three segments of these original input datasets 2 1 hydrological fluxes the following products formed part of the variables representing hydrological fluxes hf in our test bed i trmm base precipitation ii albedo iii wind speed at 10 m iv runoff v evapotranspiration vi atmospheric pressure vii soil moisture viii surface

from the national aerospace and space administration nasa goddard space flight center gsfc merged with the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurements imerg datasets ii to ix were extracted from global land data assimilation model gldas and formed part of our hydrological flux predictors of twsa 2 2 climate indices for the climate indices ci the following products formed part of the variables representing the global climate indices we also attach their download links as shown in table 1 below 2 3 sea surface temperatures the sea surface temperature sst products applied in this study include ninos 1 2 0 10 s 90 80 w 3 0 5 n 5s 150 90 w 3 4 5 n 5s 170 120 w and 4 0 5 n 5s 160e 150 w other sst products such as the nta north tropical atlantic eta east tropical atlantic and sta south tropical atlantic from the atlantic ocean were also used in our analysis the averaged sst datasets from 2003 to 2012 used in this study was downloaded from https www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data noaa oisst v2 html to reconstruct twsa using our csvm model we first explored a training model encompassing the datasets from the hydrological flux class climate indices class and the sea surface temperature class our attempt to reconstruct twsa was based on these 22 predictors table 2 aimed at having a strong regression model despite the severe non linearity of our model we explored first order kernel variants and higher order kernel variants to ascertain their regression strengths and also comment on their robustness in reconstructing the three variants of twsa which served as our dependent variables for the first order kernels we explored the linear kernel eq 6 the polynomial kernel of order 2 eq 7 and the rbf kernel eq 8 of gamma 0 05 then for the higher order kernels we implemented the polynomial kernel of order 3 eq 7 and the rbf kernels of gamma 0 03 and 0 02 respectively eq 8 for our training we made use of 70 of our total predictors hf ci sst these independent variables were trained with i twsa gfz ii twsa csr and iii twsa jpl which served as their corresponding dependent variables after estimating the performance of our different kernels on the three dependent variables we segmented our predictors into i hydrological fluxes ii climate indices and sea surface temperatures table 2 to be able to investigate the individual performance of these three sects in modeling twsa using both first and higher order kernels in our csvm 3 materials and methods 3 1 convolution based support vector machine framework our modeled csvm made use of a convolution product in its operation by combining the cnn method with the svm method cnns are popularly known for their ability to create good filters and extract the in depth features of their training dataset efficiently for each convolution layer we formalized the convolution operation as follows 1 h ij k f w k x ij b k where f represent the activation function w k and b k represents the weights and bias terms of the kth feature map respectively the svm is a robust machine learning technique that is largely based on the structural risk minimization approach it is characterized by a proficient non linear mapping performance which has the capabilities of efficiently mapping big data inputs into their respective high dimensional feature space as well as performing linear regression in its feature space mi et al 2019 the regression formula of the model is given by 2 f x w t φ x b where φ represents the non linear mapping function and the respective weights and bias terms are represented by w and b the svm optimization model is given by 3 min w b ξ ξ 0 5 w t w c i 1 n ξ i ξ i 4 s t y i w x i b ε ξ i w x i b y i ε ξ i i 1 2 l ξ i ξ i 0 where l and n represent the number of samples ξ i ξ i represents the upper and lower training errors respectively x i and y i represents the inputs and outputs of the training data respectively ε and c represents the insensitive loss factor and the regularized constant respectively to generate the prediction function f we utilize the lagrange multipliers a i and a i as follows 5 f x a i a i i 1 n a i a i k m x x i b m 1 2 3 where k m is the kernel function and in this study we made use of the linear k 1 the polynomial k 2 and the radial basis function gaussian k 3 kernels fig 2 whose formulas are given below 6 k 1 x x i x t x i 7 k 2 x x i 1 x t x i q where q represents the order of the polynomial kernel we used order 2 and 3 for this study 8 k 3 x x i exp x x i 2 2 γ 2 where γ represent the optimal gamma value we used gamma values 0 05 0 02 and 0 03 for this study eqs 6 7 and 8 represents the linear polynomial and rbf kernels respectively fig 2 fig 3 provides the computational steps of the csvm and is summarized as follows 1 use the original input training datasets to build and train the cnn model each cnn model is composed of three convolution layers and two fully connected layers the convolution layers occupy channels 4 8 and 16 respectively the relu and adam algorithms were used as the activation and optimization function for the first hidden layer and for the second hidden layer we employed the sigmoid algorithm as the activation function also we attempted to enhance the generalization performance of the cnn model by utilizing the capabilities of the dropout and lasso regularization techniques in our multi layered architecture as explained by cai and liu 2016 and ambach and schmid 2017 we used the drop out ratio of p 0 7 between the convolution layer 3 and fully connected layer 1 the lasso regularization maintained a proportion of 0 01 while the loss function represents the summation of the average mean squared error and lasso regularization 2 the fully connected layer 1 of the cnn model is extracted to serve as the input features of the svm then the modeling and training of the svm framework commence using the grid search optimizer we searched for ε and c the grid search searches in a random order using uniform sampling without replacement from the grid this was useful in improving the generalization and robustness of the svm model 3 save the training models of the cnn and svm fig 3 4 the training model is reloaded into the system and the testing model is rebuilt the building of the testing model is achieved by interfacing the fully connected layer 1 with the svm layer directly also the training and testing model parameters are shared to make predictions of twsa using hydrological flux h f components climate indices c i components and sea surface temperature ssts components this procedure is aimed at estimating the impact of each individual set of hydrological variables in regulating terrestrial water storage changes in the csvm framework we detail the relationship among the activation function f kernel functions k m x x i non linear mapping function φ and the prediction function f x a i a i as i six activation function phases are employed in the csvm frame with the relu algorithm powering the first input transfer functions to the convolutional layer 1 the second transfer function which is powered by the sigmoid algorithm is transferred to the convolution layer 2 the third function transfers the convolution layer 2 to the convolution layer 3 the fourth function transfers the convolution layer 3 to the fully connected layer 2 the fifth function transfers the fully connected layer 1 to the fully connected layer 2 while the sixth function transfers the fully connected layer 2 to the outputs note the fully connected layer 2 maintains the attributes and characteristic values of all the other prior connections which enhance the output predictions ii the non linear mapping function φ can convey the fully connected layer 1 to the svm layer while the kernel functions k m x x i represents the transformation of φ fig 2 iii our output reconstruction model is built on the prediction function f x a i a i obtained in eq 5 in our experiment we updated all values in filters of the proposed convolution products using the ssom the ssom is regarded as a classic machine learning method due to its update mechanism yeh 2013 originally introduced by yeh the simplicity and efficiency of the ssom have been corroborated by past studies to be very useful in optimization and even data mining problems yeh 2015 the central idea of the ssom is that each variable for example the jth variable in the ith solution x i j undergoes a step wise update routine as suggested by yeh 2013 9 x i j g j if ρ 0 1 ϵ 0 c g p i j if ρ 0 1 ϵ c g c p x i j if ρ 0 1 ϵ c p c w x otherwise the value ρ 0 1 ϵ 0 1 is randomly generated by the system while the parameters c g c p c g c w c p and 1 c w all have a range of 0 1 which equally represent the probabilities of the existing variables that are derived from the best of all solutions i e the optimal ith solution the existing solution and a randomly generated feasible value respectively using the no free lunch theorem we customized and reduced the four items in eq 9 to three items in a bid to improve efficiency the c g c p and c w parameters are self adapted special equations are selected to replace g j p i j x i j and x which means that only a certain number of variables are selected to be updated regardless the ssom update mechanism is largely based on the stepwise function 3 2 one filter one variable greedy update mechanism in our proposed csvm it is required that all values in filters are variables that must be determined before the implementation of the convolution products using the traditional ssom this operation takes a very long time to achieve to by pass this limitation we introduce the one filter one variable greedy update mechanism which will allow this update while saving time the one filter one variable greedy update mechanism attempts to randomly select one prior solution from the pool for updating in each generation of the proposed ssom let s select a solution sol to be updated based on the given model 10 sol gbest if ρ 0 1 ϵ 0 c g 1 p 1 nsol if ρ 0 1 ϵ c g 1 c p 1 sol if ρ 0 1 ϵ c p 1 c w 1 0 otherwise where ρ 0 1 represents a random floating point generated from the interval 0 1 and p 1 nsol is an element of a real number ranging from 1 to nsol and represents the index of the randomly selected solution gbest represents the index of the best solution found while we assign 0 as a new randomly generated solution the process described next allows us to either discard or replace the newly updated solution x sol with the prior x sol value from eq 10 we select sol as the solution to be updated in the proposed new ssom we select randomly only one filter fil in solution sol given that fil 1 2 pfilter fil j moreover one additional variable for instance x sol fil k where k is given by 1 2 n var in filter x sol fil is equally selected at random to undergo the update process based on the steps outlined below 11 max min x sol fil k 1 20 ρ 0 03 0 09 2 2 where ρ 0 03 0 09 represents a randomly generated number in the update mechanism with 0 03 and 0 09 depicting the lower and upper bounds of the random number ρ the ρ interval is gotten from the optimal value of multi randomized trial and error results we adopted a step size of 0 045 in the local search to ensure we achieve an adequate optimal solution for our system after changing all variables in these filters x sol h to random numbers generated from 2 2 for all h fil we derive 12 x sol h l x sol h l if h fil or h fil and l k max min x sol h l 1 20 ρ 0 03 0 09 2 2 if h fil and l k ρ 2 2 otherwise also f x sol l f x sol f 1 for all values of l f note the condition for discarding the updated solutions x sol including the newly updated filters and variables is if their fitness values are not better than that of x sol that means 13 x sol x sol if f x s f x sol x otherwise 3 3 conventional models in twsa regressions to compare our proposed csvm model 3 3 1 multi linear regression a multi linear regression mlr model is an extension of the basic linear regression model having multiple predictor inputs and one predictand x i 1 x i 2 x i p 1 y i for i 1 2 n units of observation it reinfornces a simultaneous statistical interaction between the single continuous outcome y and the predictor variables x k k 1 2 p 1 14 y i β 0 β 1 x i 1 β 2 x i 2 β p 1 x i p 1 ε i where ε i n 0 σ 2 β 0 is the intercept the mean of y when all x k 0 and each β k represents a gradient with respect to x k the magnitude of change in the mean of y when x k is greater by one unit and all other predictor variables are held as constant 3 3 2 partial least squares regression the partial least square regression plsr model is a two edged multivariate tool as it combines the features from pca and mlr it attempts to decompose the mean data of x predictor variable and y predictand as 15 x n p t n 1 p p 1 e n p y n q u n 1 q q 1 f n q where n is the corresponding dependent samples t and u are latent vectors for the n observations p and q are the loading vectors while e and f are the residual vectors 3 3 3 back propagation neural network the back propagation neural network bpnn framework allows network neurons from one layer to connect to all the neurons in subsequent layers but with no lateral links within any layer or the possibility of feedback connections asides the input neuron which links only one input value to the corresponding weights the net input for each discrete neuron is the total of all input parameters each multiplied by its weight and a bias term building for two hidden layers we have 16 h p 1 i 1 n w p 1 x i z p h q 1 f h p 1 17 h q 1 i 1 n w q 1 h p 1 z q y p q f h q 1 where p q 1 6 n 22 with eqs 16 and 17 being models of the first and second hidden layers respectively the output value y p q can be calculated by feeding the net input and the parameters from the hidden layers into the transfer function of the neurons where h p 1 h q 1 represents neurons in the first and second hidden layers respectively w p 1 w q 1 are the varying weights originating from the input parameters to the last hidden layers respectively z p z q represents the supplementary weight projected for better predictions for the first to last hidden layers respectively y p q is the output which is directly a function of the second hidden layer but indirectly a function of the entire bpnn model 3 3 4 gaussian process regression the gaussian process regression gpr is a supervised non parametric kernel based probabilistic model it is a machine learning method based on the bayes theory and statistical learning theory considering the training set x i y i i 1 2 3 n where x i r d and y i r drawn from an indefinite distribution the gpr algorithm attempts to predict the value of a response variable y new given the new input vector x new which form the 30 testing datasets used in our experiment and the 70 training dataset a linear regression model is of the form 18 y x t β ε where ε n 0 σ 2 the priori distribution of the observation y eq 1 and the joint prior distribution of the observed y value and the predicted value y new can be obtained by 19 y n 0 k x x σ n 2 i n 20 y y new n 0 k x x σ n 2 i n k x x new k x new x k x new x new n 0 k k t k k where k x x is a symmetric positive definitive

training set x k x x is the covariance matrix of the test set itself i n represents an n by n unit matrix 4 results 4 1 fitting our algorithms to the three level 3 grace products the convolution based support vector machine presented in this study is designed to mimic the operation of the cnn using svms as regression models applies the same principle as the classification based svm operations the training phase used 70 of the input datasets to find the best fit line between the predictor and predictand the best fit line is the hyper plane with the maximum number of points that the csvm attempts to fit within a threshold value the csvm is unlike other conventional regression models for example mlr plsr bpnn that try to minimize the error between the actual and predicted value the threshold value is the distance between the boundary line and the hyper plane the csvm technique maintains a fit time complexity of above quadratic normal with the number of samples making it challenging to scale to datasets with extremely large samples like 20000 samples in fig 4 we demonstrate the comparison of the resulting output of the first order training models i e linear polynomial order 2 and rbf gamma 0 05 on the three variants of grace twsa used as our predictand i e the target output following our model fits we observe that for twsa gfz csvm rbf 1 made the best fit when compared to other variants fig 4g for twsa csr csvm poly 1 maintained the best fit compared to other variants fig 4c and for twsa jpl csvm poly 1 maintained the best fit compared to other variants fig 4f overall we observe that the reconstruction fit with the minimal bias was between the csvm poly 1 and the twsa csr among other twsa variants the csr product also showed minimal bias with the other first order models better than other grace variants explored in this experiment fig 4b e h this could be attributed mainly to the c30 replacement solutions from satellite laser ranging for this grace solution loomis et al 2019 and the degree 1 coefficient corrections applied to the solution using the estimates in tn 13a behzadpour et al 2021 which inadvertently led to a better fitting index in our csvm linear mode also the state of the art mascon gridded grace twsa products fig 1 are known to undergo glacial isostatic adjustment peltier et al 2018 and the monthly averages of the modeled non tidal ocean bottom pressure deviation chambers and bonin 2012 save et al 2016 corrections which makes them more suitable for hydrology ice mass and ocean bottom pressure mass change applications the reconstruction phase undertaken in both the first fig 4 and higher order fig 5 csvm levels utilized the total 22 predictors composed of the hfs cis and the ssts the regularization parameter was used to initialize the model to ensure the balance of weights and biases in the csvm training phase eq 2 explains the interpretation of the varying weights and bias terms used in the training the weights represented as extracts from the svm hyper plane are determined by obtaining the coordinates of the corresponding vectors orthogonal to the hyper plane given that the directions provide us with useful information about our twsa reconstruction exercise we take the dot product of any point with the vector to check if it belongs to the positive or negative class eq 1 throws more light on the operation of the weight and bias terms of our csvm algorithm in the higher order training models fig 5 which is characterized by the polynomial order 3 rbf gamma 0 02 and rbf gamma 0 03 kernels we observe the fitting index of our actual 3 variant grace tws products and predicted reconstructed twsa information for our model fits we note that for twsa gfz csvm poly 2 made the best fit when compared to other variants fig 5a for twsa csr csvm rbf 2 maintained the best fit compared to other variants fig 5e and for twsa jpl csvm poly 2 maintained the best fit compared to other variants fig 5c from both the first and higher order reconstruction phases we observe that the polynomial kernel reconstructed and predicted twsa better than other kernels this corroborates the superior performance of the polynomial kernel in regression exercises as has been reported in previous studies e g khalil et al 2006 yao et al 2017 the rbf kernels on the other hand exhibited significant performance in reconstructing twsa as highlighted in the first fig 4 and higher order fig 5 samples the popularity of the rbf kernels stems from their close similarity to k nearest neighborhood knn algorithm it equally possesses the advantages of the knn as well as overcomes the space complexity problems in the model given that they store the support vectors during training and not the entire dataset 4 2 estimating the impact of hf ci and ssts in regulating twsa past studies have explored the impacts of hydrological fluxes kalu et al 2021a climate indices ndehedehe et al 2017 and sea surface temperatures ndehedehe and ferreira 2020 in regulating tws fluctuations in different sub regions our experiment also attempts to assess the impacts of these three sets of climate variables extracted from our predictor classes in modeling twsa discretely extreme hydro meteorological conditions and significant hydrological fluctuations are erratic outcomes of variations in global and sub regional climate modes that impact on twsa for example global precipitation records display a mean increase of approximately 9 mm of precipitation over land areas during the twentieth century however reports have shown a drastic and increased frequency of wet days in many sub regions of the world and the escalated proportion of total precipitation beginning from the largest precipitation events in many of the world s largest freshwater reservoirs knapp et al 2008 this also plays a crucial role in twsa regulation as confirmed by the water budget equation tws p r et where p r and et represents precipitation runoff and evapotranspiration respectively also we notice that one hydrological product has a directly proportional effect in regulating the behavior of other hydrological products for example an increase in latent heat transfer leads to increase in land surface temperature evapotranspiration rates soil temperature and a substantial decrease in soil moisture this interplay between hydrological products provides significant information on their relevance in either directly or indirectly affecting twsa fig 6 shows that rbf 3 provided the best fit between the hydrological parameters and the averaged twsa we however notice a significant fitting range from month 11 to month 24 in our training samples fig 6a f months 10 25 represent wet months extracted to form part of our testing dataset this is yet another significant pointer to the dominance of precipitation rates in regulating twsa amidst the impacts of other hydrological products used in the modeling process another important thing to note is that month 11 24 is dominated by annual signals which also shows that in complex hydrological modeling our csvms performs poorly in multi annual time series this is usually noticed in large freshwater basins where the dynamics of the hydrological process are significantly strong such as the amazon river basin ndehedehe and ferreira 2020 therefore performing a csvm modeling procedure for such regions may not give optimal results especially due to their strong land atmosphere interaction and dynamics which results in extreme hydrological fluctuations ndehedehe et al 2020 kalu et al 2022b the study conducted by ndehedehe et al 2017 provided evidence of rapid changes in the global atmosphere and hydrological cycle due to the influence of climate variability such changes influence water resources resulting in incessant extreme hydro meteorological conditions the dominant impact of enso amo and iod indices in grace derived twsa was pointed out in their study our csvm attempts to relate these datasets with an averaged grace twsa exploring both first and higher order kernels our results show that the csvm poly 1 figs 6h 7h made the best attempt to relate these two products however compared to the hydrological products performance in estimating twsa we observe that the cis did not do well on their own in this modeling phase this however is not surprising as their influence on twsa is usually augmented by other hydrological products which did not form part of the training also the effect of these indices is generally localized while only a few of them like enso has a more dominant widespread force sst datasets performed better than climate indices in estimating the average twsa trends this is because i spatially distributed observations of the sst better represent oceanic variations than the single indices produced by the teleconnection patterns ii the gridded sst datasets for each month are composed of severally averaged sst components which provided the csvm a more robust training dataset than the climate indices iii sst predicts precipitation better than the pressure anomaly often used in the development of climate indices given that precipitation plays a dominant role in regulating twsa therefore sst properties outperform climate indices in estimating twsa our results however show that out of the three kernels used to make this estimation the csvm poly 1 figs 6n 7n produced the best fit between ssts and the averaged twsa the polynomial kernel has been shown to perform well in modeling predictands whose predictors do not maintain sufficient relationships between them even more than the rbf kernels this also shows us that the assertion made by izabatene et al 2010 which postulates that the increasing polynomial order increases accuracy in regression does not apply in all cases especially in cases of severe non linearity between predictors and predictands 4 3 performance of the different kernel variants used in our system the robustness of the cnn and svm in pattern recognition has been severely corroborated in many aspects of science as explained in the introduction here we pay specific attention to the performance of the linear polynomial and rbf kernels in our integrated csvm system the linear kernel is regarded as the simplest of all kernels it does not project data into a higher dimension but only operates with the inner product of the x and xi terms eq 6 with an optional constant in some cases however the benefit of the linear kernel is in its incredible simplicity the linear kernel is typically used on datasets with a significant amount of correlation therefore increasing the dimensionality of these datasets does not necessarily improve regression accuracy in our case the csvm linear showed a considerable regression fit for the three variants of twsa using the integrated inputs from the hf s ci s and sst s as predictors over test points 4 20 and 26 in the linear kernel we observed a bias of twsa gfz 0 049 mm 0 502 mm and 0 305 mm twsa csr 0 202 mm 0 157 mm and 0 365 mm and twsa jpl 0 355 mm 0 202 mm and 0 022 mm respectively table 3 however as the input datasets were segmented to hfs cis and ssts we observed a reduction in their regression strength for example over test points 7 21 and 36 we recorded a bias of av twsa h f 26 29 and 24 av twsa ci 59 57 and 60 and av twsa sst 41 43 and 39 respectively see table 4 the most negligible bias was noticed in regressions where the x values have a notable relationship with the xi values as shown in eq 6 this clearly shows that the linear kernel performs better when the predictors are significantly correlated with the predictand as opined originally in most cases results from the polynomial kernels proved to be more significant than the linear and rbf kernels the poly 1 kernel as used in this study represents the polynomial kernel of order 2 from table 3 we observed that over test points 4 20 and 6 a bias of twsa gfz 0 000 mm 0 516 mm and 0 584 mm twsa csr 0 018 mm 0 000 mm 0 108 mm and tws jpl 0 000 mm 0 001 mm 0 082 mm respectively was achieved in the reconstruction process from the segmented test points in table 4 we recorded a bias of av twsa hf 26 27 23 av twsa ci 53 57 60 and av twsa sst 35 36 37 over test points 7 21 and 36 respectively the poly 2 kernel on the other hand represents polynomial kernel of order 3 over test point 4 20 and 36 we observed a bias of twsa gfz 0 000 mm 0 000 mm 0 000 mm twsa csr 0 000 mm 0 000 mm 0 001 mm and twsa jpl 0 000 mm 0 002 mm 0 000 mm respectively for the segmented datasets that estimated the impacts of hfs ci s and ssts we recorded over test points 7 21 and 36 a bias of av twsa hf 19 22 26 av twsa ci 52 49 51 and av twsa ssts 40 29 34 respectively was determined the results from the polynomial order 2 and 3 kernels are quite similar to the linear and rbf kernel in trends but differ in the fine tuned accuracy index especially in cases where the predictors are significantly correlated to the predictands tables 3 4 this is not surprising as the polynomial kernel unlike the other kernel takes the inner products from a higher dimensional space to aid regression fits this is why the csvm poly 2 fit which assessed order three outperformed the csvm poly 1 which only assessed order two in most cases this shows that the higher order we access the more fitted our predictors get to the predictands however this is not usually the best case as it commonly leads to over fitting therefore we avoided making use of polynomial orders higher than 3 to avoid over fitting and subsequent compromising of our result integrity we also explored the robustness of the rbf kernels which have been reported to have better fitting capabilities than other svm kernels khalil et al 2006 the rbf kernel is composed of a free parameter that scales the amount of effect two points have on each other it is usually represented as gamma γ unlike the polynomial kernel which looks at the extra dimensions that can be explored the rbf expands into an infinite number of dimensions this is as a result of the expansion of the polynomial for example from eq 8 let us use the gamma value γ assigned to csvm rbf 1 which is 1 20 and expand the exponential 21 k 3 x x i exp 1 2 γ 2 x x i 2 exp 1 200 x 2 x i 2 2 x x i exp x 2 x i 2 200 exp x x i we now expand exp x x i into infinite dimensions using a taylor series approximation like this 22 exp x x i 1 1 1 x x i 1 2 x x i 2 1 200 x x i 200 1 x x i this expansion helps to fine tune its reconstructive fitting index and minimizes regression loss significantly from our study we divided the csvm rbf kernel into three to explore the capabilities of three different intermediate gamma values csvm rbf 1 has gamma value of 0 05 csvm rbf 2 has gamma value of 0 02 and csvm rbf 3 has gamma of 0 03 for rbf 1 our results show that over test points 4 20 and 26 we observed a bias of twsa gfz 0 008 mm 0 004 mm 0 012 mm twsa csr 0 008 mm 0 016 mm 0 007 mm tws jpl 0 004 mm 0 000 mm 0 000 mm respectively for the segmented predictors that measured percentage impact table 4 over test points 7 21 and 36 we recorded a bias of av twsa hf 18 20 21 av twsa ci 46 49 48 av twsa sst 38 36 35 respectively for rbf 2 our results show that over test points 4 20 and 26 table 3 we recorded a bias of tws gfz 0 008 mm 0 002 mm 0 011 mm tws csr 0 001 mm 0 005 mm 0 002 mm tws jpl 0 001 mm 0 008 mm 0 010 mm respectively for the segmented predictors that measured percentage impact table 4 over test points 7 21 and 36 we recorded a bias of av twsa hf 25 16 12 av twsa ci 48 50 38 av twsa sst 30 28 31 respectively for rbf 3 our results show that over test points 4 20 and 26 table 3 we observed a bias of tws gfz 0 001 mm 0 007 mm 0 006 mm twsa csr 0 000 mm 0 001 mm 0 006 mm twsa jpl 0 041 mm 0 002 mm 0 001 mm respectively for the segmented predictors that measured percentage impact table 4 over test points 7 21 and 36 we observed a bias of av twsa hf 19 16 14 av twsa ci 44 47 40 av twsa sst 26 32 23 respectively the rbf kernel performed significantly better than the linear kernel in both cases this was to be expected given that the kernel is equivalent to the inner product of the two data points having an infinite number of dimensions as described in eq 15 our optimal gamma and epsilon values were generated using the grid search method fig 3 it generated the least bias between predictors and predictand even in the case of the segmented predictors to estimate the influence of hfs cis and ssts on the averaged twsa tables 3 4 the percentage fit represented in table 5 shows that all the kernels performed relatively well in fitting twsa in case 1 however the polynomial kernels were more consistent in fitting the trends of twsa gfz twsa csr and twsa jpl more than the linear and rbf kernels also in case 2 we noticed that the csvm poly 2 performed better in the sst a tws relationship while the rbfs dominated in percentage fits for the hydrological flux and climate indices associated to the averaged twsa this is in line with the assertion from previous studies that the rbf kernels are more robust in performing non linear regressions and this experiment has corroborated this assertion even in hydrological operations 4 4 comparison between csvm and other conventional models in tws regression the strength of our convolution based svm was tested with other conventional regression algorithms to determine their fit index using the same datasets in modeling twsa gfz using the mlr we observed that the mlr performed better in fitting testing months 15 36 than the testing months 1 14 however this was not the case for twsa csr and jpl as the prediction accuracy and fit dropped even in testing months 15 36 this bias in the csr and jpl predictions shows the unpredictability of the mlr in reconstructing several variants of the twsa given its significant non linearity the partial least square regression model has been shown to be extremely robust in hydrological predictions okwuashi et al 2020 ndehedehe and ferreira 2020 ndehedehe et al 2021 in our experiment the plsr model better reconstructed the twsa csr and twsa jpl than the twsa gfz its robustness is seen in the fitting index however significant regression errors were noticed in the fitting of the twsa especially in the first 30 months fig 8d f the csvm outperforms the plsr in the fitting index as shown in table 6 given that a standard deviation of twsa gfz 0 455 twsa csr 0 317 and twsa jpl 0 373 was recorded for the plsr in contrast the polynomial kernel of order 2 poly 2 showed a standard deviation of twsa gfz 0 147 twsa csr 0 111 and twsa jpl 0 124 this shows that the plsr is more affected in cases of disturbed predictor signals low concentration impacts and significant non linearity in the correlation estimates of predictor and predictands more than our csvm the bpnn s are historically known for performing a series of linear combinations integrated with non linear activation functions across several layers our experiment showed that they modeled twsa better than the csvm linear and csvm poly 1 kernel variants however the rbf kernels outperformed them as shown in table 6 regardless we suggest that the bpnn has the potential of outperforming the csvm in a case of high dimensional large data sets since this study made use of only 22 original input predictors however the performance of the bpnn in reconstructing twsa using a high dimensional large data set is left as possible dispute for further research the gpr is a new non parametric bayesian approach in reconstruction and regression exercises and is making waves in machine learning it performed significantly well in modeling twsa especially the twsa jpl fig 8l this is to be expected as the strength of the gpr is mostly dominant in cases of small to medium input datasets also given that the prediction is probabilistic it allows the system to estimate the confidence intervals and make decisions based on those that should go for re fitting the prediction regardless the robustness of the exponentiated quadratic kernel of the gpr which was applied in this regression outperformed all the csvm kernels used in this study except the csvm rbf 3 kernel this shows that in cases of kernel sampling of the gpr it is possible to achieve better results from the gpr than our csvm we also estimate the regression loss of all the system models in reconstructing twsa fig 9 shows that the model with the highest regression loss of the three twsa variants in the mlr which is not too robust in modeling significantly non linear systems like its counterparts the svm poly 2 performed best in this analysis as it shows the smallest regression loss regardless the new gpr is a potential algorithm that has the tendency of adequately predicting hydrological variables having small to medium input datasets however its application in a similar study exploring its different kernels will provide more information on its capabilities and robustness in twsa reconstructions 5 discussion 5 1 coupling the convolution neural network with support vector machine the convolution based support vector machine has proved to be a very useful tool in data science as it was shown to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of mining small to medium range yeh et al 2021 the csvm used in our study showed significant efficiency in performing non linear operations this shows that the assimilation of cnn methods with the svm is very robust in hydrological analysis the cnn is known for its proficiency in generating optimal filters that aid the extraction of in depth features of their corresponding datasets gu et al 2018 whereas the svm which has been shown to be a robust machine learning tool composed of a significant non linear mapping skill with the ability to efficiently map big data inputs into their corresponding high dimensional feature space and performing regression analysis in its feature space using a structural risk minimization approach mi et al 2019 therefore our idea of combining these two powerful algorithms is in line with the recent integrated and deep learning methods that are taking over the world of machine learning in recent times our original input datasets have 22 sets of data which were composed of hf datasets ci datasets and sst datasets using these original input datasets we built and trained our cnn model our cnn model was characterized by three convolution layers and two fully connected layers we utilized the relu and adam algorithms as the activation and optimization function for our first hidden layer while we used the sigmoid algorithm as the activation function for the second hidden layer the svm was fed with input features from the fully connected layer 1 of the cnn model after which the svm operation begins the svm used the grid search optimizer to investigate the ε and c values which helped in enhancing the robustness and generalization of the svm model after saving the cnn and svm models we reloaded the training model into the system while we rebuilt the testing model we also used the well known ssom in updating all the filter values of our proposed convolution products yeh 2013 has described the ssom as a classic machine learning technique as a result of its robust update mechanism which has been found to be effective in data science and even optimization problems we segmented the training and testing models to make predictions of an averaged twsa using hf s ci s and ssts this procedure was arranged to be able to estimate the extent and impact of these sets of climate observations in regulating region based twsa from our experiment we found that while the hf dataset provided the most significant impact on twsa regulation the ci dataset was the least the low rate of the sst in regulating twsa was attributed to the single indices parameters produced by teleconnection patterns the discrete monthly datasets provided by the ci s as opposed to the gridded datasets provided by ssts and rainfall datasets and the weak correlation of pressure anomaly used to develop ssts compared to sst used to predict precipitation these results also showed that the csvm provides better results in cases of more robust input parameters 5 2 csvm based kernels used for twsa reconstruction in our experiment we used the three variants of twsa to serve as our predictands i e twsa gfz twsa csr and twsa jpl we extracted the twsa from january 2003 to december 2012 grace data has been significantly applied to water related and hydrological studies over the years however a big problem for researchers is that significant data gaps are noticed in the mission from april 2002 to july 2019 a total of 163 monthly observations were made by the mission whereas 24 monthly datasets are missing see fig 1 of ahi and cekim 2021 this show over 14 of missing data and this value can affect accuracy and precision especially in hydro geodetic operations the purpose of using the three variants of the grace twsa as independent validation models was to ascertain the performance of our csvm algorithm in reconstructing them individually we leveraged on the gaussian smoothing and de correlation filtering that has been applied to the grace level 3 products to enable a swift and more robust regression of our proposed algorithm 70 of our original input variable was used to train our model while 30 was used for testing the model performance and the fitting index to our three variant twsa table 2 we refrained from training with more datasets to avoid over fitting and subsequent compromising our result integrity we segmented our linear polynomial and rbf kernels into six more parts having i csvm linear ii csvm poly 1 iii csvm poly 2 iv csvm rbf 1 v csvm rbf 2 vi csvm rbf 3 where ii and iii only differ as a result of the polynomial order of 2 and 3 used respectively and iv v and vi only differ as a result of the gamma value of 0 05 0 03 and 0 02 used respectively from fig 10 we observe that csvm poly 1 made the best fit for twsa gfz fig 10d twsa csr fig 10e and twsa jpl fig 10f when compared to the other kernel variants we attribute the difference in fitting index of these kernels to the prior corrections and de correlations that some of these twsa mascon products have undergone for example the twsa csr variant which maintained a minimal bias with the other first order models better than the other twsa variants was recorded to have undergone a c30 replacement solution from satellite laser ranging for the grace solution and have also had the degree 1 coefficient corrections applied to the solution using the estimates in the tn 13a loomis et al 2019 behzadpour et al 2021 this inadvertently led to a better fitting index in our first order csvm kernels for the csr solutions the weights and bias terms of our first and higher order csvm kernels were balanced using the regularization parameter eq 2 in our higher order training models shown in fig 11 we explored the robustness of csvm poly2 csvm rbf 2 and csvm rbf 3 in reconstructing our three variant twsa results from our analysis show that csvm poly 2 made the best fit for twsa gfz fig 11a twsa csr fig 11b and twsa jpl fig 11c patterns overall we observed that the polynomial kernels reconstructed and predicted twsa better that the other kernels the rbf kernels also performed well in reconstructing twsa especially in the first order kernels fig 10g i given that the rbf kernel bears a significant resemblance to the knn algorithm it equally retains the advantages of both knn as well this provides it with robust techniques for overcoming the space complexity problems postulated by most models thus their proficiency in reconstruction tasks nevertheless we must note that since the proposed model provided good performance in twsa reconstructions as clearly shown in the represented results fig 7 tables 3 5 we observe that the minimal bias is obtained in our experiment only when the twsa variant undergoes corrections in a case of raw twsa observations the fitting index of the csvm is likely to reduce the proposed model also poses significant restrictions on kernel use as the higher order kernels did not provide better results in all cases better than the first order kernels for example the polynomial kernel showed that its assessment of higher orders improved the relationship of the predicted models with hfs ci s and sst fig 6c i o tables 3 and 4 parameters while the rbf kernel was the opposite figs 10g i 11d i regardless we must note that the assessment of higher orders is not usually the best option in machine learning because the assessment of higher orders greater than 3 could lead to over fitting of the system model thus compromising the integrity of the output results kalu et al 2022a 5 3 impact assessment of the predictor signals on twsa we also explored the impact extent of hfs cis and ssts on twsa results from our analysis show that hydrological fluxes impact more on twsa than ci s and ssts this is due to the huge role that the precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff variables play in the water budget equation however we could not achieve a 100 fit between hydrological fluxes and twsa because of the contributing factors of other variables whose influences were not captured in our model as well as the result of non linear interaction between hydrological parameters however we see that the best fits for the hydrological fluxes were in months 11 24 which are dominated by annual signals therefore performing our proposed algorithm in regions with heightened dynamics of surface water and hydrological interactions may not be a good idea as a majority of those locations are mostly dominated by multi annual time series such as the congo river basin kalu et al 2021a and the amazon river basin ndehedehe and ferreira 2020 the ci s contributed the least in regulating twsa due to the localized nature of their data types even though some of them have dominant widespread influence like the enso however our algorithm shows that the csvm rbf 3 made the best fit in relating hfs and twsa figs 6f 7f the csvm poly 1 made the best fit in relating ci s with twsa figs 6h 7h while the csvm poly 1 also made the best fit in relating ssts with twsa figs 6n 7n this throws more light on the potential of the polynomial kernel in relating climate variables with hydrological variables especially given their tendency to look for extra dimensions that can be explored also we opine that the polynomial kernel tends to perform well in modeling predictands whose predictors don t maintain significant relationships between them therefore they can be very useful in modeling extremely non linear climate systems also the percentage fit index shown in table 5 clearly represents all the kernel variants in reconstructing twsa especially in case 1 we noticed however that the rbf kernels provided a more consistent fitting trend for our three variant predictand twsa more than the other kernels in case 2 we equally noticed that the csvm poly 2 performed better in estimating the impact of sst on the averaged twsa while the rbf kernels dominated in terms of percentage fits for both hydrological flux and climate indices impact estimation on the averaged twsa 5 4 comparing csvm with conventional methods we also compared our algorithm with other models that are well known for regression analysis such as the mlr plsr the bpnn and the gpr the bpnn and gpr outperformed our first order kernels in most cases fig 8 table 6 for example in modeling twsa gfz the gpr achieved a standard deviation of 0 110 which was only surpassed by a standard deviation of 0 097 achieved by the csvm rbf 3 kernel and 0 024 achieved by the csvm poly 2 in twsa csr the gpr achieved a standard deviation of 0 016 which was better than the results achieved from all of our kernel and for twsa jpl the gpr achieved a standard deviation of 0 021 but was outperformed by the csvm poly 1 0 009 csvm poly 2 0 004 csvm rbf 2 0 020 and the csvm rbf 3 0 011 variants this shows that on an average the csvm poly 2 and csvm rbf 3 kernels outperformed every other conventional kernel used fig 9 in reconstructing grace twsa however the gpr has proved to be significantly efficient in relating non linear climatic variables and poses to be a very interesting reconstruction tool even for higher order climate exercises 6 conclusion the increasing change in our global climate is evidenced in the severe non linearity noticed in the relationship between hydrological and climate datasets in recent times it is therefore pertinent to explore the capabilities of existing machine learning techniques to enhance their predictive abilities to comfortably tackle the growing non linearity in hydrological analysis our study introduced an integration of the convoluted neural network with the support vector machine to improve prediction and reconstruction of the grace twsa the major take away from our study are outlined below i the influence of climate variability over the congo river basin is evidenced in the rapid changes in the global atmosphere and hydrological cycle witnessed over the region this influence resulted in sst having a significantly stronger impact in regulating twsa over the basin when compared to climate indices ii the rbf kernel showed substantial strength in performing non linear regression as evidenced in its superior percentage fits for the hydrological flux and climate indices interaction with the averaged twsa case 2 the polynomial kernel on the other hand proved to be more consistent in fitting trends and reconstructing the twsa gfz twsa csr and twsa jpl more than the linear and rbf kernels iii for the rbf kernel the use of very small gamma values makes the model mimic the procedure of a linear model while the use of very large gamma values usually lead to over fitting the model the intermediate kernel values ranging from 0 05 to 0 5 are ideal for climatic and hydrological operations iv the superiority of the csvm over the compared traditional machine learning algorithms is evidence that the growing non linearity of climatic variables can be addressed by improving the efficiency and robustness of existing machine learning methods this could be achieved by tuning the hyper parameters of existing models increasing the neuron set in the hidden layer to deepen the network or coupling two robust algorithms regardless continuous mathematical operations are required to accommodate the growing non linearity in hydrological studies the conventional models used in comparing the csvm shows great promise in accurately reconstructing predicting or tracking twsa signals by exploring their full individual capabilities they possess the capability of challenging integrated learning methods in accurate hydrological regression operations one of such models is the gpr which is a relatively new regression approach whose impact in hydrological studies is yet to be fully explored we therefore recommend it for future applications in a similar operation to conclusively determine its strength robustness and capabilities in reconstruction and pattern recognition exercises in hydrological analysis credit authorship contribution statement kalu ikechukwu writing original draft writing review editing
