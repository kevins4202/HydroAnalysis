16185,permeability reduction and formation damage in porous media caused by fines defined as unconfined solid particles present in the pore spaces migration is one of the major reasons for productivity decline it is well accepted that particle detachment occurs under imbalanced torques arising from hydrodynamic and adhesive forces exerted on attached particles this paper reviewed current understanding on primary factors influencing fines migration as well as mathematical formulations for quantification we also introduced salinity related experimental observations that contradict theoretical predictions based on torque balance criteria such as delayed particle release and attachment detachment hysteresis the delay of particle release during low salinity water injection was successfully explained and formulated by the nernst planck diffusion of ions in a narrow contact area in addition to the widely recognized explanation by surface heterogeneity and the presence of low velocity regions we proposed a hypothesis that accounts for the shifting of equilibrium positions providing new insight into the interpretation of elusive attachment detachment hysteresis both physically and mathematically the review was finalized by discussing the quantification of anomalous salinity effect on adhesion force at low and high salinity conditions graphical

as kaolinite chlorite and illite quartz and silica particles might also be released in low consolidated sandstones sen and khilar 2006 arab et al 2014 guo et al 2016 2018 huang et al 2017 2018 in addition to those naturally present in situ colloidal particles and precipitation from supersaturated solutions movable fines may also come from cement dissolution due to mineral reactions experimental studies show that chemical reactions during co₂ saturated water injection or water saturated scco₂ injection dissolve inter granular cement othman et al 2019a b ge et al 2020 2022 therefore some of the grains and fines bonded with the rock due to cementing are dislodged which causes detachment of fines othman et al 2019a b zhang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 reported that water could dissolve some carbonate at high temperatures which leads to fines migration the mechanism is similar to co2 sequestration but mineral dissolution during single phase water flow is only significant at high temperatures permeability decline during core floods with piecewise increasing velocity has been observed in numerous laboratory tests khilar and fogler 1998 ochi and vernoux 1998 1999 similar effects have been detected during piecewise decrease in salinity or increase in ph while injecting fluids into porous media lever and dawe 1984 kia et al 1987a b despite the great efforts that researchers have made a couple of mysteries remain veiled due to the complicated interactions between particles and substrates especially when it comes to the influence of ionic strength and temperature for example the widely reported delayed particle release during low salinity water injection and particle attachment detachment hysteresis during the salinity loading and unloading process are still not fully understood moreover colloid attachment in the presence of repulsive barriers unfavorable condition highlights the significance of nano or larger scale surface chemical heterogeneity johnson et al 2010 temperature also plays an essential role in determining particle substrate interactions yet the experimental findings are controversial flooding tests performed on sandstone cores showed that core permeabilities were significantly decreased to 35 90 of the initial permeability when temperature increased to 80 180 schembre and kovscek 2005 musharova et al 2012 owing to particle detachment and subsequent pore clogging at higher temperatures however several experiments revealed that increasing temperature yields an increased attached particle concentration when injecting colloids into porous media kim and walker 2009 yan et al 2015 sasidharan et al 2017 a schematic for attached and strained fine particles in the porous space is demonstrated in fig 1 showcasing the particle statuses of attachment detachment suspension straining and bridging it is worth noting that the detachment of fines coating the grain surfaces yields a negligible increase in porosity and permeability relative to the significant porosity and permeability decline that arises from their straining at pore throats and the resultant blocking of flow paths permeability reduction caused by fines migration can be characterized directly by particle straining or indirectly by estimating porosity variation due to particle straining which is then related to permeability change using correlations between porosity and permeability johnson et al 2020 this paper presents current understanding on primary influencing factors of fines migration our review starts with the criteria for particle remobilization i e torque balance section 2 followed by the dlvo theory that has been widely applied to quantifying the adhesion forces between attached particles and solid substrates section 3 based on the dlvo theory we synthetically analyze primary factors influencing the fate of particles in porous media section 4 including salinity section 4 1 ph section 4 2 temperature section 4 3 flow rate section 4 4 and nanoscale heterogeneity section 4 5 the concept of maximum retention concentration and the phenomena of delayed particle release and attachment detachment hysteresis are presented in sections 5 7 respectively section 8 finalizes the review by discussing the quantification of anomalous salinity effect on adhesion force at low and high salinity conditions that contradicts the well accepted dlvo theory 2 criteria for particle remobilization colloid attachment and detachment in porous media are recognized to be determined by the torque balance of the applied hydrodynamic forces arising from flowing fluid and the adhesive interactions between colloids and rock substrates sharma and yortsos 1987 sharma et al 1992 torkzaban et al 2007 2008 2010 bedrikovetsky et al 2011a molnar et al 2015 vanness et al 2019 colloid attachment is traditionally defined by removing particle mass from solution via collision with and fixation to the porous media dependent on particle surface interactions elimelech and o melia 1990 and physically controlled processes of sedimentation and interception logan et al 1995 the kinetics of particle attachment are controlled by the rate of delivery to solid surfaces and subsequent immobilization the current review is focused on the process of colloid immobilization rather than collision therefore we use attachment to refer to immobilization and the two terms are used equivalently in this text colloid detachment occurs when mobilizing torque from hydrodynamic force exceeds the arresting torque from adhesion the same forces and torques that determine detachment also govern immobilization attachment wherein immobilization is permitted when the arresting torque exceeds the mobilizing torque van ness et al 2019 further suggested that attachment and detachment should be unified in modeling as parameters calibrated by particle attachment are the key to successful predictions of particle detachment three conceptual models have been proposed to quantify the critical conditions of particle remobilization i e rolling sliding and lifting sharma et al 1992 the latter predicts a significantly larger flow rate relative to that necessitates rolling or sliding owing to a negligible lifting force created by fluid bypassing the attached particle in a laminar flow and the fact that the balance between the lifting and adhesion forces determines whether lifting occurs bergendahl and grasso 2000 2003 shavezipur et al 2012 direct adhesion force measurements and cell flow experiments demonstrate that the measured pull off force of an attached particle is several orders of magnitude greater than the critical hydrodynamic force required for particle removal from a substrate das et al 1994 freitas and sharma 2001 this indicates that lifting is not a primary mechanism for particle remobilization by comparing the centrifuge experiments with flow cell experiments it has also been demonstrated that the detachment of spherical particles is more likely to be initiated by rolling rather than sliding given the same critical torques required to release the particles in both the centrifuge and the flow experiments sharma et al 1992 however it is worth mentioning that torque balance predicts no attachment in the presence of a strong energy barrier despite clear experimental observation to the contrary implying the significance of surface charge heterogeneity that can highly influence the magnitude of adhesion force pazmino et al 2014a b vanness et al 2019 detailed discussion of the surface heterogeneity effect on particle mobilization will be presented in section 4 5 fig 2 illustrates forces and torques acting on a deformable colloid resting on a rigid solid surface with a roughness of height hr as well as the corresponding lever arms the profile of flow velocity generates the drag fd mlt 2 and lift fl mlt 2 forces while the interactions between colloid and surface give rise to the adhesive force fa mlt 2 the lift force is negligible in a laminar flow if compared with the adhesion force soltani and ahmadi 1994 the resultant force of gravity and buoyancy fb can be neglected for a neutrally buoyant particle however gravity becomes significant for the larger and denser particles transport in water saturated porous media under conditions electrostatically unfavourable to deposition chen et al 2010 chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 higher retention concentration was observed under upward than downward flows chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 the drag force fd acting on a spherical particle in contact with a plane wall can be calculated by goldman et al 1967 o neill 1968 bradford and torkzaban 2013 1 f d c h 6 π μ w τ w r s r s h

eq 9 interfacial parameters are required to calculate the thermodynamic work of adhesion however the surface tension of a solid is hard to be obtained starov 2013 let alone its salinity and temperature dependence that have been proven to be crucial in determining the adhesion force the contact angle is generally used to estimate the lifshitz van der waals component of the surface tension vrlinic et al 2016 yet the difficulty in obtaining an equilibrium contact angle results in higher uncertainty starov and velarde 2019 me ml2t 2 is the external moment of surface stress which can be

water density the resisting adhesive torque is determined by 14 t a l a f a f b colloid rolling occurs if t a t h 0 while colloids are immobilized when t a t h 0 3 dlvo theory at the interfacial scale the dlvo theory has been widely used to calculate the interaction energies between the particles and pore surfaces the total energy v is the sum of the london van der waals lvw potential v l w the electrical double layer potential v e d l and the born potential v b hogg et al 1966 gregory 1981 derjaguin and landau 1993 elimelech et al 2013 15 v v l w v e d l v b it is worth noting that the traditional dlvo theory includes only lvw and the electrical double layer potential while short range repulsive interactions are not considered however without the presence of short range repulsions colloids have no chance to escape from the infinitely deep primary minimum the born repulsion force derived from the interatomic potential model same as that used to generate the lvw potential is typically included in the dlvo theory to provide a finite primary minimum other repulsion forces such as the hydration force solvation force and lewis acid base force are regarded as non dlvo forces israelachvili 2015 georgopoulou et al 2020 we will highlight the significance of non dlvo forces in determining colloids fate in the discussion section when discussing abnormal phenomena of colloid mobilization in response to salinity variations in this section we briefly present the most commonly used formulae developed for spherical particles and plane surfaces for the three components of the dlvo potential rather than provide a thorough review of theory development those formulae are employed to generate dlvo curves in later sections a detailed summary including various expressions of each element that account for different assumptions and particle shapes can be found in elimelech et al 2013 and shen et al 2020 respectively 3 1 london van der waals potential the london van der waals energy of interaction between two subjects integrates all intermolecular interactions between polarized molecules over the surface at the microscopic scale several expressions for sphere sphere and sphere plate geometries have been summarized by elimelech et al 2013 among which the one derived by gregory 1981 is the most commonly used expressed by 16 v l w a 132 r s 6 h 1 5 32 h λ l n 1 λ 5

constant n is the refractive index the subscript 1 2 and 3 represent latex silica and liquid respectively ν e is the constant value of absorption frequency taken from israelachvili 2015 3 2 electrical double layer potential the electrical double layer is a structure existing near a charged surface in a fluid the first layer the so called stern layer consists of counter ions adsorbed onto the substrate due to chemical interactions while the second layer diffuse layer comprises ions attracted onto the surface via the coulomb force electrically screening the first layer unlike the first layer being firmly anchored the diffuse layer is movable in the fluid under electric attraction or thermal motion the counter ion cloud extends into the solution encompassing a charged surface balancing the surface charge over some distance away from the particle as a result the net surface charge highly affects the distribution of counterions in the diffuse layer for a detailed description of the double layer structure we refer to elimelech et al 2013 the repulsive electrical double layer energy between two similarly charged surfaces originates from the overlap of diffuse counter ion layers surrounding the charged bodies various expressions for electrical double layer interaction based on three types of assumptions including constant potential constant charge and linear superposition approximation lsa have been presented in the literature elimelech et al 2013 the equation derived from the linear superposition approximation is widely adopted in estimating the edl energy leading to an intermediate value between those given by formulae stemming from the constant potential or constant charge assumptions the lsa based expression for edl is given by 18 v e d l 128

hydrodynamic and adhesion forces the hydrodynamic forces are determined by the flow rate of injection the adhesion force is calculated by dlvo theory primarily influenced by chemical compositions ph and salinity of the fluids temperature and physical and chemical heterogeneity on surfaces it is worth noting that the present study is focused on the single phase flow for multiphase flows additional influencing factors such as interfacial tension and wettability may become significant and must be included huang et al 2018 2021a othman et al 2018 2019a 2019b yu et al 2019 ge et al 2020 2022 4 1 salinity fluid salinity can alter the double layer force by affecting the zeta potential of colloid and rock surfaces thereby influencing the adhesion of attached particles as salinity increases the magnitude of zeta potential decreases resulting in weaker repulsion between the two approaching surfaces the presence of a higher energy barrier at lower salinity decreases the possibility of colloids being trapped at the primary minimum due to the lack of sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the barrier the secondary minimum associated colloids are not arrested but move slowly along surfaces in response to fluid drag and diffusion due to the shallow adhesion energy and the negligible friction or arresting torques johnson et al 2007 2009 torkzaban et al 2008 the observed genuine arrest under unfavorable conditions however can be successfully explained by the operation of nanoscale surface heterogeneity ron et al 2019 increasing salinity generally yields a higher retention concentration of colloids yet it has been observed that when restoring the fluid salinity to the same low salinity environment from high salinity the retention concentration cannot be recovered exhibiting a distinguished discrepancy between the salinity loading and unloading processes ryan and gschwend 1994 lenhart and sariers 2003 torkzaban et al 2010 usually the retention concentration corresponding to the loading process is lower than that of the unloading process under the same environment i e the unloading curve rests above the loading curve torkzaban et al 2010 this phenomenon is called hysteresis of retention concentration hrc detailed in section 6 4 2 ph zeta potential and surface charge are strongly linked to fluid ph fig 3 shows the measured zeta potential of quartz grains in nacl solution at different ph values exhibiting a shift from positive at lower ph to negative at higher ph a similar variation tendency was also obtained for the zeta potential of berea sandstone grains in a 0 10 m cacl2 solution at different ph sharma et al 1987 even at this relatively strong ionic strength of divalent calcium ions the zeta potential remains negative for ph above 3 we notice that the variation of zeta potential with ph is non monotonous in the nacl solutions with relatively lower salinity of 0 05 m and 0 01 m showing a slight increase at high ph this owes to the remarkable rise of oh concentration that is comparable to na which affects the debye length and thus the double layer force kia et al 1987a reported that the permeability of sandstone declines remarkably after injecting low salinity water lsw when ph was higher than 6 however the permeability was found unaltered when ph was less than 4 8 valdya and fogler 1992 observed that the berea sandstone saturated with 0 51 m nacl solution was not altered after injecting the nacl free fluid of ph ranging from 2 to 9 in contrast a significant permeability decrease was recorded when ph was over 11 these experimental results agree with their measured tendency of zeta potential variation i e the higher magnitude of zeta potential at high ph in the nacl solution yields a stronger repulsion force and results in particle detachment it is worth mentioning that the ph effect on different parts of material might vary due to the different charging principles for example the edge surface of kaolinite is known to interact with the potential determining h and oh therefore the edge surface potential is highly dependent on ph in comparison the face surface of kaolinite is usually assumed to exhibit a constant negative surface potential 4 3 temperature temperature effects on fines migration remain controversial flooding tests performed on sandstone cores showed that core permeabilities were significantly decreased to 35 90 of the initial permeability when temperature rises to 80 180 schembre et al 2005 musharova et al 2012 which could be ascribed to the fines detachment and the subsequent pore plugging however several experiments demonstrated that increasing temperature yields an enhanced retention concentration when injecting colloids into porous media kim et al 2009 yan et al 2015 sasidharan et al 2017 both the london van der waals force and born repulsion force are a function of the hamaker constant determined by dielectric constant and refractive index israelachvili 2015 temperature effects on these parameters are material related the dielectric constant of kaolinite linearly depends on temperature with a gradient of 0 005 leluk et al 2010 in comparison the dielectric constant of latex shows a slight increase when the temperature is within the range between 120 and 0 and exhibits a non monotonous trend first increase and then decrease with temperatures lower than 160 chaki and khastgir 1990 temperature influence on quartz s dielectric constant is negligible when temperature is below 170 stuart et al 1955 the dielectric constant of water is linearly dependent on temperature with a gradient of 0 29 fernandez et al 1997 mcgory et al 2020 measured the refractive index of latex within the temperature range of 20 234 with high accuracy yet the temperature effect on kaolinite s refractive index is not available according to the calculation by you et al 2019 the hamaker constant of a kaolinite water quartz system exhibits an approximate 20 increase when the temperature rises from 25 to 129 the debye length and zeta potential are two key parameters that are highly dependent on temperature the debye length characterizes the double layer thickness expressed by κ 1 ε 0 ε 3 k b t e 2 n i 0 z i 2 intuitively the debye length will increase with increased temperature according to its expression however the dielectric constant of water ε 3 is also sensitive to temperature showing a decreasing trend with increased temperature you et al 2019 therefore the competitive effect between t and ε 3 leads to an uncertainty of debye length variation zeta potential manifests the amount of surface charge the magnitude of zeta potential increases with rising temperature resulting in an enhanced repulsion on the other hand increasing temperature yields reduced viscosity giving rise to a weaker drag force al shemmeri et al 2012 you et al 2016 2019 in consequence the influence of temperature on torque controlled fines mobilization is a resultant of the dependences of dlvo interactions and hydrodynamic forces on temperature in addition the stokes einstein diffusion coefficient dt l2t 1 for translational particle diffusion in water is given by 20 d t k b t 6 π μ w r s eq 20 indicates that higher temperature yields stronger diffusion as the diffusion coefficient is proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to viscosity that decreases with increased temperature therefore increasing temperature leads to higher kinetic energy of particles thereby facilitating particles to overcome energy barriers for both attachment and detachment 4 4 flow rate during the water injection into hydrocarbon and geothermal reservoirs the in situ particles attached to rock surfaces can be detached under the flushing or shearing of injected fluids due to the unbalanced torques and thus may reduce the formation conductivity caused by pore blocking and permeability damaging especially in those reservoirs of poor cementation ochi and vernoux 1998 investigated the influence of flow rates on fines migration and observed a critical fluid velocity beyond which permeability decreases arising from fine particles detachment this phenomenon is concluded as the velocity sensitivity of formation permeability civan 2007 bedrikovetsky et al 2011a successfully modeled the velocity dependent maximum retention concentration mrc see section 5 their model demonstrates that particles can be released from the surface immediately after increasing the fluid velocity to a critical value while decreasing the velocity yields a higher retention concentration till a maximum corresponding to the fluid conditions the velocity dependency of colloid detachment has been substantiated by numerous visualization tests performed on glass substrates sharma et al 1992 ryan and gschwend 1994 li et al 2017 a higher velocity results in a larger shearing force particle mobilization may occur when hydrodynamic torques exceed the adhesion torques torkzaban et al 2010 observed that single layer of attached colloids is partially released rather than completely despite the enforced flow rate leading to a hydrodynamic shearing over the critical value this ascribes to the spatial variation of hydrodynamic and adhesion forces caused by the heterogeneity of pore structure roughness and surface charge see section 4 5 4 5 nanoscale heterogeneity although dlvo provides a theoretical tool in adhesion prediction and shows an advantage in qualitatively explaining observed colloidal attachment and detachment in some cases many experimental results are contradictory to those predicted by the dlvo theory tufenkji et al 2004 elimelech et al 1990 manciu et al 2001a 2001b li et al 2020 when the double layer repulsion predominates the interactions between colloids and surfaces an energy barrier presents and hinders colloids moving toward the deeper primary minimum the so called unfavorable condition we expect that colloids cannot attach under an unfavorable condition if the present energy barrier is higher than 10 kt prieve and dennis 1999 however it is frequently reported that colloids can attach to a surface even under an unfavorable condition with a calculated barrier over 10 kt bradford and torkzaban 2008 canseco et al 2009 vanness et al 2019 we ascribe this deviation to the oversimplified assumptions of the dlvo theory i e perfectly smooth surface and homogeneous surface charges in fact a natural surface will exhibit a certain roughness at a nanoscale which may eliminate the energy barrier of dlvo interactions moreover surface charge also shows heterogeneity due to crystal defects isomorphism replacement and adsorption of ions organics or clays vaidyanathan et al 1991 song et al 1994 nanoscale physical and chemical heterogeneity has been successfully applied to the illustration of colloid adsorption at unfavorable conditions hoek et al 2006 simulated the influence of nanoscale surface roughness nsr on dlvo interaction employing the surface element integration technique and derjaguin s integration method they concluded that the energy barrier is decreased by surface roughness due to a longer effective separation distance between a particle and rough surface generally the electrical double layer and born potentials decay more significantly along the distance than lvw and thus the lvw potential exhibits a more pronounced influence on the total energy thereby weakening repulsion between colloids and surfaces decreased energy barrier yields greater retention at the primary minimum conversely colloid interactions with the surface at the primary minimum are believed to be weak and retained colloids were susceptible to removal because nsr is also expected to reduce the depth of the primary minimum and the energy barrier to detachment from the primary minimum torkzaban and bradford 2016 shen et al 2011 experimentally showed that the reduction effect of nsr on energy barrier is effective at ionic strengths higher than 0 01 m for large particles 1156 nm colloids in their study therefore it is significant to incorporate nanoscale surface roughness into interaction energy to address colloid retention and release in porous media however nsr itself has been proven to be unable to reproduce the observed dramatic increase of attachment and irreversibility with increased roughness under unfavorable conditions which necessitates inclusion of nanoscale charge heterogeneity that is inferred to have codeveloped with roughness rasmuson et al 2019 resultantly charge heterogeneity also plays a crucial role in influencing fines migration chen et al 2001 bradford et al 2012a 2012b the surface element integration sei technique based on local topography has been employed to account for the roughness effect on dlvo interactions bhattacharjee and elimelech 1997 bhattacharjee et al 1998 bendersky and davis 2011 shen et al 2012 in comparison the grid surface integration gsi discretizes the heterogeneously patterned surfaces into equally sized tiny grids capturing desired features of the surfaces by assigning various hamaker constants or zeta potentials positive or negative to those discretized cells duffadar and davis 2007 2008 duffadar et al 2009 then the total interaction energy is acquired by summing the contribution of each discretized surface element over the entire particle surface a gsi based langrangian trajectory approach ma et al 2011 pazmino et al 2014a b has been further developed to quantify the influence of nanoscale heterogeneity on colloid migration despite having provided invaluable information the intensive computation caused by sealed heterogeneity distribution and requirements of full knowledge of the flow field and repeated surface integration calculations restrain the trajectory simulations to pore scale study and it is especially inconvenient to feature transient surface heterogeneity due to changes in solution chemistry by contrast the continuum model approach necessitates averaged heterogeneous properties that occur at the pore scale over a representative elementary volume or area to obtain effective lumped parameters a computationally efficient statistical approach based on gsi assuming binormal distributed chemical heterogeneity has been developed to estimate colloid adhesive parameters at a scale of the representative elementary area which also enables one to account for temporal variations in charge heterogeneity bradford and torkzaban 2012a interactions between colloids and the zone of influence zoi depend on the ratio of total heterodomain defined as the nanoscale domain of opposite charges to the bulk surface area over the zoi area when colloids approach heterodomains the average and variance of interaction energies in a cell unit are obtained to represent the physical and chemical heterogeneities direct measurements of colloid heterodomains are not practical using current techniques for example the assay of surface heterogeneity using x ray photoelectron or other techniques has no straightforward translation to spatial variation in surface properties that are directly pertinent to colloid surface interactions pazmino et al 2014a whereas the force volume approach of atomic force microscopy afm is able to provide valuable information on colloid surface interaction forces over an area taboada serrano et al 2005 drelich and wang 2011 it is extremely laborious to conduct force volume imaging over a representative area of the collector at a resolution corresponding to colloid collector interactions however the representative heterogeneity parameters of porous media might be inversely determined from the trajectory simulation of colloids transport incorporating discrete surface heterogeneity by simulating the retention behavior of colloids of various sizes under different fluid velocities and ionic strengths pazmino et al 2014a showed that the uniformly placed power law size distributed ranging within 60 120 nm rather than randomly placed 5 nm radius heterodomains could quantitatively match the observed retention under unfavorable conditions over soda lime glass slides in comparison duffadar et al 2009 reported that 21 of surface coverage of randomly placed 5 nm radius heterodomains could successfully describe the deposition rates of three colloid sizes 0 46 1 and 2 μm at 90 mm on silica surfaces coating with cationic polymer poly dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate 5 maximum retention concentration the advective diffusive attachment detachment model with the sink term for particle retention and the source term for particle dislodging has been widely used to evaluate fines mobilization migration and straining in porous media assuming that the particle detachment rate is proportional to the retained concentration schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 foppen and schijven 2006 bradford et al 2003 2011 tufenkji 2007 molnar et al 2015 chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 the proportionality coefficient of detachment is an empirical constant usually determined by tuning the experimental data which does not characterize the microscale mechanical equilibrium moreover this model exhibits asymptotic stabilization of permeability after an abrupt change of the parameters while the laboratory tests show an instant response to the abrupt flow perturbation ochi and vernoux 1998 bedrikovetsky et al 2011a bedrikovetsky et al 2012b one of the crucial parameters for fines migration modeling is the mass volume concentration of released particles which is a key input to predict effluent concentration and permeability variation the experimentally observed critical conditions for fines remobilization implies the existence of a maximum retention concentration mrc mrc is a function of the dimensionless ratio between tangent and normal forces determined by torque balance particle mobilization occurs when the applied hydrodynamic torque acting on a particle overcomes the adhesion torque khilar and fogler 1998 yuan and shapiro 2011 bradford and torkzaban 2012a elimelech et al 2013 israelachvili 2015 once the balance is disrupted a certain number of attached particles are released and resting is the maximum retention concentration under a particular fluid condition i e retention concentrations higher than mrc are not permitted according to the torque balance requirement in comparison when the retention concentration is lower than mrc attached particles will be in a mechanical equilibrium state and arresting torques dominate over mobilizing torques which impedes particle detachment substituting the expressions for drag electrostatic lift and gravitational forces into the torque balance equation enables us to acquire mrc and released concentration under a particular condition bedrikovetsky et al 2011a the incorporation of phenomenological mrc into the particle release kinetics in the classical attachment detachment model allows one to quantify released particle concentration however the maximum retention function does not account for the nanoscale surface heterogeneity that may yield an incorrect determination of mrc under unfavorable conditions furthermore the multilayer model does not consider the influence of adjacent particles despite its over simplification it enables an excellent match to effluent concentration and permeability at the core and reservoir scale by tuning unknown parameters meanwhile the one dimensional problem of deep bed filtration with limited particle retention determined by mrc allows for an exact analytical solution under the assumption of constant filtration coefficient and porosity bedrikovetsky et al 2011a yang et al 2020 two approaches have been developed to quantify mrc incorporating the multilayer monosize and the monolayer multisize models based on different assumptions the former represents the case of multi layer attachment of single radius particles in rock with mono sized cylindrical capillaries bedrikovetsky et al 2011a the latter corresponds to a monolayer of poly dispersed particles expressed via size distribution for fine particles you et al 2015 we will explain these two methods in detail below 5 1 multilayer monosize model this section presents the maximum retention function of multi layer mono sized particles in cylindrical pores fig 4 exhibits particle rotation around the tangent point with its neighboring particle the distance between the particle and the cake increases from a minimum value up to some point where interactions are negligible which corresponds to particle dislodging therefore the electrostatic forces at various distances along the dlvo force profile are ergodic particle detachment indicates that the adhesion torque resultant from the maximum attraction force has to be exceeded by the adverse hydrodynamic torque as a result the maximum attraction force is naturally selected as the adhesion force fe in the mechanical equilibrium condition the lever arms for drag and normal forces have the same order of magnitude and their ratio is equal to 3 for a two dimensional case of particles with the same radius the final expression eq 21 of mrc is a function of the erosion number ε defined by the ratio of the drag force at an absence of particle retention over the sum of normal forces bedrikovetsky et al 2011a 21 σ σ c r ε ε μ r s 2 u f n φ k 0 2 the subscript cr denotes the maximum or critical value fig 5 presents a schematic of the velocity dependency of mrc obtained from eq 21 the higher is the velocity u the higher is the numerator in the expression 18 for the erosion number ε the higher is the lifting force and the lower is the denominator consequently the erosion number is a monotonically increasing function of u and a higher velocity yields a lower mrc continuous particle retention until the torque equilibrium can be illustrated geometrically in the u σ plane as shown in fig 5 point a below the mrc curve denotes an under saturated state at a certain reservoir location i e the attaching torque exceeds the detaching torque if some suspended particles move along with constant velocity particle retention will occur at this location under a constant injection rate the gradual particle attachment leads to an increase in the interstitial flow velocity and resultantly increased drag and lifting forces the process of particle retention corresponds to the upward movement along the vertical line from point a to b and stops until the saturated state torque equilibrium is reached i e point b the shift from a to c corresponds to the gradual velocity increase without particle attachment indicating increased hydrodynamic forces the torque equilibrium of particles is satisfied at point c where the corresponding velocity refers to the critical velocity or minimum velocity for fine mobilization miranda and underdown 1993 khilar and fogler 1998 further increase of flow velocity results in a certain number of particles being detached corresponding to the movement along the mrc curve from point c to d 5 2 monolayer multisize model natural reservoir fines are size distributed in a wide range khilar and fogler 1998 civan 2007 2015 and all the components involved in the mechanical equilibrium of an attached particle are size dependent particles are dislodged by drag force with increasing velocity and decreasing ionic strength in the order of particle size reduction the larger particles are easier to be released first and the smaller particles remain indicating the existence of critical particle size therefore unlike the multilayer monosize model we propose a monolayer multisize model based on the critical particle size rscr to quantify mrc you et al 2015 2016 2019 22 σ c r u γ σ a 0 0 r s c r u γ σ a r s d r s σ a l 1 represents the size distribution of attached fines σ a 0 is the initial retention concentration typical forms of the salinity and velocity dependency of mrc under various temperatures calculated using the multilayer monosize model are depicted in fig 6 we assume that the attached particle sizes hold a log normal distribution point i corresponds to the initial attached particle concentration ionic strength decrease from γ1 to γ2 velocity increase from zero to u b does not lift fines the attached particles start to be released at point b further ionic strength decrease down to γ3 velocity increase up to u c causes the release of fines by the amount σ we noticed that mrc obtained by the multilayer monosize model exhibits a quadratic polynomial and the corresponding mrc curves are convex in comparison the form of mrc curves for the case of mono layer fines is not convex the maximum retention function versus temperature is determined by the temperature dependencies of the electrostatic constants in eqs 16 18 and of water viscosity that affects the hydrodynamic forces therefore the temperature dependency of mrc is primarily determined by the materials involved in the system for a quartz water kaolinite system we conclude that higher temperature 45 leads to lower mrc and a greater number of released particles due to the dominance of temperature influence on the adhesive torque you et al 2019 nevertheless this monolayer multisize model ignored the brownian force which might be significant when addressing brownian particles ma et al 2013 under unfavorable conditions the diffusion controlled brownian particles transporting in a near surface region must possess sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the energy barrier to approach the primary minimum likewise particles attached at the primary minimum must hold sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the energy barrier to be detached ryan and elimelech 1996 it should also be noted that the breakthrough of larger particles in column transport experiments precedes that of smaller ones indicating the size dependency of particle dispersity chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 5 3 transition from salinity to velocity dependency of mrc the radial flow rate per unit of the reservoir depth around a production well is expressed by q 2πru one observes two or more orders of magnitude decrease of fluid velocity in the direction from the wellbore towards the drainage contour during production the magnitude of this decrease is proportional to the distance from the well moreover variation of fluid viscosity with the temperature significantly affects detaching hydrodynamic forces that are also functions of fluid velocity therefore such rheological dependence of σcr should be studied over a wide range of fluid velocities a thorough understanding of this relationship enables reliable estimation of well productivity index however the capacity of commercially available pumps restricts core floods with a broad range of fluid velocity variation comparatively running core floods with a wide range ionic strength is more practical than core floods at high velocity fortunately torque balance allows us to translate the salinity dependence of mrc σcr σcr γ to its velocity dependence σcr u and vice versa you et al 2015 2016 2019 now we describe such translation for a monolayer of multi sized particles attached to pore walls core floods with various fluid ionic strengths γ at a fixed velocity u0 allows obtaining the corresponding mrc σcr u0 γ recalling that one can determine the critical particle radius rscr u0 γ from torque balance equation it is possible to calculate the critical velocity that offers an equivalent rscr u γ0 at a fixed ionic strength γ0 by equating rscr u γ0 rscr u0 γ therefore the relationship σcr u0 γ obtained experimentally can be re calculated into σcr u γ0 via rscr u γ0 fig 6 shows an example of translation of mrc between the salinity dependency and velocity dependency based on the transition procedure described above fig 6a shows σcr u0 γ at constant fluid velocity and the translated curves in fig 6b represent σcr u γ0 at constant fluid ionic strength 6 delayed particle release experimental observations indicate that replacing the reservoir fluids with an electrolyte of lower ionic strength yields significant alteration of the rock wettability towards more hydrophilic mahani et al 2015a 2015b yang et al 2016 rayhani et al 2020 the reduced contact angle causes an easier detachment of oil droplets from the solid surface however a noticeable delay between salinity alternation and the corresponding contact angle change has been reported mahani et al 2015a 2015b this phenomenon owes to ionic diffusion in the thin film between the deformed oil droplet and rock surface fig 7 the so called nernst planck diffusion in a narrow contact area between two plates under the molecular force action is significantly slower than the brownian diffusion resulting in a significant delay in establishing equilibrium of the salt concentration between the bulk fluid and the contact area a similar effect may also be expected for lsw induced particle detachment unlike mathematical models developed for fines migration arising from increased flow rate that assume an instant detachment of those extra particles beyond the critical retention concentration the delayed release must be considered in the models of lsw induced fines migration the delay in particle detachment can be described by a non equilibrium relationship between the retention concentration and salinity i e the critical retention concentration is reached after certain retardation time τ i e 23 σ a x t τ σ c r γ x t assuming the retardation time is constant the detachment kinetics is obtained by reserving the linear terms from the taylor series expansion of eq 23 24 τ σ a x t t σ c r γ x t σ a x t eq 24 is valid for small retardation time t τ this equation resembles relaxation kinetics commonly used in modelling chemical reactions bedrikovetsky 1993 during low salinity water injection clay particles can only be gradually released after the arrival of the injected lsw the released particles give rise to a shock at the moving water front rankine hugoniot rh jump condition has been successfully applied to address this discontinuity in the particle concentration the rh condition based on the conservation laws of mass provides a simple and straightforward method to obtain the values of shock parameters russell et al 2018 yang et al 2020 7 attachment detachment hysteresis in addition to the delayed release caused by nernst planck diffusion another phenomenon related to ionic strength that deserves to be explored is the attachment detachment hysteresis or irreversibility the retention concentration profile for stepwise decreased salinity unloading does not coincide with that for stepwise increased salinity loading typically the affinity of colloids to solid substrates appears to be greater along the salinity unloading path than that along the salinity loading path fig 8 however the dlvo theory reflecting mean interaction energies predicts the same adhesive electrostatic force at an identical salinity and therefore provides the same retention profile and fails in elucidating the mechanisms of hysteresis a similar phenomenon has also been reported for retention curves caused by flow perturbation i e decreasing and increasing fluid velocity a smaller retention concentration was observed for stepwise decreased velocity attachment compared to increased velocity detachment the velocity related retention hysteresis was attributed to the deformation hysteresis i e greater deformation can be achieved upon the process of attachment yielding higher arresting torques when increasing flow rates vanness et al 2019 although the time dependence of deformation may play a role in hysteresis transient retention hysteresis by flow perturbation has not been verified despite its unaccountability several other hypotheses explaining salinity induced retention hysteresis have been proposed including the adhesion hysteresis arising from surface heterogeneity that has not been accounted for in the conventional dlvo theory and the presence of low velocity regions where the torques acting on a colloid are favorable for attachment bradford and kim 2012b the latter indicates that the number of retained colloids depends on the mass transfer of particles to grain grain contact or stagnation points where the competition of torques is favorable for retention torkzaban et al 2007 bradford et al 2011 subsequent alterations of fluid salinity cannot release particles due to the small scale vortices torkzaban et al 2008 however simulations using navier stokes equations reveal that the contribution of these low velocity regions on colloid retention is insignificant bradford and kim 2012b in comparison the former hysteresis implies that more particles interact with existing nano or microscale heterogeneities leading to contact at the primary minima where the retained particles are difficult to be removed bradford and kim 2012b calculations using the gsi technique demonstrate that the retention hysteresis is closely related to the size of zoi defined as proportional to the square root of the product of the colloid radius and the debye length spatial charge heterogeneity produces significant deviations from the mean interaction energy when the zoi is small yielding local minima favorable for retention duffadar and davis 2007 bradford and kim 2012b experimentally substantiated the effect of surface heterogeneity on retention hysteresis by conducting core flooding tests in salt and salt acid treated sand packs fig 8b they concluded that smaller colloids were more irreversibly retained thus more distinct hysteresis than larger colloids due to lower hydrodynamic torque applied and greater depths in the local minima of the interaction energy near heterogeneities meanwhile the surface heterogeneity of colloids may also play a role in the retention hysteresis tan et al 2005 measured charge heterogeneity on polystyrene latex particles and attributed it to the separation of ion rich and ion poor components of the polymer on the particle surface the parti suite software https wpjohnsongroup utah edu trajectorycodes html developed by johnson s group the university of utah incorporated a full force and torque balance into pore scale mechanistic lagrangian trajectory simulations enabling one to predict colloid attachment and detachment under favorable and unfavorable conditions johnson et al 2018 vanness et al 2019 it is reasonable to expect that secondary minimum associated colloids and primary minimum attached colloids via surface heterogeneity contribute to the retention and hysteresis observed in fig 8b here we propose that hysteresis for the secondary minimum associated colloids may arise from shifting their equilibrium separation distances from hundreds of nanometers at low ionic strength to several nanometers primary minimum at high ionic strength fig 9 upon ionic strength reduction the barrier to detachment retains the colloid within the primary minimum where fluid drag is low and surface attraction is high such that the colloids remain attached despite low ionic strength fig 9 hahn et al 2004 however this hypothesis assumes the absence of heterogeneity it deserves noting that the presence of surface heterogeneity locally reduces or eliminates the repulsive barrier so that secondary minimum associated colloids can enter the primary minimum and attach in the case involving heterogeneity hysteresis can arise from the varied overlap of zois with heterodomains which produces varied attraction pazmino et al 2014a b ron et al 2019 rasmuson et al 2019 varied overlap of zois with heterodomains arises from the impacts of diffusion on precisely how each colloid encounters heterodomains combined with the fact that the zoi radius decreases with increased salinity pazmino et al 2014a b ron et al 2019 rasmuson et al 2019 the schematic shown in fig 9 illustrates a particular scenario i e increasing the salinity from low unfavorable to high favorable values when the salinity is increased from low unfavorable to medium unfavorable values particles must hold sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the energy barrier and approach the primary minimum therefore the adhesion force is sensitive to the kinetic energy of attached particles and their resultant equilibrium positions the maxwellian probability density function has been widely used to evaluate the distribution of kinetic energies of colloids hahn and o melia 2004 shen et al 2007 johnson and hilpert 2013 bradford et al 2017 providing a linkage between nanoscale colloid surface interactions and continuum scale retention and reentrainment rate coefficients the trajectory simulation conducted by ma et al 2011 demonstrated that the difference between the maxwell predicted and their simulated velocity distribution is relatively small a factor of two to three the probability of colloid interaction with the primary and secondary minima can therefore be estimated from the maxwellian cumulative density function shen et al 2007 25 ε a b 2 v π exp v d v where v represents the dlvo interaction energy a and b denote the lower and upper limits of integration respectively selecting appropriate values of the lower and upper limits a and b from the calculated interaction energy profiles corresponding to different salinities allows us to determine colloids equilibrium positions force and torque balances determine whether a colloid attaches to or escapes from a surface it is worth mentioning that the movement of colloids initially trapped at either the primary or the secondary minimum of a low salinity curve towards the minima of a high salinity curve would not alter the integration limits of either the low salinity curve or the high salinity curve this is ascribed to deeper minima and a broader range of interaction limits of a high salinity profile than a low salinity one when unloading salinity however the integration limits might have been changed due to the shift of equilibrium position of an attached particle from the secondary minimum to the primary minimum during salinity loading despite the same energy profile corresponding to the same salinity consequently a higher probability of colloid interaction with the primary minimum is anticipated under the same fluid conditions the higher attractive force at the primary minimum compared with the secondary minimum may give rise to hysteresis of attachment and detachment when salinity is first increased and then decreased however the validity of the maxwell approach for secondary minimum interactions is debated pazmino et al 2014a direct pore scale observations show that unless solution chemistry or flow is perturbed attached immobilized colloids of diameter 100 nm and larger do not undergo significant diffusive detachment johnson et al 2010 accordingly the adaptability of our hypothesis based on the maxwell distribution of velocity for colloids larger than 100 nm is skeptical and must be addressed it is worth noting that the lower and upper limits of integration a and b in the maxwell accumulative density function eq 25 are size dependent the larger the particle size the higher the values of a and b the lower the probability for colloids to overcome energy barriers therefore the prediction using the maxwell approach agrees with the conclusion of insignificant diffusion for larger particles if it can be used to characterize brownian particles it should also work for larger particles that are not diffusion controlled the key of our hypothesis is the shifting of equilibrium position during the process of salinity increase and decrease which occurs regardless of what type of velocity distribution is assumed for colloids different equilibrium positions yield different adhesion forces and thus different torques which determines the fate of colloids we select the maxwell approach as a way to identify the possible equilibrium positions of colloids as no better velocity distribution functions available to us although johnson et al 2010 observed insignificant diffusive detachment the variation of equilibrium position within a range of tens of nanometers has not been negated and remains to be explored attachment detachment hysteresis yields two types of particle attachment i e reversible and irreversible analytical solutions have been derived accounting for the two type particle transport in porous media reversible and irreversible attachment kinetics are formulated separately both assuming linear attachment rates katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2019 this two type attachment assumption has further been coupled with a particle tracking algorithm to track particle s movement in a laminar flow determined by the local cubic law within a rough fracture created by the random field generator ding et al 2021 8 discussion it has been recognized that the electrical double layer force is much more sensitive to salinity compared to the van der waals force and born repulsion force this is because zeta potential as one of the essential parameters in the expression of double layer force eq 18 can be enormously influenced by salinity you et al 2019 commonly the magnitude of zeta potential descends with increased salinity indicating a weaker repulsive double layer force in comparison the hamaker constant is negligibly changed with ionic strength elimelech et al 2013 and therefore the van der waals force and born repulsion force are less dependent on salinity in the light of the traditional dlvo theory one expects that increasing salinity can result in a higher adhesion force and retained particle concentration and on the contrary decreasing salinity yields a lower adhesion force and retained particle concentration fig 10 demonstrates the calculated examples of the dlvo force profile under different salinity at a distance greater than the primary minimum the calculated double layer force decreases as salinity increases agreeing with our knowledge nevertheless the double layer force curves intersect around the primary minimum exhibiting a non monotonic variation i e increases first and then decreases with increased salinity thus the magnitude of the total dlvo force at the primary minimum referred to as primary force in the following discussion is anticipated to decrease first and then increase with increased salinity opposite to the variation of double layer force at the same location although the primary force has been considered the adhesion force in the literature bowling 1988 vadillo rodrı guez et al 2004 zhao et al 2020 the unexpected non monotonic tendency of the primary force brings about a critical issue i e what is the proper way to predict adhesion force from dlvo interaction curves apparently it is non physical to use the primary force that provides a stronger adhesion at extremely low salinity theoretically the potential energy of a particle should be locally minimized that is fine particles attached to a surface are trapped at a local minimum of the energy profile an energy barrier might exist at low salinity separating the primary minimum and the secondary minimum at the energy distance profile fig 11 a while at high salinity the energy barrier is absent fig 11b the maximum force corresponding to the secondary energy minimum referred to as secondary force in the following discussion has been applied to quantifying the adhesion force for secondary minimum associated colloids at low salinity torkzaban et al 2007 2008 bai et al 2019 you et al 2019 which yields a monotonic trend of adhesion force with salinity that agrees with our common knowledge however the weak secondary force usually several orders of magnitude lower than the primary force predicts no immobile attachment under most unfavorable conditions in response to fluid shear and diffusion this contradicts numerous visualization tests which showed that attached particles could not be completely removed at a low salinity environment ryan and gschwend 1994 lenhart and sariers 2003 torkzaban et al 2010 this discrepancy occurs owing to the presence of charge heterogeneity and a range of overlap between zoi and heterodomains ron et al 2019 rasmuson et al 2019 it is worth noting that the dlvo theory assumes no physical or chemical heterogeneity and we must recognize that the colloid attachment observed in countless transport experiments cannot be explained without concerning the existence of nanoscale heterogeneity ron and johnson 2020 another laboratory observation contradicting dlvo prediction is that adhesion force might decrease with increased salinity at high electrolyte concentrations i e a weaker collision or coagulation occurs when the double layer is expected to collapse elimelech 1990 studied the collision efficiency of latex colloids with glass surfaces in a kcl solution and observed a critical k concentration 0 1 m beyond which the collision efficiency declines anomalously with increasing electrolyte concentration li et al 2020 reported that the higher is the salinity of the initially injected colloid suspension the easier is the detachment of those attached colloids i e the interaction between colloids and surfaces shows a weaker attraction in a high salinity environment alfridsson et al 2000 demonstrated that the aggregation rate of charged paraffin particles increases with nacl concentration while decreasing after reaching a peak value at about 0 5 m moreover silica particles exhibit excellent stability in a solution with any electrolyte concentration implying large repulsion even at high salinity when the double layer is highly compressed manciu and ruckenstein 2001b resultantly researchers have recognized that non dlvo forces might also be essential in explaining particle surface interactions occurring in a fluid hydration force is a typical short distance repulsion between hydrophilic surfaces exhibiting an exponential attenuation as the separation distance increases israelachvili and pashley 1983 parsegian and zemb 2011 when salinity is higher than the critical hydration concentration hydrated cations are adsorbed onto the negatively charged surface resulting in the repulsive hydration force proportional to salinity israelachvili 2015 the expression of the hydration force between a spherical particle and a flat surface is given as molina bolivar and ortega vinuesa 1999 26 f h 2 π r s e 0 e h λ h where e 0 is defined by 27 e 0 n a c h c λ h where n a is the avogadro constant mol 1 c is the concentration of the electrolyte solution mm ch is the hydration constant j λ h is the decay length m a typical value of 1 6 10 20 is generally adopted for the hydration constant c h molina bolivar and ortega vinuesa 1999 the decay length is given as 0 6 nm which has been proven to be independent of ionic strength van oss 1993 the corresponding hydration potential is obtained from the integration of eq 26 with respect to the separation distance h 28 v h 2 π r s e 0 λ h e h λ h an extended dlvo theory xdlvo has been developed accounting for the hydration force mahmood et al 2001 pazmino et al 2014b li et al 2020 the presence of the hydration force gives rise to a reduction in the adhesion at the primary minimum it thus leads to a lower collision efficiency easier detachment and abnormally high dispersity of a high salinity solution containing hydrophilic particles a comprehensive analysis to quantify the contribution of other non dlvo forces e g solvation and lewis acid base forces on the dlvo interaction profile and fines migration is urgently needed the solvation force originates from the density variation of liquid molecules with separation when two solid surfaces approach each other due to the dramatic constraining effect between the confining surfaces israelachvili 2015 lewis acid base interactions are of polar origin primarily based on electron acceptor electron donor interactions between polar moieties in polar media van oss et al 1988 the development of the atomic force microscopy afm and colloidal probe technique allows direct quantification of the adhesion force between the surfaces immersed in electrolyte solutions butt et al 2005 assemi et al 2006 filby et al 2012 however contradictory measurements are reported for different solid liquid systems either an increased freitas and sharma 2001 or a decreased assemi et al 2006 zhao et al 2020 adhesion force required to pull off an attached particle at elevated salinity has been reported furthermore available afm measurements regarding the impact of temperature on the adhesion force were all conducted in a gas phase despite its significance direct quantification of the temperature effect on adhesion force in an aqueous phase is not documented and requires further investigation it also deserves noting that when measuring the adhesion force using afm the external force imposed by the afm cantilever pushes particles through the energy barrier and enables them to reach the neighborhood of the primary minimum accordingly the afm measured force represents the adhesion force for a particle trapped around the primary minimum to be detached and is not representative of an unfavorable condition future work could lead to the determination of adhesion force at low salinity when an energy barrier exists and hinders colloids from approaching the primary minimum 9 conclusions fine particle migration is essential in many natural processes such as hydrocarbon recovery contaminant transport and wastewater treatment continuous efforts have been devoted to revealing the influencing factors and developing mathematical quantifications for particle attachment and detachment however many unexpected experimental and theoretical results that deviate from the prevalent dlvo theory remain to be addressed this paper presents a critical review on the current understanding of primary factors influencing fines migration as well as mathematical formulations for quantification from our point of view the necessitated development in near future could include 1 the newly proposed hypothesis of colloid attachment detachment hysteresis accounting for shifting equilibrium positions should be experimentally substantiated 2 the influence of non dlvo forces and surface heterogeneity on colloid mobilization requires a more comprehensive understanding 3 surface heterogeneity plays a significant role in determining the adhesion force between particles and substrate under an unfavorable condition 4 direct measurement of the temperature effect on adhesion force in an aqueous phase is not well studied and requires further investigation 5 although the underlying mechanisms governing the colloid surface interactions have been explored in recent years researchers are still struggling with a meaningful and accurate prediction of colloid attachment and detachment due to its complexity it would be helpful to build a platform that resembles existing

16185,permeability reduction and formation damage in porous media caused by fines defined as unconfined solid particles present in the pore spaces migration is one of the major reasons for productivity decline it is well accepted that particle detachment occurs under imbalanced torques arising from hydrodynamic and adhesive forces exerted on attached particles this paper reviewed current understanding on primary factors influencing fines migration as well as mathematical formulations for quantification we also introduced salinity related experimental observations that contradict theoretical predictions based on torque balance criteria such as delayed particle release and attachment detachment hysteresis the delay of particle release during low salinity water injection was successfully explained and formulated by the nernst planck diffusion of ions in a narrow contact area in addition to the widely recognized explanation by surface heterogeneity and the presence of low velocity regions we proposed a hypothesis that accounts for the shifting of equilibrium positions providing new insight into the interpretation of elusive attachment detachment

as kaolinite chlorite and illite quartz and silica particles might also be released in low consolidated sandstones sen and khilar 2006 arab et al 2014 guo et al 2016 2018 huang et al 2017 2018 in addition to those naturally present in situ colloidal particles and precipitation from supersaturated solutions movable fines may also come from cement dissolution due to mineral reactions experimental studies show that chemical reactions during co₂ saturated water injection or water saturated scco₂ injection dissolve inter granular cement othman et al 2019a b ge et al 2020 2022 therefore some of the grains and fines bonded with the rock due to cementing are dislodged which causes detachment of fines othman et al 2019a b zhang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 reported that water could dissolve some carbonate at high temperatures which leads to fines migration the mechanism is similar to co2 sequestration but mineral dissolution during single phase water flow is only significant at high temperatures permeability decline during core floods with piecewise increasing velocity has been observed in numerous laboratory tests khilar and fogler 1998 ochi and vernoux 1998 1999 similar effects have been detected during piecewise decrease in salinity or increase in ph while injecting fluids into porous media lever and dawe 1984 kia et al 1987a b despite the great efforts that researchers have made a couple of mysteries remain veiled due to the complicated interactions between particles and substrates especially when it comes to the influence of ionic strength and temperature for example the widely reported delayed particle release during low salinity water injection and particle attachment detachment hysteresis during the salinity loading and unloading process are still not fully understood moreover colloid attachment in the presence of repulsive barriers unfavorable condition highlights the significance of nano or larger scale surface chemical heterogeneity johnson et al 2010 temperature also plays an essential role in determining particle substrate interactions yet the experimental findings are controversial flooding tests performed on sandstone cores showed that core permeabilities were significantly decreased to 35 90 of the initial permeability when temperature increased to 80 180 schembre and kovscek 2005 musharova et al 2012 owing to particle detachment and subsequent pore clogging at higher temperatures however several experiments revealed that increasing temperature yields an increased attached particle concentration when injecting colloids into porous media kim and walker 2009 yan et al 2015 sasidharan et al 2017 a schematic for attached and strained fine particles in the porous space is demonstrated in fig 1 showcasing the particle statuses of attachment detachment suspension straining and bridging it is worth noting that the detachment of fines coating the grain surfaces yields a negligible increase in porosity and permeability relative to the significant porosity and permeability decline that arises from their straining at pore throats and the resultant blocking of flow paths permeability reduction caused by fines migration can be characterized directly by particle straining or indirectly by estimating porosity variation due to particle straining which is then related to permeability change using correlations between porosity and permeability johnson et al 2020 this paper presents current understanding on primary influencing factors of fines migration our review starts with the criteria

bedrikovetsky et al 2011a molnar et al 2015 vanness et al 2019 colloid attachment is traditionally defined by removing particle mass from solution via collision with and fixation to the porous media dependent on particle surface interactions elimelech and o melia 1990 and physically controlled processes of sedimentation and interception logan et al 1995 the kinetics of particle attachment are controlled by the rate of delivery to solid surfaces and subsequent immobilization the current review is focused on the process of colloid immobilization rather than collision therefore we use attachment to refer to immobilization and the two terms are used equivalently in this text colloid detachment occurs when mobilizing torque from hydrodynamic force exceeds the arresting torque from adhesion the same forces and torques that determine detachment also govern immobilization attachment wherein immobilization is permitted when the arresting torque exceeds the mobilizing torque van ness et al 2019 further suggested that attachment and detachment should be unified in modeling as parameters calibrated by particle attachment are the key to successful predictions of particle detachment three conceptual models have been proposed to quantify the critical conditions of particle remobilization i e rolling sliding and lifting sharma et al 1992 the latter predicts a significantly larger flow rate relative to that necessitates rolling or sliding owing to a negligible lifting force created by fluid bypassing the attached particle in a laminar flow and the fact that the balance between the lifting and adhesion forces determines whether lifting occurs bergendahl and grasso 2000 2003 shavezipur et al 2012 direct adhesion force measurements and cell flow experiments demonstrate that the measured pull off force of an attached particle is several orders of magnitude greater than the critical hydrodynamic force required for particle removal from a substrate das et al 1994 freitas and sharma 2001 this indicates that lifting is not a primary mechanism for particle remobilization by comparing the centrifuge experiments with flow cell experiments it has also been demonstrated that the detachment of spherical particles is more likely to be initiated by rolling rather than sliding given the same critical torques required to release the particles in both the centrifuge and the flow experiments sharma et al 1992 however it is worth mentioning that torque balance predicts no attachment in the presence of a strong energy barrier despite clear experimental observation to the contrary implying the significance of surface charge heterogeneity that can highly influence the magnitude of adhesion force pazmino et al 2014a b vanness et al 2019 detailed discussion of the surface heterogeneity effect on particle mobilization will be presented in section 4 5 fig 2 illustrates forces and torques acting on a deformable colloid resting on a rigid solid surface with a roughness of height hr as well as the corresponding lever arms the profile of flow velocity generates the drag fd mlt 2 and lift fl mlt 2 forces while the interactions between colloid and surface give rise to the adhesive force fa mlt 2 the lift force is negligible in a laminar flow if compared with the adhesion force soltani and ahmadi 1994 the resultant force of gravity and buoyancy fb can be neglected for a neutrally buoyant particle however gravity becomes significant for the larger and denser particles transport in water saturated porous media under conditions electrostatically unfavourable to deposition chen et al 2010 chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 higher retention concentration was observed under upward than downward flows chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 the drag force fd acting on a spherical particle in contact with a plane wall can be calculated by goldman et al 1967 o neill 1968 bradford and torkzaban 2013 1 f d c h 6 π μ w τ w r s r s h

eq 9 interfacial parameters are required to calculate the thermodynamic work of adhesion however the surface tension of a solid is hard to be obtained starov 2013 let alone its salinity and temperature dependence that have been proven to be crucial in determining the adhesion force the contact angle is generally used to estimate the lifshitz van der waals component of the surface tension vrlinic et al 2016 yet the difficulty in obtaining an equilibrium contact angle results in higher uncertainty starov and velarde 2019 me ml2t 2 is the external moment of surface stress which can be

water density the resisting adhesive torque is determined by 14 t a l a f a f b colloid rolling occurs if t a t h 0 while colloids are immobilized when t a t h 0 3 dlvo theory at the interfacial scale the dlvo theory has been widely used to calculate the interaction energies between the particles and pore surfaces the total energy v is the sum of the london van der waals lvw potential v l w the electrical double layer potential v e d l and the born potential v b hogg et al 1966 gregory 1981 derjaguin and landau 1993 elimelech et al 2013 15 v v l w v e d l v b it is worth noting that the traditional dlvo theory includes only lvw and the electrical double layer potential while short range repulsive interactions are not considered however without the presence of short range repulsions colloids have no chance to escape from the infinitely deep primary minimum the born repulsion force derived from the interatomic potential model same as that used to generate the lvw potential is typically included in the dlvo theory to provide a finite primary minimum other repulsion forces such as the hydration force solvation force and lewis acid base force are regarded as non dlvo forces israelachvili 2015 georgopoulou et al 2020 we will highlight the significance of non dlvo forces in determining colloids fate in the discussion section when discussing abnormal phenomena of colloid mobilization in response to salinity variations in this section we briefly present the most commonly used formulae developed for spherical particles and plane surfaces for the three components of the dlvo potential rather than provide a thorough review of theory development those formulae are employed to generate dlvo curves in later sections a detailed summary including various expressions of each element that account for different assumptions and particle shapes can be found in elimelech et al 2013 and shen et al 2020 respectively 3 1 london van der waals potential the london van der waals energy of interaction between two subjects integrates all intermolecular interactions between polarized molecules over the surface at the microscopic scale several expressions for sphere sphere and sphere plate geometries have been summarized by elimelech et al 2013 among which the one derived by gregory 1981 is the most commonly used expressed by 16 v l w a 132 r s 6 h 1 5 32 h λ l n 1 λ 5

constant n is the refractive index the subscript 1 2 and 3 represent latex silica and liquid respectively ν e is the constant value of absorption frequency taken from israelachvili 2015 3 2 electrical double layer potential the electrical double layer is a structure existing near a charged surface in a fluid the first layer the so called stern layer consists of counter ions adsorbed onto the substrate due to chemical interactions while the second layer diffuse layer comprises ions attracted onto the surface via the coulomb force electrically screening the first layer unlike the first layer being firmly anchored the diffuse layer is movable in the fluid under electric attraction or thermal motion the counter ion cloud extends into the solution encompassing a charged surface balancing the surface charge over some distance away from the particle as a result the net surface charge highly affects the distribution of counterions in the diffuse layer for a detailed description of the double layer structure we refer to elimelech et al 2013 the repulsive electrical double layer energy between two similarly charged surfaces originates from the overlap of diffuse counter ion layers surrounding the charged bodies various expressions for electrical double layer interaction based on three types of assumptions including constant potential constant charge and linear superposition approximation lsa have been presented in the literature elimelech et al 2013 the equation derived from the linear superposition approximation is widely adopted in estimating the edl energy leading to an intermediate value between those given by formulae stemming from the constant potential or constant charge assumptions the lsa based expression for edl is given by 18 v e d l 128

hydrodynamic and adhesion forces the hydrodynamic forces are determined by the flow rate of injection the adhesion force is calculated by dlvo theory primarily influenced by chemical compositions ph and salinity of the fluids temperature and physical and chemical heterogeneity on surfaces it is worth noting that the present study is focused on the single phase flow for multiphase flows additional influencing factors such as interfacial tension and wettability may become significant and must be included huang et al 2018 2021a othman et al 2018 2019a 2019b yu et al 2019 ge et al 2020 2022 4 1 salinity fluid salinity can alter the double layer force by affecting the zeta potential of colloid and rock surfaces thereby influencing the adhesion of attached particles as salinity increases the magnitude of zeta potential decreases resulting in weaker repulsion between the two approaching surfaces the presence of a higher energy barrier at lower salinity decreases the possibility of colloids being trapped at the primary minimum due to the lack of sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the barrier the secondary minimum associated colloids are not arrested but move slowly along surfaces in response to fluid drag and diffusion due to the shallow adhesion energy and the negligible friction or arresting torques johnson et al 2007 2009 torkzaban et al 2008 the observed genuine arrest under unfavorable conditions however can be successfully explained by the operation of nanoscale surface heterogeneity ron et al 2019 increasing salinity generally yields a higher retention concentration of colloids yet it has been observed that when restoring the fluid salinity to the same low salinity environment from high salinity the retention concentration cannot be recovered exhibiting a distinguished discrepancy between the salinity loading and unloading processes ryan and gschwend 1994 lenhart and sariers 2003 torkzaban et al 2010 usually the retention concentration corresponding to the loading process is lower than that of the unloading process under the same environment i e the unloading curve rests above the loading curve torkzaban et al 2010 this phenomenon is called hysteresis of retention concentration hrc detailed in section 6 4 2 ph zeta potential and surface charge are strongly linked to fluid ph fig 3 shows the measured zeta potential of quartz grains in nacl solution at different ph values exhibiting a shift from positive at lower ph to negative at higher ph a similar variation tendency was also obtained for the zeta potential of berea sandstone grains in a 0 10 m cacl2 solution at different ph sharma et al 1987 even at this relatively strong ionic strength of divalent calcium ions the zeta potential remains negative for ph above 3 we notice that the variation of zeta potential with ph is non monotonous in the nacl solutions with relatively lower salinity of 0 05 m and 0 01 m showing a slight increase at high ph this owes to the remarkable rise of oh concentration that is comparable to na which affects the debye length and thus the double layer force kia et al 1987a reported that the permeability of sandstone declines remarkably after injecting low salinity water lsw when ph was higher than 6 however the permeability was found unaltered when ph was less than 4 8 valdya and fogler 1992 observed that the berea sandstone saturated with 0 51 m nacl solution was not altered after injecting the nacl free fluid of ph ranging from 2 to 9 in contrast a significant permeability decrease was recorded when ph was over 11 these experimental results agree with their measured tendency of zeta potential variation i e the higher magnitude of zeta potential at high ph in the nacl solution yields a stronger repulsion force and results in particle detachment it is worth mentioning that the ph effect on different parts of material might vary due to the different charging principles for example the edge surface of kaolinite is known to interact with the potential determining h and oh therefore the edge surface potential is highly dependent on ph in comparison the face surface of kaolinite is usually assumed to exhibit a constant negative surface potential 4 3 temperature temperature effects on fines migration remain controversial flooding tests performed on sandstone cores showed that core permeabilities were significantly decreased to 35 90 of the initial permeability when temperature rises to 80 180 schembre et al 2005 musharova et al 2012 which could be ascribed to the fines detachment and the subsequent pore plugging however several experiments demonstrated that increasing temperature yields an enhanced retention concentration when injecting colloids into porous media kim et al 2009 yan et al 2015 sasidharan et al 2017 both the london van der waals force and born repulsion force are a function of the hamaker constant determined by dielectric constant and refractive index israelachvili 2015 temperature effects on these parameters are material related the dielectric constant of kaolinite linearly depends on temperature with a gradient of 0 005 leluk et al 2010 in comparison the dielectric constant of latex shows a slight increase when the temperature is within the range between 120 and 0 and exhibits a non monotonous trend first increase and then decrease with temperatures lower than 160 chaki and khastgir 1990 temperature influence on quartz s dielectric constant is negligible when temperature is below 170 stuart et al 1955 the dielectric constant of water is linearly dependent on temperature with a gradient of 0 29 fernandez et al 1997 mcgory et al 2020 measured the refractive index of latex within the temperature range of 20 234 with high accuracy yet the temperature effect on kaolinite s refractive index is not available according to the calculation by you et al 2019 the hamaker constant of a kaolinite water quartz system exhibits an approximate 20 increase when the temperature rises from 25 to 129 the debye length and zeta potential are two key parameters that are highly dependent on temperature the debye length characterizes the double layer thickness expressed by κ 1 ε 0 ε 3 k b t e 2 n i 0 z i 2 intuitively the debye length will increase with increased temperature according to its expression however the dielectric constant of water ε 3 is also sensitive to temperature showing a decreasing trend with increased temperature you et al 2019 therefore the competitive effect between t and ε 3 leads to an uncertainty of debye length variation zeta potential manifests the amount of surface charge the magnitude of zeta potential increases with rising temperature resulting in an enhanced repulsion on the other hand increasing temperature yields reduced viscosity giving rise to a weaker drag force al shemmeri et al 2012 you et al 2016 2019 in consequence the influence of temperature on torque controlled fines mobilization is a resultant of the dependences of dlvo interactions and hydrodynamic forces on temperature in addition the stokes einstein diffusion coefficient dt l2t 1 for translational particle diffusion in water is given by 20 d t k b t 6 π μ w r s eq 20 indicates that higher temperature yields stronger diffusion as the diffusion coefficient is proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to viscosity that decreases with increased temperature therefore increasing temperature leads to higher kinetic energy of particles thereby facilitating particles to overcome energy barriers for both attachment and detachment 4 4 flow rate during the water injection into hydrocarbon and geothermal reservoirs the in situ particles attached to rock surfaces can be detached under the flushing or shearing of injected fluids due to the unbalanced torques and thus may reduce the formation conductivity caused by pore blocking and permeability damaging especially in those reservoirs of poor cementation ochi and vernoux 1998 investigated the influence of flow rates on fines migration and observed a critical fluid velocity beyond which permeability decreases arising from fine particles detachment this phenomenon is concluded as the velocity sensitivity of formation permeability civan 2007 bedrikovetsky et al 2011a successfully modeled the velocity dependent maximum retention concentration mrc see section 5 their model demonstrates that particles can be released from the surface immediately after increasing the fluid velocity to a critical value while decreasing the velocity yields a higher retention concentration till a maximum corresponding to the fluid conditions the velocity dependency of colloid detachment has been substantiated by numerous visualization tests performed on glass substrates sharma et al 1992 ryan and gschwend 1994 li et al 2017 a higher velocity results in a larger shearing force particle mobilization may occur when hydrodynamic torques exceed the adhesion torques torkzaban et al 2010 observed that single layer of attached colloids is partially released rather than completely despite the enforced flow rate leading to a hydrodynamic shearing over the critical value this ascribes to the spatial variation of hydrodynamic and adhesion forces caused by the heterogeneity of pore structure roughness and surface charge see section 4 5 4 5 nanoscale heterogeneity although dlvo provides a theoretical tool in adhesion prediction and shows an advantage in qualitatively explaining observed colloidal attachment and detachment in some cases many experimental results are contradictory to those predicted by the dlvo theory tufenkji et al 2004 elimelech et al 1990 manciu et al 2001a 2001b li et al 2020 when the double layer repulsion predominates the interactions between colloids and surfaces an energy barrier presents and hinders colloids moving toward the deeper primary minimum the so called unfavorable condition we expect that colloids cannot attach under an unfavorable condition if the present energy barrier is higher than 10 kt prieve and dennis 1999 however it is frequently reported that colloids can attach to a surface even under an unfavorable condition with a calculated barrier over 10 kt bradford and torkzaban 2008 canseco et al 2009 vanness et al 2019 we ascribe this deviation to the oversimplified assumptions of the dlvo theory i e perfectly smooth surface and homogeneous surface charges in fact a natural surface will exhibit a certain roughness at a nanoscale which may eliminate the energy barrier of dlvo interactions moreover surface charge also shows heterogeneity due to crystal defects isomorphism replacement and adsorption of ions organics or clays vaidyanathan et al 1991 song et al 1994 nanoscale physical and chemical heterogeneity has been successfully applied to the illustration of colloid adsorption at unfavorable conditions hoek et al 2006 simulated the influence of nanoscale surface roughness nsr on dlvo interaction employing the surface element integration technique and derjaguin s integration method they concluded that the energy barrier is decreased by surface roughness due to a longer effective separation distance between a particle and rough surface generally the electrical double layer and born potentials decay more significantly along the distance than lvw and thus the lvw potential exhibits a more pronounced influence on the total energy thereby weakening repulsion between colloids and surfaces decreased energy barrier yields greater retention at the primary minimum conversely colloid interactions with the surface at the primary minimum are believed to be weak and retained colloids were susceptible to removal because nsr is also expected to reduce the depth of the primary minimum and the energy barrier to detachment from the primary minimum torkzaban and bradford 2016 shen et al 2011 experimentally showed that the reduction effect of nsr on energy barrier is effective at ionic strengths higher than 0 01 m for large particles 1156 nm colloids in their study therefore it is significant to incorporate nanoscale surface roughness into interaction energy to address colloid retention and release in porous media however nsr itself has been proven to be unable to reproduce the observed dramatic increase of attachment and irreversibility with increased roughness under unfavorable conditions which necessitates inclusion of nanoscale charge heterogeneity that is inferred to have codeveloped with roughness rasmuson et al 2019 resultantly charge heterogeneity also plays a crucial role in influencing fines migration chen et al 2001 bradford et al 2012a 2012b the surface element integration sei technique based on local topography has been employed to account for the roughness effect on dlvo interactions bhattacharjee and elimelech 1997 bhattacharjee et al 1998 bendersky and davis 2011 shen et al 2012 in comparison the grid surface integration gsi discretizes the heterogeneously patterned surfaces into equally sized tiny grids capturing desired features of the surfaces by assigning various hamaker constants or zeta potentials positive or negative to those discretized cells duffadar and davis 2007 2008 duffadar et al 2009 then the total interaction energy is acquired by summing the contribution of each discretized surface element over the entire particle surface a gsi based langrangian trajectory approach ma et al 2011 pazmino et al 2014a b has been further developed to quantify the influence of nanoscale heterogeneity on colloid migration despite having provided invaluable information the intensive computation caused by sealed heterogeneity distribution and requirements of full knowledge of the flow field and repeated surface integration calculations restrain the trajectory simulations to pore scale study and it is especially inconvenient to feature transient surface heterogeneity due to changes in solution chemistry by contrast the continuum model approach necessitates averaged heterogeneous properties that occur at the pore scale over a representative elementary volume or area to obtain effective lumped parameters a computationally efficient statistical approach based on gsi assuming binormal distributed chemical heterogeneity has been developed to estimate colloid adhesive parameters at a scale of the representative elementary area which also enables one to account for temporal variations in charge heterogeneity bradford and torkzaban 2012a interactions between colloids and the zone of influence zoi depend on the ratio of total heterodomain defined as the nanoscale domain of opposite charges to the bulk surface area over the zoi area when colloids approach heterodomains the average and variance of interaction energies in a cell unit are obtained to represent the physical and chemical heterogeneities direct measurements of colloid heterodomains are not practical using current techniques for example the assay of surface heterogeneity using x ray photoelectron or other techniques has no straightforward translation to spatial variation in surface properties that are directly pertinent to colloid surface interactions pazmino et al 2014a whereas the force volume approach of atomic force microscopy afm is able to provide valuable information on colloid surface interaction forces over an area taboada serrano et al 2005 drelich and wang 2011 it is extremely laborious to conduct force volume imaging over a representative area of the collector at a resolution corresponding to colloid collector interactions however the representative heterogeneity parameters of porous media might be inversely determined from the trajectory simulation of colloids transport incorporating discrete surface heterogeneity by simulating the retention behavior of colloids of various sizes under different fluid velocities and ionic strengths pazmino et al 2014a showed that the uniformly placed power law size distributed ranging within 60 120 nm rather than randomly placed 5 nm radius heterodomains could quantitatively match the observed retention under unfavorable conditions over soda lime glass slides in comparison duffadar et al 2009 reported that 21 of surface coverage of randomly placed 5 nm radius heterodomains could successfully describe the deposition rates of three colloid sizes 0 46 1 and 2 μm at 90 mm on silica surfaces coating with cationic polymer poly dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate 5 maximum retention concentration the advective diffusive attachment detachment model with the sink term for particle retention and the source term for particle dislodging has been widely used to evaluate fines mobilization migration and straining in porous media assuming that the particle detachment rate is proportional to the retained concentration schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 foppen and schijven 2006 bradford et al 2003 2011 tufenkji 2007 molnar et al 2015 chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 the proportionality coefficient of detachment is an empirical constant usually determined by tuning the experimental data which does not characterize the microscale mechanical equilibrium moreover this model exhibits asymptotic stabilization of permeability after an abrupt change of the parameters while the laboratory tests show an instant response to the abrupt flow perturbation ochi and vernoux 1998 bedrikovetsky et al 2011a bedrikovetsky et al 2012b one of the crucial parameters for fines migration modeling is the mass volume concentration of released particles which is a key input to predict effluent concentration and permeability variation the experimentally observed critical conditions for fines remobilization implies the existence of a maximum retention concentration mrc mrc is a function of the dimensionless ratio between tangent and normal forces determined by torque balance particle mobilization occurs when the applied hydrodynamic torque acting on a particle overcomes the adhesion torque khilar and fogler 1998 yuan and shapiro 2011 bradford and torkzaban 2012a elimelech et al 2013 israelachvili 2015 once the balance is disrupted a certain number of attached particles are released and resting is the maximum retention concentration under a particular fluid condition i e retention concentrations higher than mrc are not permitted according to the torque balance requirement in comparison when the retention concentration is lower than mrc attached particles will be in a mechanical equilibrium state and arresting torques dominate over mobilizing torques which impedes particle detachment substituting the expressions for drag electrostatic lift and gravitational forces into the torque balance equation enables us to acquire mrc and released concentration under a particular condition bedrikovetsky et al 2011a the incorporation of phenomenological mrc into the particle release kinetics in the classical attachment detachment model allows one to quantify released particle concentration however the maximum retention function does not account for the nanoscale surface heterogeneity that may yield an incorrect determination of mrc under unfavorable conditions furthermore the multilayer model does not consider the influence of adjacent particles despite its over simplification it enables an excellent match to effluent concentration and permeability at the core and reservoir scale by tuning unknown parameters meanwhile the one dimensional problem of deep bed filtration with limited particle retention determined by mrc allows for an exact analytical solution under the assumption of constant filtration coefficient and porosity bedrikovetsky et al 2011a yang et al 2020 two approaches have been developed to quantify mrc incorporating the multilayer monosize and the monolayer multisize models based on different assumptions the former represents the case of multi layer attachment of single radius particles in rock with mono sized cylindrical capillaries bedrikovetsky et al 2011a the latter corresponds to a monolayer of poly dispersed particles expressed via size distribution for fine particles you et al 2015 we will explain these two methods in detail below 5 1 multilayer monosize model this section presents the maximum retention function of multi layer mono sized particles in cylindrical pores fig 4 exhibits particle rotation around the tangent point with its neighboring particle the distance between the particle and the cake increases from a minimum value up to some point where interactions are negligible which corresponds to particle dislodging therefore the electrostatic forces at various distances along the dlvo force profile are ergodic particle detachment indicates that the adhesion torque resultant from the maximum attraction force has to be exceeded by the adverse hydrodynamic torque as a result the maximum attraction force is naturally selected as the adhesion force fe in the mechanical equilibrium condition the lever arms for drag and normal forces have the same order of magnitude and their ratio is equal to 3 for a two dimensional case of particles with the same radius the final expression eq 21 of mrc is a function of the erosion number ε defined by the ratio of the drag force at an absence of particle retention over the sum of normal forces bedrikovetsky et al 2011a 21 σ σ c r ε ε μ r s 2 u f n φ k 0 2 the subscript cr denotes the maximum or critical value fig 5 presents a schematic of the velocity dependency of mrc obtained from eq 21 the higher is the velocity u the higher is the numerator in the expression 18 for the erosion number ε the higher is the lifting force and the lower is the denominator consequently the erosion number is a monotonically increasing function of u and a higher velocity yields a lower mrc continuous particle retention until the torque equilibrium can be illustrated geometrically in the u σ plane as shown in fig 5 point a below the mrc curve denotes an under saturated state at a certain reservoir location i e the attaching torque exceeds the detaching torque if some suspended particles move along with constant velocity particle retention will occur at this location under a constant injection rate the gradual particle attachment leads to an increase in the interstitial flow velocity and resultantly increased drag and lifting forces the process of particle retention corresponds to the upward movement along the vertical line from point a to b and stops until the saturated state torque equilibrium is reached i e point b the shift from a to c corresponds to the gradual velocity increase without particle attachment indicating increased hydrodynamic forces the torque equilibrium of particles is satisfied at point c where the corresponding velocity refers to the critical velocity or minimum velocity for fine mobilization miranda and underdown 1993 khilar and fogler 1998 further increase of flow velocity results in a certain number of particles being detached corresponding to the movement along the mrc curve from point c to d 5 2 monolayer multisize model natural reservoir fines are size distributed in a wide range khilar and fogler 1998 civan 2007 2015 and all the components involved in the mechanical equilibrium of an attached particle are size dependent particles are dislodged by drag force with increasing velocity and decreasing ionic strength in the order of particle size reduction the larger particles are easier to be released first and the smaller particles remain indicating the existence of critical particle size therefore unlike the multilayer monosize model we propose a monolayer multisize model based on the critical particle size rscr to quantify mrc you et al 2015 2016 2019 22 σ c r u γ σ a 0 0 r s c r u γ σ a r s d r s σ a l 1 represents the size distribution of attached fines σ a 0 is the initial retention concentration typical forms of the salinity and velocity dependency of mrc under various temperatures calculated using the multilayer monosize model are depicted in fig 6 we assume that the attached particle sizes hold a log normal distribution point i corresponds to the initial attached particle concentration ionic strength decrease from γ1 to γ2 velocity increase from zero to u b does not lift fines the attached particles start to be released at point b further ionic strength decrease down to γ3 velocity increase up to u c causes the release of fines by the amount σ we noticed that mrc obtained by the multilayer monosize model exhibits a quadratic polynomial and the corresponding mrc curves are convex in comparison the form of mrc curves for the case of mono layer fines is not convex the maximum retention function versus temperature is determined by the temperature dependencies of the electrostatic constants in eqs 16 18 and of water viscosity that affects the hydrodynamic forces therefore the temperature dependency of mrc is primarily determined by the materials involved in the system for a quartz water kaolinite system we conclude that higher temperature 45 leads to lower mrc and a greater number of released particles due to the dominance of temperature influence on the adhesive torque you et al 2019 nevertheless this monolayer multisize model ignored the brownian force which might be significant when addressing brownian particles ma et al 2013 under unfavorable conditions the diffusion controlled brownian particles transporting in a near surface region must possess sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the energy barrier to approach the primary minimum likewise particles attached at the primary minimum must hold sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the energy barrier to be detached ryan and elimelech 1996 it should also be noted that the breakthrough of larger particles in column transport experiments precedes that of smaller ones indicating the size dependency of particle dispersity chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 5 3 transition from salinity to velocity dependency of mrc the radial flow rate per unit of the reservoir depth around a production well is expressed by q 2πru one observes two or more orders of magnitude decrease of fluid velocity in the direction from the wellbore towards the drainage contour during production the magnitude of this decrease is proportional to the distance from the well moreover variation of fluid viscosity with the temperature significantly affects detaching hydrodynamic forces that are also functions of fluid velocity therefore such rheological dependence of σcr should be studied over a wide range of fluid velocities a thorough understanding of this relationship enables reliable estimation of well productivity index however the capacity of commercially available pumps restricts core floods with a broad range of fluid velocity variation comparatively running core floods with a wide range ionic strength is more practical than core floods at high velocity fortunately torque balance allows us to translate the salinity dependence of mrc σcr σcr γ to its velocity dependence σcr u and vice versa you et al 2015 2016 2019 now we describe such translation for a monolayer of multi sized particles attached to pore walls core floods with various fluid ionic strengths γ at a fixed velocity u0 allows obtaining the corresponding mrc σcr u0 γ recalling that one can determine the critical particle radius rscr u0 γ from torque balance equation it is possible to calculate the critical velocity that offers an equivalent rscr u γ0 at a fixed ionic strength γ0 by equating rscr u γ0 rscr u0 γ therefore the relationship σcr u0 γ obtained experimentally can be re calculated into σcr u γ0 via rscr u γ0 fig 6 shows an example of translation of mrc between the salinity dependency and velocity dependency based on the transition procedure described above fig 6a shows σcr u0 γ at constant fluid velocity and the translated curves in fig 6b represent σcr u γ0 at constant fluid ionic strength 6 delayed particle release experimental observations indicate that replacing the reservoir fluids with an electrolyte of lower ionic strength yields significant alteration of the rock wettability towards more hydrophilic mahani et al 2015a 2015b yang et al 2016 rayhani et al 2020 the reduced contact angle causes an easier detachment of oil droplets from the solid surface however a noticeable delay between salinity alternation and the corresponding contact angle change has been reported mahani et al 2015a 2015b this phenomenon owes to ionic diffusion in the thin film between the deformed oil droplet and rock surface fig 7 the so called nernst planck diffusion in a narrow contact area between two plates under the molecular force action is significantly slower than the brownian diffusion resulting in a significant delay in establishing equilibrium of the salt concentration between the bulk fluid and the contact area a similar effect may also be expected for lsw induced particle detachment unlike mathematical models developed for fines migration arising from increased flow rate that assume an instant detachment of those extra particles beyond the critical retention concentration the delayed release must be considered in the models of lsw induced fines migration the delay in particle detachment can be described by a non equilibrium relationship between the retention concentration and salinity i e the critical retention concentration is reached after certain retardation time τ i e 23 σ a x t τ σ c r γ x t assuming the retardation time is constant the detachment kinetics is obtained by reserving the linear terms from the taylor series expansion of eq 23 24 τ σ a x t t σ c r γ x t σ a x t eq 24 is valid for small retardation time t τ this equation resembles relaxation kinetics commonly used in modelling chemical reactions bedrikovetsky 1993 during low salinity water injection clay particles can only be gradually released after the arrival of the injected lsw the released particles give rise to a shock at the moving water front rankine hugoniot rh jump condition has been successfully applied to address this discontinuity in the particle concentration the rh condition based on the conservation laws of mass provides a simple and straightforward method to obtain the values of shock parameters russell et al 2018 yang et al 2020 7 attachment detachment hysteresis in addition to the delayed release caused by nernst planck diffusion another phenomenon related to ionic strength that deserves to be explored is the attachment detachment hysteresis or irreversibility the retention concentration profile for stepwise decreased salinity unloading does not coincide with that for stepwise increased salinity loading typically the affinity of colloids to solid substrates appears to be greater along the salinity unloading path than that along the salinity loading path fig 8 however the dlvo theory reflecting mean interaction energies predicts the same adhesive electrostatic force at an identical salinity and therefore provides the same retention profile and fails in elucidating the mechanisms of hysteresis a similar phenomenon has also been reported for retention curves caused by flow perturbation i e decreasing and increasing fluid velocity a smaller retention concentration was observed for stepwise decreased velocity attachment compared to increased velocity detachment the velocity related retention hysteresis was attributed to the deformation hysteresis i e greater deformation can be achieved upon the process of attachment yielding higher arresting torques when increasing flow rates vanness et al 2019 although the time dependence of deformation may play a role in hysteresis transient retention hysteresis by flow perturbation has not been verified despite its unaccountability several other hypotheses explaining salinity induced retention hysteresis have been proposed including the adhesion hysteresis arising from surface heterogeneity that has not been accounted for in the conventional dlvo theory and the presence of low velocity regions where the torques acting on a colloid are favorable for attachment bradford and kim 2012b the latter indicates that the number of retained colloids depends on the mass transfer of particles to grain grain contact or stagnation points where the competition of torques is favorable for retention torkzaban et al 2007 bradford et al 2011 subsequent alterations of fluid salinity cannot release particles due to the small scale vortices torkzaban et al 2008 however simulations using navier stokes equations reveal that the contribution of these low velocity regions on colloid retention is insignificant bradford and kim 2012b in comparison the former hysteresis implies that more particles interact with existing nano or microscale heterogeneities leading to contact at the primary minima where the retained particles are difficult to be removed bradford and kim 2012b calculations using the gsi technique demonstrate that the retention hysteresis is closely related to the size of zoi defined as proportional to the square root of the product of the colloid radius and the debye length spatial charge heterogeneity produces significant deviations from the mean interaction energy when the zoi is small yielding local minima favorable for retention duffadar and davis 2007 bradford and kim 2012b experimentally substantiated the effect of surface heterogeneity on retention hysteresis by conducting core flooding tests in salt and salt acid treated sand packs fig 8b they concluded that smaller colloids were more irreversibly retained thus more distinct hysteresis than larger colloids due to lower hydrodynamic torque applied and greater depths in the local minima of the interaction energy near heterogeneities meanwhile the surface heterogeneity of colloids may also play a role in the retention hysteresis tan et al 2005 measured charge heterogeneity on polystyrene latex particles and attributed it to the separation of ion rich and ion poor components of the polymer on the particle surface the parti suite software https wpjohnsongroup utah edu trajectorycodes html developed by johnson s group the university of utah incorporated a full force and torque balance into pore scale mechanistic lagrangian trajectory simulations enabling one to predict colloid attachment and detachment under favorable and unfavorable conditions johnson et al 2018 vanness et al 2019 it is reasonable to expect that secondary minimum associated colloids and primary minimum attached colloids via surface heterogeneity contribute to the retention and hysteresis observed in fig 8b here we propose that hysteresis for the secondary minimum associated colloids may arise from shifting their equilibrium separation distances from hundreds of nanometers at low ionic strength to several nanometers primary minimum at high ionic strength fig 9 upon ionic strength reduction the barrier to detachment retains the colloid within the primary minimum where fluid drag is low and surface attraction is high such that the colloids remain attached despite low ionic strength fig 9 hahn et al 2004 however this hypothesis assumes the absence of heterogeneity it deserves noting that the presence of surface heterogeneity locally reduces or eliminates the repulsive barrier so that secondary minimum associated colloids can enter the primary minimum and attach in the case involving heterogeneity hysteresis can arise from the varied overlap of zois with heterodomains which produces varied attraction pazmino et al 2014a b ron et al 2019 rasmuson et al 2019 varied overlap of zois with heterodomains arises from the impacts of diffusion on precisely how each colloid encounters heterodomains combined with the fact that the zoi radius decreases with increased salinity pazmino et al 2014a b ron et al 2019 rasmuson et al 2019 the schematic shown in fig 9 illustrates a particular scenario i e increasing the salinity from low unfavorable to high favorable values when the salinity is increased from low unfavorable to medium unfavorable values particles must hold sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the energy barrier and approach the primary minimum therefore the adhesion force is sensitive to the kinetic energy of attached particles and their resultant equilibrium positions the maxwellian probability density function has been widely used to evaluate the distribution of kinetic energies of colloids hahn and o melia 2004 shen et al 2007 johnson and hilpert 2013 bradford et al 2017 providing a linkage between nanoscale colloid surface interactions and continuum scale retention and reentrainment rate coefficients the trajectory simulation conducted by ma et al 2011 demonstrated that the difference between the maxwell predicted and their simulated velocity distribution is relatively small a factor of two to three the probability of colloid interaction with the primary and secondary minima can therefore be estimated from the maxwellian cumulative density function shen et al 2007 25 ε a b 2 v π exp v d v where v represents the dlvo interaction energy a and b denote the lower and upper limits of integration respectively selecting appropriate values of the lower and upper limits a and b from the calculated interaction energy profiles corresponding to different salinities allows us to determine colloids equilibrium positions force and torque balances determine whether a colloid attaches to or escapes from a surface it is worth mentioning that the movement of colloids initially trapped at either the primary or the secondary minimum of a low salinity curve towards the minima of a high salinity curve would not alter the integration limits of either the low salinity curve or the high salinity curve this is ascribed to deeper minima and a broader range of interaction limits of a high salinity profile than a low salinity one when unloading salinity however the integration limits might have been changed due to the shift of equilibrium position of an attached particle from the secondary minimum to the primary minimum during salinity loading despite the same energy profile corresponding to the same salinity consequently a higher probability of colloid interaction with the primary minimum is anticipated under the same fluid conditions the higher attractive force at the primary minimum compared with the secondary minimum may give rise to hysteresis of attachment and detachment when salinity is first increased and then decreased however the validity of the maxwell approach for secondary minimum interactions is debated pazmino et al 2014a direct pore scale observations show that unless solution chemistry or flow is perturbed attached immobilized colloids of diameter 100 nm and larger do not undergo significant diffusive detachment johnson et al 2010 accordingly the adaptability of our hypothesis based on the maxwell distribution of velocity for colloids larger than 100 nm is skeptical and must be addressed it is worth noting that the lower and upper limits of integration a and b in the maxwell accumulative density function eq 25 are size dependent the larger the particle size the higher the values of a and b the lower the probability for colloids to overcome energy barriers therefore the prediction using the maxwell approach agrees with the conclusion of insignificant diffusion for larger particles if it can be used to characterize brownian particles it should also work for larger particles that are not diffusion controlled the key of our hypothesis is the shifting of equilibrium position during the process of salinity increase and decrease which occurs regardless of what type of velocity distribution is assumed for colloids different equilibrium positions yield different adhesion forces and thus different torques which determines the fate of colloids we select the maxwell approach as a way to identify the possible equilibrium positions of colloids as no better velocity distribution functions available to us although johnson et al 2010 observed insignificant diffusive detachment the variation of equilibrium position within a range of tens of nanometers has not been negated and remains to be explored attachment detachment hysteresis yields two types of particle attachment i e reversible and irreversible analytical solutions have been derived accounting for the two type particle transport in porous media reversible and irreversible attachment kinetics are formulated separately both assuming linear attachment rates katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2019 this two type attachment assumption has further been coupled with a particle tracking algorithm to track particle s movement in a laminar flow determined by the local cubic law within a rough fracture created by the random field generator ding et al 2021 8 discussion it has been recognized that the electrical double layer force is much more sensitive to salinity compared to the van der waals force and born repulsion force this is because zeta potential as one of the essential parameters in the expression of double layer force eq 18 can be enormously influenced by salinity you et al 2019 commonly the magnitude of zeta potential descends with increased salinity indicating a weaker repulsive double layer force in comparison the hamaker constant is negligibly changed with ionic strength elimelech et al 2013 and therefore the van der waals force and born repulsion force are less dependent on salinity in the light of the traditional dlvo theory one expects that increasing salinity can result in a higher adhesion force and retained particle concentration and on the contrary decreasing salinity yields a lower adhesion force and retained particle concentration fig 10 demonstrates the calculated examples of the dlvo force profile under different salinity at a distance greater than the primary minimum the calculated double layer force decreases as salinity increases agreeing with our knowledge nevertheless the double layer force curves intersect around the primary minimum exhibiting a non monotonic variation i e increases first and then decreases with increased salinity thus the magnitude of the total dlvo force at the primary minimum referred to as primary force in the following discussion is anticipated to decrease first and then increase with increased salinity opposite to the variation of double layer force at the same location although the primary force has been considered the adhesion force in the literature bowling 1988 vadillo rodrı guez et al 2004 zhao et al 2020 the unexpected non monotonic tendency of the primary force brings about a critical issue i e what is the proper way to predict adhesion force from dlvo interaction curves apparently it is non physical to use the primary force that provides a stronger adhesion at extremely low salinity theoretically the potential energy of a particle should be locally minimized that is fine particles attached to a surface are trapped at a local minimum of the energy profile an energy barrier might exist at low salinity separating the primary minimum and the secondary minimum at the energy distance profile fig 11 a while at high salinity the energy barrier is absent fig 11b the maximum force corresponding to the secondary energy minimum referred to as secondary force in the following discussion has been applied to quantifying the adhesion force for secondary minimum associated colloids at low salinity torkzaban et al 2007 2008 bai et al 2019 you et al 2019 which yields a monotonic trend of adhesion force with salinity that agrees with our common knowledge however the weak secondary force usually several orders of magnitude lower than the primary force predicts no immobile attachment under most unfavorable conditions in response to fluid shear and diffusion this contradicts numerous visualization tests which showed that attached particles could not be completely removed at a low salinity environment ryan and gschwend 1994 lenhart and sariers 2003 torkzaban et al 2010 this discrepancy occurs owing to the presence of charge heterogeneity and a range of overlap between zoi and heterodomains ron et al 2019 rasmuson et al 2019 it is worth noting that the dlvo theory assumes no physical or chemical heterogeneity and we must recognize that the colloid attachment observed in countless transport experiments cannot be explained without concerning the existence of nanoscale heterogeneity ron and johnson 2020 another laboratory observation contradicting dlvo prediction is that adhesion force might decrease with increased salinity at high electrolyte concentrations i e a weaker collision or coagulation occurs when the double layer is expected to collapse elimelech 1990 studied the collision efficiency of latex colloids with glass surfaces in a kcl solution and observed a critical k concentration 0 1 m beyond which the collision efficiency declines anomalously with increasing electrolyte concentration li et al 2020 reported that the higher is the salinity of the initially injected colloid suspension the easier is the detachment of those attached colloids i e the interaction between colloids and surfaces shows a weaker attraction in a high salinity environment alfridsson et al 2000 demonstrated that the aggregation rate of charged paraffin particles increases with nacl concentration while decreasing after reaching a peak value at about 0 5 m moreover silica particles exhibit excellent stability in a solution with any electrolyte concentration implying large repulsion even at high salinity when the double layer is highly compressed manciu and ruckenstein 2001b resultantly researchers have recognized that non dlvo forces might also be essential in explaining particle surface interactions occurring in a fluid hydration force is a typical short distance repulsion between hydrophilic surfaces exhibiting an exponential attenuation as the separation distance increases israelachvili and pashley 1983 parsegian and zemb 2011 when salinity is higher than the critical hydration concentration hydrated cations are adsorbed onto the negatively charged surface resulting in the repulsive hydration force proportional to salinity israelachvili 2015 the expression of the hydration force between a spherical particle and a flat surface is given as molina bolivar and ortega vinuesa 1999 26 f h 2 π r s e 0 e h λ h where e 0 is defined by 27 e 0 n a c h c λ h where n a is the avogadro constant mol 1 c is the concentration of the electrolyte solution mm ch is the hydration constant j λ h is the decay length m a typical value of 1 6 10 20 is generally adopted for the hydration constant c h molina bolivar and ortega vinuesa 1999 the decay length is given as 0 6 nm which has been proven to be independent of ionic strength van oss 1993 the corresponding hydration potential is obtained from the integration of eq 26 with respect to the separation distance h 28 v h 2 π r s e 0 λ h e h λ h an extended dlvo theory xdlvo has been developed accounting for the hydration force mahmood et al 2001 pazmino et al 2014b li et al 2020 the presence of the hydration force gives rise to a reduction in the adhesion at the primary minimum it thus leads to a lower collision efficiency easier detachment and abnormally high dispersity of a high salinity solution containing hydrophilic particles a comprehensive analysis to quantify the contribution of other non dlvo forces e g solvation and lewis acid base forces on the dlvo interaction profile and fines migration is urgently needed the solvation force originates from the density variation of liquid molecules with separation when two solid surfaces approach each other due to the dramatic constraining effect between the confining surfaces israelachvili 2015 lewis acid base interactions are of polar origin primarily based on electron acceptor electron donor interactions between polar moieties in polar media van oss et al 1988 the development of the atomic force microscopy afm and colloidal probe technique allows direct quantification of the adhesion force between the surfaces immersed in electrolyte solutions butt et al 2005 assemi et al 2006 filby et al 2012 however contradictory measurements are reported for different solid liquid systems either an increased freitas and sharma 2001 or a decreased assemi et al 2006 zhao et al 2020 adhesion force required to pull off an attached particle at elevated salinity has been reported furthermore available afm measurements regarding the impact of temperature on the adhesion force were all conducted in a gas phase despite its significance direct quantification of the temperature effect on adhesion force in an aqueous phase is not documented and requires further investigation it also deserves noting that when measuring the adhesion force using afm the external force imposed by the afm cantilever pushes particles through the energy barrier and enables them to reach the neighborhood of the primary minimum accordingly the afm measured force represents the adhesion force for a particle trapped around the primary minimum to be detached and is not representative of an unfavorable condition future work could lead to the determination of adhesion force at low salinity when an energy barrier exists and hinders colloids from approaching the primary minimum 9 conclusions fine particle migration is essential in many natural processes such as hydrocarbon recovery contaminant transport and wastewater treatment continuous efforts have been devoted to revealing the influencing factors and developing mathematical quantifications for particle attachment and detachment however many unexpected experimental and theoretical results that deviate from the prevalent dlvo theory remain to be addressed this paper presents a critical review on the current understanding of primary factors influencing fines migration as well as mathematical formulations for quantification from our point of view the necessitated development in near future could include 1 the newly proposed hypothesis of colloid attachment detachment hysteresis accounting for shifting equilibrium positions should be experimentally substantiated 2 the influence of non dlvo forces and surface heterogeneity on colloid mobilization requires a more comprehensive understanding 3 surface heterogeneity plays a significant role in determining the adhesion force between particles and substrate under an unfavorable condition 4 direct measurement of the temperature effect on adhesion force in an aqueous phase is not well studied and requires further investigation 5 although the underlying mechanisms governing the colloid surface interactions have been explored in recent years researchers are still struggling with a meaningful and accurate prediction of colloid attachment and detachment due to its complexity it would be helpful to build a platform that resembles existing

16186,a review of the current status of direct and indirect potable water reuse dpr ipr implementation has been conducted focusing on the regulatory and practical aspects and with reference to the most recent published literature the review encompasses a the principal contaminant types their required removal and the methods by which their concentration is monitored b regulatory approaches and stipulations in assessing ratifying treatment schemes and maintaining treated water quality and c existing full scale installations analytical methods discussed include established in line monitoring tools such as turbidity measurement to more recent polymerase chain reaction pcr based assay methods for microbial detection the key risk assessment tools of quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra and water safety plans wsps are considered in relation to their use in selecting ratifying treatment schemes and the components of the treatment schemes from 40 existing ipr dpr installations summarised five specific schemes are considered in more detail the review reveals 1 over half of the schemes identified employ reverse osmosis ro followed by uv disinfection with uv based advanced oxidation used in many modern schemes as the final step 2 whilst quantitative pcr appears to offer many advantages for microbial detection due to its sensitivity and specificity it nonetheless demands pre concentration of the sample and is subject to interference leading to possible false positives 3 qmra studies suggest that the risk imposed by dpr and in particular ipr is very small compared with de facto reuse the latter being subject to far less regulatory scrutiny 4 there appears to be no evidence of acute conditions and diarrhoeal disease specifically from the few epidemiological studies which have been conducted and 5 ipr implementation becomes challenging if unbounded environmental waters are used as a buffer since zero deterioration in environmental quality must then be demonstrated whilst there are a number of ongoing projects where ro is not used because of the challenge imposed by disposal of ro concentrate the prevalence of the sequential ro uv combination implies the importance of quantifying the impact of process upsets on these unit operations graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction indirect potable reuse ipr is the recovery of wastewater for potable use via an intervening environmental buffer as opposed to direct potable reuse dpr where there is no such buffer or only limited dilution or storage time provided by such buffers the environmental buffer which may be a lake river or a groundwater aquifer is considered to provide additional protection through dilution or removal by filtration for aquifers photolysis for surface waters or biological degradation usepa 2017 whilst this performance can be attained by additional unit process technologies for dpr such supplementation does not address the loss in response time in the event of a process upset such as membrane breaching or uv lamp failure such risks in implementing dpr must be addressed through advanced automation and real time process performance monitoring a key aspect of implementation is regulation and in this regard there are two identifiable elements allocation of an explicit and quantitative contaminant removal to an individual unit operation within the water reuse facility and quantification of risk associated with installation and operation of the water reuse facility the first of these provides minimum performance levels or credits attainable by individual process technologies for each key pollutant and pathogens specifically along with a minimum number of sequential treatment steps which then provide multiple barriers to individual contaminants agwr 2006 2008 olivieri et al 2016 usepa 2017 soller et al 2018 the second element comprises a holistic health based risk assessment and management for maximising the safety of drinking water delivery from source to tap davison et al 2006 who 2016 2017 both approaches demand input data pertaining to a the feed and required output water quality b process failure risk and the associated preventative remedial measures and c impacts of contamination it is of interest to appraise the current status of wastewater reclamation for potable water use from both a regulatory and practical perspective to elucidate the most productive forward path the review is focused predominantly on the most recent publications 2016 onwards pertaining to contaminants of interest their removal and their monitoring in the treated water regulatory approaches to assessing and ratifying candidate treatment schemes and maintaining treated water quality and existing full scale installations 2 water reuse key facets critically important parameters in reclaiming wastewater for potable supply comprise fig 1 a the legislated maximum contaminant concentration mcl of chemical pollutants in the treated water who 2004 2016 2017 as well as the process performance in terms of pathogen removal expressed as the log removal value lrv or credit werf 2016 swrcb 2018 cwb 2021 b the

degradation of treated water quality or some other onerous outcome such as pollution from residuals and d the impact of treated water quality degradation or possible pollutant release associated with the above events 2 1 contaminants and mcl the required pathogen removal expressed as the lrv is determined by i impact on life duration adjusted for disability hence the disability adjusted life years dalys or ii the infection rate limit irl a limit of 1 year reduction in projected life in 106 dalys is stipulated by the world health organization corresponding to a risk of 1 excess case per 100 000 people from lifetime exposure who 2004 2016 an irl of 1 per 10 000 people per year 10 4 pppy has been originally proposed staatsblad 2001 smeets et al 2009 both approaches are constrained in their applicability to some extent the daly does not account for asymptomatic infection and the irl does not account for the infection severity associated with the different pathogens there are broadly two types of contaminants of concern in drinking water derived substantially from a municipal wastewater source a pathogens and b dissolved organic and inorganic matter of the latter concern has been focused on the so called contaminants of emerging concern cecs a general term for organic and inorganic species present at low concentrations also called micropollutants but which may nonetheless impose a significant chronic health risk schwarzenbach et al 2006 however notwithstanding the concern of key contaminants such as pfas perfluoroalkyl polyfluoroalkyl substances dbps disinfection byproducts and occasional industrial pollutants the vast majority of cecs do not present any known human health risks at the levels found in wwtp effluent and even less so following purification trussell and trussell 2015 2 1 1 pathogens historically the key contaminants of concern in water reuse have been the pathogenic micro organisms or species indicating their presence i e indicators indicator organisms most commonly monitored comprise the thermotolerant faecal coliforms tc and e coli specifically the most prevalent tc in faecal matter and therefore considered to provide a reasonable indication of faecal contamination holcomb and stewart 2020 guideline mcl values and recommended measurement frequencies are in place for these pathogens for wastewater reuse for irrigation in many countries shoushtarian and negahban azar 2020 for potable water reuse duties the pathogens of interest are enteroviruses and the protozoa giardia and cryptosporidium including oocysts enteroviruses are relatively small 0 05 µm compared with e coli 1 2 µm or the protozoa 4 µm but are a largely associated with suspended solids ss particularly in high ss environments such as mixed liquors haun et al 2014 and b less tolerant to chemical disinfection than the protozoa bitton 2014 and cryptosporidium oocysts specifically in potable reuse mcl values and system performance are often focused on enterovirus and protozoa removals and residual levels this then takes account of removal on the basis of size exclusion such as for permselective membranes and physicochemical mechanisms ultraviolet and chemical disinfection mcl values derive from toxicological and eco toxicological evidence quantified as the daly the resulting computed permitted pollutant concentrations are subsequently below the limit at which they can be quantitatively measured as demonstrated in a number of studies of full scale membrane based systems ferrer et al 2015 purnell et al 2016 katz et al 2017 this then means that the practically measured lrv is governed by the ratio of the feed concentration to the limit of detection of the method used and does not necessarily relate to the unit process system performance or infection risk the few early epidemiological studies conducted on water reuse nellor et al 1985 sloss et al 1996 sinclair et al 2010 have indicated no impact from the supply of reused water to the local community though some of these studies have been viewed as being flawed nappier et al 2018 suffering from study design deficiencies and insufficient sensitivity to detect the relevant low level adverse health effects the risk of pathogen breakthrough for specific unit processes can be determined by quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra zhiteneva et al 2020 owens et al 2020 this approach then relies on extensive data sets for both the source water pathogen concentrations and the performance of the unit process and in particular the impact of the risk of process failure on downstream pathogen levels evaluation of the of the nature frequency and impact of process failures or hazard events has been conducted originally in australia agwr 2006 and subsequently in the us salveson 2018 although guidelines have been provided for its methodology who 2016 applying qmra in practice is challenged by a lack of consensus with reference to zhiteneva et al 2020 owens et al 2020 1 the most representative values to be used for pathogen concentrations and their range of removals by specific unit technologies 2 the validity of the use of point lrvs over probability distribution functions pdfs and subsequently the most apposite pdf for specific pathogens applications or scenarios 3 assumptions relating to pathogen surrogate and pathogen indicator ratios 4 the basis for selecting the appropriate dose response model and 5 the specific risk parameter s used to represent the health burden threshold i e average vs median vs specific percentiles with or without associated confidence interval the ambient level of contaminants in the influent required to determine the required lrv is often unknown and has to be assumed or inferred from other data which may be site specific or literature based point value estimates of concentrations have in the past often been assumed in qmra calculations but these have been shown to underestimate the actual risk schmidt et al 2020 probability distribution functions pdfs based on probabilistic stochastic methods using techniques such as monte carlo or latin hypercube sampling more accurately reflect the range of risk incurred but there is little consensus regarding the selection of the most appropriate pdf or statistical method it was further noted owens et al 2020 that the variability in the complexity of design was not necessarily commensurate with the requirement to assess the actual safety of the treated water as a drinking water supply notwithstanding the issues surrounding the assumptions and precise methodology applied to qmra two recent analysis of representative ipr and dpr treatment schemes amoueyan et al 2019 soller et al 2019 both concluded the risk values associated with such schemes to lie substantially below the irl and or daly threshold values in both studies the risk associated with appropriately designed ipr and dpr schemes was significantly less than that for de facto i e unintentioned reuse outcomes were found to be highly dependent on either a the residence time of the treated water prior to reuse the irl decreasing from 10 4 to 10 9 pppy on increasing the retention time from 90 to 100 days for ipr soller et al 2019 b employing high dose instead of low dose uv 800 vs 12 mj cm2 for dpr soller et al 2019 c wastewater temperature inactivation of viruses increasing significantly with temperature amoueyan et al 2019 d wastewater pathogen concentration treated water pathogen levels increasing with increasing feed concentrations amoueyan et al 2019 as may arise during outbreaks 2 1 2 cecs the environmental and health hazards imposed by cecs has long been recognised schwarzenbach et al 2006 and the accumulation of the more persistent of these and in particular the highly biorefractory perfluoroalkyl substances or pfas podder et al 2021 in crops irrigated with recovered wastewater increasingly reported mansilla et al 2021 ben mordechay 2021 unlike pathogens most cecs are not associated with faecal contamination the mcl levels ascribed to non reclaimed potable water sources can thus be considered equally germane to water recovered from municipal wastewater for ipr or dpr the most recent proposed drinking water legislation eu 2020 encompasses some these compounds specifically bisphenol a with beta oestradiol and nonylphenol likely to follow evidence suggests that there is limited removal at full scale potable water treatment works for many endocrine disrupting cecs valbonesi et al 2021 including pfas boone et al 2019 however a recent report of the possible chronic impacts of cecs assessed through in vitro bioassay indicated the measurable bioactivity specifically the glucocorticoid hydrocarbon and oestrogen receptor activity in secondary effluent sampled across six us full scale reuse installations 5 ipr 1 dpr all employing ro to disappear in the final potable reuse water schimmoller et al 2020 moreover actual total measured cec levels in the treated reuse water were comparable to those measured in conventionally sourced drinking water most studies have shown ro based ipr and dpr systems to provide robust removal of both long and short chain pfas compounds whilst non ro systems such as ozone bac gac robustly remove long chain pfas down to below the limits pertaining to health standards 2 2 monitoring the challenges to a consistent and representative qmra underline the importance of real time monitoring which encompasses other key contaminants such as the cecs the classical method for determining pathogen concentration is the laboratory based method which is low in cost but labour intensive and demands an extended time period 16 h the more recent molecular methods target the microorganism gene rather than the whole cell molecular methods can be more sensitive than culture based ones which include flow cytometry and other cell level detection methods however no method can be considered sufficiently sensitive to directly and reliably detect pathogens at the limiting concentrations required on a continuous basis sample enrichment is thus always required this being the case surrogate parameters have been identified for monitoring system performance on line 2 2 1 physical and cell monitoring methods a widely implemented monitoring method and the one around which existing legislation for process performance monitoring is based is turbidimetric or nephelometric measurement turbidity measurement is well developed well understood and robust it has been shown to give a reasonable reflection of membrane integrity and the associated risk of pathogen breakthrough in some full scale systems katz et al 2017 prado et al 2019 though its sensitivity and reliability across different waters appears to be limited krahnstöver et al 2019 particularly when air bubbles are present xin et al 2019 laser extinction xin et al 2019 has been reported as being able to detect and characterise both suspended microbubbles and particles possibly offering some promise for on line particle or microbe detection in permeate from air scoured membrane processes such as mbrs however it is unclear as to whether this technique is sufficiently sensitive and robust for full scale application particle counting technology and nanoparticle counting in particular krahnstöver et al 2019 has also been shown to infer microorganism cells downstream of membrane permeation fujioka et al 2019 lousada ferreira et al 2016 flow cytometry which employs a laser beam to characterise suspended particles according to their light scattering and fluorescence characteristics is most often used for cell counting safford and biscel 2019 the captured scatter and fluorescence data infer cell characteristics such as relative size complexity and nucleic acid content and thus provide a unique cytometric fingerprint of the microbial community present in a water sample commercial instruments are available and real time monitoring is possible li et al 2020 although high in capital cost analysis can be relatively low in operating cost if multiple samples are analysed safford and biscel 2019 it is nonetheless limited in sensitivity by interference from other non cell fluorescing particulate or chemical species as is the case with other fluorescence based methods korshin et al 2018 sherchan et al 2018 sohrabi et al 2021 2 2 2 biological biochemical and molecular monitoring methods identification and quantification of coliforms is most often through the laboratory based defined substrate technology dst method where a proprietary reagent system is used to enumerate specific target microbes from a mixture of bacteria however the drive towards greater speed sensitivity and automation has led to the development of molecular methods which target highly specific genomic segments of the pathogen genetic material li et al 2020 of these quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr assay has been the most widely tested and implemented particularly for viruses haramoto et al 2018 farkas et al 2020 it is sensitive specific quantitative in assaying for target microorganisms and commercially available as a portable device however it is also relatively costly complicated and time consuming in relying on repeated thermal cycles over an extended time period 5 h sohrabi et al 2021 to complete the assay qpcr is also often subject to interference and inhibited by organic substances such as polyphenolic compounds found in environmental samples farkas et al 2020 a recent development is loop mediated isothermal amplification lamp which amplifies the gene from the extracted nucleic acid material through a biochemical reaction it is an isothermal analysis and therefore less costly and more rapid than pcr and is also usually more sensitive it s combination with microfluidics allows it to be configured as a portable device for accessible for field application in environmental water samples li et al 2020 however it is not currently quantitative and as with pcr has not yet been configured for continuous monitoring and cannot provide the required sensitivity required without preconcentration of the sample specifically for the protozoa giardia and cryptosporidia a wide variety of portable biosensors have been developed to at least the proof of concept stage for a range of different target pathogens sohrabi et al 2021 biosensors can be either cell or molecular based in general for the most commonly studied pathogen of e coli the reported limit of detection is generally around 10 per 100 ml 2 2 3 chemical monitoring there has been extensive study of the use of uv254 and fluorescence spectroscopy for monitoring the removal of organic matter generally and organic cecs often referred to as trace organic chemicals or trocs specifically korshin et al 2018 sohrabi et al 20 201 song et al 2021 valbonesi et al 2021 as with flow cell cytometry fluorescence detection is subject to interference from naturally occurring dissolved organic matters other examples of intrinsic water quality parameters used for monitoring ro integrity include conductivity total organic carbon toc and specific polyvalent species such as sulphate and calcium however these methods are generally insufficiently sensitive pype et al 2016 with an lrv threshold of 3 hornstra et al 2019 to detect minor breaches in membrane that nonetheless permit a minimal number of viruses to pass 2 2 4 monitoring summary whilst there has been significant progress towards increasing the sensitivity and utility of water quality monitoring methods for application to water reuse further progress is needed turbidity the most widely monitored parameter in practice and particle counting are both challenged by limited sensitivity lack of specificity and false positives generated from suspended air xin et al 2019 flow cytometry appears to be the most advanced of the microbial cell specific water quality monitoring tools but as with all detection methods based wholly on physical spectroscopic parameters it is ultimately unable to differentiate between microbial cells and abiotic particles displaying the same spectroscopic properties although fluorescence appears to be the property permitting the greatest degree of resolution korshin et al 2018 against this established bulk parameters such as turbidity as well as colour and uv254 lidén et al 2016 foschi et al 2021 have been demonstrated as being capable of providing real time monitoring of membrane integrity as an adjunct to off line pressure decay test katz et al 2017 prado et al 2019 molecular methods including pcr and lamp would seem to offer the most promise as a sensitive and highly specific tool for pathogen detection qpcr based methods have become the standard for off line detection of viral genomes in concentrated water samples haramoto et al 2018 farkas et al 2020 gunnarsdottir et al 2020 currently pre concentration of samples is required to permit detection of many pathogens with sample volumes as large as 1000 l being concentrated by up to 1500 times by filtration and then a further 100 150 times by specific adsorption gunnarsdottir et al 2020 and the subsequent qpcr analysis then takes several hours to perform lamp is more rapid than qpcr but currently not quantitative and is still subject to a preconcentration step to capture the pathogens present at very low concentrations 2 3 process performance two key unit processes employed in most potable water reuse schemes are membrane separation and uv irradiation uv advanced oxidation processes aop achieve disinfection direct photolysis and advanced oxidation whereas uv alone provides disinfection only aops have been shown to degrade biorefractory trace organic chemicals including some of the cecs kwon et al 2020 huang et al 2020 tan et al 2020 gao et al 2020 yeom et al 2021 in the case of disinfection efficacy specifically a uf can remove viruses in the 99 99 range jacquet et al 2021 but there is no current monitoring method to allow credits to be granted b ro removes both protozoa and viruses with various surrogates demonstrating up to 99 9 removal credit pype et al 2016 hornstra et al 2019 and c uv is a robust virus disinfectant though adenovirus requires a higher dose per log reduction fig 2 ipr and dpr systems employ uv dose values that far exceed that needed for 6 log reduction of all virus species including adenovirus d reuse treatment schemes achieve virus reduction of lrv 8 18 depending on the treatment scheme and operational parameters olivieri et al 2016 but there are few reliable surrogates to demonstrate this reduction in real time 2 3 1 uv irradiation a roughly linear response relationship exist between lrv and uv fluence in mj cm2 for inactivation of most pathogens including viruses hijnen et al 2006 fig 2 the transmission of uv irradiation the uv transmittance uvt through water is nonetheless significantly impacted by colloidal and suspended solids carré et al 2018 since uv treatment is almost always employed downstream of membrane filtration in implemented ipr dpr schemes a possible loss of performance from a reduced uvt associated with solids or colloidal material is perhaps only practically germane to breaching of the membranes though membrane breaching by particulates is not observed in most installations such breaching would also be expected to lead to increased permeate pathogen concentrations which would then be accompanied by impaired salt toc and or turbidity removal discernible at lrv values below 3 hornstra et al 2019 of greater practical relevance to uv process robustness is the risk of lamp and ballast failure demanding duty standby configuration more recently there has been increased research focus on light emitting diode uv led uv technology for promoting energy efficiencies sholtes and linden 2019 tan et al 2020 gao et al 2020 in the case of led lamps failure has been associated with degradation of the optical power to significantly below the initial value due to corresponding degradation of the semiconductor device or the silicon encapsulation arques orobon et al 2020 despite the progress in led development they are yet to be implemented for large scale water disinfection the stipulated uv dose for achieving a target level of inactivation is generally based on the adenoviruses since these are known to be the most resistant to uv light fig 2 other factors contributing to viruses uv disinfection efficacy include the virus concentration and the degree of aggregation aggregates being more resistant to disinfection gerba et al 2018 though aggregation is minimal at the extremely low microbial concentrations germane to ipr and dpr treated water there has also been increased interest in the use of uv combined with chlorine and or chloramines uv cl as an alternative to more conventional advanced photolysis methods kwon et al 2020 gao et al 2020 tan et al 2020 yeom et al 2021 recent studies have demonstrated improved removal by uv cl compared with the conventional advanced photolysis uv h2o2 of recalcitrant cecs such as ndma and 1 4 dioxane kwon et al 2020 and phenacetin and acetaminophen tan et al 2020 however it is suggested that the photolytic degradation products of some cecs may themselves have associated toxicity yeom et al 2021 and cytotoxicity or oestrogenic activity specifically huang et al 2020 2 3 2 membrane technology virus rejection by membranes is often determined using surrogates since procedures required for the analysis of human viruses are time consuming and cumbersome of these the most well explored is the bacteriophage ms2 amarasiri et al 2017 which has a similar size whilst it has been shown purnell et al 2016 that phages and enteric viruses do not necessarily co exist with seasonal variations in their relative concentrations phages have been and continue to be used for assessing membrane and other treatment processes these have included ro pype et al 2016 hornstra et al 2019 direct membrane filtration jacquet et al 2021 and membrane bioreactors mbrs zhu et al 2021 as well as other barrier processes such as soil aquifer treatment morrison et al 2020 whilst membrane technology including ultrafiltration uf membrane bioreactors mbrs and reverse osmosis ro generally offer a robust barrier to the larger pathogens bacteria and protozoa viruses are not completely rejected studies or reviews of the capability of uf jacquet et al 2021 bray et al 2021 mbrs o brien and xagoraraki 2020 zhu et al 2021 and ro hornstra et al 2019 fujioka and boivin 2020 for rejecting viruses or their analogues have identified challenges relating to performance variability across different pathogen species membrane characteristics and process operation reported lrvs for virus rejection by uf membranes have generally been between 3 and 4 jacquet et al 2016 reported maximum lrvs of 3 or more for adenovirus and ms2 at high feed concentrations 108 cells ml decreasing dramatically 1 at influent concentrations below 104 cells l bray et al 2021 reported mean lrvs of 4 for total viruses the value being lowest directly after cleaning lrvs of 4 for ms2 rejection were also reported by lee et al 2019 who also observed a decrease in lrv to 1 5 for aged membranes studies of ro membrane rejection of ms2 phage in controlled challenge tests have indicated increased rejection lrvs of 6 7 as reviewed by hornstra et al 2019 compared to uf however demonstrating removal of naturally arising pathogenic viruses is challenged by their low feedwater concentration in the case of mbrs membrane pore size dependency is demonstrated for some viruses including enterovirus and human adenovirus but not others table 1 o brien and xagoraraki 2020 the range of reported lrv values is also significant both for single and across different species this may arise from challenges posed by sampling and analysis gerba et al 2018 but is also likely to reflect the impact of partitioning of the viruses between the solid and aqueous phases in the mixed liquor viruses favour the solid phase over the aqueous phase by up 200 times haun et al 2014 since the mixed liquor solids are almost quantitatively rejected virus removal by mbrs tends to be greater than that provided by direct membrane filtration in the absence of such ancillary solids as acknowledged in the most recently promulgated regulatory guidelines on mbr process credits cwb 2021 a most recent pragmatic analysis conducted on behalf of the water research foundation salveson et al 2021 identifies performance levels for specific types or tiers of mbr technologies tier 1 mbrs refers to those already implemented at full scale and with demonstrated performance data these mbrs provide lrvs of 1 0 for virus and 2 5 for protozoa applicable to any hollow fibre or flat sheet mbr with pore sizes up to 0 4 μm and mbr filtrate turbidity values maintained at or below 0 2 ntu 95 of the time and never exceeding 0 5 ntu almost all use schemes employ some sort of membrane separation technology and many also include uv disinfection the differing efficacies and susceptibilities of these two technologies reinforce the long held principle of a multi barrier approach in potable water reuse as stipulated by regulatory bodies 3 regulatory guidelines and standards 3 1 non potable reuse npr guidelines for wastewater npr were originally provided by who 2006 these are taken as the minimum water quality required based on the direct use of the recovered wastewater with insignificant human exposure a comprehensive review of standards and guidelines applied globally to recovered sewage shoushtarian and negahban azar 2020 has indicated that the bacteriological water quality required in all countries to be 1 6 orders of magnitude more stringent than those recommended by who table 2 the difference between the figures presented in the low and high columns of table 3 relate to the sampling schedule for sampling over an extended period normally one week the guidelines refer to either a a maximum median value or b a maximum value with an associated percentage compliance within the eu the current standards for recovered wastewater for irrigation use eu 2020 iso 2020 categorise water quality classes for different uses the most stringent standard is for class a and stipulates permitted maximum averaged concentrations for pathogens bod5 tss and turbidity of 10 100 ml 5 mg l 5 mg l and 3 ntu respectively table 3 3 2 indirect direct potable reuse ipr dpr ipr demands significantly higher standards both of treated water quality and quality monitoring than npr this introduces a compliance issue with essentially two elements to the sanctioning a candidate treatment scheme a assigning of a maximum attainable performance to a specific unit operation or process technology and b the assessment of risk an established example of the former is that applied in the us state of california werf 2016 swrcb 2018 and elsewhere agwr 2006 2008 the assessment of risk is the approach advocated by the who 2006 and is manifested in water safety plans wsps in which quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra is embedded zhiteneva et al 2020 3 2 1 credits the regulations widely recognised as being the most advanced and comprehensive globally are those in place in california in this region the required performance in terms of removal of key pathogens is stipulated for a the treatment goal table 4 and b individual unit operations table 5 whilst the california title 22 standards have provided the benchmark for required process performance and product water purity they are proscriptive in nature and do not necessarily account for the prevailing site based circumstances and most specifically the associated risks the incorporating of site specific details which may impact on risk forms a key component of water safety plans 3 2 2 water safety plans water safety plans wsps are essentially holistic risk assessments ras applied to water management and supply and are sanctioned by the who who 2006 they encompass the expected elements of an ra of hazard assessment frequency and impact completion of wsps is often an iterative process where required modification of the system is revealed through close consideration of the risks required control measures and managerial aspects table 6 the adaptation of wsps for application to potable reuse schemes has the potential to replace a plethora of existing approaches which use various aspects of hazard and risk assessment e g rodriguez et al 2007 the first documented attempt to assess a potable reuse scheme using a wsp approach was conducted by dominguez chicas and scrimshaw 2010 with risks illustrated using a heat map graphic subsequent advances have seen proposals for dedicated water reuse safety plans suggested by sanz and gawlik 2014 and further developed in goodwin et al 2015 which draw on the strengths of the standard wsp agenda but with enhanced focus on integrating different water cycles and mechanisms to better account for uncertainty risk interactions and risk prioritisation wsps have also influenced national frameworks for drinking water quality and thereby indirectly impacted the design and management of mostly indirect potable reuse schemes for example in australia an early adopter of wsps in 1999 recent instances of the federal drinking water guidance nhmrc 2016 have adopted the central principles of the wsp approach putting more emphasis on the responsibility of utilities to monitor and properly manage processes in addition to conforming with delivered water quality standards growth in the dpr sector is providing yet another level of challenge for regulators standards setting bodies and scheme operators as the distinctive nature of risks and uncertainties become more apparent concerns here centre around a perceived lack of appropriate analysis and contingency planning for catastrophic risks which have low probabilities of occurrence but high impact consequences enhanced safety cultures rooted in the principles which shape behaviours in other high reliability process industries e g aviation nuclear combined with a regulatory philosophy which emphasises learning and experience sharing are argued to offer a more suitable operating environment for risk reduction and mitigation binz et al 2020 an independent enquiry body that to investigate water quality and wider system failures would both build public confidence in reuse scheme operations and ensure that near misses are investigated and adequately responded to across the sector 4 installations a summary of the global installations dedicated to wastewater reuse for potable supply table 7 indicates them to be predominantly us based there are additionally multiple installations established in australia singapore and southern africa it is unclear as to whether any of the large number of water reuse plants in china provide an indirect supply of potable water zhu and dou 2018 however it is evident from a number of studies that the de facto reuse of municipal wastewater for potable water supply presents a substantially greater risk to health than planned reuse either directly or indirectly nappier et al 2018 amoueyan et al 2019 soller et al 2019 in the us where the water reuse regulations are set at state level an investment of more than 11b in potable reuse is planned in california by 2035 to promote reuse of effluent currently discharged to sea california has promulgated regulations for dpr swrcb 2019 subject to review by an expert panel surface water augmentation in california has been limited because there were no specific regulations to allow the practice however this option is the primary focus for new projects in the state now that the regulations are in place whilst groundwater replenishment has been the historical focus in california a number of surface water augmentation projects exist elsewhere in the u s e g nevada virginia georgia there are a number of largely common features across the ipr schemes the environmental buffer in ipr schemes is most often groundwater hence groundwater recharge gwr which generally allows extended times for attenuation of residual pollutant levels surface water augmentation swa is also employed but normally as a consequence of the gwr option being unavailable the use of ro followed by uv irradiation either for disinfection or occasionally as part of on aop is widespread ro requires protection from channel blockage by fine solids and colloids and this is most often achieved by mf uf or more recently mbr technology the few dpr schemes employ supplementary treatment steps and or incorporate engineered storage to provide attenuation there appear to be fewer than 5 large dpr schemes currently as at august 2021 delivering treated reused water to consumers the schemes at brownwood tx and cloudcroft nm have been approved but not constructed the wichita falls scheme was piloted then decommissioned after one year of successful operation and the el paso plant is close to completion of the design phase the 7 5 mld colorado river municipal water district scheme at big spring tx is apparently operational however since motivations for implementation of ipr dpr differ regionally it is instructive to examine a few of the installations in more detail particularly the more established ones which have remained operational since first implemented for the more numerous ipr plants the regions most concentrated in large installations are southern california singapore and australia however one of the oldest installations is the new goreangab water reclamation plant at windhoek namibia a dpr facility which has been in substantially continuous operation since its commissioning in 2002 4 1 goreangab water reclamation plant windhoek namibia dpr the installation at windhoek was motivated by a water crisis dating back to 1957 coupled with increased population growth and declining annual rainfall freshwater demand in the region increased by over 600 ml y between 1982 and 2012 lafforgue and lenouvel 2015 in the absence of significant replenishable groundwater or river sources in the region demand management and dpr represent the only viable options for conserving water direct wastewater reclamation for predominantly potable use has been in operation in windhoek since 1969 the original plant 3 3 mld plant designed to treat the treated effluent from the city s city s gammams wwtp was based on coagulation daf rgf gac and chlorination prior to blending with the regular water supply from the surface reservoir provided by the goreangab dam however since the whole city and its informal settlements lie within the catchment of the dam the reservoir water quality is often worse than the treated wastewater du pisani 2006 the capacity from this original plant was subsequently increased to 7 5 mld in 1997 and currently provides irrigation quality water the new 21 mld capacity goreangab water reclamation plant ngwrp was constructed at a cost of 12 5 m eur hence 0 60 m mld and was opened in 2002 it is fed with tertiary treated municipal and commercial wastewater and comprises nine treatment steps fig 3 in addition to online water quality monitoring automated sampling at every process step is conducted daily supplemented with concurrent manual sampling for microbiological samples and sampling of the final product water at multiple locations of the distribution network water quality guidelines used are an amalgamation of those of the who usepa eu and namibia south africa and as such are based on the widely accepted range of biological physical and chemical parameters table 8 health impacts from water reuse were the subject of a 10 year long epidemiological study examining the relationship between diarrhoeal disease and potable reuse between consumers and non users in windhoek based on the study outcomes it was concluded that potable reuse did not increase incidences of diarrhoeal disease from water borne pathogens since no adverse health effects were detected the study was terminated in 1983 isaacson and sayed 1988 a more recent evaluation of the credits provided by the ngwrp law et al 2015 revealed these to be 12 4 13 9 for viruses 15 2 15 7 for bacteria and 7 9 9 4 for protozoa exceeding those demanded by the australian standards agwr 2006 2008 4 2 langford water recycling scheme lwrs uk ipr the lwrs ipr scheme dates back to april 2000 when the uk environment agency ea granted licences to allow discharge of tertiary quaternary treated wastewater into the river chelmer at scotch marsh essex and subsequent abstraction downstream of this discharge fig 4 its implementation was preceded by 10 years of environmental data capture and collation at the behest of the ea this scheme represents the first large scale uk example of planned ipr although there are many examples of de facto ipr in the country the wwtw concerned chelmsford sewage treatment works cstw treats the sewage by conventional primary settlement and secondary biological treatment using classical trickling filters and activated sludge to meet a discharge consent of 10 mgn l ammonia 20 mg l bod and 40 mg l suspended solids yhe treated wastewater flows along a 15 km underground pipeline to be discharged into the tidal chelmer about a kilometre downstream of two potable water intakes langford wtw and the raw water pumping station to hanningfield reservoir under the scheme wastewater is taken from the pipeline into the purpose built recycling plant at langford for further treatment the treated recovered water is then discharged into the chelmer upstream of the two potable water intakes augmenting the river flow as well as providing an indirect potable water supply the 20 mld capacity plant comprises advanced ballasted clarification biological denitrification and nitrification chemical precipitation of phosphorus and uv disinfection it was installed at a cost of 13 m hence 0 65 m per mld and has operated since late 2002 on an as needed basis it is intended for use during drought periods when treated volumes may represent up to 70 of the drinking water intakes the risk assessment and mitigation demanded extensive baseline environmental monitoring data to demonstrate compliance with the regulatory objective of no deterioration in environmental quality assessment was mainly based around the impact on downstream ecology from potential discharge of nutrients endocrine disrupting chemicals specifically nonylphenol toxic metals and pathogens table 9 quantitative ecological impacts encompassed invertebrate taxa environmental quality index ranges fish sexual development and wildfowl diversity assessment for a further 8 10 years following implementation of the scheme demonstrated no significant difference in metrics either between i upstream and downstream samples or ii sampling prior to or following the scheme implementation following expiration of the initial 10 year license the ea granted an indefinite license to continue operation of the scheme in this instance the impact of the scheme on the safety of the drinking water supply was of secondary importance to the possible environmental impact on the receiving water bodies throughout the duration of the scheme s operation the water quality of the recovered water has been substantially higher based on every metric recorded than the receiving environmental water which is subsequently abstracted for potable water supply the langford scheme highlights three key issues 1 ownership of the water hanningfield reservoir is owned by the water company but its management is subject to stipulations made by the uk regulator 2 the quantification and subsequent proof of no deterioration in environmental quality it is not possible to absolutely prove zero deterioration and there is no consistency in the interpretation of this stipulation across the many uk environmental regulatory bodies and pressure groups 3 extent of responsibility the water company has had to fund certain activities to mitigate against perceived impacts of abstraction of the wastewater which would otherwise flow to the downstream marina such as the annual dredging of maldon dock which is subject to silting up even though the scheme only operates during dry seasons 4 3 singapore ipr almost 40 of singapore s water supply is currently made up of recovered municipal and industrial wastewater termed newater by water reclamation plants wrps the newater is primarily supplied to non domestic sectors for industrial and cooling purposes and not directly to households for consumption during dry months however a small proportion of newater is directed to reservoirs to supplement the drinking water reserves the blended reservoir water then undergoes further treatment at the water treatment works prior to going into supply a rigorous sampling and monitoring programme is in place for the newater sfa 2019b encompassing over 300 parameters to ensure that its quality exceeds benchmark international potable water quality standards usepa 2009 who 2017 water supply in singapore is subject to the completion and implementation of a water safety plan and a water sampling plan by the supplier the singapore public utilities board in accordance with the who drinking water guidelines sfa 2019ab section 2 of chapter 95 of the singapore environmental public health act seph 2019a requires the supplier to maintain records report any incidents leading to the diminution in potable water quality to the director general and outline and enforce the necessary remedial measures the wrps plants at bedok and kranji both based on uv disinfection of membrane filtered secondary wastewater were commissioned in 2003 following a two year demonstration programme at the bedok site encompassing practical demonstration of the scheme based on operation of a 9 8 mld capacity plant extensive sampling and monitoring of the treated water for physical chemical and microbiological parameters assessment of health toxicological impacts based on rodents and fish for carcinogenic and oestrogenic effects respectively the above was supplemented by independent expert panel review to scrutinise the performance and health data pub 2002 as well as a public outreach programme which included a purpose built visitor centre the estimated capex for the schemes was 0 58 m per mld singapore continues its drive towards water self sufficiency the planned wrp at tuas fig 5 to be based on mbr technology is designed to recover most of the water and resources from 650 to 150 mld of domestic and industrial wastewater respectively zheng 2021 and will be one of the largest mbr installations in the world the municipal effluent stream will as with the earlier schemes employ ro and uv as the downstream polishing technologies but with mbr technology used for combined advanced biological treatment and clarification the latent energy from the biosolids is to be recovered by anaerobic digestion enhanced using upstream thermal hydrolysis 4 4 orange county water district groundwater replenishment system ipr the 265 mld orange county water district ocwd groundwater replenishment

demonstration dpr plant at wichita falls fig 7 was operated continuously for 377 days from 9 july 2014 1 8 m discrete water quality data were collected over the course of the operational period nix et al 2021 during which time over 7500 ml of wastewater was reclaimed as drinking water without water quality failures or plant shutdowns no viruses were ever detected in the treated water and e coli giardia and cryptosporidia were undetected downstream of the mf the facility achieved 100 compliance with all primary and secondary drinking water regulations as well as with the pathogen log removals stipulated by the regulator table 11 management of the scheme was supplemented by a task force of all stakeholders including the regulator and the regional health district which met monthly to review operational data and receive updates from the health district s epidemiologist on any related health anomalies record rainfall in may 2015 returned the region s reservoirs to 100 percent within three weeks this contributed to the decision to transition to ipr 5 conclusions a review of the status of wastewater reuse for potable supply both direct and indirect focused primarily on the regulatory and practical aspects has revealed 1 more than half 22 out of 40 of the schemes for which information was captured table 7 are based on enhanced clarification most often uf or mf followed by ro and then uv for final disinfection with modern dpr schemes tending to employ uv based advanced oxidation as the final step 2 the rapid development of quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and loop mediated isothermal amplification lamp has led to their increased implementation for water quality monitoring due to their high specificity and sensitivity for pathogen detection 3 quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra studies suggest that the risk imposed by dpr and in particular ipr is very small compared with de facto reuse where the latter is not subject to the same level of scrutiny by the regulators 4 the few epidemiological studies which have been conducted have related to early more rudimentary ipr dpr schemes but these studies have nonetheless reported zero impact of municipal water reuse on the health of the consumer 5 ipr is complicated if zero deterioration in the environmental quality of the water buffer has to be demonstrated since this condition is not subject to consistent interpretation either internationally or nationally with respect to environmental impact on the buffer point 5 extremely conservative conditions have been imposed most graphically illustrated by the uk langford scheme which is not commensurate with the risk incurred and goes well above and beyond regulations pertaining to de facto water reuse if on the other hand the environmental buffer is both contained and owned by the water provider then these stipulations don t apply qmra point 3 provides a mechanism for quantification of infection risk from pathogens and can be extended to other pollutants for which quantitative data on influent concentration removal by unit wastewater treatment technologies and health impacts is available however it appears to be challenged by a lack of a appropriately detailed wastewater quality data and b consensus relating to the methodology and assumptions used which may limit the more widespread applicability of the findings from individual analyses notwithstanding such limitations and regardless of the noted inconsistencies and challenges analyses conducted have all tended to indicate that the microbial risk imposed by the product water from existing ipr and dpr schemes to be significantly below the thresholds set by the regulators the low risk is supported by the few epidemiological studies which have been conducted point 4 this being the case the most fruitful way forward would appear to be investing in ensuring process robustness whilst incurring a relatively high energy demand as well as generating a waste stream from the ro step which requires further management the inclusion of ro with downstream uv in the majority of the treatment schemes point 1 would seem to provide the appropriate level of efficacy when these processes are operating optimally maintaining this efficacy i e the required low health risk therefore relies on a reducing process failure risk and in relation to this b ensuring reliable on line monitoring there has been extensive demonstration of qpcr assay for many duties including reuse water quality assessment the method appears to offer a reliable precise and sensitive for pathogen identification and quantification point 2 but as with all microbial analytical methods for this duty demand substantial enrichment of the water sample due

16186,a review of the current status of direct and indirect potable water reuse dpr ipr implementation has been conducted focusing on the regulatory and practical aspects and with reference to the most recent published literature the review encompasses a the principal contaminant types their required removal and the methods by which their concentration is monitored b regulatory approaches and stipulations in assessing ratifying treatment schemes and maintaining treated water quality and c existing full scale installations analytical methods discussed include established in line monitoring tools such as turbidity measurement to more recent polymerase chain reaction pcr based assay methods for microbial detection the key risk assessment tools of quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra and water safety plans wsps are considered in relation to their use in selecting ratifying treatment schemes and the components of the treatment schemes from 40 existing ipr dpr installations summarised five specific schemes are considered in more detail the review reveals 1 over half of the schemes identified employ reverse osmosis ro followed by uv disinfection with uv based advanced oxidation used in many modern schemes as the final step 2 whilst quantitative pcr appears to offer many advantages for microbial detection due to its sensitivity and specificity it nonetheless demands pre concentration of the sample and is subject to interference leading to possible false positives 3 qmra studies suggest that the risk imposed by dpr and in particular ipr is very small compared with de facto reuse the latter being subject to far less regulatory scrutiny 4 there appears to be no evidence of acute conditions and diarrhoeal disease specifically from the few epidemiological studies which have been conducted and 5 ipr implementation becomes challenging if unbounded environmental waters are used as a buffer since zero deterioration in environmental quality must then be demonstrated whilst there are a number of ongoing projects where ro is not used because of the challenge imposed by disposal of ro concentrate the prevalence of the sequential ro uv combination implies the importance of quantifying the impact of process upsets on these unit operations graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction indirect potable reuse ipr is the recovery of wastewater for potable use via an intervening environmental buffer as opposed to direct potable reuse dpr where there is no such buffer or only limited dilution or storage time provided by such buffers the environmental buffer which may be a lake river or a groundwater aquifer is considered to provide additional protection through dilution or removal by filtration for aquifers photolysis for surface waters or biological degradation usepa 2017 whilst this performance can be attained by additional unit process technologies for dpr such supplementation does not address the loss in response time in the event of a process upset such as membrane breaching or uv lamp failure such risks in implementing dpr must be addressed through advanced automation and real time process performance monitoring a key aspect of implementation is regulation and in this regard there are two identifiable elements allocation of an explicit and quantitative contaminant removal to an individual unit operation within the water reuse facility and quantification of risk associated with installation and operation of the water reuse facility the first of these provides minimum performance levels or credits attainable by individual process technologies for each key pollutant and pathogens specifically along with a minimum number of sequential treatment steps which then provide multiple barriers to individual contaminants agwr 2006 2008 olivieri et al 2016 usepa 2017 soller et al 2018 the second element comprises a holistic health based risk assessment and management for maximising the safety of drinking water delivery from source to tap davison et al 2006 who 2016 2017 both approaches demand input data pertaining to a the feed and required output water quality b process failure risk and the associated preventative remedial measures and c impacts of contamination it is of interest to appraise the current status of wastewater reclamation for potable water use from both a regulatory and practical perspective to elucidate the most productive forward path the review is focused predominantly on the most recent publications 2016 onwards pertaining to contaminants of interest their removal and their monitoring in the treated water regulatory approaches to assessing and ratifying candidate treatment schemes and maintaining treated water quality and existing full scale installations 2 water reuse key facets critically important parameters in reclaiming wastewater for potable supply comprise fig 1 a the legislated maximum contaminant concentration mcl of chemical pollutants in the treated water who 2004 2016 2017 as well as the process performance in terms of pathogen removal expressed as the log removal value lrv or credit werf 2016 swrcb 2018 cwb 2021 b the minimum contaminant concentration measurable mrl the method reporting limit twdb 2015 who 2017 c the frequency of events process failure and mitigating factors including environmental leading to degradation of treated water quality or some other onerous outcome such as pollution from residuals and d the impact of treated water quality degradation or possible pollutant release associated with the above events 2 1 contaminants and mcl the required pathogen removal expressed as the lrv is determined by i impact on life duration adjusted for disability hence the disability adjusted life years dalys or ii the infection rate limit irl a limit of 1 year reduction in projected life in 106 dalys is stipulated by the world health organization corresponding to a risk of 1 excess case per 100 000 people from lifetime exposure who 2004 2016 an irl of 1 per 10 000 people per year 10 4 pppy has been originally proposed staatsblad 2001 smeets et al 2009 both approaches are constrained in their applicability to some extent the daly does not account for asymptomatic infection and the irl does not account for the infection severity associated with the different pathogens there are broadly two types of contaminants of concern in drinking water derived substantially from a municipal wastewater source a pathogens and b dissolved organic and inorganic matter of the latter concern has been focused on the so called contaminants of emerging concern cecs a general term for organic and inorganic species present at low concentrations also called micropollutants but which may nonetheless impose a significant chronic health risk schwarzenbach et al 2006 however notwithstanding the concern of key contaminants such as pfas perfluoroalkyl polyfluoroalkyl substances dbps disinfection byproducts and occasional industrial pollutants the vast majority of cecs do not present any known human health risks at the levels found in wwtp effluent and even less so following purification trussell and trussell 2015 2 1 1 pathogens historically the key contaminants of concern in water reuse have been the pathogenic micro organisms or species indicating their presence i e indicators indicator organisms most commonly monitored comprise the thermotolerant faecal coliforms tc and e coli specifically the most prevalent tc in faecal matter and therefore considered to provide a reasonable indication of faecal contamination holcomb and stewart 2020 guideline mcl values and recommended measurement frequencies are in place for these pathogens for wastewater reuse for irrigation in many countries shoushtarian and negahban azar 2020 for potable water reuse duties the pathogens of interest are enteroviruses and the protozoa giardia and cryptosporidium including oocysts enteroviruses are relatively small 0 05 µm compared with e coli 1 2 µm or the protozoa 4 µm but are a largely associated with suspended solids ss particularly in high ss environments such as mixed liquors haun et al 2014 and b less tolerant to chemical disinfection than the protozoa bitton 2014 and cryptosporidium oocysts specifically in potable reuse mcl values and system performance are often focused on enterovirus and protozoa removals and residual levels this then takes account of removal on the basis of size exclusion such as for permselective membranes and physicochemical mechanisms ultraviolet and chemical disinfection mcl values derive from toxicological and eco toxicological evidence quantified as the daly the resulting computed permitted pollutant concentrations are subsequently below the limit at which they can be quantitatively measured as demonstrated in a number of studies of full scale membrane based systems ferrer et al 2015 purnell et al 2016 katz et al 2017 this then means that the practically measured lrv is governed by the ratio of the feed concentration to the limit of detection of the method used and does not necessarily relate to the unit process system performance or infection risk the few early epidemiological studies conducted on water reuse nellor et al 1985 sloss et al 1996 sinclair et al 2010 have indicated no impact from the supply of reused water to the local community though some of these studies have been viewed as being flawed nappier et al 2018 suffering from study design deficiencies and insufficient sensitivity to detect the relevant low level adverse health effects the risk of pathogen breakthrough for specific unit processes can be determined by quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra zhiteneva et al 2020 owens et al 2020 this approach then relies on extensive data sets for both the source water pathogen concentrations and the performance of the unit process and in particular the impact of the risk of process failure on downstream pathogen levels evaluation of the of the nature frequency and impact of process failures or hazard events has been conducted originally in australia agwr 2006 and subsequently in the us salveson 2018 although guidelines have been provided for its methodology who 2016 applying qmra in practice is challenged by a lack of consensus with reference to zhiteneva et al 2020 owens et al 2020 1 the most representative values to be used for pathogen concentrations and their range of removals by specific unit technologies 2 the validity of the use of point lrvs over probability distribution functions pdfs and subsequently the most apposite pdf for specific pathogens applications or scenarios 3 assumptions relating to pathogen surrogate and pathogen indicator ratios 4 the basis for selecting the appropriate dose response model and 5 the specific risk parameter s used to represent the health burden threshold i e average vs median vs specific percentiles with or without associated confidence interval the ambient level of contaminants in the influent required to determine the required lrv is often unknown and has to be assumed or inferred from other data which may be site specific or literature based point value estimates of concentrations have in the past often been assumed in qmra calculations but these have been shown to underestimate the actual risk schmidt et al 2020 probability distribution functions pdfs based on probabilistic stochastic methods using techniques such as monte carlo or latin hypercube sampling more accurately reflect the range of risk incurred but there is little consensus regarding the selection of the most appropriate pdf or statistical method it was further noted owens et al 2020 that the variability in the complexity of design was not necessarily commensurate with the requirement to assess the actual safety of the treated water as a drinking water supply notwithstanding the issues surrounding the assumptions and precise methodology applied to qmra two recent analysis of representative ipr and dpr treatment schemes amoueyan et al 2019 soller et al 2019 both concluded the risk values associated with such schemes to lie substantially below the irl and or daly threshold values in both studies the risk associated with appropriately designed ipr and dpr schemes was significantly less than that for de facto i e unintentioned reuse outcomes were found to be highly dependent on either a the residence time of the treated water prior to reuse the irl decreasing from 10 4 to 10 9 pppy on increasing the retention time from 90 to 100 days for ipr soller et al 2019 b employing high dose instead of low dose uv 800 vs 12 mj cm2 for dpr soller et al 2019 c wastewater temperature inactivation of viruses increasing significantly with temperature amoueyan et al 2019 d wastewater pathogen concentration treated water pathogen levels increasing with increasing feed concentrations amoueyan et al 2019 as may arise during outbreaks 2 1 2 cecs the environmental and health hazards imposed by cecs has long been recognised schwarzenbach et al 2006 and the accumulation of the more persistent of these and in particular the highly biorefractory perfluoroalkyl substances or pfas podder et al 2021 in crops irrigated with recovered wastewater increasingly reported mansilla et al 2021 ben mordechay 2021 unlike pathogens most cecs are not associated with faecal contamination the mcl levels ascribed to non reclaimed potable water sources can thus be considered equally germane to water recovered from municipal wastewater for ipr or dpr the most recent proposed drinking water legislation eu 2020 encompasses some these compounds specifically bisphenol a with beta oestradiol and nonylphenol likely to follow evidence suggests that there is limited removal at full scale potable water treatment works for many endocrine disrupting cecs valbonesi et al 2021 including pfas boone et al 2019 however a recent report of the possible chronic impacts of cecs assessed through in vitro bioassay indicated the measurable bioactivity specifically the glucocorticoid hydrocarbon and oestrogen receptor activity in secondary effluent sampled across six us full scale reuse installations 5 ipr 1 dpr all employing ro to disappear in the final potable reuse water schimmoller et al 2020 moreover actual total measured cec levels in the treated reuse water were comparable to those measured in conventionally sourced drinking water most studies have shown ro based ipr and dpr systems to provide robust removal of both long and short chain pfas compounds whilst non ro systems such as ozone bac gac robustly remove long chain pfas down to below the limits pertaining to health standards 2 2 monitoring the challenges to a consistent and representative qmra underline the importance of real time monitoring which encompasses other key contaminants such as the cecs the classical method for determining pathogen concentration is the laboratory based method which is low in cost but labour intensive and demands an extended time period 16 h the more recent molecular methods target the microorganism gene rather than the whole cell molecular methods can be more sensitive than culture based ones which include flow cytometry and other cell level detection methods however no method can be considered sufficiently sensitive to directly and reliably detect pathogens at the limiting concentrations required on a continuous basis sample enrichment is thus always required this being the case surrogate parameters have been identified for monitoring system performance on line 2 2 1 physical and cell monitoring methods a widely implemented monitoring method and the one around which existing legislation for process performance monitoring is based is turbidimetric or nephelometric measurement turbidity measurement is well developed well understood and robust it has been shown to give a reasonable reflection of membrane integrity and the associated risk of pathogen breakthrough in some full scale systems katz et al 2017 prado et al 2019 though its sensitivity and reliability across different waters appears to be limited krahnstöver et al 2019 particularly when air bubbles are present xin et al 2019 laser extinction xin et al 2019 has been reported as being able to detect and characterise both suspended microbubbles and particles possibly offering some promise for on line particle or microbe detection in permeate from air scoured membrane processes such as mbrs however it is unclear as to whether this technique is sufficiently sensitive and robust for full scale application particle counting technology and nanoparticle counting in particular krahnstöver et al 2019 has also been shown to infer microorganism cells downstream of membrane permeation fujioka et al 2019 lousada ferreira et al 2016 flow cytometry which employs a laser beam to characterise suspended particles according to their light scattering and fluorescence characteristics is most often used for cell counting safford and biscel 2019 the captured scatter and fluorescence data infer cell characteristics such as relative size complexity and nucleic acid content and thus provide a unique cytometric fingerprint of the microbial community present in a water sample commercial instruments are available and real time monitoring is possible li et al 2020 although high in capital cost analysis can be relatively low in operating cost if multiple samples are analysed safford and biscel 2019 it is nonetheless limited in sensitivity by interference from other non cell fluorescing particulate or chemical species as is the case with other fluorescence based methods korshin et al 2018 sherchan et al 2018 sohrabi et al 2021 2 2 2 biological biochemical and molecular monitoring methods identification and quantification of coliforms is most often through the laboratory based defined substrate technology dst method where a proprietary reagent system is used to enumerate specific target microbes from a mixture of bacteria however the drive towards greater speed sensitivity and automation has led to the development of molecular methods which target highly specific genomic segments of the pathogen genetic material li et al 2020 of these quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr assay has been the most widely tested and implemented particularly for viruses haramoto et al 2018 farkas et al 2020 it is sensitive specific quantitative in assaying for target microorganisms and commercially available as a portable device however it is also relatively costly complicated and time consuming in relying on repeated thermal cycles over an extended time period 5 h sohrabi et al 2021 to complete the assay qpcr is also often subject to interference and inhibited by organic substances such as polyphenolic compounds found in environmental samples farkas et al 2020 a recent development is loop mediated isothermal amplification lamp which amplifies the gene from the extracted nucleic acid material through a biochemical reaction it is an isothermal analysis and therefore less costly and more rapid than pcr and is also usually more sensitive it s combination with microfluidics allows it to be configured as a portable device for accessible for field application in environmental water samples li et al 2020 however it is not currently quantitative and as with pcr has not yet been configured for continuous monitoring and cannot provide the required sensitivity required without preconcentration of the sample specifically for the protozoa giardia and cryptosporidia a wide variety of portable biosensors have been developed to at least the proof of concept stage for a range of different target pathogens sohrabi et al 2021 biosensors can be either cell or molecular based in general for the most commonly studied pathogen of e coli the reported limit of detection is generally around 10 per 100 ml 2 2 3 chemical monitoring there has been extensive study of the use of uv254 and fluorescence spectroscopy for monitoring the removal of organic matter generally and organic cecs often referred to as trace organic chemicals or trocs specifically korshin et al 2018 sohrabi et al 20 201 song et al 2021 valbonesi et al 2021 as with flow cell cytometry fluorescence detection is subject to interference from naturally occurring dissolved organic matters other examples of intrinsic water quality parameters used for monitoring ro integrity include conductivity total organic carbon toc and specific polyvalent species such as sulphate and calcium however these methods are generally insufficiently sensitive pype et al 2016 with an lrv threshold of 3 hornstra et al 2019 to detect minor breaches in membrane that nonetheless permit a minimal number of viruses to pass 2 2 4 monitoring summary whilst there has been significant progress towards increasing the sensitivity and utility of water quality monitoring methods for application to water reuse further progress is needed turbidity the most widely monitored parameter in practice and particle counting are both challenged by limited sensitivity lack of specificity and false positives generated from suspended air xin et al 2019 flow cytometry appears to be the most advanced of the microbial cell specific water quality monitoring tools but as with all detection methods based wholly on physical spectroscopic parameters it is ultimately unable to differentiate between microbial cells and abiotic particles displaying the same spectroscopic properties although fluorescence appears to be the property permitting the greatest degree of resolution korshin et al 2018 against this established bulk parameters such as turbidity as well as colour and uv254 lidén et al 2016 foschi et al 2021 have been demonstrated as being capable of providing real time monitoring of membrane integrity as an adjunct to off line pressure decay test katz et al 2017 prado et al 2019 molecular methods including pcr and lamp would seem to offer the most promise as a sensitive and highly specific tool for pathogen detection qpcr based methods have become the standard for off line detection of viral genomes in concentrated water samples haramoto et al 2018 farkas et al 2020 gunnarsdottir et al 2020 currently pre concentration of samples is required to permit detection of many pathogens with sample volumes as large as 1000 l being concentrated by up to 1500 times by filtration and then a further 100 150 times by specific adsorption gunnarsdottir et al 2020 and the subsequent qpcr analysis then takes several hours to perform lamp is more rapid than qpcr but currently not quantitative and is still subject to a preconcentration step to capture the pathogens present at very low concentrations 2 3 process performance two key unit processes employed in most potable water reuse schemes are membrane separation and uv irradiation uv advanced oxidation processes aop achieve disinfection direct photolysis and advanced oxidation whereas uv alone provides disinfection only aops have been shown to degrade biorefractory trace organic chemicals including some of the cecs kwon et al 2020 huang et al 2020 tan et al 2020 gao et al 2020 yeom et al 2021 in the case of disinfection efficacy specifically a uf can remove viruses in the 99 99 range jacquet et al 2021 but there is no current monitoring method to allow credits to be granted b ro removes both protozoa and viruses with various surrogates demonstrating up to 99 9 removal credit pype et al 2016 hornstra et al 2019 and c uv is a robust virus disinfectant though adenovirus requires a higher dose per log reduction fig 2 ipr and dpr systems employ uv dose values that far exceed that needed for 6 log reduction of all virus species including adenovirus d reuse treatment schemes achieve virus reduction of lrv 8 18 depending on the treatment scheme and operational parameters olivieri et al 2016 but there are few reliable surrogates to demonstrate this reduction in real time 2 3 1 uv irradiation a roughly linear response relationship exist between lrv and uv fluence in mj cm2 for inactivation of most pathogens including viruses hijnen et al 2006 fig 2 the transmission of uv irradiation the uv transmittance uvt through water is nonetheless significantly impacted by colloidal and suspended solids carré et al 2018 since uv treatment is almost always employed downstream of membrane filtration in implemented ipr dpr schemes a possible loss of performance from a reduced uvt associated with solids or colloidal material is perhaps only practically germane to breaching of the membranes though membrane breaching by particulates is not observed in most installations such breaching would also be expected to lead to increased permeate pathogen concentrations which would then be accompanied by impaired salt toc and or turbidity removal discernible at lrv values below 3 hornstra et al 2019 of greater practical relevance to uv process robustness is the risk of lamp and ballast failure demanding duty standby configuration more recently there has been increased research focus on light emitting diode uv led uv technology for promoting energy efficiencies sholtes and linden 2019 tan et al 2020 gao et al 2020 in the case of led lamps failure has been associated with degradation of the optical power to significantly below the initial value due to corresponding degradation of the semiconductor device or the silicon encapsulation arques orobon et al 2020 despite the progress in led development they are yet to be implemented for large scale water disinfection the stipulated uv dose for achieving a target level of inactivation is generally based on the adenoviruses since these are known to be the most resistant to uv light fig 2 other factors contributing to viruses uv disinfection efficacy include the virus concentration and the degree of aggregation aggregates being more resistant to disinfection gerba et al 2018 though aggregation is minimal at the extremely low microbial concentrations germane to ipr and dpr treated water there has also been increased interest in the use of uv combined with chlorine and or chloramines uv cl as an alternative to more conventional advanced photolysis methods kwon et al 2020 gao et al 2020 tan et al 2020 yeom et al 2021 recent studies have demonstrated improved removal by uv cl compared with the conventional advanced photolysis uv h2o2 of recalcitrant cecs such as ndma and 1 4 dioxane kwon et al 2020 and phenacetin and acetaminophen tan et al 2020 however it is suggested that the photolytic degradation products of some cecs may themselves have associated toxicity yeom et al 2021 and cytotoxicity or oestrogenic activity specifically huang et al 2020 2 3 2 membrane technology virus rejection by membranes is often determined using surrogates since procedures required for the analysis of human viruses are time consuming and cumbersome of these the most well explored is the bacteriophage ms2 amarasiri et al 2017 which has a similar size whilst it has been shown purnell et al 2016 that phages and enteric viruses do not necessarily co exist with seasonal variations in their relative concentrations phages have been and continue to be used for assessing membrane and other treatment processes these have included ro pype et al 2016 hornstra et al 2019 direct membrane filtration jacquet et al 2021 and membrane bioreactors mbrs zhu et al 2021 as well as other barrier processes such as soil aquifer treatment morrison et al 2020 whilst membrane technology including ultrafiltration uf membrane bioreactors mbrs and reverse osmosis ro generally offer a robust barrier to the larger pathogens bacteria and protozoa viruses are not completely rejected studies or reviews of the capability of uf jacquet et al 2021 bray et al 2021 mbrs o brien and xagoraraki 2020 zhu et al 2021 and ro hornstra et al 2019 fujioka and boivin 2020 for rejecting viruses or their analogues have identified challenges relating to performance variability across different pathogen species membrane characteristics and process operation reported lrvs for virus rejection by uf membranes have generally been between 3 and 4 jacquet et al 2016 reported maximum lrvs of 3 or more for adenovirus and ms2 at high feed concentrations 108 cells ml decreasing dramatically 1 at influent concentrations below 104 cells l bray et al 2021 reported mean lrvs of 4 for total viruses the value being lowest directly after cleaning lrvs of 4 for ms2 rejection were also reported by lee et al 2019 who also observed a decrease in lrv to 1 5 for aged membranes studies of ro membrane rejection of ms2 phage in controlled challenge tests have indicated increased rejection lrvs of 6 7 as reviewed by hornstra et al 2019 compared to uf however demonstrating removal of naturally arising pathogenic viruses is challenged by their low feedwater concentration in the case of mbrs membrane pore size dependency is demonstrated for some viruses including enterovirus and human adenovirus but not others table 1 o brien and xagoraraki 2020 the range of reported lrv values is also significant both for single and across different species this may arise from challenges posed by sampling and analysis gerba et al 2018 but is also likely to reflect the impact of partitioning of the viruses between the solid and aqueous phases in the mixed liquor viruses favour the solid phase over the aqueous phase by up 200 times haun et al 2014 since the mixed liquor solids are almost quantitatively rejected virus removal by mbrs tends to be greater than that provided by direct membrane filtration in the absence of such ancillary solids as acknowledged in the most recently promulgated regulatory guidelines on mbr process credits cwb 2021 a most recent pragmatic analysis conducted on behalf of the water research foundation salveson et al 2021 identifies performance levels for specific types or tiers of mbr technologies tier 1 mbrs refers to those already implemented at full scale and with demonstrated performance data these mbrs provide lrvs of 1 0 for virus and 2 5 for protozoa applicable to any hollow fibre or flat sheet mbr with pore sizes up to 0 4 μm and mbr filtrate turbidity values maintained at or below 0 2 ntu 95 of the time and never exceeding 0 5 ntu almost all use schemes employ some sort of membrane separation technology and many also include uv disinfection the differing efficacies and susceptibilities of these two technologies reinforce the long held principle of a multi barrier approach in potable water reuse as stipulated by regulatory bodies 3 regulatory guidelines and standards 3 1 non potable reuse npr guidelines for wastewater npr were originally provided by who 2006 these are taken as the minimum water quality required based on the direct use of the recovered wastewater with insignificant human exposure a comprehensive review of standards and guidelines applied globally to recovered sewage shoushtarian and negahban azar 2020 has indicated that the bacteriological water quality required in all countries to be 1 6 orders of magnitude more stringent than those recommended by who table 2 the difference between the figures presented in the low and high columns of table 3 relate to the sampling schedule for sampling over an extended period normally one week the guidelines refer to either a a maximum median value or b a maximum value with an associated percentage compliance within the eu the current standards for recovered wastewater for irrigation use eu 2020 iso 2020 categorise water quality classes for different uses the most stringent standard is for class a and stipulates permitted maximum averaged concentrations for pathogens bod5 tss and turbidity of 10 100 ml 5 mg l 5 mg l and 3 ntu respectively table 3 3 2 indirect direct potable reuse ipr dpr ipr demands significantly higher standards both of treated water quality and quality monitoring than npr this introduces a compliance issue with essentially two elements to the sanctioning a candidate treatment scheme a assigning of a maximum attainable performance to a specific unit operation or process technology and b the assessment of risk an established example of the former is that applied in the us state of california werf 2016 swrcb 2018 and elsewhere agwr 2006 2008 the assessment of risk is the approach advocated by the who 2006 and is manifested in water safety plans wsps in which quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra is embedded zhiteneva et al 2020 3 2 1 credits the regulations widely recognised as being the most advanced and comprehensive globally are those in place in california in this region the required performance in terms of removal of key pathogens is stipulated for a the treatment goal table 4 and b individual unit operations table 5 whilst the california title 22 standards have provided the benchmark for required process performance and product water purity they are proscriptive in nature and do not necessarily account for the prevailing site based circumstances and most specifically the associated risks the incorporating of site specific details which may impact on risk forms a key component of water safety plans 3 2 2 water safety plans water safety plans wsps are essentially holistic risk assessments ras applied to water management and supply and are sanctioned by the who who 2006 they encompass the expected elements of an ra of hazard assessment frequency and impact completion of wsps is often an iterative process where required modification of the system is revealed through close consideration of the risks required control measures and managerial aspects table 6 the adaptation of wsps for application to potable reuse schemes has the potential to replace a plethora of existing approaches which use various aspects of hazard and risk assessment e g rodriguez et al 2007 the first documented attempt to assess a potable reuse scheme using a wsp approach was conducted by dominguez chicas and scrimshaw 2010 with risks illustrated using a heat map graphic subsequent advances have seen proposals for dedicated water reuse safety plans suggested by sanz and gawlik 2014 and further developed in goodwin et al 2015 which draw on the strengths of the standard wsp agenda but with enhanced focus on integrating different water cycles and mechanisms to better account for uncertainty risk interactions and risk prioritisation wsps have also influenced national frameworks for drinking water quality and thereby indirectly impacted the design and management of mostly indirect potable reuse schemes for example in australia an early adopter of wsps in 1999 recent instances of the federal drinking water guidance nhmrc 2016 have adopted the central principles of the wsp approach putting more emphasis on the responsibility of utilities to monitor and properly manage processes in addition to conforming with delivered water quality standards growth in the dpr sector is providing yet another level of challenge for regulators standards setting bodies and scheme operators as the distinctive nature of risks and uncertainties become more apparent concerns here centre around a perceived lack of appropriate analysis and contingency planning for catastrophic risks which have low probabilities of occurrence but high impact consequences enhanced safety cultures rooted in the principles which shape behaviours in other high reliability process industries e g aviation nuclear combined with a regulatory philosophy which emphasises learning and experience sharing are argued to offer a more suitable operating environment for risk reduction and mitigation binz et al 2020 an independent enquiry body that to investigate water quality and wider system failures would both build public confidence in reuse scheme operations and ensure that near misses are investigated and adequately responded to across the sector 4 installations a summary of the global installations dedicated to wastewater reuse for potable supply table 7 indicates them to be predominantly us based there are additionally multiple installations established in australia singapore and southern africa it is unclear as to whether any of the large number of water reuse plants in china provide an indirect supply of potable water zhu and dou 2018 however it is evident from a number of studies that the de facto reuse of municipal wastewater for potable water supply presents a substantially greater risk to health than planned reuse either directly or indirectly nappier et al 2018 amoueyan et al 2019 soller et al 2019 in the us where the water reuse regulations are set at state level an investment of more than 11b in potable reuse is planned in california by 2035 to promote reuse of effluent currently discharged to sea california has promulgated regulations for dpr swrcb 2019 subject to review by an expert panel surface water augmentation in california has been limited because there were no specific regulations to allow the practice however this option is the primary focus for new projects in the state now that the regulations are in place whilst groundwater replenishment has been the historical focus in california a number of surface water augmentation projects exist elsewhere in the u s e g nevada virginia georgia there are a number of largely common features across the ipr schemes the environmental buffer in ipr schemes is most often groundwater hence groundwater recharge gwr which generally allows extended times for attenuation of residual pollutant levels surface water augmentation swa is also employed but normally as a consequence of the gwr option being unavailable the use of ro followed by uv irradiation either for disinfection or occasionally as part of on aop is widespread ro requires protection from channel blockage by fine solids and colloids and this is most often achieved by mf uf or more recently mbr technology the few dpr schemes employ supplementary treatment steps and or incorporate engineered storage to provide attenuation there appear to be fewer than 5 large dpr schemes currently as at august 2021 delivering treated reused water to consumers the schemes at brownwood tx and cloudcroft nm have been approved but not constructed the wichita falls scheme was piloted then decommissioned after one year of successful operation and the el paso plant is close to completion of the design phase the 7 5 mld colorado river municipal water district scheme at big spring tx is apparently operational however since motivations for implementation of ipr dpr differ regionally it is instructive to examine a few of the installations in more detail particularly the more established ones which have remained operational since first implemented for the more numerous ipr plants the regions most concentrated in large installations are southern california singapore and australia however one of the oldest installations is the new goreangab water reclamation plant at windhoek namibia a dpr facility which has been in substantially continuous operation since its commissioning in 2002 4 1 goreangab water reclamation plant windhoek namibia dpr the installation at windhoek was motivated by a water crisis dating back to 1957 coupled with increased population growth and declining annual rainfall freshwater demand in the region increased by over 600 ml y between 1982 and 2012 lafforgue and lenouvel 2015 in the absence of significant replenishable groundwater or river sources in the region demand management and dpr represent the only viable options for conserving water direct wastewater reclamation for predominantly potable use has been in operation in windhoek since 1969 the original plant 3 3 mld plant designed to treat the treated effluent from the city s city s gammams wwtp was based on coagulation daf rgf gac and chlorination prior to blending with the regular water supply from the surface reservoir provided by the goreangab dam however since the whole city and its informal settlements lie within the catchment of the dam the reservoir water quality is often worse than the treated wastewater du pisani 2006 the capacity from this original plant was subsequently increased to 7 5 mld in 1997 and currently provides irrigation quality water the new 21 mld capacity goreangab water reclamation plant ngwrp was constructed at a cost of 12 5 m eur hence 0 60 m mld and was opened in 2002 it is fed with tertiary treated municipal and commercial wastewater and comprises nine treatment steps fig 3 in addition to online water quality monitoring automated sampling at every process step is conducted daily supplemented with concurrent manual sampling for microbiological samples and sampling of the final product water at multiple locations of the distribution network water quality guidelines used are an amalgamation of those of the who usepa eu and namibia south africa and as such are based on the widely accepted range of biological physical and chemical parameters table 8 health impacts from water reuse were the subject of a 10 year long epidemiological study examining the relationship between diarrhoeal disease and potable reuse between consumers and non users in windhoek based on the study outcomes it was concluded that potable reuse did not increase incidences of diarrhoeal disease from water borne pathogens since no adverse health effects were detected the study was terminated in 1983

exceeding those demanded by the australian standards agwr 2006 2008 4 2 langford water recycling scheme lwrs uk ipr the lwrs ipr scheme dates back to april 2000 when the uk environment agency ea granted licences to allow discharge of tertiary quaternary treated wastewater into the river chelmer at scotch marsh essex and subsequent abstraction downstream of this discharge fig 4 its implementation was preceded by 10 years of environmental data capture and collation at the behest of the ea this scheme represents the first large scale uk example of planned ipr although there are many examples of de facto ipr in the country the wwtw concerned chelmsford sewage treatment works cstw treats the sewage by conventional primary settlement and secondary biological treatment using classical trickling filters and activated sludge to meet a discharge consent of 10 mgn l ammonia 20 mg l bod and 40 mg l suspended solids yhe treated wastewater flows along a 15 km underground pipeline to be discharged into the tidal chelmer about a kilometre downstream of two potable water intakes langford wtw and the raw water pumping station to hanningfield reservoir under the scheme wastewater is taken from the pipeline into the purpose built recycling plant at langford for further treatment the treated recovered water is then discharged into the chelmer upstream of the two potable water intakes augmenting the river flow as well as providing an indirect potable water supply the 20 mld capacity plant comprises advanced ballasted clarification biological denitrification and nitrification chemical precipitation of phosphorus and uv disinfection it was installed at a cost of 13 m hence 0 65 m per mld and has operated since late 2002 on an as needed basis it is intended for use during drought periods when treated volumes may represent up to 70 of the drinking water intakes the risk assessment and mitigation demanded extensive baseline environmental monitoring data to demonstrate compliance with the regulatory objective of no deterioration in environmental quality assessment was mainly based around the impact on downstream ecology from potential discharge of nutrients endocrine disrupting chemicals specifically nonylphenol toxic metals and pathogens table 9 quantitative ecological impacts encompassed invertebrate taxa environmental quality index ranges fish sexual development and wildfowl diversity assessment for a further 8 10 years following implementation of the scheme demonstrated no significant difference in metrics either between i upstream and downstream samples or ii sampling prior to or following the scheme implementation following expiration of the initial 10 year license the ea granted an indefinite license to continue operation of the scheme in this instance the impact of the scheme on the safety of the drinking water supply was of secondary importance to the possible environmental impact on the receiving water bodies throughout the duration of the scheme s operation the water quality of the recovered water has been substantially higher based on every metric recorded than the receiving environmental water which is subsequently abstracted for potable water supply the langford scheme highlights three key issues 1 ownership of the water hanningfield reservoir is owned by the water company but its management is subject to stipulations made by the uk regulator 2 the quantification and subsequent proof of no deterioration in environmental quality it is not possible to absolutely prove zero deterioration and there is no consistency in the interpretation of this stipulation across the many uk environmental regulatory bodies and pressure groups 3 extent of responsibility the water company has had to fund certain activities to mitigate against perceived impacts of abstraction of the wastewater which would otherwise flow to the downstream marina such as the annual dredging of maldon dock which is subject to silting up even though the scheme only operates during dry seasons 4 3 singapore ipr almost 40 of singapore s water supply is currently made up of recovered municipal and industrial wastewater termed newater by water reclamation plants wrps the newater is primarily supplied to non domestic sectors for industrial and cooling purposes and not directly to households for consumption during dry months however a small proportion of newater is directed to reservoirs to supplement the drinking water reserves the blended reservoir water then undergoes further treatment at the water treatment works prior to going into supply a rigorous sampling and monitoring programme is in place for the newater sfa 2019b encompassing over 300 parameters to ensure that its quality exceeds benchmark international potable water quality standards usepa 2009 who 2017 water supply in singapore is subject to the completion and implementation of a water safety plan and a water sampling plan by the supplier the singapore public utilities board in accordance with the who drinking water guidelines sfa 2019ab section 2 of chapter 95 of the singapore environmental public health act seph 2019a requires the supplier to maintain records report any incidents leading to the diminution in potable water quality to the director general and outline and enforce the necessary remedial measures the wrps plants at bedok and kranji both based on uv disinfection of membrane filtered secondary wastewater were commissioned in 2003 following a two year demonstration programme at the bedok site

weeks this contributed to the decision to transition to ipr 5 conclusions a review of the status of wastewater reuse for potable supply both direct and indirect focused primarily on the regulatory and practical aspects has revealed 1 more than half 22 out of 40 of the schemes for which information was captured table 7 are based on enhanced clarification most often uf or mf followed by ro and then uv for final disinfection with modern dpr schemes tending to employ uv based advanced oxidation as the final step 2 the rapid development of quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and loop mediated isothermal amplification lamp has led to their increased implementation for water quality monitoring due to their high specificity and sensitivity for pathogen detection 3 quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra studies suggest that the risk imposed by dpr and in particular ipr is very small compared with de facto reuse where the latter is not subject to the same level of scrutiny by the regulators 4 the few epidemiological studies which have been conducted have related to early more rudimentary ipr dpr schemes but these studies have nonetheless reported zero impact of municipal water reuse on the health of the consumer 5 ipr is complicated if zero deterioration in the environmental quality of the water buffer has to be demonstrated since this condition is not subject to consistent interpretation either internationally or nationally with respect to environmental impact on the buffer point 5 extremely conservative conditions have been imposed most graphically illustrated by the uk langford scheme which is not commensurate with the risk incurred and goes well above and beyond regulations pertaining to de facto water reuse if on the other hand the environmental buffer is both contained and owned by the water provider then these stipulations don t apply qmra point 3 provides a mechanism for quantification of infection risk from pathogens and can be extended to other pollutants for which quantitative data on influent concentration removal by unit wastewater treatment technologies and health impacts is available however it appears to be challenged by a lack of a appropriately detailed wastewater quality data and b consensus relating to the methodology and assumptions used which may limit the more widespread applicability of the findings from individual analyses notwithstanding such limitations and regardless of the noted inconsistencies and challenges analyses conducted have all tended to indicate that the microbial risk imposed by the product water from existing ipr and dpr schemes to be significantly below the thresholds set by the regulators the low risk is supported by the few epidemiological studies which have been conducted point 4 this being the case the most fruitful way forward would appear to be investing in ensuring process robustness whilst incurring a relatively high energy demand as well as generating a waste stream from the ro step which requires further management the inclusion of ro with downstream uv in the majority of the treatment schemes point 1 would seem to provide the appropriate level of efficacy when these processes are operating optimally maintaining this efficacy i e the required low health risk therefore relies on a reducing process failure risk and in relation to this b ensuring reliable on line monitoring there has been extensive demonstration of qpcr assay for many duties including reuse water quality assessment the method appears to offer a reliable precise and sensitive for pathogen identification and quantification point 2 but as with all microbial analytical methods for this duty demand substantial enrichment of the water sample due to the extremely low pathogen concentrations in the treated water against this research into the quantification of process failure whether relating to uv or membrane technology is sparse this

16187,wastewater treatment is generally performed using energy intensive processes such as activated sludge improving energy efficiency has become one of the main challenges for next generation wastewater treatment plants bioelectrochemical systems bes have been attracting attention because they take advantage of the chemical energy contained in wastewater while enabling the valorization of effluents either with electrical energy microbial fuel cells or with useful chemicals microbial electrolysis cells bioelectrochemical wastewater treatment has been under investigation since the early 2000s and is now the subject of an abundant literature which is most frequently focused on anodic cod removal comparing results obtained in different studies is particularly difficult with bes because many different parameters effluent characteristics inoculation design and operation may interact and because using real effluents results in high variability to address this issue data were retrieved from 1 073 articles that were selected objectively and with transparency this systematic review evaluates the potential of anodic wastewater treatment based on 4 579 experimental observations overall bes has already shown satisfactory treatment capacity with a median chemical oxygen demand removal of 72 however the median coulombic efficiency was only 18 increasing this parameter offers the greatest opportunity for bes improvement graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial electrochemical systems meta analysis anodic treatment scale up performance 1 introduction wastewater treatment consists in the removal of pollutants from sewage in a series of physical chemical and biological treatment processes before water is released back into the environment since wastewater treatment contributes to preserving the quality of natural water bodies it plays a key role in several contemporary challenges such as the protection of wildlife habitats and of human health presently wastewater treatment is globally mature and well established but it suffers from high energy intensity in the us and in europe wastewater treatment may account for 0 7 to 5 of the national electric energy consumption maktabifard et al 2018 within wastewater treatment plants wwtps secondary i e biological treatment generally has a particularly high demand in energy activated sludge is the dominant technology used for this step it relies on the aerobic degradation of dissolved organic matter by endogenous microorganisms and it plays a major role in the fulfillment of discharge standards especially regarding chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod and nitrogen removal tank oxygenation is performed by a combination of air injection and stirring which may represent over half of the total energy consumption of the wwtp maktabifard et al 2018 mccarty et al 2011 decreasing this energy demand constitutes one of the challenges for greener next generation wwtps using an anaerobic process instead of or complementarily to activated sludge could not only remove the aeration energy need but it could also help taking advantage of the chemical potential energy contained in wastewater gude 2018 li and yu 2016 mccarty et al 2011 in particular bioelectrochemical systems bess are a promising solution for reaching this objective a bes is composed of one or more compartments that may be separated from one another by membranes bess are essentially electrochemical processes in which at least one of the reactions is catalyzed by microorganisms that can exchange electrons with solid electrodes an oxidation reaction takes place at the anode and electrons are released into an external electrical circuit in which they circulate until they reach the cathode at the cathode electrons are consumed in a reduction reaction finally due to the electromotive force charged molecules anions or cations migrate from one electrode to the other thus ensuring the electroneutrality of the system when microbes catalyze the oxidation reaction at the anode they are called electrogens conversely when microbes catalyze the reduction reaction they are called electrotrophs logan and rabaey 2012 in the case of anodic wastewater treatment the effluent is treated by electrogens on the anodic side the anode is thus a bioanode the cathode however can be either biotic or abiotic he and angenent 2006 two main categories of bes exist schröder et al 2015 if the reactions are spontaneous useful electrical energy can be harnessed and the bes is called a microbial fuel cell mfc if the reactions are nonspontaneous power must be applied and the bes is called a microbial electrolysis cell mec mecs are typically used to produce h2 or to perform electrosynthesis at the cathode when ion exchange membranes are used to separate the anodic and cathodic compartments ions of interest e g nh4 carboxylates can advantageously be concentrated on one of the sides or in an additional concentration chamber an abundant and diverse scientific literature has already been published on anodic wastewater treatment 3000 articles since 2000 this highlights the fact that despite being relatively recent this technology is rapidly developing after two decades of profuse literature now seems to be the appropriate time to reflect on the maturity and on the future outlook of this technology what is the potential of bes for wastewater treatment and what are the most efficient operational conditions this is a fundamental question that has to be answered before considering its practical implementation this question covers different aspects of bes i e wastewater characteristics reactor and anodic design and biofilm establishment however due to the wide variety of experimental setups and the lack of homogeneity in the way results are reported comparing studies is still quite challenging despite valuable proposals on how to achieve homogenization logan et al 2006 schröder et al 2015 to tackle this issue we conducted a systematic literature review to evaluate the feasibility of bioelectrochemical wastewater treatment indeed the systematic review methodology implies an exhaustive and reproducible literature search as well as a qualitative and quantitative analysis xiao and watson 2019 although biases may be introduced because the different parameters are not independently investigated from one another the key asset of this methodology is to gather a large set of data that allows to identify global trends and make general conclusions with this approach it is possible to make the most out of the great number of studies with numerous different experimental setups which could not be compared otherwise in more limited datasets due to the many varying factors of course the downside is that it is however difficult to study each specific factor in detail the present review gathers data from the past two decades of literature on anodic wastewater treatment and aims at providing a global view on this technology its key parameters and the performances achieved so far this work is also the opportunity to drive the discussion forward on how experimental parameters and results are generally reported in the literature and to make suggestions for improvement 2 material and methods fig 1 is a schematic summary of the methodology used for the systematic literature review 2 1 scoping in order to guarantee a comprehensive and objective review of the topic the systematic review methodology was applied xiao and watson 2019 first the scope of the study was refined by the formulation of four research questions i what are the effects of the wastewater characteristics on the treatment capability of the bes and on its electrochemical performance ii which strategy for anodic biofilm establishment guarantees the best long term performance both in terms of wastewater treatment and of electrochemical operation iii how does the anodic configuration affect the development and the activity of the biofilm iv which are the best suited operational conditions for both wastewater treatment and electrochemical operation at large scale 2 2 article search and selection based on these research questions two distinct search queries were defined in order to retrieve all scientific papers dealing with anodic wastewater treatment table s1 these search queries were refined with the addition of exclusion key words table s2 for setting aside papers considering either expensive electrodes e g gold electrode genetically modified microbes eukaryotic organisms removal of specific compounds e g heavy metals azo dye and specific types of bess enzymatic and photo bes articles were searched for using the final queries in the scopus elsevier bibliographical database the search was done in november 2019 and new articles were not added after that while articles that were already in press for 2020 were kept this resulted in the selection of 1895 articles as a control 28 key articles of the field were identified beforehand independently from the queries table s3 all 28 articles were present in the scopus queries results thus indicating that no major article was missed during the initial query and through filtering finally the complete set of articles was manually filtered in order to remove the remaining out of scope papers as well as reviews papers dealing with pure cultures rather than mixed microbial consortia were also manually filtered the final set contained 1073 articles 2 3 database constitution whenever possible the value of key variables describing the different aspects of a bes were retrieved from each of these articles in short these variables can be separated into five main categories wastewater characteristics anodic design pilot design process operation and performance of the bes a complete list of the variables is available in table s4 where applicable values were calculated based on the information given in the article reporting errors may occur during manual data collection so a data check was carried out first outliers i e values farther than two times the standard error from the mean for each numerical variable were double checked and corrected if applicable secondly a multivariate outlier detection was carried out using the isolation forest algorithm liu et al 2012 as implemented by the function isolationforest from package solitude r 3 6 0 software r core team this algorithm separates each multivariate observation from the others using decision trees and random cutoffs an observation is considered as an anomaly if the decision tree is short i e if its separation required only a few steps however isolation forest can only be applied to a complete database without missing data which was not the case of the present database in order to make up for missing data in isolation forests missing values were randomly generated from a normal distribution that was established for each variable using its mean and standard error 2 4 statistical analysis cod removal and coulombic efficiency medians were compared for different groups e g categories of effluents inoculum using the non parametric kruskal wallis one way anova when more than two groups were compared and if a significant difference p 0 05 was found the multiple comparison dunn test was used as post hoc test in order to determine which medians were different from one another p values of the dunn test were corrected for multiple testing using the holm method both tests were carried out in the r 3 6 0 software using respectively the base function kruskal test and the dunn test function from package dunn test 3 description of the database the final bibliographical database included 4579 experimental observations extracted from a total of 1073 articles dealing with bioelectrochemical wastewater treatment and dating from 2003 to 2020 the number of annual publications on the subject has steadily increased in that period fig 2 a which denotes the potential anticipated by the scientific community for this technology the analysis of this substantial set of articles should provide insight on the real capability of bess to treat wastewater that can be reasonably expected one of the first concerns might be on the maturity of the technology in addition to being abundant has the published work studied real life conditions or is it still a laboratory curiosity fig 2 a shows that from the beginning real wastewater treatment has been under investigation in bess its share has regularly increased over the years up to the point where more than half of the studies now focus on real effluents rather than on synthetic effluents in the early years 2003 2010 the anodic working volumes were typically comprised between a few tens of milliliters and a few liters at most fig 2 b since then efforts have been put into scale up and the cubic meter scale is now reached in a few instances cusick et al 2011 liu et al 2017 valladares linares et al 2019 wang et al 2017 meanwhile miniaturization was also recently achieved with anodic volumes lower than 1 ml mateo et al 2019 which is also a sign of better technology understanding and control this shows that bioelectrochemical wastewater treatment is indeed getting more mature and that the present bibliographical database constitutes a relevant basis for evaluating this technology another important concern arises when considering the joint analysis of a substantial set of articles is the desired information documented in a sufficient number of articles is it reported in a homogeneous format that allows its analysis categorical variables e g type of wastewater type of inoculum could be determined unambiguously for almost all observations fig 3 regarding numerical i e quantitative variables results are more mixed total cod was given for almost all observations but other key parameters were less often found fig 3 total cod is a critical parameter for anodic wastewater treatment it represents the pollutant load to be treated so its removal must be monitored it also serves as electron source for the electrochemical process not knowing the value of other critical parameters for the functioning of bess makes the interpretation of the results and their extrapolation more difficult in particular in order to extrapolate the capacity of a bes to treat wastewater parameters such as ph ionic conductivity and temperature should be taken into account which was not always the case soluble cod was available for 60 of the observations but 87 of these observations corresponded to experiments with a synthetic medium in that case soluble and total cod are equal so no additional information is brought by soluble cod temperature was reasonably available yet it should be noted that numerous studies only indicated that the experiments were carried out at room temperature without any further information on approximate values nor on estimated variability range day night seasons in these cases temperature could not be taken into account the availability of ionic conductivity was curiously low which may show that ion transport is often a neglected aspect of bess of course in wastewater treatment conductivity is not defined by the operator but rather imposed by the influent which generally has a conductivity around 1 ms cm 1 yet reporting this parameter more consistently even for synthetic effluents could help to evidence limitations or strength of a given bes regarding ion transport oliot et al 2016 furthermore 177 articles from the selected set reported characterization of the microbial community through sequencing analysis however data files were found in online databases for only 24 articles it is thus recommended that accession numbers for the nucleotide sequences are systematically provided when a microbial community is characterized in a bes this would facilitate large scale meta analyses and advance our understanding of the dynamics and interactions within electroactive communities furthermore the actual anodic working volume was given for 72 of the observations for the remaining observations the total geometric anodic volume was however available in these cases the working was estimated as representing 90 of the total volume this 90 ratio was the median ratio that was found for all observations were both working and total volumes were given by doing so the anodic volume could be analyzed for 96 of the observations depending on its objective a given study may focus more on one aspect or the other wastewater treatment or electrochemical kinetics for instance this could explain why no performance indicator was systematically reported fig 3 it should be noted that the scientific community seems to have come to a consensus on which are the key performance indicators and on how to calculate them which facilitates inter studies comparisons many authors use the tools proposed by logan et al 2006 at the beginning of mfc development yet a good publishing practice should be to always report all indicators for example a study focusing on treatment capacity should report coulombic efficiency and current density in addition to cod removal in order to help the technology development by others furthermore wastewater treatment is almost always taken from the perspective of cod removal while other aspects are rarely studied or rarely reported at least the articles included in the study were searched for by using generic terms like treatment purification sanitation table s2 only studies focused on the removal of specific compounds metals antibiotics were specifically excluded in particular anodic removal efficiencies of total suspended solids tss n and p were actively searched for during the data collection phase yet they were only available for 1 to 3 of the observations in light of this wastewater treatment is only considered in terms of cod removal in subsequent analyses the fact that these aspects were not given more attention over the past two decades in the literature may suggest that there in a consensus on anodic wastewater treatment not being expected to adequately treat other parameters than cod at the anode a key asset of anaerobic wastewater treatment technologies is their capacity to serve multiple purposes at once wastewater is not considered anymore as a sole waste but also as a resource for energy production li and yu 2016 mccarty et al 2011 in the case of bioelectrochemical wastewater treatment different waste valorization strategies may be considered notably depending on the type of bes mfc or mec the primary focus of the articles is often on valorization while wastewater treatment is a secondary objective electrical energy production is the primary objective for 84 of the observations most of these studies deal with mfcs which aim at harvesting useful energy from the electrogenic activity of the anodic microbes in a few cases 1 the energy being produced is not harvested for external use in an electrical circuit instead the aim is to take advantage of the electrochemical gradient that is thus created it is notably the case in microbial desalination cells mdcs perazzoli et al 2018 sophia and bhalambaal 2015 and in bess performing electrodialysis zhang and angelidaki 2015 in the remaining 16 observations power was supplied to the bes instead of being produced in order to perform electrosynthesis or to provide other types of services such as ammonium recovery or denitrification in that case the cathode may be either abiotic or biotic depending on the specificities of each process a majority of mecs observations were producing energy carriers in the form of dihydrogen 73 chacón carrera et al 2019 gil carrera et al 2013 tartakovsky et al 2011 methane 14 virdis et al 2009 zeppilli et al 2015 or a mix of them 4 tenca et al 2013 zeppilli et al 2019 only a few studies aimed at the production of other chemical commodities such as acetic acid desmond le quéméner et al 2019 however it should be noted that the present study is focused on anodic wastewater treatment strategies so mec papers using abiotic anodes were not included based on these papers it can be inferred that target products could notably include a variety of other organic acids butyric acid caproic acid prévoteau et al 2020 4 overall performance of anodic wastewater treatment several key performance indicators were chosen before data collection in order to examine the various dimensions of bioelectrochemical wastewater treatment namely i wastewater treatment cod removal ii conversion efficiency coulombic efficiency and iii electrochemical kinetics current power density all experiments combined it can be observed that bess can achieve high and satisfactory cod removal with half of the experiments exceeding 72 of removal fig 4 a this confirms that globally bess constitute a relevant technology for treating wastewater provided adequate optimization is carried out for each specific case it should be possible to reach discharge standards on the contrary coulombic efficiencies are strikingly low half of the experiments did not exceed a coulombic efficiency of 18 fig 4 a this means that current generation generally accounts for only a fraction of cod removal and that non electrochemical reactions e g methane production o2 respiration impair the electro chemical performances when strictly considering wastewater treatment it might not matter whether cod is removed electrochemically or not however the energy production of mfcs and the cathodic valorization of mecs could be dramatically restrained anaerobic digestion occurring in the anodic compartment is a likely explanation for coulombic efficiencies being so low if no precaution is taken to ensure strict anaerobiosis in the anolyte it is also probable that cod is partly aerobically removed this would typically take place in small scale pilots using o2 as electron acceptor at the cathode o2 could diffuse into the anodic compartment dissolved o2 in wastewater could also contribute to aerobic cod removal injecting another gas e g n2 ar in the anodic compartment is one possible way to avoid this aerobic cod degradation and to better understand bioelectrochemical removal of cod however this solution only applies to small scale research its full scale implementation would not be practical and would defeat the purpose of anaerobic wastewater treatment alternatively it was recently shown that thick biofilms 40 µm of the model species geobacter sulfurreducens had greater oxygen tolerance than thinner biofilms 10 µm when oxygen was introduced in each experiment the relative decrease in the electron harvest was smaller with thick biofilms speers and reguera 2021 maintaining thick biofilms could be a possible way to limit aerobic cod oxidation in scaled up bes even if a balance will have to be found with substrate transfer limitation phenomena furthermore any part of the process that is susceptible to be limiting may contribute to the low coulombic efficiencies in particular this indicator is also likely impaired due to important limitations by the cathodic reaction if the cathodic kinetic is limiting the anode cannot be used as an electron sink only a fraction of the electrons released by cod oxidation are actually channeled into it in order to assess the reality of this limitation the median coulombic efficiencies can be compared for mecs versus mfcs indeed mecs are less likely to be kinetically limited by the cathodic reaction when a voltage is applied using a power source or a potentiostat is used to apply the anodic potential a voltage was applied for 64 of mecs while 24 had the anodic potential controlled the remaining observations did not specify analysis shows that indeed mecs do have a significantly greater coulombic efficiency median compared to mfcs 33 versus 15 respectively p value 0 001 this comparison highlights that cathodic reactions may constitute a limitation for wastewater treatment in mfcs as reviewed by rismani yazdi et al 2008 several factors may contribute to performance loss at the cathode such as cathodic overpotentials activation losses ohmic limitations or mass transport limitations yet the 33 median coulombic efficiency for mecs remains quite limited so important limitations are also due to other factors generally speaking low coulombic efficiencies prove that there are alternative electron acceptors in the medium other than the anode irrespective to potential kinetic limitations for the mass balance principle to be respected electrons have to be channeled to acceptors the electron acceptor being used should be the most energetically favorable for example if o2 is present it likely is the preferential acceptor thus decreasing coulombic efficiencies in the case of a perfect anaerobiosis no traces of o2 electrons are expected to be channeled to the anode yet limiting factors e g cathode reaction ionic transport might arise that makes the anode less competitive and favors electron acceptors that would be less energetically advantageous otherwise such as co2 throughout the literature coulombic efficiencies are thus likely affected by a combination of alternative electron acceptors and electrochemical bottlenecks kinetic indicators i e current and power densities are harder to discuss because of bias in the way they are reported first it is not completely equivalent to compare maximal densities of non continuous experiments to steady state densities of continuous experiments furthermore even though the current was normalized by the anodic area instead of cathodic or membrane areas in almost all studies this normalization still introduces a bias all authors do not use the same method for calculating the anodic area for example for a plane anode some authors may consider only one side and others both sides in the present study this factor was corrected by always using the same formula for a given anodic geometry table s4 still depending on the anodic geometry the projected area might be more or less close to the real area for instance the projected area of a plane anode is expected to be closer to reality than the one of a brush anode when the equivalent cylinder is considered for projection consequently comparing current or power densities for different anodic geometries remains questionable that being said fig 4 b shows that current densities may vary within a large range from virtually no current to a few dozen of amperes per square meter the highest values 10 a m 2 remain relatively scarce 45 papers from 2009 to 2019 so they cannot be considered as easily achievable more typically values are comprised in a narrower range 50 of current density values fall between 0 085 and 1 3 a m 2 most studies 84 deal with mfcs which aim at harvesting useful energy from the electrogenic activity of the anodic microbes the best power densities ranged from 0 10 to 0 42 kw m 3 but they represented only 1 5 of all reported values more typically power densities varied from 0 0 to 0 5 10 3 kw m 3 as a comparison conventional li ion dry batteries may produce a power density of 90 kw m 3 arends and verstraete 2012 given these low values it can be expected that the use of mfcs will remain limited to niche applications that do not require high energy densities interestingly fig 4 c and d show that for all performance indicators no clear upward trend can be identified in the past decades except for a major breakthrough innovation this means that no overall increase in performance should be expected in the coming years and that the feasibility of commercial development of bess for wastewater treatment can be evaluated on the basis of the existing literature on the opposite there is no clear downward trend in performance over the years either meanwhile the scale of pilots increased steadily in the same period and so did the share of experiments using real wastewater instead of synthetic medium fig 2 this could suggest that overall the experiments are getting closer to real life operational conditions while still preserving a similar level of performance which is encouraging for future developments yet there is an important variability of the performance indicator values throughout the literature so it is necessary to carefully identify which operational choices are the most promising due to the challenges in the comparison of current densities across different studies cod removal and coulombic efficiency were the only performance indicators selected for the next sections 5 impact of wastewater characteristics on process performance 5 1 type of effluent synthetic media i e model effluents alone account for over half of the observations revealing the dominance of lab scale experiments this is consistent with fig 2 a showing that bigger scale pilots have been developed only in recent years the choice of the model substrate is dependent on the kind of effluent that the operator wants to recreate according to fig 5 a acetate is the most common one and it is typically used to emulate urban wastewater glucose as for it would be a better suited model for experiments addressing the food and drinks industry effluents for instance e g brewery wastewater the predominance of acetate within synthetic media 61 of synthetic media experiments may indicate that research efforts are leaning towards the treatment of urban wastewater rather than other kinds of effluents another explanation might be that acetate is a well known carbon source for the model electroactive microbe geobacter sulfurreducens which is frequently found in anodic biofilms koch and harnisch 2016 lovley et al 2011 indeed fig 5 b shows that tcod levels in synthetic media seem closer to and thus more representative of levels observed in urban wastewaters other categories of effluents listed on fig 5 are all real life effluents originating from various sources urban wastewater he et al 2016 liu and logan 2004 pandit et al 2014 food industry brewery dairy plants cecconet et al 2018 feng et al 2008 other industries paper industries petroleum refineries ketep et al 2013 srikanth et al 2016 dark fermentations etc experiments using these effluents as anolytes can be regarded as more representative of operational conditions as opposed to synthetic media which dismiss all issues due to the complexity of the effluent in particular urban wastewater is the most frequent real life effluent being tested 14 of all observations this reinforces the previous statement as far as the scientific literature is concerned bess seem particularly interesting in the case of urban wastewater treatment a more intense research effort on the topic could also be the sign of urban wastewater being the most challenging effluent to treat in a bes in fact urban wastewater is the effluent containing the lowest level of tcod fig 5 b so it is questionable whether a substantial biofilm growth and sustainable electrochemical performances can be supported as a first approach the distribution of the two key performance indicators can be compared for the different categories of effluents fig 5 c and d as it could be expected experiments with synthetic media achieved higher performance levels compared to the other effluents the median cod removal and coulombic efficiency were respectively 78 and 23 for synthetic media compared to 68 and 13 for all real effluents combined this difference could be explained by the easily accessible and biodegradable cod contained in synthetic media in addition these media are less complex and may not contain specific pollutants that interfere with the development of an efficient electroactive biofilm synthetic media might also be associated with small scale experiments in controlled conditions which could constitute a bias in this observation despite the relatively low levels of cod in urban wastewater fig 5 b it appears that bess can achieve satisfactory cod removal fig 5 c however cod removal for urban wastewater median 68 seemed slightly lower compared to simpler or more concentrated effluents such as synthetic media median 78 or food industry wastewater median 75 a possible explanation is that because cod levels in urban wastewater are lower the irreducible non biodegradable part might represent a larger portion of it among bess treating real effluents it seems that those using food industry effluents achieve the closest performances to those using synthetic wastewater the two most frequent sub categories of food industry wastewater were dairy wastewater 29 and brewery wastewater 19 they both contain high levels of cod fig 5 b which is expectedly mainly in the form of readily available carbohydrates such as lactose and glucose respectively an important additional aspect is that these effluents are typically treated at higher temperatures than urban wastewater in real life conditions between 17 and 25 c for dairy wastewater between 18 and 45 c for brewery wastewater compared to a range of 10 to 20 c for urban wastewater slavov 2017 werkneh et al 2019 higher treatment temperatures can result in quicker and more efficient biodegradation of the pollutants in the literature for bess the average temperature for food industry effluents is 28 6 c while it is 25 5 c for urban wastewater even though this difference was significant wilcoxon test p 0 001 it could be too tenuous to explain the observed differences in performance however it should be noted that in the literature urban wastewater is generally treated at a higher temperature 25 5 c than in real life conditions between 10 and 20 c this constitutes a possible bias for the extrapolation of bes performance from lab scale to industrial scale experiments regarding bes used to treat other industrial wastewater it might come as a surprise that the performances should be this low compared to food industry wastewater 62 vs 75 for median cod removal and 13 vs 16 for median coulombic efficiency indeed cod levels found in food industry wastewater were approximately the same as in other industrial wastewater fig 5 b however non food industrial wastewater are likely to contain organic matter in more complex forms that are more difficult to break down the most frequent sources for industrial wastewater were the petroleum industry 26 and the paper industry 17 the former typically contains high percentages of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons 75 of petroleum hydrocarbons along with toxic compounds such as phenols or heavy metals varjani et al 2020 as for it paper industry wastewater is notably composed of complex polymers extracted from the pulp and paper the most prominent being lignin and cellulose toczyłowska mamińska 2017 the complexity and potential toxicity of these effluents are the most likely explanations for the lower performances observed in bess finally bess treating non food fermentation effluents showed the lowest cod removal median 52 but the highest coulombic efficiencies median 27 fig 5 this category of wastewater groups together a diversity of effluents produced by bioprocesses such as dark fermentation effluents 38 anaerobic digestion effluents 26 and fermentation effluents 26 these effluents having already undergone a biological transformation their volatile fatty acids vfa levels should be relatively high so it was not expected that cod removal rates would be that low compared to other effluents however fewer observations were available in the literature for this category of effluents as compared to others and the dispersion of the results is higher therefore the performances observed might actually reflect the influence of other parameters e g inoculum temperature residence time etc this last comment also applies to coulombic efficiencies of non food fermentation effluents when using anaerobic digestion effluent as anolyte methanogens are likely to be enriched while they do contribute to cod removal they are less likely to participate in current generation thus impairing the coulombic efficiency 5 2 total chemical oxygen demand no significant difference in cod removal nor in coulombic efficiency appeared for cod levels up to 10 000 mgo2 l 1 while concentrations above this threshold seemed detrimental to the performances median cod removal varied between 68 and 75 for cod concentrations below 10 000 mgo2 l 1 while the median was only 60 above this threshold below this threshold median coulombic efficiency ranged between 17 and 21 while above the threshold it decreased to 14 fig 6 a and b this suggests that bess might not be suitable for the treatment of very concentrated effluents in light of this a functioning range for bess appears to be from 100 to 10 000 mgo2 l 1 this range is in accordance with the typical cod content of all main categories of effluent fig 5 b so it is not expected that cod levels should be a major concern for the development of bess coulombic efficiencies were found lower for the highest cod levels in the effluent while no significant differences were identified for cod from 0 to 10 000 mgo2 l 1 this suggests that for the highest organic loads the bioelectrochemical share of microbial activity decreased and the side reactions e g methanogenesis were more important if o2 contamination in anodes were the main reason for coulombic efficiencies being so low throughout the literature low cod contents should have tallied with lower coulombic efficiencies so the main cause for that likely lies elsewhere 5 3 ph both cod removal rates and coulombic efficiencies were found significantly higher in the circumneutral ph domain 6 5 7 5 fig 6 c and d the median cod removal for circumneutral ph was 72 compared to 57 for acidic ph and 63 for alkaline ph the median coulombic efficiency was 19 around ph 7 but 14 in acidic conditions and 11 in alkaline conditions this result could be expected since a ph around 7 is commonly considered in the literature as optimum for anodic microbial activity and extreme conditions are tested less often dopson et al 2016 patil et al 2011 this is also reflected in the fact most of the experiments are carried out in this range of values 62 of the observations with a known ph value were comprised between 6 5 and 7 5 most effluents had ph values typically in the circumneutral domain so the ph of the treated effluent is not expected to be a major issue in the development of bess for wastewater treatment two exceptions were however identified urine with an average ph 8 1 1 4 n 27 and landfill leachate with an average ph 7 6 1 0 n 42 furthermore even though the ph in the effluent might not be an issue in most cases attention must be paid on the ph evolution in the anolyte over time anodic oxidation reactions tend to acidify the medium due to proton release 5 4 ionic conductivity no significant difference in cod removal could be evidenced according to ionic conductivities fig 6 e and f the range of 1 to 10 ms cm 1 is the most frequently tested condition this is consistent with the fact that this range of values corresponds to the typical conductivities found in effluents and to the most appropriate conditions for microbial activity indeed higher conductivities indicate highly saline environments in which only halophilic organisms may thrive as a comparison sea water conductivity may vary from 10 to 60 ms cm 1 tyler et al 2017 only two categories of effluents were found with an average conductivity exceeding 10 ms cm 1 urine with an average conductivity of 30 9 7 0 ms cm 1 n 15 and landfill leachate with 25 3 13 9 ms cm 1 n 24 among food industry effluents high conductivities may also be found in specific cases for example brines from the olive industry had a conductivity of 77 2 17 0 ms cm 1 n 6 yet conductivity values from the literature were too scarce and getting an accurate picture of the typical conductivities of each effluent is questionable it seems quite surprising that only 15 of all observations would report the conductivity of the effluent this parameter can be conveniently measured with adequate probes and it is a good indicator of the ion transport capacity of the wastewater kinetics of electrochemical reactions are dependent on the ion transport in the electrolyte oliot et al 2016 conductivities under 10 ms cm 1 are likely to be rate limiting for electrochemical cod removal low ionic conductivities were already identified as a major hurdle in the development of bess as compared to abiotic electrochemical processes where electrolytes commonly have conductivities of several hundreds of ms cm 1 oliot et al 2016 unsurprisingly higher conductivities over 10 ms cm 1 were associated with higher coulombic efficiency with a median value of 25 while the median ranged between 15 and 18 with lower conductivities fig 6 f furthermore generally low anodic conductivities may be an explanation to the globally low coulombic efficiencies throughout the literature given the results presented here increasing the conductivity e g by adding salts might be a way of increasing coulombic efficiencies by preventing ion transport limitation with no expected difference in treatment capacity however this strategy cannot be used for the treatment of large volumes of wastewater like urban wastewater 5 5 temperature at thermophilic temperatures cod removal was found to be slightly lower than at mesophilic temperatures 61 vs 72 but the difference was not significant fig 6 g again intermediate conditions i e mesophilic temperatures are optimal for a greater variety of microorganisms as compared to extreme conditions and this is likely to explain why cod removal was the highest between 20 and 45 c however it is remarkable that no significant difference could be evidenced between psychrophilic and mesophilic conditions this suggests that anodic treatment of effluents could be performed at ambient temperature this property constitutes a real asset for the implementation of bess for urban wastewater treatment in temperate countries where temperatures are often comprised between 10 and 20 c despite the decrease of cod removal for thermophilic temperatures it is noteworthy that coulombic efficiencies increased in these conditions fig 6 h this might be attributed to higher anodic reaction kinetics or quicker ion transport yet experiments in thermophilic conditions were very few 25 in total and further evidence is still required to substantiate this observation if thermophilic temperatures correlate with higher coulombic efficiencies indeed temperature would appear as a means of favoring electroactive microorganisms and of reducing non electrogenic side reactions however heating effluents would require expensive amount of energy and it seems impractical at a full industrial scale for effluents such as urban wastewater 5 6 wastewater feeding strategy three main strategies for anodic wastewater supply were identified from the literature batch semi continuous repeated batch and continuous operation batch feeding represented 23 of the observations while semi continuous and continuous feedings represented 33 and 43 respectively for batch and semi continuous feedings cod removal medians 76 were found significantly greater p value 0 001 than for continuous operation 68 see fig 7 for batch and repeated batch common criteria for stopping the experiment were current decrease or voltage drop for mfcs in any case it means that the experiment is carried out until cod is almost fully depleted which introduces a bias when comparing to continuous operation experiments regarding coulombic efficiencies it appeared that semi continuous experiments had a significantly higher median 23 versus 17 and 15 for batch and continuous operation respectively p value 0 001 see fig 7 this observation could be explained by an adaptation of the anodic biofilm over the successive batch cycles which would progressively enrich the biofilm in electroactive species that would be favored by the presence of the anode on the other hand the difference in medians between batch and continuous operation is quite limited 17 versus 15 despite being slightly significant p value 0 04 it could be expected that coulombic efficiencies would be higher for continuous operation since it should also allow the progressive selection of electrogens however this is likely dependent on the actual hydraulic retention times hrt and organic loading rates olr that are being applied the impact of hrt on the selection of electrogens in the biofilm is a non trivial issue on the one hand hrts should not be too short so that the biomass is not entirely washed off on the other hand applying relatively short hrts may also be an opportunity to apply a selective pressure in order to select microbes that attach to the anode when continuous operation was chosen the median olr was 1 7 kgcod m 3 d 1 n 1704 with olrs typically varying from 0 63 to 4 7 kgcod m 3 d 1 q1 q3 interquartile range correspondingly the median hrt was 12 h n 1693 and typical hrts ranged from 6 h to 1 d q1 q3 interquartile range in order to undertake a comparison with batch operation an equivalent to olr might be calculated as the initial cod concentration divided by the duration of the batch by doing so a median supply rate of 1 9 kgcod m 3 d 1 is found n 838 with typical batch duration comprised between 4 and 17 days however an equivalent olr could not be calculated for semi continuous operation experiments based on the data that were retrieved from the literature the number of cycles and their duration were not collected only the total duration of the semi continuous process was even though loading rates might be roughly equivalent overall between continuous and batch operation a batch typically benefited from a longer time to treat an equivalent amount of cod for continuous operation the median organic removal rate was 1 1 kgcod m 3 d 1 n 1351 while it was 1 4 kgcod m 3 d 1 n 586 for batch this difference despite being slight was found significant p value 0 01 however in real life conditions wastewater treatment is most likely to be operated continuously since batch operation would be impractical for low cod containing effluents such as urban wastewater furthermore for an adequate process design the time between two batches should be included in the calculation which would result in lower olrs yet batch operation remains commonly used in the literature because it is a standardized and practical setup for bench scale experiments which allows focusing on other specific factors 6 anodic configuration 6 1 most frequent anodic configuration bio electrochemical performances of bes also depend on the configuration that was chosen for the anode in particular the anodic material and geometry e g plane granular are generally recognized as important factors for example the biofilm adherence likely depends on the surface characteristics in addition the type of geometry will determine the range of surface to volume ratio fig 8 b this ratio corresponds to the ratio between the projected electrode surface and the anodic working volume the higher this ratio is the more of the working volume is occupied by electrodes and thus by the electroactive biofilm the working volume is also an influential parameter achieving high surface to volume ratios is easier in small scale reactors than in large scale pilot experiments for example fig 8 b shows that larger scale pilots 10 l have surface to volume ratios typically lower than 100 m2 m 3 while bench scale pilots 1 l achieve ratios over this threshold more commonly it is particularly striking for plane electrodes which are the most frequently used for bench scale pilots typical ratios ranged from 6 4 to 35 m2 m 3 while they typically ranged from 0 5 to 12 m2 m 3 for larger scale pilots maintaining a high surface to volume ratio is one of the important challenges that still remain for bes scale up typically brush and granular electrodes can help achieving higher surface to volume ratios due to their three dimensional structures at small scale their median ratio was 86 m2 m 3 for brushes and 106 m2 m 3 for granules however until now these configurations remain rarely tested at larger scale respectively 20 and 1 observations so the actual ratios that might be expected are still difficult to estimate based on the existing literature graphite was the most common anodic material fig 8 a representing 83 of the anodes due to its properties low cost and adequate biofilm support depending on the electrode geometry some forms of graphite were preferred mainly graphite felt graphite cloth plain graphite and graphite paper were chosen for plane electrodes representing respectively 29 24 18 and 12 of plane electrodes graphite fiber however represented 55 of brush electrodes only plain graphite was used irrespective of the geometry aside from graphite activated carbon was commonly used for granular anodes 28 of granular electrodes and stainless steel was a possible alternative for planar electrodes 6 other materials included composite electrodes modified surface electrodes biochar and metals e g iron zinc however the price of the two former may be prohibitive for scale up roubaud et al 2019 6 2 impact of the anodic configuration on the process performance fig 9 shows the bes performances according to the anodic configurations no clear trend could be identified concerning cod removal so it is difficult to determine an optimal configuration from that point of view since coulombic efficiencies are generally low in the literature cod removal may be attributed to some extent to planktonic microorganisms this could explain why the anodic configuration has no clear impact on cod removal on the opposite coulombic efficiencies vary more dramatically graphite always showed high values and was only topped by activated carbon in planar configuration this last remark however relies only on a few observations and it might be questionable overall the relevance of anode graphite is hereby confirmed 7 biofilm establishment 7 1 description of the main strategies the establishment of the anodic biofilm is a crucial phase in the implementation of a bes treating effluents the protocol for anodic inoculation should allow proper colonization of the electrode surface so that cod can be effectively removed while current is generated this implies that the conditions of maturation should allow preferential selection of electroactive microorganisms within the biofilm the term maturation phase is defined here as the phase that took place prior to the considered experiment and during which an anodic biofilm was established the diversity of strategies for the establishment of the anodic biofilm was captured in two variables notably the type of inoculum and the substrate used during the biofilm maturation the main strategies are presented on fig 10 the most frequent type of inoculum was non electrochemical anaerobic inoculum i e an anaerobic inoculum that does not stem from another bioelectrochemical system this category of inoculum mainly includes anaerobic digestion sludge 82 and sediments 6 the next categories of inoculum were real wastewater and electrochemical inoculum the latter describes an inoculum that was sampled from an on going bes wastewater inoculum means that the effluent that is treated in the bes also serves as source of microbes and that no other inoculum is added the last category of inoculum was aerobic inoculum which mostly consisted in activated sludge from wwtps 92 the choice of the inoculum is not indifferent because each inoculum will provide a microbial consortium whose composition is likely to depend on its origin for instance anaerobic digestion sludge is expected to bring a significant part of methanogens that may impair the coulombic efficiency aerobic sludge however is likely to be rich in aerobes so the selection of electroactive anaerobes in the bes may require a longer time however the conditions of inoculation substrate anodic potential residence time anaerobiosis etc in the anodic compartment may remedy these difficulties in most cases the substrate used during the maturation phase was a synthetic effluent 54 globally when a synthetic effluent was used during maturation it was generally also used afterwards during the operation phase of the bes however in some cases 11 of the observations with a synthetic effluent as maturation substrate the synthetic effluent was replaced at the end of maturation by real wastewater in other cases when wastewater was the inoculum the real wastewater was also used directly as substrate during biofilm establishment this constitutes a singular inoculation strategy only wastewater is supplied to the bes as anolyte and it serves as a source for both microorganisms and carbon this strategy may seem quite challenging because wastewater is likely less loaded with microorganisms so biofilms may take longer to form yet with this strategy the applied maturation times were not necessarily longer than all the others when a maturation time was applied it typically varied between a few days and a month in both cases around half the studies 47 when wastewater was the source of carbon and of microbes 53 in all other cases did not include a maturation phase at all meaning that observations started as soon as the inoculum was added however this strategy if proven effective enough see section 7 2 could be well adapted to industrial scale installations because of its simplicity of implementation furthermore irrespective of the type of inoculum biofilm maturation is typically carried out without a continuous feeding of effluent either in batch mode or in semi continuous mode i e in repeated batches overall semi continuous feeding alone represented 42 of the observations a single batch maturation might end up with substrate full depletion before the biofilm is mature enough so repeated batch is likely better suited for achieving successful biofilm establishment continuous feeding would be more relevant for bigger scale bess in this case the hydraulic retention time hrt could also play a role in the selection of electroactive microbes for example like methanogenic biofilm reactors short hrt could help preferentially select microbes that are able to attach to the electrode while planktonic microbes are washed out cresson et al 2008 a large fraction of the observations did not have a dedicated maturation phase at all in these cases the experiment only included an initial inoculation this can be either because the focus of the corresponding papers was precisely on the maturation phase or because the question addressed in these papers did not require a mature biofilm 7 2 impact of inoculation and maturation on process performance one of the initial concerns of the present study was to evaluate the impact of the biofilm formation stage on the long term performances of bess unfortunately it was not possible to establish a standardized indicator describing what long term is moreover a biofilm is a dynamic structure that evolves continuously so it might be questionable to attribute long term variations on the initial inoculum conditions consequently the analysis was focused on the impact of the inoculum and maturation time on cod removal and coulombic efficiency of the subsequent operation phase as observed on fig 11 all types of inocula could be associated with high cod removal anaerobic inoculum either electrochemical or non electrochemical were associated with higher cod removal when compared to wastewater or aerobic sludge the differences were slight but they might be attributed to anaerobic sludge containing microorganisms that are already well adapted to anaerobiosis regarding electrochemical inoculum electroactive microbes are likely already abundant and this must be the reason for the higher coulombic efficiency that was observed fig 11 b 18 of the observations that had a maturation phase had it carried out as mec mode instead of mfc with either the voltage or the anodic potential that was controlled mec maturation can be interesting because it may contribute to the selection of electroactive microbes in the biofilm thanks to anodic potential control yet biofilm maturation in mec mode was very rare preceding a mfc experiment it represented only 8 of the mfc experiments that included a biofilm maturation phase but 53 of the mec experiments the maturation phase in the remaining mec experiments was in mfc mode data on anodic potential during maturation was too scarce for proper analysis when evaluating the impact of the maturation phase on the subsequent operation phase one can wonder whether it is more appropriate to apply similar conditions for both phases so that the microbial community adapts to the operation conditions or to apply optimal conditions during maturation for establishing a robust biofilm even if less favorable conditions will be applied during operation interestingly for bess treating either a real or a synthetic wastewater cod removal was greater when the biofilm had been maturated directly with the final effluent as substrate 71 vs 51 for bes treating real wastewater and 93 vs 75 for bes treating synthetic wastewater fig 12 a coulombic efficiencies however were lower when the biofilm was matured with a real effluent 10 vs 13 for bes treating real wastewater and 1 vs 17 for bes treating synthetic wastewater fig 12 b the differences in coulombic efficiencies remained more limited compared to cod removal especially for bess treating real wastewater during operation where the difference was not significant this shows that in real industrial installation it is not necessarily relevant to design a maturation phase with a synthetic substrate in addition to being more efficient using the real effluent for maturation will also be easier to implement and would save costs 8 design of the bioelectrochemical reactor 8 1 shape and symmetry as previously reviewed he et al 2017 bes for wastewater treatment may come in many shapes and sizes here the variety of reactor designs was captured in two variables i its internal shape e g rectangular cylinder and ii the type of symmetry the latter represents how the anode and the cathode are positioned relatively to one another they can be on opposite sides reflection symmetry or they can be arranged in concentric layers rotational symmetry overall rectangular bes with a reflection electrode symmetry is the most frequent 40 configuration in the literature fig 13 a probably because they are the easiest to implement in most cases when a cylindrical shape was chosen the electrodes were still put in a reflection symmetry in these cases there is no fundamental difference in using one shape of the other at bench scale for example it may be considered equivalent to use a rectangular glass tank or a bottle i e a vertical cylinder it is thus interesting to look more specifically to bigger scale bioelectrochemical reactor designs fig 13 b for bes with an anodic working volume greater than 10 l rectangular shape reactors are even more frequent 59 this design allows a great modularity either by inserting electrode cassettes in a tank cotterill et al 2017 hiegemann et al 2019 or by stacking several units in a filter press mode vilajeliu pons et al 2017 wu et al 2016 similarly to bench scale experiments when a cylindrical pilot shape was chosen for bigger scale experiments it really took advantage of a rotational electrode symmetry in one third of the observations fig 13 b in these cases the pilots were mainly developed as tubular modules that may work in parallel or in series depending on how the hydraulic flow was operated this modules could be operated either as columns lu et al 2017 or as horizontal tubes ge and he 2016 unsurprisingly h shape pilots were not tested at bigger scale since they are a typical small scale 1 l design ahmed et al 2015 logan et al 2006 nikhil et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 horizontal cylinders with a reflection symmetry are also a very common small scale experimental design with a typical working volume of a few dozen of milliters guo and kim 2019 logan et al 2006 zhou et al 2019 pilot designs that typically correspond to small scale set ups may be artificially associated to greater process performance because they are easier to implement and to control this is a likely explanation for the distributions of the performance indicators shown on fig 13 c d in particular for the higher results obtained with horizontal cylinders both for cod removal and coulombic efficiency or with h shape reactors for coulombic efficiency 8 2 type of membrane an important part of the reactor design lies in the selection of the type of separation between the anodic chamber and the other chambers it depends greatly on the intended purpose of the bes being designed be it electrical energy production electrosynthesis desalination overall in just over half the cases 51 at least one ion exchange membrane was used while in one third of the experiments there was no separation between the electrodes fig 14 a membrane less bes may be easier and cheaper to implement but they can only be used when there is no need for physical separation between chambers for product recovery for example proton exchange membranes pem and cation exchange membranes cem were the most common membranes respectively 24 and 21 of all observations but more rarely in 4 of the observations anion exchange membranes aem could also be used in microbial desalination cells mdcs a combination of aems and cems is used in order to concentrate the salts in intermediary chambers ebrahimi et al 2018 perazzoli et al 2018 results shown on fig 14 b c are globally consistent with the comparison previously published by oliot et al 2016 pems were expected to be detrimental to mfcs because proton transport contributes very little to ion transport at the typical circumneutral ph of mfcs and indeed pems seem to be associated with lower performance indicators for instance the median cod removal with a pem was 68 versus 75 and 73 respectively for bes with no membrane or with a cem the median coulombic efficiency was 14 with a pem compared to 23 and 19 with no membrane or with a cem fig 14 b c in addition compared to cems aems are expected to minimize the resistance to the ph balance role of the buffering phosphates species h2po4 and hpo4 2 between the two compartments oliot et al 2016 this may explain why coulombic efficiencies seem higher with aems fig 14 c yet the advantage of aems over cems does not hold regarding cod removal fig 14 b 8 3 pilot scale reactors despite bes scale up being progressively achieved the number of pilot studies remains very limited fig 2 even the definition of a pilot scale study is a non trivial issue as explained by wang and he 2020 in addition to the working volume several other criteria should be met for a reactor to be considered an actual pilot reactor such as the hydraulic flow the use of real wastewater the duration of the experiment and its location laboratory or on site here only 206 observations 4 5 corresponded to an anodic working volume greater than 10 l and only 33 observations 0 7 to a working volume greater than 100 l among pilots exceeding 10 l only 64 used real wastewater the most frequent real effluents that were used are urban wastewater 43 and food industry effluents 7 8 in total there were 102 observations that corresponded to a large scale experiment 10 l using a real effluent that was fed continuously this represents only a small fraction of all observations 2 2 but these experiments are the closest to field conditions the actual potential of anodic wastewater treatment may thus be evaluated based on these experiments even though bes scale up is still under investigation and further optimization is to be expected these observations typically lasted between 15 and 70 days and the applied hrts typically ranged from 0 35 to 1 8 d corresponding to organic loading rates between 0 38 and 2 1 kgcod m 3 d 1 q1 q3 interquartile ranges the median cod removal was 72 n 94 and the median coulombic efficiency was 6 5 n 39 it appears that the cod removal median is the same for pilot scale observations than for the overall dataset so the organic matter treatment capacity is well maintained however coulombic efficiencies are even lower than for the global dataset here again this shows that the anodic side is likely not the limiting aspect of the global bes functioning and that challenges for scale up mainly lie in improving other limiting aspects such as cathodic reactions are mass transport phenomena 9 conclusions and outlook bioelectrochemical reactors offer a technological means to harvest the energy content of wastewater during its treatment they have therefore a huge potential for drastic reduction of energy consumption associated to wastewater treatment and have attracted tremendous attention becoming the focus of extensive research during the last two decades even though the technology is still not mature it has now reached a crossroads our analysis indeed shows that an increasing number of studies have been challenging bes technologies with more realistic real life conditions over the recent years process scale up has now been under investigation for several years and the share of real effluents in the experiments now represents more than half the observations fig 2 in order to infer successful technology development paths it is therefore the right time to refine our assessment and to ask which lessons can be learned from two decades of extensive research on of anodic wastewater treatment in bioelectrochemical reactors the present review involved the systematic and quantitative analysis of the abundant literature on the subject a total of 4579 observations were retrieved from 1073 articles published between 2002 and 2020 at first it should be pointed out that the values of some key parameters e g ionic conductivity temperature nitrogen and phosphorus contents were seldom reported in the studies this observation is especially true for real effluents compared to synthetic effluents which may be paradoxical since real effluents have more complex compositions that vary over time and in space in addition quantitative analyses were further limited by the difficult homogenization of other key parameters such as current densities in the present study we used a unique and homogeneous formula for renormalization of each parameter on a common basis yet some bias might still remain due to differences in the design or operating techniques for future technology developments it is highly advisable for the whole scientific community to continue its effort in harmonizing the way bioelectrochemical experiments are documented logan et al 2006 schröder et al 2015 in particular all operational parameters and performance indicators should be reported quantitatively in all studies irrespective of the particular focus of a given study i e whether a study focuses on the treatment capacity on energy production or on electrolysis the authors should always report cod removal coulombic efficiency and current density this will facilitate the extrapolation of lab scale results to real operating conditions our systematic approach made however possible to consider the key parameters influencing anodic treatment and their influence on two major performance indicators coulombic efficiency and cod removal quantitative analysis provided insights into the impact of the wastewater characteristics of anodic and pilot design and of operational parameters table 1 the analysis shows that at this stage bioelectrochemical treatment appears to be appropriate for all kinds of effluents but some effluents could be more challenging than others due to low cod content or conductivities e g urban wastewater or due to toxic compounds e g industrial wastewater food industry wastewater appears to be particularly suitable for treatment in bes even though it only accounted for 10 of the observations overall the most favorable cod concentrations were around 1 go2 l 1 regarding anodic design there is a consensus in the scientific community on using carbon materials as low cost anodes on the contrary inoculation strategies are more diversified using wastewater as a source of inoculum may be more practical while using an effluent from an on going bes may increase coulombic efficiency finally although a wide range of pilot shapes and designs were characterized only a few different configurations have already been implemented at large scales 10 l and these corresponded to relatively simple designs such as parallelepipeds or cylinders with concentric compartments this underlines the fact that scale up remains a difficult task and that scalability needs to be thought through right from the early stages of the development of new bes from a more general perspective the discrepancy between cod removal rates and coulombic efficiencies revealed here is quite a compelling finding while cod removal rates are satisfactory from a treatment point of view median 72 coulombic efficiencies remain quite low median 18 this observation opens the debate on what can be the most appropriate positioning for bioelectrochemical technology on one hand indeed if treatment is the primary objective these low coulombic efficiencies may still be acceptable this suggests that optimizing the bioelectrochemical performances of the bes process might not be the only technological path to follow this possibility is further backed up by several other observations importantly cod removal performances also remain unchanged when considering larger experiments 10 l treating real effluent only n 94 in addition the median organic removal rate value for continuous processes 1 1 kgcod m 3 d 1 n 1351 is also in line with process performance expectations for many situations why not taking further advantage of these facts by increasing our research efforts towards the development of low intensity and robust bes technological solutions for oxidation of wastewater organic load at low cost for this the absence of separators and the use of cheap recyclable carbon based materials for process components such as electrodes are of outmost importance the effectiveness of these options being also clearly supported by our quantitative literature analysis beside mfc or mec process configurations electromicrobial snorkels consisting just of a conductive material placed along the redox gradient for short circuiting bioanode and biocathode also appears as an attractive low cost option deserving an intensification of research efforts erable et al 2011 on the other hand harvesting wastewater chemical energy under the form of electricity that could be directly used in the case of mfc or reinvested to contribute to the catalysis of endergonic reactions in the case of mec remains a highly desirable research target our study also outlines that it remains the most challenging aspect for future development it also constitutes a clear call to the research community to more deeply explore and document the reasons underlying the observed low columbic efficiencies results suggest several potential approaches that could benefit from future research to achieve higher coulombic efficiencies first it appeared that some extreme conditions such as high salinity 10 2 s cm 1 and thermophilic temperatures 45 c could help improve coulombic efficiencies increasing salinity and temperature may not be a practical solution in most operational configurations yet obtaining more insight into this aspect may prove useful in certain cases such as brine treatment another potential improvement would be to increase the surface to volume ratio in bes so that a greater fraction of the anodic working volume is actually electrochemically active for now the median surface to volume ratio for pilots larger than 10 l is 8 2 m2 m 3 which leaves room for further optimization even though this issue might be one of the most challenging aspects of bes scale up in order to increase coulombic efficiency efforts should also be made to limit undesirable side reactions methanogenesis is likely the main competing process during anaerobic bioelectrochemical wastewater treatment consequently it could be useful to try and limit the use of anaerobic sludge as anodic inoculum which is still the most common one 48 of the observations in 2019 furthermore establishing the anodic biofilm in mec mode i e with an applied voltage of anodic potential during a short less than one week maturation phase before mfc operation may be a way to promote the development of electrogenic microbes instead of methanogens this inoculation strategy still needs to be validated through additional experiments finally the choice of the separator between the anodic and cathodic compartment is also likely to impact coulombic efficiency this choice may vary in each specific case yet the use of pem appears to be quite common 19 of the observations in 2019 but should be avoided due to its negative effect on coulombic efficiencies to sum up our study highlights that anodic treatment of most types of organic wastewater constitutes a viable technological option bes technologies have today the potential to become a sound industrial reality in contexts where energy savings for wastewater treatment is the main objective for that increased research and demonstration efforts at higher scale with robust and low maintenance process designs using low cost technological components are required in addition to process performances analysis such demonstrations should also include environmental and economical evaluation of associated capital and operational expenditures to determine if the right balance has been struck in a longer perspective using anodic wastewater oxidation to leverage the chemical energy of wastewater remains a highly desirable target in the framework of the development of a sustainable bioeconomy our study also clearly outlines that important opportunities for improvement exists in that direction achieving this objective might however require more technologically intensive processes associated to higher capital costs such designs would therefore need to be backed up by clearly documented environmental benefits and sustained by appropriate economical value chains beyond technology development many other factors should therefore be considered including the evolution of public policy making decisions to resolve under which circumstances this technological promise could become a true economically and environmentally sound reality author contributions f f and v l conceived the meta analysis carried out its successive steps selection of articles data

16187,wastewater treatment is generally performed using energy intensive processes such as activated sludge improving energy efficiency has become one of the main challenges for next generation wastewater treatment plants bioelectrochemical systems bes have been attracting attention because they take advantage of the chemical energy contained in wastewater while enabling the valorization of effluents either with electrical energy microbial fuel cells or with useful chemicals microbial electrolysis cells bioelectrochemical wastewater treatment has been under investigation since the early 2000s and is now the subject of an abundant literature which is most frequently focused on anodic cod removal comparing results obtained in different studies is particularly difficult with bes because many different parameters effluent characteristics inoculation design and operation may interact and because using real effluents results in high variability to address this issue data were retrieved from 1 073 articles that were selected objectively and with transparency this systematic review evaluates the potential of anodic wastewater treatment based on 4 579 experimental observations overall bes has already shown satisfactory treatment capacity with a median chemical oxygen demand removal of 72 however the median coulombic efficiency was only 18 increasing this parameter offers the greatest opportunity for bes improvement graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial electrochemical systems meta analysis anodic treatment scale up performance 1 introduction wastewater treatment consists in the removal of pollutants from sewage in a series of physical chemical and biological treatment processes before water is released back into the environment since wastewater treatment contributes to preserving the quality of natural water bodies it plays a key role in several contemporary challenges such as the protection of wildlife habitats and of human health presently wastewater treatment is globally mature and well established but it suffers from high energy intensity in the us and in europe wastewater treatment may account for 0 7 to 5 of the national electric energy consumption maktabifard et al 2018 within wastewater treatment plants wwtps secondary i e biological treatment generally has a particularly high demand in energy activated sludge is the dominant technology used for this step it relies on the aerobic degradation of dissolved organic matter by endogenous microorganisms and it plays a major role in the fulfillment of discharge standards especially regarding chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod and nitrogen removal tank oxygenation is performed by a combination of air injection and stirring which may represent over half of the total energy consumption of the wwtp maktabifard et al 2018 mccarty et al 2011 decreasing this energy demand constitutes one of the challenges for greener next generation wwtps using an anaerobic process instead of or complementarily to activated sludge could not only remove the aeration energy need but it could also help taking advantage of the chemical potential energy contained in wastewater gude 2018 li and yu 2016 mccarty et al 2011 in particular bioelectrochemical systems bess are a promising solution for reaching this objective a bes is composed of one or more compartments that may be separated from one another by membranes bess are essentially electrochemical processes in which at least one of the reactions is catalyzed by microorganisms that can exchange electrons with solid electrodes an oxidation reaction takes place at the anode and electrons are released into an external electrical circuit in which they circulate until they reach the cathode at the cathode electrons are consumed in a reduction reaction finally due to the electromotive force charged molecules anions or cations migrate from one electrode to the other thus ensuring the electroneutrality of the system when microbes catalyze the oxidation reaction at the anode they are called electrogens conversely when microbes catalyze the reduction reaction they are called electrotrophs logan and rabaey 2012 in the case of anodic wastewater treatment the effluent is treated by electrogens on the anodic side the anode is thus a bioanode the cathode however can be either biotic or abiotic he and angenent 2006 two main categories of bes exist schröder et al 2015 if the reactions are spontaneous useful electrical energy can be harnessed and the bes is called a microbial fuel cell mfc if the reactions are nonspontaneous power must be applied and the bes is called a microbial electrolysis cell mec mecs are typically used to produce h2 or to perform electrosynthesis at the cathode when ion exchange membranes are used to separate the anodic and cathodic compartments ions of interest e g nh4 carboxylates can advantageously be concentrated on one of the sides or in an additional concentration chamber an abundant and diverse scientific literature has already been published on anodic wastewater treatment 3000 articles since 2000 this highlights the fact that despite being relatively recent this technology is rapidly developing after two decades of profuse literature now seems to be the appropriate time to reflect on the maturity and on the future outlook of this technology what is the potential of bes for wastewater treatment and what are the most efficient operational conditions this is a fundamental question that has to be answered before considering its practical implementation this question covers different aspects of bes i e wastewater characteristics reactor and anodic design and biofilm establishment however due to the wide variety of experimental setups and the lack of homogeneity in the way results are reported comparing studies is still quite challenging despite valuable proposals on how to achieve homogenization logan et al 2006 schröder et al 2015 to tackle this issue we conducted a systematic literature review to evaluate the feasibility of bioelectrochemical wastewater treatment indeed the systematic review methodology implies an exhaustive and reproducible literature search as well as a qualitative and quantitative analysis xiao and watson 2019 although biases may be introduced because the different parameters are not independently investigated from one another the key asset of this methodology is to gather a large set of data that allows to identify global trends and make general conclusions with this approach it is possible to make the most out of the great number of studies with numerous different experimental setups which could not be compared otherwise in more limited datasets due to the many varying factors of course the downside is that it is however difficult to study each specific factor in detail the present review gathers data from the past two decades of literature on anodic wastewater treatment and aims at providing a global view on this technology its key parameters and the performances achieved so far this work is also the opportunity to drive the discussion forward on how experimental parameters and results are generally reported in the literature and to make suggestions for improvement 2 material and methods fig 1 is a schematic summary of the methodology used for the systematic literature review 2 1 scoping in order to guarantee a comprehensive and objective review of the topic the systematic review methodology was applied xiao and watson 2019 first the scope of the study was refined by the formulation of four research questions i what are the effects of the wastewater characteristics on the treatment capability of the bes and on its electrochemical performance ii which strategy for anodic biofilm establishment guarantees the best long term performance both in terms of wastewater treatment and of electrochemical operation iii how does the anodic configuration affect the development and the activity of the biofilm iv which are the best suited operational conditions for both wastewater treatment and electrochemical operation at large scale 2 2 article search and selection based on these research questions two distinct search queries were defined in order to retrieve all scientific papers dealing with anodic wastewater treatment table s1 these search queries were refined with the addition of exclusion key words table s2 for setting aside papers considering either expensive electrodes e g gold electrode genetically modified microbes eukaryotic organisms removal of specific compounds e g heavy metals azo dye and specific types of bess enzymatic and photo bes articles were searched for using the final queries in the scopus elsevier bibliographical database the search was done in november 2019 and new articles were not added after that while articles that were already in press for 2020 were kept this resulted in the selection of 1895 articles as a control 28 key articles of the field were identified beforehand independently from the queries table s3 all 28 articles were present in the scopus queries results thus indicating that no major article was missed during the initial query and through filtering finally the complete set of articles was manually filtered in order to remove the remaining out of scope papers as well as reviews papers dealing with pure cultures rather than mixed microbial consortia were also manually filtered the final set contained 1073 articles 2 3 database constitution whenever possible the value of key variables describing the different aspects of a bes were retrieved from each of these articles in short these variables can be separated into five main categories wastewater characteristics anodic design pilot design process operation and performance of the bes a complete list of the variables is available in table s4 where applicable values were calculated based on the information given in the article reporting errors may occur during manual data collection so a data check was carried out first outliers i e values farther than two times the standard error from the mean for each numerical variable were double checked and corrected if applicable secondly a multivariate outlier detection was carried out using the isolation forest algorithm liu et al 2012 as implemented by the function isolationforest from package solitude r 3 6 0 software r core team this algorithm separates each multivariate observation from the others using decision trees and random cutoffs an observation is considered as an anomaly if the decision tree is short i e if its separation required only a few steps however isolation forest can only be applied to a complete database without missing data which was not the case of the present database in order to make up for missing data in isolation forests missing values were randomly generated from a normal distribution that was established for each variable using its mean and standard error 2 4 statistical analysis cod removal and coulombic efficiency medians were compared for different groups e g categories of effluents inoculum using the non parametric kruskal wallis one way anova when more than two groups were compared and if a significant difference p 0 05 was found the multiple comparison dunn test was used as post hoc test in order to determine which medians were different from one another p values of the dunn test were corrected for multiple testing using the holm method both tests were carried out in the r 3 6 0 software using respectively the base function kruskal test and the dunn test function from package dunn test 3 description of the database the final bibliographical database included 4579 experimental observations extracted from a total of 1073 articles dealing with bioelectrochemical wastewater treatment and dating from 2003 to 2020 the number of annual publications on the subject has steadily increased in that period fig 2 a which denotes the potential anticipated by the scientific community for this technology the analysis of this substantial set of articles should provide insight on the real capability of bess to treat wastewater that can be reasonably expected one of the first concerns might be on the maturity of the technology in addition to being abundant has the published work studied real life conditions or is it still a laboratory curiosity fig 2 a shows that from the beginning real wastewater treatment has been under investigation in bess its share has regularly increased over the years up to the point where more than half of the studies now focus on real effluents rather than on synthetic effluents in the early years 2003 2010 the anodic working volumes were typically comprised between a few tens of milliliters and a few liters at most fig 2 b since then efforts have been put into scale up and the cubic meter scale is now reached in a few instances cusick et al 2011 liu et al 2017 valladares linares et al 2019 wang et al 2017 meanwhile miniaturization was also recently achieved with anodic volumes lower than 1 ml mateo et al 2019 which is also a sign of better technology understanding and control this shows that bioelectrochemical wastewater treatment is indeed getting more mature and that the present bibliographical database constitutes a relevant basis for evaluating this technology another important concern arises when considering the joint analysis of a substantial set of articles is the desired information documented in a sufficient number of articles is it reported in a homogeneous format that allows its analysis categorical variables e g type of wastewater type of inoculum could be determined unambiguously for almost all observations fig 3 regarding numerical i e quantitative variables results are more mixed total cod was given for almost all observations but other key parameters were less often found fig 3 total cod is a critical parameter for anodic wastewater treatment it represents the pollutant load to be treated so its removal must be monitored it also serves as electron source for the electrochemical process not knowing the value of other critical parameters for the functioning of bess makes the interpretation of the results and their extrapolation more difficult in particular in order to extrapolate the capacity of a bes to treat wastewater parameters such as ph ionic conductivity and temperature should be taken into account which was not always the case soluble cod was available for 60 of the observations but 87 of these observations corresponded to experiments with a synthetic medium in that case soluble and total cod are equal so no additional information is brought by soluble cod temperature was reasonably available yet it should be noted that numerous studies only indicated that the experiments were carried out at room temperature without any further information on approximate values nor on estimated variability range day night seasons in these cases temperature could not be taken into account the availability of ionic conductivity was curiously low which may show that ion transport is often a neglected aspect of bess of course in wastewater treatment conductivity is not defined by the operator but rather imposed by the influent which generally has a conductivity around 1 ms cm 1 yet reporting this parameter more consistently even for synthetic effluents could help to evidence limitations or strength of a given bes regarding ion transport oliot et al 2016 furthermore 177 articles from the selected set reported characterization of the microbial community through sequencing analysis however data files were found in online databases for only 24 articles it is thus recommended that accession numbers for the nucleotide sequences are systematically provided when a microbial community is characterized in a bes this would facilitate large scale meta analyses and advance our understanding of the dynamics and interactions within electroactive communities furthermore the actual anodic working volume was given for 72 of the observations for the remaining observations the total geometric anodic volume was however available in these cases the working was estimated as representing 90 of the total volume this 90 ratio was the median ratio that was found for all observations were both working and total volumes were given by doing so the anodic volume could be analyzed for 96 of the observations depending on its objective a given study may focus more on one aspect or the other wastewater treatment or electrochemical kinetics for instance this could explain why no performance indicator was systematically reported fig 3 it should be noted that the scientific community seems to have come to a consensus on which are the key performance indicators and on how to calculate them which facilitates inter studies comparisons many authors use the tools proposed by logan et al 2006 at the beginning of mfc development yet a good publishing practice should be to always report all indicators for example a study focusing on treatment capacity should report coulombic efficiency and current density in addition to cod removal in order to help the technology development by others furthermore wastewater treatment is almost always taken from the perspective of cod removal while other aspects are rarely studied or rarely reported at least the articles included in the study were searched for by using generic terms like treatment purification sanitation table s2 only studies focused on the removal of specific compounds metals antibiotics were specifically excluded in particular anodic removal efficiencies of total suspended solids tss n and p were actively searched for during the data collection phase yet they were only available for 1 to 3 of the observations in light of this wastewater treatment is only considered in terms of cod removal in subsequent analyses the fact that these aspects were not given more attention over the past two decades in the literature may suggest that there in a consensus on anodic wastewater treatment not being expected to adequately treat other parameters than cod at the anode a key asset of anaerobic wastewater treatment technologies is their capacity to serve multiple purposes at once wastewater is not considered anymore as a sole waste but also as a resource for energy production li and yu 2016 mccarty et al 2011 in the case of bioelectrochemical wastewater treatment different waste valorization strategies may be considered notably depending on the type of bes mfc or mec the primary focus of the articles is often on valorization while wastewater treatment is a secondary objective electrical energy production is the primary objective for 84 of the observations most of these studies deal with mfcs which aim at harvesting useful energy from the electrogenic activity of the anodic microbes in a few cases 1 the energy being produced is not harvested for external use in an electrical circuit instead the aim is to take advantage of the electrochemical gradient that is thus created it is notably the case in microbial desalination cells mdcs perazzoli et al 2018 sophia and bhalambaal 2015 and in bess performing electrodialysis zhang and angelidaki 2015 in the remaining 16 observations power was supplied to the bes instead of being produced in order to perform electrosynthesis or to provide other types of services such as ammonium recovery or denitrification in that case the cathode may be either abiotic or biotic depending on the specificities of each process a majority of mecs observations were producing energy carriers in the form of dihydrogen 73 chacón carrera et al 2019 gil carrera et al 2013 tartakovsky et al 2011 methane 14 virdis et al 2009 zeppilli et al 2015 or a mix of them 4 tenca et al 2013 zeppilli et al 2019 only a few studies aimed at the production of other chemical commodities such as acetic acid desmond le quéméner et al 2019 however it should be noted that the present study is focused on anodic wastewater treatment strategies so mec papers using abiotic anodes were not included based on these papers it can be inferred that target products could notably include a variety of other organic acids butyric acid caproic acid prévoteau et al 2020 4 overall performance of anodic wastewater treatment several key performance indicators were chosen before data collection in order to examine the various dimensions of bioelectrochemical wastewater treatment namely i wastewater treatment cod removal ii conversion efficiency coulombic efficiency and iii electrochemical kinetics current power density all experiments combined it can be observed that bess can achieve high and satisfactory cod removal with half of the experiments exceeding 72 of removal fig 4 a this confirms that globally bess constitute a relevant technology for treating wastewater provided adequate optimization is carried out for each specific case it should be possible to reach discharge standards on the contrary coulombic efficiencies are strikingly low half of the experiments did not exceed a coulombic efficiency of 18 fig 4 a this means that current generation generally accounts for only a fraction of cod removal and that non electrochemical reactions e g methane production o2 respiration impair the electro chemical performances when strictly considering wastewater treatment it might not matter whether cod is removed electrochemically or not however the energy production of mfcs and the cathodic valorization of mecs could be dramatically restrained anaerobic digestion occurring in the anodic compartment is a likely explanation for coulombic efficiencies being so low if no precaution is taken to ensure strict anaerobiosis in the anolyte it is also probable that cod is partly aerobically removed this would typically take place in small scale pilots using o2 as electron acceptor at the cathode o2 could diffuse into the anodic compartment dissolved o2 in wastewater could also contribute to aerobic cod removal injecting another gas e g n2 ar in the anodic compartment is one possible way to avoid this aerobic cod degradation and to better understand bioelectrochemical removal of cod however this solution only applies to small scale research its full scale implementation would not be practical and would defeat the purpose of anaerobic wastewater treatment alternatively it was recently shown that thick biofilms 40 µm of the model species geobacter sulfurreducens had greater oxygen tolerance than thinner biofilms 10 µm when oxygen was introduced in each experiment the relative decrease in the electron harvest was smaller with thick biofilms speers and reguera 2021 maintaining thick biofilms could be a possible way to limit aerobic cod oxidation in scaled up bes even if a balance will have to be found with substrate transfer limitation phenomena furthermore any part of the process that is susceptible to be limiting may contribute to the low coulombic efficiencies in particular this indicator is also likely impaired due to important limitations by the cathodic reaction if the cathodic kinetic is limiting the anode cannot be used as an electron sink only a fraction of the electrons released by cod oxidation are actually channeled into it in order to assess the reality of this limitation the median coulombic efficiencies can be compared for mecs versus mfcs indeed mecs are less likely to be kinetically limited by the cathodic reaction when a voltage is applied using a power source or a potentiostat is used to apply the anodic potential a voltage was applied for 64 of mecs while 24 had the anodic potential controlled the remaining observations did not specify analysis shows that indeed mecs do have a significantly greater coulombic efficiency median compared to mfcs 33 versus 15 respectively p value 0 001 this comparison highlights that cathodic reactions may constitute a limitation for wastewater treatment in mfcs as reviewed by rismani yazdi et al 2008 several factors may contribute to performance loss at the cathode such as cathodic overpotentials activation losses ohmic limitations or mass transport limitations yet the 33 median coulombic efficiency for mecs remains quite limited so important limitations are also due to other factors generally speaking low coulombic efficiencies prove that there are alternative electron acceptors in the medium other than the anode irrespective to potential kinetic limitations for the mass balance principle to be respected electrons have to be channeled to acceptors the electron acceptor being used should be the most energetically favorable for example if o2 is present it likely is the preferential acceptor thus decreasing coulombic efficiencies in the case of a perfect anaerobiosis no traces of o2 electrons are expected to be channeled to the anode yet limiting factors e g cathode reaction ionic transport might arise that makes the anode less competitive and favors electron acceptors that would be less energetically advantageous otherwise such as co2 throughout the literature coulombic efficiencies are thus likely affected by a combination of alternative electron acceptors and electrochemical bottlenecks kinetic indicators i e current and power densities are harder to discuss because of bias in the way they are reported first it is not completely equivalent to compare maximal densities of non continuous experiments to steady state densities of continuous experiments furthermore even though the current was normalized by the anodic area instead of cathodic or membrane areas in almost all studies this normalization still introduces a bias all authors do not use the same method for calculating the anodic area for example for a plane anode some authors may consider only one side and others both sides in the present study this factor was corrected by always using the same formula for a given anodic geometry table s4 still depending on the anodic geometry the projected area might be more or less close to the real area for instance the projected area of a plane anode is expected to be closer to reality than the one of a brush anode when the equivalent cylinder is considered for projection consequently comparing current or power densities for different anodic geometries remains questionable that being said fig 4 b shows that current densities may vary within a large range from virtually no current to a few dozen of amperes per square meter the highest values 10 a m 2 remain relatively scarce 45 papers from 2009 to 2019 so they cannot be considered as easily achievable more typically values are comprised in a narrower range 50 of current density values fall between 0 085 and 1 3 a m 2 most studies 84 deal with mfcs which aim at harvesting useful energy from the electrogenic activity of the anodic microbes the best power densities ranged from 0 10 to 0 42 kw m 3 but they represented only 1 5 of all reported values more typically power densities varied from 0 0 to 0 5 10 3 kw m 3 as a comparison conventional li ion dry batteries may produce a power density of 90 kw m 3 arends and verstraete 2012 given these low values it can be expected that the use of mfcs will remain limited to niche applications that do not require high energy densities interestingly fig 4 c and d show that for all performance indicators no clear upward trend can be identified in the past decades except for a major breakthrough innovation this means that no overall increase in performance should be expected in the coming years and that the feasibility of commercial development of bess for wastewater treatment can be evaluated on the basis of the existing literature on the opposite there is no clear downward trend in performance over the years either meanwhile the scale of pilots increased steadily in the same period and so did the share of experiments using real wastewater instead of synthetic medium fig 2 this could suggest that overall the experiments are getting closer to real life operational conditions while still preserving a similar level of performance which is encouraging for future developments yet there is an important variability of the performance indicator values throughout the literature so it is necessary to carefully identify which operational choices are the most promising due to the challenges in the comparison of current densities across different studies cod removal and coulombic efficiency were the only performance indicators selected for the next sections 5 impact of wastewater characteristics on process performance 5 1 type of effluent synthetic media i e model effluents alone account for over half of the observations revealing the dominance of lab scale experiments this is consistent with fig 2 a showing that bigger scale pilots have been developed only in recent years the choice of the model substrate is dependent on the kind of effluent that the operator wants to recreate according to fig 5 a acetate is the most common one and it is typically used to emulate urban wastewater glucose as for it would be a better suited model for experiments addressing the food and drinks industry effluents for instance e g brewery wastewater the predominance of acetate within synthetic media 61 of synthetic media experiments may indicate that research efforts are leaning towards the treatment of urban wastewater rather than other kinds of effluents another explanation might be that acetate is a well known carbon source for the model electroactive microbe geobacter sulfurreducens which is frequently found in anodic biofilms koch and harnisch 2016 lovley et al 2011 indeed fig 5 b shows that tcod levels in synthetic media seem closer to and thus more representative of levels observed in urban wastewaters other categories of effluents listed on fig 5 are all real life effluents originating from various sources urban wastewater he et al 2016 liu and logan 2004 pandit et al 2014 food industry brewery dairy plants cecconet et al 2018 feng et al 2008 other industries paper industries petroleum refineries ketep et al 2013 srikanth et al 2016 dark fermentations etc experiments using these effluents as anolytes can be regarded as more representative of operational conditions as opposed to synthetic media which dismiss all issues due to the complexity of the effluent in particular urban wastewater is the most frequent real life effluent being tested 14 of all observations this reinforces the previous statement as far as the scientific literature is concerned bess seem particularly interesting in the case of urban wastewater treatment a more intense research effort on the topic could also be the sign of urban wastewater being the most challenging effluent to treat in a bes in fact urban wastewater is the effluent containing the lowest level of tcod fig 5 b so it is questionable whether a substantial biofilm growth and sustainable electrochemical performances can be supported as a first approach the distribution of the two key performance indicators can be compared for the different categories of effluents fig 5 c and d as it could be expected experiments with synthetic media achieved higher performance levels compared to the other effluents the median cod removal and coulombic efficiency were respectively 78 and 23 for synthetic media compared to 68 and 13 for all real effluents combined this difference could be explained by the easily accessible and biodegradable cod contained in synthetic media in addition these media are less complex and may not contain specific pollutants that interfere with the development of an efficient electroactive biofilm synthetic media might also be associated with small scale experiments in controlled conditions which could constitute a bias in this observation despite the relatively low levels of cod in urban wastewater fig 5 b it appears that bess can achieve satisfactory cod removal fig 5 c however cod removal for urban wastewater median 68 seemed slightly lower compared to simpler or more concentrated effluents such as synthetic media median 78 or food industry wastewater median 75 a possible explanation is that because cod levels in urban wastewater are lower the irreducible non biodegradable part might represent a larger portion of it among bess treating real effluents it seems that those using food industry effluents achieve the closest performances to those using synthetic wastewater the two most frequent sub categories of food industry wastewater were dairy wastewater 29 and brewery wastewater 19 they both contain high levels of cod fig 5 b which is expectedly mainly in the form of readily available carbohydrates such as lactose and glucose respectively an important additional aspect is that these effluents are typically treated at higher temperatures than urban wastewater in real life conditions between 17 and 25 c for dairy wastewater between 18 and 45 c for brewery wastewater compared to a range of 10 to 20 c for urban wastewater slavov 2017 werkneh et al 2019 higher treatment temperatures can result in quicker and more efficient biodegradation of the pollutants in the literature for bess the average temperature for food industry effluents is 28 6 c while it is 25 5 c for urban wastewater even though this difference was significant wilcoxon test p 0 001 it could be too tenuous to explain the observed differences in performance however it should be noted that in the literature urban wastewater is generally treated at a higher temperature 25 5 c than in real life conditions between 10 and 20 c this constitutes a possible bias for the extrapolation of bes performance from lab scale to industrial scale experiments regarding bes used to treat other industrial wastewater it might come as a surprise that the performances should be this low compared to food industry wastewater 62 vs 75 for median cod removal and 13 vs 16 for median coulombic efficiency indeed cod levels found in food industry wastewater were approximately the same as in other industrial wastewater fig 5 b however non food industrial wastewater are likely to contain organic matter in more complex forms that are more difficult to break down the most frequent sources for industrial wastewater were the petroleum industry 26 and the paper industry 17 the former typically contains high percentages of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons 75 of petroleum hydrocarbons along with toxic compounds such as phenols or heavy metals varjani et al 2020 as for it paper industry wastewater is notably composed of complex polymers extracted from the pulp and paper the most prominent being lignin and cellulose toczyłowska mamińska 2017 the complexity and potential toxicity of these effluents are the most likely explanations for the lower performances observed in bess finally bess treating non food fermentation effluents showed the lowest cod removal median 52 but the highest coulombic efficiencies median 27 fig 5 this category of wastewater groups together a diversity of effluents produced by bioprocesses such as dark fermentation effluents 38 anaerobic digestion effluents 26 and fermentation effluents 26 these effluents having already undergone a biological transformation their volatile fatty acids vfa levels should be relatively high so it was not expected that cod removal rates would be that low compared to other effluents however fewer observations were available in the literature for this category of effluents as compared to others and the dispersion of the results is higher therefore the performances observed might actually reflect the influence of other parameters e g inoculum temperature residence time etc this last comment also applies to coulombic efficiencies of non food fermentation effluents when using anaerobic digestion effluent as anolyte methanogens are likely to be enriched while they do contribute to cod removal they are less likely to participate in current generation thus impairing the coulombic efficiency 5 2 total chemical oxygen demand no significant difference in cod removal nor in coulombic efficiency appeared for cod levels up to 10 000 mgo2 l 1 while concentrations above this threshold seemed detrimental to the performances median cod removal varied between 68 and 75 for cod concentrations below 10 000 mgo2 l 1 while the median was only 60 above this threshold below this threshold median coulombic efficiency ranged between 17 and 21 while above the threshold it decreased to 14 fig 6 a and b this suggests that bess might not be suitable for the treatment of very concentrated effluents in light of this a functioning range for bess appears to be from 100 to 10 000 mgo2 l 1 this range is in accordance with the typical cod content of all main categories of effluent fig 5 b so it is not expected that cod levels should be a major concern for the development of bess coulombic efficiencies were found lower for the highest cod levels in the effluent while no significant differences were identified for cod from 0 to 10 000 mgo2 l 1 this suggests that for the highest organic loads the bioelectrochemical share of microbial activity decreased and the side reactions e g methanogenesis were more important if o2 contamination in anodes were the main reason for coulombic efficiencies being so low throughout the literature low cod contents should have tallied with lower coulombic efficiencies so the main cause for that likely lies elsewhere 5 3 ph both cod removal rates and coulombic efficiencies were found significantly higher in the circumneutral ph domain 6 5 7 5 fig 6 c and d the median cod removal for circumneutral ph was 72 compared to 57 for acidic ph and 63 for alkaline ph the median coulombic efficiency was 19 around ph 7 but 14 in acidic conditions and 11 in alkaline conditions this result could be expected since a ph around 7 is commonly considered in the literature as optimum for anodic microbial activity and extreme conditions are tested less often dopson et al 2016 patil et al 2011 this is also reflected in the fact most of the experiments are carried out in this range of values 62 of the observations with a known ph value were comprised between 6 5 and 7 5 most effluents had ph values typically in the circumneutral domain so the ph of the treated effluent is not expected to be a major issue in the development of bess for wastewater treatment two exceptions were however identified urine with an average ph 8 1 1 4 n 27 and landfill leachate with an average ph 7 6 1 0 n 42 furthermore even though the ph in the effluent might not be an issue in most cases attention must be paid on the ph evolution in the anolyte over time anodic oxidation reactions tend to acidify the medium due to proton release 5 4 ionic conductivity no significant difference in cod removal could be evidenced according to ionic conductivities fig 6 e and f the range of 1 to 10 ms cm 1 is the most frequently tested condition this is consistent with the fact that this range of values corresponds to the typical conductivities found in effluents and to the most appropriate conditions for microbial activity indeed higher conductivities indicate highly saline environments in which only halophilic organisms may thrive as a comparison sea water conductivity may vary from 10 to 60 ms cm 1 tyler et al 2017 only two categories of effluents were found with an average conductivity exceeding 10 ms cm 1 urine with an average conductivity of 30 9 7 0 ms cm 1 n 15 and landfill leachate with 25 3 13 9 ms cm 1 n 24 among food industry effluents high conductivities may also be found in specific cases for example brines from the olive industry had a conductivity of 77 2 17 0 ms cm 1 n 6 yet conductivity values from the literature were too scarce and getting an accurate picture of the typical conductivities of each effluent is questionable it seems quite surprising that only 15 of all observations would report the conductivity of the effluent this parameter can be conveniently measured with adequate probes and it is a good indicator of the ion transport capacity of the wastewater kinetics of electrochemical reactions are dependent on the ion transport in the electrolyte oliot et al 2016 conductivities under 10 ms cm 1 are likely to be rate limiting for electrochemical cod removal low ionic conductivities were already identified as a major hurdle in the development of bess as compared to abiotic electrochemical processes where electrolytes commonly have conductivities of several hundreds of ms cm 1 oliot et al 2016 unsurprisingly higher conductivities over 10 ms cm 1 were associated with higher coulombic efficiency with a median value of 25 while the median ranged between 15 and 18 with lower conductivities fig 6 f furthermore generally low anodic conductivities may be an explanation to the globally low coulombic efficiencies throughout the literature given the results presented here increasing the conductivity e g by adding salts might be a way of increasing coulombic efficiencies by preventing ion transport limitation with no expected difference in treatment capacity however this strategy cannot be used for the treatment of large volumes of wastewater like urban wastewater 5 5 temperature at thermophilic temperatures cod removal was found to be slightly lower than at mesophilic temperatures 61 vs 72 but the difference was not significant fig 6 g again intermediate conditions i e mesophilic temperatures are optimal for a greater variety of microorganisms as compared to extreme conditions and this is likely to explain why cod removal was the highest between 20 and 45 c however it is remarkable that no significant difference could be evidenced between psychrophilic and mesophilic conditions this suggests that anodic treatment of effluents could be performed at ambient temperature this property constitutes a real asset for the implementation of bess for urban wastewater treatment in temperate countries where temperatures are often comprised between 10 and 20 c despite the decrease of cod removal for thermophilic temperatures it is noteworthy that coulombic efficiencies increased in these conditions fig 6 h this might be attributed to higher anodic reaction kinetics or quicker ion transport yet experiments in thermophilic conditions were very few 25 in total and further evidence is still required to substantiate this observation if thermophilic temperatures correlate with higher coulombic efficiencies indeed temperature would appear as a means of favoring electroactive microorganisms and of reducing non electrogenic side reactions however heating effluents would require expensive amount of energy and it seems impractical at a full industrial scale for effluents such as urban wastewater 5 6 wastewater feeding strategy three main strategies for anodic wastewater supply were identified from the literature batch semi continuous repeated batch and continuous operation batch feeding represented 23 of the observations while semi continuous and continuous feedings represented 33 and 43 respectively for batch and semi continuous feedings cod removal medians 76 were found significantly greater p value 0 001 than for continuous operation 68 see fig 7 for batch and repeated batch common criteria for stopping the experiment were current decrease or voltage drop for mfcs in any case it means that the experiment is carried out until cod is almost fully depleted which introduces a bias when comparing to continuous operation experiments regarding coulombic efficiencies it appeared that semi continuous experiments had a significantly higher median 23 versus 17 and 15 for batch and continuous operation respectively p value 0 001 see fig 7 this observation could be explained by an adaptation of the anodic biofilm over the successive batch cycles which would progressively enrich the biofilm in electroactive species that would be favored by the presence of the anode on the other hand the difference in medians between batch and continuous operation is quite limited 17 versus 15 despite being slightly significant p value 0 04 it could be expected that coulombic efficiencies would be higher for continuous operation since it should also allow the progressive selection of electrogens however this is likely dependent on the actual hydraulic retention times hrt and organic loading rates olr that are being applied the impact of hrt on the selection of electrogens in the biofilm is a non trivial issue on the one hand hrts should not be too short so that the biomass is not entirely washed off on the other hand applying relatively short hrts may also be an opportunity to apply a selective pressure in order to select microbes that attach to the anode when continuous operation was chosen the median olr was 1 7 kgcod m 3 d 1 n 1704 with olrs typically varying from 0 63 to 4 7 kgcod m 3 d 1 q1 q3 interquartile range correspondingly the median hrt was 12 h n 1693 and typical hrts ranged from 6 h to 1 d q1 q3 interquartile range in order to undertake a comparison with batch operation an equivalent to olr might be calculated as the initial cod concentration divided by the duration of the batch by doing so a median supply rate of 1 9 kgcod m 3 d 1 is found n 838 with typical batch duration comprised between 4 and 17 days however an equivalent olr could not be calculated for semi continuous operation experiments based on the data that were retrieved from the literature the number of cycles and their duration were not collected only the total duration of the semi continuous process was even though loading rates might be roughly equivalent overall between continuous and batch operation a batch typically benefited from a longer time to treat an equivalent amount of cod for continuous operation the median organic removal rate was 1 1 kgcod m 3 d 1 n 1351 while it was 1 4 kgcod m 3 d 1 n 586 for batch this difference despite being slight was found significant p value 0 01 however in real life conditions wastewater treatment is most likely to be operated continuously since batch operation would be impractical for low cod containing effluents such as urban wastewater furthermore for an adequate process design the time between two batches should be included in the calculation which would result in lower olrs yet batch operation remains commonly used in the literature because it is a standardized and practical setup for bench scale experiments which allows focusing on other specific factors 6 anodic configuration 6 1 most frequent anodic configuration bio electrochemical performances of bes also depend on the configuration that was chosen for the anode in particular the anodic material and geometry e g plane granular are generally recognized as important factors for example the biofilm adherence likely depends on the surface characteristics in addition the type of geometry will determine the range of surface to volume ratio fig 8 b this ratio corresponds to the ratio between the projected electrode surface and the anodic working volume the higher this ratio is the more of the working volume is occupied by electrodes and thus by the electroactive biofilm the working volume is also an influential parameter achieving high surface to volume ratios is easier in small scale reactors than in large scale pilot experiments for example fig 8 b shows that larger scale pilots 10 l have surface to volume ratios typically lower than 100 m2 m 3 while bench scale pilots 1 l achieve ratios over this threshold more commonly it is particularly striking for plane electrodes which are the most frequently used for bench scale pilots typical ratios ranged from 6 4 to 35 m2 m 3 while they typically ranged from 0 5 to 12 m2 m 3 for larger scale pilots maintaining a high surface to volume ratio is one of the important challenges that still remain for bes scale up typically brush and granular electrodes can help achieving higher surface to volume ratios due to their three dimensional structures at small scale their median ratio was 86 m2 m 3 for brushes and 106 m2 m 3 for granules however until now these configurations remain rarely tested at larger scale respectively 20 and 1 observations so the actual ratios that might be expected are still difficult to estimate based on the existing literature graphite was the most common anodic material fig 8 a representing 83 of the anodes due to its properties low cost and adequate biofilm support depending on the electrode geometry some forms of graphite were preferred mainly graphite felt graphite cloth plain graphite and graphite paper were chosen for plane electrodes representing respectively 29 24 18 and 12 of plane electrodes graphite fiber however represented 55 of brush electrodes only plain graphite was used irrespective of the geometry aside from graphite activated carbon was commonly used for granular anodes 28 of granular electrodes and stainless steel was a possible alternative for planar electrodes 6 other materials included composite electrodes modified surface electrodes biochar and metals e g iron zinc however the price of the two former may be prohibitive for scale up roubaud et al 2019 6 2 impact of the anodic configuration on the process performance fig 9 shows the bes performances according to the anodic configurations no clear trend could be identified concerning cod removal so it is difficult to determine an optimal configuration from that point of view since coulombic efficiencies are generally low in the literature cod removal may be attributed to some extent to planktonic microorganisms this could explain why the anodic configuration has no clear impact on cod removal on the opposite coulombic efficiencies vary more dramatically graphite always showed high values and was only topped by activated carbon in planar configuration this last remark however relies only on a few observations and it might be questionable overall the relevance of anode graphite is hereby confirmed 7 biofilm establishment 7 1 description of the main strategies the establishment of the anodic biofilm is a crucial phase in the implementation of a bes treating effluents the protocol for anodic inoculation should allow proper colonization of the electrode surface so that cod can be effectively removed while current is generated this implies that the conditions of maturation should allow preferential selection of electroactive microorganisms within the biofilm the term maturation phase is defined here as the phase that took place prior to the considered experiment and during which an anodic biofilm was established the diversity of strategies for the establishment of the anodic biofilm was captured in two variables notably the type of inoculum and the substrate used during the biofilm maturation the main strategies are presented on fig 10 the most frequent type of inoculum was non electrochemical anaerobic inoculum i e an anaerobic inoculum that does not stem from another bioelectrochemical system this category of inoculum mainly includes anaerobic digestion sludge 82 and sediments 6 the next categories of inoculum were real wastewater and electrochemical inoculum the latter describes an inoculum that was sampled from an on going bes wastewater inoculum means that the effluent that is treated in the bes also serves as source of microbes and that no other inoculum is added the last category of inoculum was aerobic inoculum which mostly consisted in activated sludge from wwtps 92 the choice of the inoculum is not indifferent because each inoculum will provide a microbial consortium whose composition is likely to depend on its origin for instance anaerobic digestion sludge is expected to bring a significant part of methanogens that may impair the coulombic efficiency aerobic sludge however is likely to be rich in aerobes so the selection of electroactive anaerobes in the bes may require a longer time however the conditions of inoculation substrate anodic potential residence time anaerobiosis etc in the anodic compartment may remedy these difficulties in most cases the substrate used during the maturation phase was a synthetic effluent 54 globally when a synthetic effluent was used during maturation it was generally also used afterwards during the operation phase of the bes however in some cases 11 of the observations with a synthetic effluent as maturation substrate the synthetic effluent was replaced at the end of maturation by real wastewater in other cases when wastewater was the inoculum the real wastewater was also used directly as substrate during biofilm establishment this constitutes a singular inoculation strategy only wastewater is supplied to the bes as anolyte and it serves as a source for both microorganisms and carbon this strategy may seem quite challenging because wastewater is likely less loaded with microorganisms so biofilms may take longer to form yet with this strategy the applied maturation times were not necessarily longer than all the others when a maturation time was applied it typically varied between a few days and a month in both cases around half the studies 47 when wastewater was the source of carbon and of microbes 53 in all other cases did not include a maturation phase at all meaning that observations started as soon as the inoculum was added however this strategy if proven effective enough see section 7 2 could be well adapted to industrial scale installations because of its simplicity of implementation furthermore irrespective of the type of inoculum biofilm maturation is typically carried out without a continuous feeding of effluent either in batch mode or in semi continuous mode i e in repeated batches overall semi continuous feeding alone represented 42 of the observations a single batch maturation might end up with substrate full depletion before the biofilm is mature enough so repeated batch is likely better suited for achieving successful biofilm establishment continuous feeding would be more relevant for bigger scale bess in this case the hydraulic retention time hrt could also play a role in the selection of electroactive microbes for example like methanogenic biofilm reactors short hrt could help preferentially select microbes that are able to attach to the electrode while planktonic microbes are washed out cresson et al 2008 a large fraction of the observations did not have a dedicated maturation phase at all in these cases the experiment only included an initial inoculation this can be either because the focus of the corresponding papers was precisely on the maturation phase or because the question addressed in these papers did not require a mature biofilm 7 2 impact of inoculation and maturation on process performance one of the initial concerns of the present study was to evaluate the impact of the biofilm formation stage on the long term performances of bess unfortunately it was not possible to establish a standardized indicator describing what long term is moreover a biofilm is a dynamic structure that evolves continuously so it might be questionable to attribute long term variations on the initial inoculum conditions consequently the analysis was focused on the impact of the inoculum and maturation time on cod removal and coulombic efficiency of the subsequent operation phase as observed on fig 11 all types of inocula could be associated with high cod removal anaerobic inoculum either electrochemical or non electrochemical were associated with higher cod removal when compared to wastewater or aerobic sludge the differences were slight but they might be attributed to anaerobic sludge containing microorganisms that are already well adapted to anaerobiosis regarding electrochemical inoculum electroactive microbes are likely already abundant and this must be the reason for the higher coulombic efficiency that was observed fig 11 b 18 of the observations that had a maturation phase had it carried out as mec mode instead of mfc with either the voltage or the anodic potential that was controlled mec maturation can be interesting because it may contribute to the selection of electroactive microbes in the biofilm thanks to anodic potential control yet biofilm maturation in mec mode was very rare preceding a mfc experiment it represented only 8 of the mfc experiments that included a biofilm maturation phase but 53 of the mec experiments the maturation phase in the remaining mec experiments was in mfc mode data on anodic potential during maturation was too scarce for proper analysis when evaluating the impact of the maturation phase on the subsequent operation phase one can wonder whether it is more appropriate to apply similar conditions for both phases so that the microbial community adapts to the operation conditions or to apply optimal conditions during maturation for establishing a robust biofilm even if less favorable conditions will be applied during operation interestingly for bess treating either a real or a synthetic wastewater cod removal was greater when the biofilm had been maturated directly with the final effluent as substrate 71 vs 51 for bes treating real wastewater and 93 vs 75 for bes treating synthetic wastewater fig 12 a coulombic efficiencies however were lower when the biofilm was matured with a real effluent 10 vs 13 for bes treating real wastewater and 1 vs 17 for bes treating synthetic wastewater fig 12 b the differences in coulombic efficiencies remained more limited compared to cod removal especially for bess treating real wastewater during operation where the difference was not significant this shows that in real industrial installation it is not necessarily relevant to design a maturation phase with a synthetic substrate in addition to being more efficient using the real effluent for maturation will also be easier to implement and would save costs 8 design of the bioelectrochemical reactor 8 1 shape and symmetry as previously reviewed he et al 2017 bes for wastewater treatment may come in many shapes and sizes here the variety of reactor designs was captured in two variables i its internal shape e g rectangular cylinder and ii the type of symmetry the latter represents how the anode and the cathode are positioned relatively to one another they can be on opposite sides reflection symmetry or they can be arranged in concentric layers rotational symmetry overall rectangular bes with a reflection electrode symmetry is the most frequent 40 configuration in the literature fig 13 a probably because they are the easiest to implement in most cases when a cylindrical shape was chosen the electrodes were still put in a reflection symmetry in these cases there is no fundamental difference in using one shape of the other at bench scale for example it may be considered equivalent to use a rectangular glass tank or a bottle i e a vertical cylinder it is thus interesting to look more specifically to bigger scale bioelectrochemical reactor designs fig 13 b for bes with an anodic working volume greater than 10 l rectangular shape reactors are even more frequent 59 this design allows a great modularity either by inserting electrode cassettes in a tank cotterill et al 2017 hiegemann et al 2019 or by stacking several units in a filter press mode vilajeliu pons et al 2017 wu et al 2016 similarly to bench scale experiments when a cylindrical pilot shape was chosen for bigger scale experiments it really took advantage of a rotational electrode symmetry in one third of the observations fig 13 b in these cases the pilots were mainly developed as tubular modules that may work in parallel or in series depending on how the hydraulic flow was operated this modules could be operated either as columns lu et al 2017 or as horizontal tubes ge and he 2016 unsurprisingly h shape pilots were not tested at bigger scale since they are a typical small scale 1 l design ahmed et al 2015 logan et al 2006 nikhil et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 horizontal cylinders with a reflection symmetry are also a very common small scale experimental design with a typical working volume of a few dozen of milliters guo and kim 2019 logan et al 2006 zhou et al 2019 pilot designs that typically correspond to small scale set ups may be artificially associated to greater process performance because they are easier to implement and to control this is a likely explanation for the distributions of the performance indicators shown on fig 13 c d in particular for the higher results obtained with horizontal cylinders both for cod removal and coulombic efficiency or with h shape reactors for coulombic efficiency 8 2 type of membrane an important part of the reactor design lies in the selection of the type of separation between the anodic chamber and the other chambers it depends greatly on the intended purpose of the bes being designed be it electrical energy production electrosynthesis desalination overall in just over half the cases 51 at least one ion exchange membrane was used while in one third of the experiments there was no separation between the electrodes fig 14 a membrane less bes may be easier and cheaper to implement but they can only be used when there is no need for physical separation between chambers for product recovery for example proton exchange membranes pem and cation exchange membranes cem were the most common membranes respectively 24 and 21 of all observations but more rarely in 4 of the observations anion exchange membranes aem could also be used in microbial desalination cells mdcs a combination of aems and cems is used in order to concentrate the salts in intermediary chambers ebrahimi et al 2018 perazzoli et al 2018 results shown on fig 14 b c are globally consistent with the comparison previously published by oliot et al 2016 pems were expected to be detrimental to mfcs because proton transport contributes very little to ion transport at the typical circumneutral ph of mfcs and indeed pems seem to be associated with lower performance indicators for instance the median cod removal with a pem was 68 versus 75 and 73 respectively for bes with no membrane or with a cem the median coulombic efficiency was 14 with a pem compared to 23 and 19 with no membrane or with a cem fig 14 b c in addition compared to cems aems are expected to minimize the resistance to the ph balance role of the buffering phosphates species h2po4 and hpo4 2 between the two compartments oliot et al 2016 this may explain why coulombic efficiencies seem higher with aems fig 14 c yet the advantage of aems over cems does not hold regarding cod removal fig 14 b 8 3 pilot scale reactors despite bes scale up being progressively achieved the number of pilot studies remains very limited fig 2 even the definition of a pilot scale study is a non trivial issue as explained by wang and he 2020 in addition to the working volume several other criteria should be met for a reactor to be considered an actual pilot reactor such as the hydraulic flow the use of real wastewater the duration of the experiment and its location laboratory or on site here only 206 observations 4 5 corresponded to an anodic working volume greater than 10 l and only 33 observations 0 7 to a working volume greater than 100 l among pilots exceeding 10 l only 64 used real wastewater the most frequent real effluents that were used are urban wastewater 43 and food industry effluents 7 8 in total there were 102 observations that corresponded to a large scale experiment 10 l using a real effluent that was fed continuously this represents only a small fraction of all observations 2 2 but these experiments are the closest to field conditions the actual potential of anodic wastewater treatment may thus be evaluated based on these experiments even though bes scale up is still under investigation and further optimization is to be expected these observations typically lasted between 15 and 70 days and the applied hrts typically ranged from 0 35 to 1 8 d corresponding to organic loading rates between 0 38 and 2 1 kgcod m 3 d 1 q1 q3 interquartile ranges the median cod removal was 72 n 94 and the median coulombic efficiency was 6 5 n 39 it appears that the cod removal median is the same for pilot scale observations than for the overall dataset so the organic matter treatment capacity is well maintained however coulombic efficiencies are even lower than for the global dataset here again this shows that the anodic side is likely not the limiting aspect of the global bes functioning and that challenges for scale up mainly lie in improving other limiting aspects such as cathodic reactions are mass transport phenomena 9 conclusions and outlook bioelectrochemical reactors offer a technological means to harvest the energy content of wastewater during its treatment they have therefore a huge potential for drastic reduction of energy consumption associated to wastewater treatment and have attracted tremendous attention becoming the focus of extensive research during the last two decades even though the technology is still not mature it has now reached a crossroads our analysis indeed shows that an increasing number of studies have been challenging bes technologies with more realistic real life conditions over the recent years process scale up has now been under investigation for several years and the share of real effluents in the experiments now represents more than half the observations fig 2 in order to infer successful technology development paths it is therefore the right time to refine our assessment and to ask which lessons can be learned from two decades of extensive research on of anodic wastewater treatment in bioelectrochemical reactors the present review involved the systematic and quantitative analysis of the abundant literature on the subject a total of 4579 observations were retrieved from 1073 articles published between 2002 and 2020 at first it should be pointed out that the values of some key parameters e g ionic conductivity temperature nitrogen and phosphorus contents were seldom reported in the studies this observation is especially true for real effluents compared to synthetic effluents which may be paradoxical since real effluents have more complex compositions that vary over time and in space in addition quantitative analyses were further limited by the difficult homogenization of other key parameters such as current densities in the present study we used a unique and homogeneous formula for renormalization of each parameter on a common basis yet some bias might still remain due to differences in the design or operating techniques for future technology developments it is highly advisable for the whole scientific community to continue its effort in harmonizing the way bioelectrochemical experiments are documented logan et al 2006 schröder et al 2015 in particular all operational parameters and performance indicators should be reported quantitatively in all studies irrespective of the particular focus of a given study i e whether a study focuses on the treatment capacity on energy production or on electrolysis the authors should always report cod removal coulombic efficiency and current density this will facilitate the extrapolation of lab scale results to real operating conditions our systematic approach made however possible to consider the key parameters influencing anodic treatment and their influence on two major performance indicators coulombic efficiency and cod removal quantitative analysis provided insights into the impact of the wastewater characteristics of anodic and pilot design and of operational parameters table 1 the analysis shows that at this stage bioelectrochemical treatment appears to be appropriate for all kinds of effluents but some effluents could be more challenging than others due to low cod content or conductivities e g urban wastewater or due to toxic compounds e g industrial wastewater food industry wastewater appears to be particularly suitable for treatment in bes even though it only accounted for 10 of the observations overall the most favorable cod concentrations were around 1 go2 l 1 regarding anodic design there is a consensus in the scientific community on using carbon materials as low cost anodes on the contrary inoculation strategies are more diversified using wastewater as a source of inoculum may be more practical while using an effluent from an on going bes may increase coulombic efficiency finally although a wide range of pilot shapes and designs were characterized only a few different configurations have already been implemented at large scales 10 l and these corresponded to relatively simple designs such as parallelepipeds or cylinders with concentric compartments this underlines the fact that scale up remains a difficult task and that scalability needs to be thought through right from the early stages of the development of new bes from a more general perspective the discrepancy between cod removal rates and coulombic efficiencies revealed here is quite a compelling finding while cod removal rates are satisfactory from a treatment point of view median 72 coulombic efficiencies remain quite low median 18 this observation opens the debate on what can be the most appropriate positioning for bioelectrochemical technology on one hand indeed if treatment is the primary objective these low coulombic efficiencies may still be acceptable this suggests that optimizing the bioelectrochemical performances of the bes process might not be the only technological path to follow this possibility is further backed up by several other observations importantly cod removal performances also remain unchanged when considering larger experiments 10 l treating real effluent only n 94 in addition the median organic removal rate value for continuous processes 1 1 kgcod m 3 d 1 n 1351 is also in line with process performance expectations for many situations why not taking further advantage of these facts by increasing our research efforts towards the development of low intensity and robust bes technological solutions for oxidation of wastewater organic load at low cost for this the absence of separators and the use of cheap recyclable carbon based materials for process components such as electrodes are of outmost importance the effectiveness of these options being also clearly supported by our quantitative literature analysis beside mfc or mec process configurations electromicrobial snorkels consisting just of a conductive material placed along the redox gradient for short circuiting bioanode and biocathode also appears as an attractive low cost option deserving an intensification of research efforts erable et al 2011 on the other hand harvesting wastewater chemical energy under the form of electricity that could be directly used in the case of mfc or reinvested to contribute to the catalysis of endergonic reactions in the case of mec remains a highly desirable research target our study also outlines that it remains the most challenging aspect for future development it also constitutes a clear call to the research community to more deeply explore and document the reasons underlying the observed low columbic efficiencies results suggest several potential approaches that could benefit from future research to achieve higher coulombic efficiencies first it appeared that some extreme conditions such as high salinity 10 2 s cm 1 and thermophilic temperatures 45 c could help improve coulombic efficiencies increasing salinity and temperature may not be a practical solution in most operational configurations yet obtaining more insight into this aspect may prove useful in certain cases such as brine treatment another potential improvement would be to increase the surface to volume ratio in bes so that a greater fraction of the anodic working volume is actually electrochemically active for now the median surface to volume ratio for pilots larger than 10 l is 8 2 m2 m 3 which leaves room for further optimization even though this issue might be one of the most challenging aspects of bes scale up in order to increase coulombic efficiency efforts should also be made to limit undesirable side reactions methanogenesis is likely the main competing process during anaerobic bioelectrochemical wastewater treatment consequently it could be useful to try and limit the use of anaerobic sludge as anodic inoculum which is still the most common one 48 of the observations in 2019 furthermore establishing the anodic biofilm in mec mode i e with an applied voltage of anodic potential during a short less than one week maturation phase before mfc operation may be a way to promote the development of electrogenic microbes instead of methanogens this inoculation strategy still needs to be validated through additional experiments finally the choice of the separator between the anodic and cathodic compartment is also likely to impact coulombic efficiency this choice may vary in each specific case yet the use of pem appears to be quite common 19 of the observations in 2019 but should be avoided due to its negative effect on coulombic efficiencies to sum up our study highlights that anodic treatment of most types of organic wastewater constitutes a viable technological option bes technologies have today the potential to become a sound industrial reality in contexts where energy savings for wastewater treatment is the main objective for that increased research and demonstration efforts at higher scale with robust and low maintenance process designs using low cost technological components are required in addition to process performances analysis such demonstrations should also include environmental and economical evaluation of associated capital and operational expenditures to determine if the right balance has been struck in a longer perspective using anodic wastewater oxidation to leverage the chemical energy of wastewater remains a highly desirable target in the framework of the development of a sustainable bioeconomy our study also clearly outlines that important opportunities for improvement exists in that direction achieving this objective might however require more technologically intensive processes associated to higher capital costs such designs would therefore need to be backed up by clearly documented environmental benefits and sustained by appropriate economical value chains beyond technology development many other factors should therefore be considered including the evolution of public policy making decisions to resolve under which circumstances this technological

16188,layering of water bodies with different physico chemical properties is called stratification this physical effect is known from lakes or oceans but also occurs in flooded underground mines and has been studied in the past this review gives a summary of their investigation methods flow dynamics stratification development and breakdown furthermore the barrier effect of stratification is discussed meaning that less mineralized water bodies cf water bodies on the top are separated from higher mineralized water bodies wm water bodies in the lower parts of the mine this separation causes less mineralized water to discharge from the flooded mine and mine water treatment can be reduced or omitted various options to study mine water stratification will be discussed thereunder tracer tests camera aided depth profile measurements and depth dependant mine water sampling studies about free convection and natural stratification as well as those about using artificial stratification to encapsulate the lower quality water in the deeper mine parts will be presented no forecasting tool for the existence or development of stratification in flooded mines was found in the literature and a discussion about the long term stability of the stratification and its potential implementation will be given the conclusions show that precise predictions of mine water stratification are currently not possible in all detail but wherever stratification occurs it is mostly stable over a longer period of time as the density difference between the cf and wm layers prevents their mixing graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords stratification layering mine water underground mine flooding pollution prevention 1 introduction 1 1 motivation and scope density stratification in flooded underground mines has been described for more than 60 years and it is assumed that the separation of the mine water pool into layers with different water qualities might be used as an in situ remediation method this assumption comes from the observation that the deeper water bodies are usually higher mineralized than the shallower ones and discharging just the shallow water from a flooded underground mine could be a method for faster water quality improvement although numerous researchers have described density stratification in underground mines there is a lack of systematic reviews of the literature on this effect how it is measured how it might develop and how to categorize mine water stratification due to the importance of density stratification for the discharged mine water quality and the current discussions in the witwatersrand south africa and western german coal mining regions of how to use density stratification for improving mine water quality this review paper aims in compiling the state of the current knowledge this paper s scope includes methods for conducting density stratification investigations observations in various underground mines and their interpretation no detailed descriptions of individual measurements of stratification will be given but pattens and measurements common to all depth dependant physico chemical measurements in flooded mine shafts are provided it aims to give a comprehensive overview of the existing literature and the gaps in mine water density stratification research especially for underground mines and it suggests a uniform naming convention this paper introduces the cf wm layer cold fresh warm mineralized concept from oceanography and hopes that it will be used in future mine water stratification research in addition this review paper will draw first conclusions about the reasons for mine water stratification where it occurs and how it can disappear when the conditions change finally this paper will provide a means of how density stratification can be used to improve the discharged mine water quality 1 2 stratification in natural water bodies discharges of polluted and unpolluted mine water are a worldwide problem and in some cases mine water treatment is necessary before further discharge is possible wolkersdorfer 2008 younger et al 2002 in certain cases the occurrence of density stratification in the flooded mine workings results in a relatively better mine water quality close to the surface hence alleviating or reducing the need for extensive mine water treatment thus allowing passive mine water treatment wolkersdorfer et al 2016 stratification or layering in the context of this review paper is the compartmentation of water bodies with different physical or chemical properties before focusing on stratification in flooded underground mines a brief explanation of stratification in other natural water bodies shall be given first detailed stratification studies in lakes were published by findenegg 1933 depending on the time of the year lakes have no or up to three layers named epilimnion top layer metalimnion or thermocline middle layer and hypolimnion bottom layer boehrer and schultze 2009 most publications about lakes and flooded pit lakes cover thermal stratification boehrer and schultze 2008 a more fitting case which better resembles the conditions in a flooded underground mine is salt stratification found in inland lakes caused predominantly by mining activities for instance boehrer et al 1998 kirkland et al 1980 salt stratification occurs when the dissolved salt concentration exceeds 3 g kg in lake water and in some cases concentrations as high as 300 g kg were reported for instance williams 1996 1999 pit lakes differ in their shape and size to natural lakes and much greater depths often cause a permanent stratification in these pit lakes boehrer et al 1998 denimal et al 2005 fisher and lawrence 2006 gammons and duaime 2006 geller et al 2013 miller et al 1996 stevens and lawrence 1998 another example for stratification in natural water bodies is stratification in oceans or adjacent seas like the black sea baltic sea or red sea blanc and anschutz 1995 boehrer and schultze 2008 voorhis and dorson 1975 sometimes with the occurrence of internal waves gill 1982 pedlosky 1990 pond and pickard 1983 thermohaline staircases as a result of salt fingering and or diffusive convection merryfield 2000 radko 2013 appear in the ocean but can also be observed in flooded shafts bao and liu 2019b reichart 2015 rüterkamp and meßer 2000 stratification in boreholes respectively groundwater monitoring wells is described in detail by berthold and börner 2008 in addition to the field and laboratory experiments as well as numerical modelling of groundwater monitoring wells by berthold 2009 a skimming well with saline groundwater in the lower parts and layered freshwater in the upper in the indus river basin in pakistan is an example for stratification of groundwater asghar et al 2002 schelkes 1981 also describes the movement of groundwater in connection with stratification however the reasons for stratification in flooded underground mines usually differ from those in boreholes lakes and oceans since solar radiation has almost no influence on the warming of upper water bodies in boreholes the density differences responsible for stratification are caused mainly by the mineralization of the water burghardt et al 2017 an effect that can also be assumed for flooded underground mines in both cases various water bodies separate rather by chemical changes such as sulfate concentration or physical changes such as electrical conductivity or turbidity wolkersdorfer 2008 if stratification occurs in flooded underground mines water in the upper parts of the mine pool usually has a better quality in other words is less mineralized than that in deeper parts of the mine ladwig et al 1984 nuttall and younger 2003 wolkersdorfer 2008 a strong dependence however on the type of mine ore coal salt and its structure should be considered kories et al 2004 mugova and wolkersdorfer 2018 rüterkamp 2001 as the mining method mine layout and depth seem to have a substantial influence on the occurrence of mine water stratification 1 3 research history and terminology first known investigations of stratification in flooded underground mines were carried out in the u s a by stuart and simpson 1961 describing the presence of layering of the acid water with bottles they took water samples from three different depths determining separated water bodies and measuring lower ph values in greater depths in some of their mine pools in the following years cairney and frost 1975 cutright 1979 as well as sanders thomas inc 1975 continued with further stratification studies however experiments on stratification in flooded underground mines were already carried out in germany at the beginning of the 1960s there temporal stratification of the mine pool could be achieved by injecting fresh water into the maximilian shaft semmler 1964 unfortunately no detailed description of the investigations has been published this is the case for many flooded underground mines with density stratification it would be helpful to bring the stratification into the context of the flooding history but this information is not readily available in most cases the pumps are simply switched off or removed and no follow up monitoring is conducted to our knowledge first precise temperature profiles were recorded by uerpmann 1980 measured over a vertical distance of 300 m at one metre intervals he described single convection cells in various water bodies of flooded shafts and took additional measurements every 5 mm in the area between two water bodies in addition he conducted one of the first experiments on artificial stratification using dyes to observe the mixing behaviour between water bodies and proposed estimated time frames required for stratification to develop he noticed that the flow velocities in the boundary layers were always orders of magnitude lower than those in the convection zones uerpmann 1980 describes that boundary layers with abrupt temperature and concentration changes represent a strong barrier to convective mass transfer ladwig et al 1984 published an extensive report describing a measurement method using downhole probes as well as how to take water samples in a flooded shaft they concluded that the upper water body is less contaminated due to the occurrence of stratification and that the static or near static water level conditions may be responsible for the observed development of water quality stratification furthermore they mention that the stratification appears to be related to discharge elevations at the time of inundation as well as present flow conditions relative positions of mined barrier pillars out fall installations and natural structural features combine to create an environment more favourable to flushing in the shallower parts of the mine system consequently they concluded that higher mineralized or contaminated water usually collects in deeper mine workings ladwig et al 1984 one of the world s first detailed studies about mine flooding and stratification with numerous sensors and depth dependant measurements were conducted within the hope germany mine flooding project this mine was actively flooded with saturated brine from a salt waste rock pile and eventually a freshwater cap cf layer formed on top of the brine accurate depth profiles and flow measurements were taken by herbert 1989 for the flooding process at this potash mine he confirmed research results from previously published articles about stratification and studied turbulent flow conditions in the flooded shaft in the 1990s and 2000s first papers on modelling stratification in flooded underground mines were published with successful simulation of convection cells in flooded shafts czolbe et al 1992 könig and blömer 1999 luckner and morgenstern 2006 rüterkamp 2001 in addition a comparison of stratification in different mines was carried out by coldewey et al 1999 with the result that the occurrence of density stratification under certain boundary conditions is a natural effect first tracer tests in flooded mines to study stratification were conducted by wolkersdorfer 1996 who identified effective velocities of up to 25 m min with an average around 1 m min wolkersdorfer et al 1997 in the past few years research has focused on the following two topics geothermal applications and using mine water stratification for the prevention of large scale mixing processes stratification might influence mine water geothermal applications and was studied by various authors bao and liu 2019a 2019b burnside et al 2016 wieber et al 2019 although this is not a new idea and was already investigated earlier by cutright 1979 taking advantage of stratification as a hydraulic or geochemical barrier to avoid the discharge of higher mineralized water thus reducing or alleviating the need for extensive mine water treatment is described in several research papers heidenreich et al 1991 kindermann 1998 melchers et al 2019 mugova and wolkersdorfer 2019a 2019b wolkersdorfer et al 2016 most of the research about stratification in flooded underground mines has been carried out in europe especially in germany great britain france the czech republic poland and north america most notably in the pennsylvanian anthracite mines research from australia focuses mainly on pit lakes and almost no research relating to mine water stratification seems to have been conducted in asia or south america large differences in the use of the terminology were encountered in the literature many publications about stratification in flooded underground mines are written in german and an exact translation of technical terms into english is not always possible in the first publication on the subject the term layering of acid water was used stuart and simpson 1961 but since 1975 the term stratification has become widely accepted cutright 1979 ladwig et al 1984 sanders and thomas inc 1975 some authors further specify the term stratification such as hydrochemical stratification nuttall and younger 2003 rapantova et al 2013 density stratification coldewey et al 1999 or thermohaline stratification bao and liu 2019b meaning more or less the same effect in addition different names for the individual mine water bodies and the area between them are used lower and upper respectively bottom and top layer or zone is commonly used ladwig et al 1984 sanders and thomas inc 1975 more precise would be terms linked to the chemical composition or perhaps the origin of the water which is ultimately responsible for the differences in density highly mineralized water kories et al 2004 heavy mineralized water or poorer quality water nuttall and younger 2003 is often used to describe the deeper water body the term wm warm mineralized is used in oceanography which can also describe the deeper water body in flooded mines ruddick and gargett 2003 in contrast a near surface water body is commonly referred to as fresh ground water kories et al 2004 wolkersdorfer 2008 clear water zone kindermann 1998 shallow sourced water less mineralized water nuttall and younger 2003 or meteoric water henkel and melchers 2017 rosner 2011 uses the term freshwater cap or freshwater lens and in oceanography the term cf cool fresh in contrast to wm warm mineralised is commonly used ruddick and gargett 2003 for a water body with similar characteristics the expression homogeneous zone is used czolbe et al 1992 a layer between homogeneous water bodies has been called transition between zones ladwig et al 1984 separation zone heidenreich et al 1991 boundary layer coldewey et al 1999 kories et al 2004 melchers et al 2014 intermediate layer wolkersdorfer 2008 as well as transition layer wieber et al 2016 however the use of the term boundary layer is incorrect because the term is already defined and describes a flowing fluid on a wall schlichting and gersten 2006 studies by the authors of this paper show that the intermediate layer is not necessarily present or it is only very thin 2 investigation methods to identify stratification 2 1 depth dependant measurements physico chemical parameters depth dependant measurements with down hole probes fig 1 or dippers are the main investigation method to identify stratification in flooded shafts rapid changes of temperature or electrical conductivity indicate a change of the water s properties and thus stratification coldewey et al 1999 cutright 1979 czolbe et al 1992 ladwig et al 1984 melchers et al 2019 if the vertical electrical conductivity profile shows a sudden increase in values the down hole probe s sensor has reached a higher mineralized water body usually separated from the overlying water body by an intermediate layer fig 2 it can be assumed that historic depth dependant measurements of physico chemical parameters pre 1990s are less precise which makes it difficult to accurately localize the boundary between the water bodies this contrasts with more recent measurements where parameters are recorded at a high spatial resolution unpublished measurements by the authors show that parameters can change considerably within centimetres distance when evaluating the measurement results it needs to be verified that the probe acclimatised prior to the start of the measurement in addition the probe s downward velocity must be slow enough to allow an adjustment to the temperature changes in the shaft water body water samples in flooded mines should be taken after recording a depth profile as the intermediate layer s depth must be considered to avoid that unrepresentative samples are taken usually various parameters are sampled and analysed such as in situ parameters and main as well as trace ions czolbe et al 1992 henkel and melchers 2017 melchers et al 2014 nuttall and younger 2003 rüterkamp 2001 snyder 2012 wieber et al 2016 wolkersdorfer 1996 zeman et al 2008 one of the more recent approaches in studying stratified mine water bodies is using geochemical in conjunction with isotopic markers to investigate the origin of the mine water melchers et al 2019 wolkersdorfer et al 2020 in most flooded mine shafts only one single stratification measurement has been conducted which does not allow a discussion of the temporal stratification development in these shafts only rarely repeated measurements with widely varying results in the same shaft exist in some cases even when additional measurements were repeated after decades the intermediate layer has not substantially changed its position in other cases yet its position has changed considerably or the stratification disappeared coldewey et al 1999 melchers et al 2019 reichart 2015 wieber et al 2016 wolkersdorfer 1996 wolkersdorfer et al 2002 another approach would be to perform continuous depth profile measurements at a shaft without changing the probe s position wolkersdorfer 1996 or fibre optic distributed temperature sensing dts as in the german eduard shaft pers comm kurt schetelig or in the french vouters shaft reichart 2015 reichart et al 2011 2 2 depth dependant measurements chemistry depth dependant mine water sampling for chemical analysis is done since 1961 stuart and simpson 1961 these authors initially lowered empty bottles into the desired depth and waited until the bottles were filled through a short open capillary pipe thereafter the bottles were hauled to the surface and the on site parameters and chemical analysis conducted with the water in these bottles instruments used for chemical sampling so far were messenger tripped bore hole or depth samplers cutright 1979 nuttall and younger 2003 and samplers with additional messenger weights to trigger a locking mechanism like conventional bacon bomb samplers erickson et al 1982 kemmerer stainless steel point samplers bao 2018 snyder 2012 or van dorn plastic point samplers with spring loaded endcaps snyder 2012 additionally samplers with electronic opening and closing mechanisms coldewey et al 1999 erickson et al 1982 rüterkamp 2001 ball valve operated samplers coldewey et al 1999 gzyl and banks 2007 snyder 2012 ruttner samplers chudy et al 2020 uerpmann 1980 wieber et al 2016 or bailers like point source bailers toran 1987 are used furthermore water samples can be collected by pumping with submersible or peristaltic pumps elliot and younger 2007 rapantova et al 2013 toran 1987 or by water sampling below the water level during the course of flooding cutright 1979 wolkersdorfer 1996 passive grab or thief samplers such as the discrete interval sampler nielsen 2006 which can take water samples up to a depth of 1200 m have successfully been used to collect depth dependant water samples in flooded spanish coal mines pers comm daniel gonzález suárez usually the volume of the water samples ranges between 0 5 and 5 l fig 3 systems in which the closing mechanism is triggered by jerking movements are not suitable for flooded shafts the closing mechanism can already be triggered by hitting shaft installations as for example described by coldewey et al 1999 older samplers with only mechanical locking mechanisms messenger weights are suitable to a certain extent but they are not designed for larger depths erickson et al 1982 ladwig et al 1984 stuart and simpson 1961 herbert and sander 1989 developed and patented a sampling device for mine shafts that are flooded with brines this device allows undisturbed sampling of the brine under ambient conditions and the measurement of on site parameters such as ph velocity of speed temperature and conductivity it was first tested and used during the hope germany mine flooding experiment if only surface water chemistry is of interest also telescopic samplers have been used to sample mine water in flooded mines 2 3 use of shaft cameras and underwater robots with underwater cameras it is possible to observe the change from murky water to clear water fig 4 and inflow from galleries and particle movement snyder 2012 stemke et al 2017 initially normal borehole cameras were used wieber et al 2019 however they are not ideal for flooded shafts only a few cameras are available that have been specifically developed for flooded underground mines equipped with powerful lamps and up to 4k image resolution stemke et al 2017 another new development is the use of mine water robots like the autonomous underwater explorer for flooded mines ux 1c from the unexmin project fernandez et al 2019 žibret and žebre 2018 this robot is equipped with navigation instrumentation such as sonar scanner and lasers as well as scientific instrumentation like temperature and pressure sensors 2 4 flow measurements in flooded mines flow measurements in flooded mines can be done in accessible galleries or in shafts in the galleries the flow measurement methods applied in surface water measurements can be used anklin et al 2003 u s department of the interior bureau of reclamation 2001 wolkersdorfer 2008 while flow measurements in the shafts or in the whole flooded mine section need specific techniques rüterkamp et al 2004 discuss selected methods suitable for flooded mines such as acoustic meters kories et al 2004 rüterkamp et al 2004 impeller current meters johnson and younger 2002 radioactive tracers czolbe et al 1992 drift tracers like microspheres or dyed spores wolkersdorfer 1996 or fluorescent dyes like na fluorescein wolkersdorfer 2008 flow measurements in analogue laboratory models such as laser doppler anemometry or thermoanemometry are described in martynenko and khramtsov 2005 knowledge about flow dynamics and flow velocities over longer distances can be gained via tracer tests furthermore it is possible to inject different tracers at different depths into the flooded mine voids wolkersdorfer 2008 tracer tests where tracers were injected below the intermediate layer have shown that the tracer cannot penetrate from the lower water body to the upper one neumann 2007 unger 2002 wackwitz 2002 laboratory investigations are another possibility to investigate stratification berthold 2009 as well as berthold and börner 2008 conducted detailed investigations for boreholes which can only partly be transferred to flooded mine shafts another study was conducted by dmt gmbh co kg using a small scale testing facility consisting of two shafts with three horizontal connections between the shafts they generated an artificial stratification of freshwater on top of highly mineralised water and simulated the influence of the geothermal gradient by using a heating element their aim was to understand mine water stratification convection flow in a shaft and convection loops in a mine coldewey et al 1999 rüterkamp 2001 based on this earlier experiment the same research group conducted a larger and more detailed one on a scale of 1 500 for a 1000 m deep mine allowing also inflow and outflow from and into the shaft frequent measurements of temperature and electrical conductivity allowed numerical cfd models and the dmt box model to be applied eckart et al 2012 eckart et al 2010 the authors of this article are currently investigating mine water stratification on a 4 6 m analogue model the agricola model mine amm several shafts and galleries are connected with each other and a geothermal gradient is simulated by heating elements in situ parameters of the water can be measured at various outlets at each model section main objectives of this experiment are to understand the flooding process of an underground mine as well as to gain new insights into the occurrence and break down of stratification mugova and wolkersdorfer 2018 a laboratory experiment used as an explanation for convection loops between shafts and galleries by wolkersdorfer 1996 was conducted by bau and torrance bau and torrance 1981a 1981b 1983 in their experiments using open and closed convection loops heated at various locations they noticed that free convection loops provide a means for circulating fluid without the use of pumps bau and torrance 1981a transferred to flooded mine shafts the geothermal gradient can be considered the heating element and the free surface of the mine water in the shafts in conjunction with the mine air the cooling element this explains the development of convection cells in the mine pools earlier experiments by creveling et al 1975 explain the temperature and velocity fluctuations that are measured when a probe is located for a while at the same location as has been observed by wolkersdorfer 1996 these fluctuations result from the turbulent flow conditions as they develop in the flooded mine shafts 2 5 numerical stratification modelling numerical modelling of flooded underground mines tries to understand the hydrodynamics in the mine pool by using numerical codes of various complexity a simple code which simulates the flooding process but not the stratification is for example the gram groundwater rebound in abandoned mineworkings code adams and younger 1997 whilst more sophisticated models are using cfd computational fluid dynamics codes to understand the flow and stratification in the mine loredo et al 2016 wolkersdorfer 2008 czolbe et al 1992 developed the finite difference code kasomo to investigate the flow in a flooded underground mine they demonstrated the barrier function of the intermediate layer in the shaft könig and blömer 1999 used the software code spring and rüterkamp et al 2004 compared differential computational fluid dynamic cfd programs for modelling stratification finally using the code cfx rüterkamp et al 2004 modelled a general approach of a flooded shaft and transferred these findings to a real mine in germany based on the results of previous analogue modelling eckart et al 2012 used cfd modelling and their box model for data from a small scale analogue model and applied it to real dimensions of a mine they concluded that modelling of the real world scenario is not possible with the computer capacities that were available at that time reichart 2015 used the cfd code comsol multiphysics for investigating flow and convection in a mine shaft he compared data from a 2d model with an existing mine shaft and used the results for a 3d model bao and liu 2019b worked with openfoam but focused on double diffusive convection associated with stratification they pointed out that stratification can only be successfully modelled with high resolution dense grit confirming conclusions by rüterkamp et al 2004 namely that layers will mix over long time if a shaft has no in or outflow numerical modelling based on mine water tracer tests were conducted by unger 2002 and hultsch 2006 using ansys flotran they were able to model the breakthrough of the tracer in the austrian georgi unterbau and the german felsendome rabenstein mines with the advance of computation capacities more sophisticated models can now be set up nonetheless modelling a fully flooded mine is still a complex task one example to identify the influence of a small scale area would be the on setting area at the shaft at which intermediate layers are often located even if the modelling focuses only on this small area the geometry is relatively complex due to the existing pit under the tilting platform for example which can strongly influence the flow velocity and flow direction likewise in a flooded mine there are usually no smooth shaft walls resulting in turbulent flow shaft installations and reinforcing components also influence the flow hence modelling in flooded mines must be viewed critically as the mine layout and thus the flow regime differs from mine to mine 3 synthesis and discussion processes 3 1 classification of hydrodynamics in flooded underground mines to understand stratification in flooded underground mines knowledge about hydrodynamic principles is relevant for example the shaft lining s roughness and the shaft furniture such as guide rails together with the mine water s velocity determine whether there is turbulent or laminar flow in the shaft water can flow upwards or downwards in the shaft and can noticeably change its flow velocity wolkersdorfer 2008 to develop an understanding of the system the authors have developed a classification for flooded underground mines table 1 which can be used to set up conceptual models of flooded underground mines the first category includes the source of the inflowing water for example precipitation water that infiltrates via the overburden into the mine a ascending water from deep aquifers b or a combination of both moreover the efflorescent salts in the mine workings could be washed out during the initial stage of the mine flooding causing mine water with an elevated mineralisation collecting in the lower parts of the mine and once the efflorescent salts are flushed away the water quality slowly improves building a layer with a better water quality on top of the higher mineralised mine water d convective flow is another category with temperature or density differences of the water causing free or natural convection a whereas free convection is described with the grashof number gr kays and crawford 1993 in eq 1 1 g r l 3 p 2 β δ t g μ 2 with l characteristic length m p fluid density kg m 3 β coefficient of thermal expansion k 1 δ t temperature difference k g gravitational acceleration m s 2 μ dynamic viscosity of fluid ns m 2 in contrast forced convection b for instance by operating pumps or a combination of both c is possible in shallow mines the geothermal gradient has little or no influence 0 but the deeper a mine the more its influence increases 1 in addition it is relevant if a mine behaves as a single shaft mine ssm or a multiple shaft mine msm mines of the msm type have a large number of interconnected shafts and working levels while ssm types usually have one or a small number of shafts with restricted hydraulic connection wolkersdorfer 2006 as the layout of a mine seems to have a decisive influence on flow velocities which in turn have an influence on stratification this classification group is relevant at a flow rate above 1 m min mainly found in multiple shaft mines m high effective velocities occur single shaft mines s usually develop small flow rates below 1 m min these categories are helpful in classifying and consequently comparing flooded underground mines using the metsämonttu mine in finland where stratification has been proven the category for this mine would be aa1mxδ water inflow from above free convection influence of geothermal gradient and multiple shaft mine diffusive convection as much as the chemical quality of the ground water in the aquifers around a mine contributes to the pre flooding water quality in the mines there seems to be no direct relationship between the ground water quality and the stratified mine water quality during or post flooding main reasons are as described in younger 1997 that the mine water quality is mainly controlled by vestigal and juvenil acidities and by efflorescent salts that are dissolved by the ground water flooding the mines only after the first flush the discharged mine water quality from the cf layer slowly reaches background ground water qualities 3 2 occurrence and stability of stratification based on the categories above it can be concluded that the conditions under which stratification occurs can vary greatly from mine to mine and that in most investigated cases stratification can be observed wolkersdorfer et al 2016 stratification occurs at different states of mine water rebound during the flooding process after completed flooding and even during ongoing pumping activities johnson and younger 2002 melchers et al 2015 nuttall and younger 2003 rapantova et al 2013 wieber et al 2016 wolkersdorfer 1996 stratification can appear in the steady state conditions of an already flooded mine shaft as well as in an instationary system while the mine is still in its flooding process coldewey et al 1999 detailed studies about these two conditions in flooded underground mines are still missing but experiments in the authors analogue mine model amm are currently under way in most investigated mines the geothermal gradient causes the mine water in the deeper sections of the mine to get warmer than in shallower sections which when the temperature difference is high enough results in free convection a counterforce to the thermal convection can be the mineralisation of the mine water which might even result in density inversions such preventing free convection numerical and analogue models showed that the water heats from the shaft wall and rises upwards along the walls martynenko and khramtsov 2005 once the ascending water reaches an anomaly for example a gallery or has already cooled down to such an extent that an ascent is no longer possible it flows back through the middle of the shaft until it reaches the shaft s sump or another water body heidenreich et al 1991 this results in density driven free convection cells which have been shown in experiments using radioactive tracers czolbe et al 1992 modelling results suggest that it might not necessarily be one large convection cell but rather many small cells called bales kories et al 2004 which is also discussed in the theoretical explanations by aigner et al 2015 könig and blömer 1999 assume that shafts with smaller diameters develop more convection cells and higher velocities eventually convection cells and therefore homogeneous water bodies develop by the interruption of the liquid movement in the shaft this interruption can be provoked by the geological conditions such as crevasses inflows or different thermal rock conductivity but also by adjacent mine workings coldewey et al 1999 czolbe et al 1992 so far no investigation observed that density stratification caused geological features to occur such as fractures or karst features in no case a direct relationship between the geological setting and the stratification could be identified except that the geological setting is responsible for the mine layout which in turn influences the stratification to a degree not known yet based on all measurements and publications reviewed the mine layout seems to be the key controlling factor for the stratification while inflows of ground water are not that relevant as much as the mineralogical composition of the host rock and the raw material will control the final water quality the stratification itself has no relation with the geological structures this is an indication that the geological setting of the mine seems to be irrelevant for the stratification per se stratification occurs at the boundary of convection cells otherwise homogeneous water bodies and can be considered stable if temperature differences above 10 k δρ 2 kg m³ total dissolved solid differences of more than 3 δρ 20 kg m³ or large differences in turbidity δρ 200 kg m³ occur kranawettreiser 1989 furthermore aigner et al 2015 distinguishes between static stratification which is caused by thermal or saline pressure differences and dynamic stratification which is caused by turbidity laden flow at the intermediate layer between two water bodies mainly molecular diffusion and minor exchange of heat and particles appears czolbe et al 1992 rüterkamp 2001 as has been shown by the laboratory experiments of uerpmann 1980 it has been shown by in situ measurements of various research groups that homogeneous water bodies can reach a thickness of several meters to hundreds of meters whereas the intermediate layer is comparably thin in literature the thickness of the intermediate layer is described as being between a few decimeters 0 6 m and 1 3 m by coldewey et al 1999 or kories et al 2004 and some meters 2 to 5 m by wieber et al 2016 or wolkersdorfer 1996 recent measurements by the authors indicate that the intermediate layer can even be thinner and that delay of the probe or smudging during the measurement could misrepresent the results wolkersdorfer 1996 mentions that the thickness could increase over time towards the sump in contrast wieber et al 2016 and rüterkamp et al 2004 describe a decrease in thickness due to inflowing surface water as per rüterkamp et al 2004 the thickness of the transition zone is influenced by the amount of inflowing and outflowing water and the location or depth of connected galleries depending on the flow velocity there is no exchange between the water body above and the water body below once the intermediate layer reaches a certain thickness aigner et al 2015 this velocities difference dependant thickness of the intermediate s layer can be represented by eq 2 2 δ x δ v 2 24 g δ p p with g gravitational acceleration m s 2 x depth m p fluid density g m 3 v velocity in each of the fluid s layers m s 1 in some cases a staircase profile of the layers was observed which can be attributed to double diffusive convection fig 5 or internal waves eckart et al 2012 radko 2013 wolkersdorfer 2008 which appears because of the diffusivity differences in heat and salinity in mine shafts it has been observed that cf wm cold fresh warm mineralised scenarios are more common than wm cf double diffusion scenarios and that the first are more stable than the latter aigner et al 2015 explain that with increasing velocity differences between the layers waves appear at the boundary between them although not specifically pertaining to the intermediate layer bao and liu 2019b describe staircase profiles in flooded shafts while reichart 2015 discusses the bénard lapwood convection cells in connection with staircase profiles with the current knowledge about mine water stratification it is not conclusively possible to predict the long term stability of stratification as it can change over time table 2 in some mines under cf wm conditions a long term stability seems to exist whilst wm cf conditions are less stable in the long term stable stratification exists when the following conditions apply 3 gebhart et al 1988 3 d d x p t p 0 with x depth m p fluid density g m 3 t temperature k p depth dependant pressure pa another approach to evaluate the stability of stratification in flooded shafts is the richardson number ri or richard s criterion which determines if two layers in a fluid will mix whereby stable conditions usually exist with ri 0 25 gebhart et al 1988 rieutord 2015 wolkersdorfer 2008 which is called miles theorem many factors are known to cause the buildup or breakdown of mine water stratification fig 6 meteoric or infiltration water can seep through the overburden or can flow directly into the mine via shafts near surface inflows can result in a layer of water with lower density sometimes called fresh or surface water cap rosner 2011 wieber et al 2016 which equals a cf over wm situation a good example for the formation of a cf layer are the hermann shafts in germany since its flooding began there have been near surface freshwater water influxes and the cf layer became thicker over time coldewey et al 1999 in the flooded ermelo colliery south africa johnstone et al 2013 describe that the higher mineralized mine water is trapped within the mine voids by a cf layer not only surface water but also rising mine water during the flooding process can result in stratification nuttall and younger 2003 this is probably closely related to an anomaly in the shaft wall during the flooding though this assumption might be possible however it is more likely that galleries or roadways connected to the shaft are of greater importance the occurrence of an intermediate layer at on setting stations was often observed flow into the shaft for example from adjacent mine workings seems to be the main cause for the development of stratification coldewey et al 1999 eckart et al 2012 rüterkamp et al 2004 on the other hand wolkersdorfer 1996 had already described convection loops or thermosiphons derived from experiments carried out by bau and torrance 1981a 1981b 1983 these convection loops between interconnected shafts and galleries could cause higher flow velocities and could be responsible for a jet stream like inflow aigner et al 2015 examples such as the hermann shafts and the sicilia shaft in germany laboratory experiments coldewey et al 1999 melchers et al 2019 and obervations during camera drives support this assumption 4 synthesis and discussion scientific relevance 4 1 processes that cause build up or breakdown of mine water stratification barriers are believed to prevent convection loops since these can break down the stratification wolkersdorfer 1996 ultimately it depends on the spatial position of the convection loops whether they result in stabilizing or destructing the stratification the same applies to infiltrating meteoric or groundwater though it favours the development of a cf layer it can also cause lower density differences between water bodies which means that the necessary density difference for a stable stratification cannot be maintained wieber et al 2016 although being more likely for single mine shafts with no direct in or outflow rain events could cause a rapid sometimes temporary collapse of the stratification external forces affecting the existing stratification can also result in its collapse these include human activities like pumping shaft measurements injections during tracer tests elliot and younger 2014 frolik 2009 wolkersdorfer 2008 or a modification of the flow path for example by installing a drainage adit in addition natural events like storm events or earthquakes can affect the mine water pool and cause a stratification breakdown wolkersdorfer 2008 breaking of dams can change the overall flow regime but also result in the formation of new convection loops nuttall and younger 2003 wolkersdorfer 2008 the same results can occur as soon as the rising mine water table drains off via a gallery or adit as observed during the flooding of the german niederschlema alberoda uranium mine wolkersdorfer 1996 jet streams can also influence the stratification in a negative way especially when they are vertical even small differences in density between the jet and the surrounding water are sufficient for effective mixing stefan and gu 1992 and can thus break down or prevent stratification within a flooded mine bao and liu 2019b used numerical modelling of a mine shaft to show that without further inflows to the shaft the number of layers reduces over time which they call a merging event this might explain the occurrence and breakdown of stratification in a short period of time moreover reichart 2015 assumes from the results of his numerical modelling that a small reversal of the temperature gradient is enough to disrupt the convection cells and thus the stratification 4 2 stratification as an in situ mitigation of mine water natural and artificial stratification in the literature several considerations have been discussed and proposed to take advantage of the barrier effect caused by mine water stratification thereunder for radioactive waste disposal in flooded salt mines heidenreich et al 1991 kindermann 1998 uerpmann 1980 in all cases the aim is to separate the mostly higher mineralised wm water body in a mine from the usually less mineralised cf water body this separation can mitigate or alleviate the need for extensive mine water treatment wolkersdorfer et al 2016 so far it is known that stratification and thus a barrier effect occurs under certain conditions but cannot be predicted reliably which does neither mean it will not occur or that stratification can t be used to help avoiding environmental impacts therefore approaches to artificially create stratification in flooded underground mines exist an example of artificial stratification in pit lakes is described by fisher and lawrence 2006 who generated a cf layer above a wm layer in a 350 m deep pit lake in the 1960s 1970s artificially creating stratification was tested by means of an infiltration test well at the maximilian shaft germany there the injected freshwater pushed the higher mineralized mine water to greater depths a cf layer formed and was stable at least between 1960 and 1972 demonstrating that artificial stratification might be a possibility rüterkamp et al 2004 semmler 1964 the idea of an artificial cf layer was reconsidered and briefly described by kories et al 2004 luckner and morgenstern 2006 as well as eckart et al 2010 but without showing any particular proposals for implementation none of the authors developed a method of how artificial stratification could be carried out in practice where the water supply could come from or if it must be supplied continuously mugova and wolkersdorfer 2019a numerical modelling by rüterkamp et al 2004 bao and liu 2019a and bao and liu 2019b indicated that the cf and wm layers could combine should freshwater not be continuously supplied another possibility to create artificial stratification is to modify the mine water flow paths through horizontal or vertical barriers wolkersdorfer 1996 this 1996 publication is based on a 3 year study of stratification in a flooded underground mine supported by the results of a tracer test and focuses specifically on man made barriers dams or bulkheads to prevent convection loops however these barriers should be installed during the closure phase so far an in situ application has not yet been constructed but it is obvious from the authors investigations and the analogue mine model results that any interruption of convection loops e g closing dams constructing barriers helps to support artificial stratification 5 conclusions and outlook although research about stratification in flooded underground mines has been conducted for many decades the number of publications on this topic is limited while the existing publications focus on the description of the subject many details especially regarding hydrodynamics are still unsolved several possibilities of how stratification can occur are described but the detailed mechanisms of stratification development in flooded underground mines is not yet solved based on the published depth profiles the transition between two water bodies occurs mainly at the on setting stations where shafts and adits connect with each other indicating a relationship between stratification and these connections however detailed studies of the flow pattern in this area have not yet been conducted in addition the current knowledge does not allow predictions at which depth or at which on setting stations the intermediate layer develops stratification also occurs between two individual connections to the shaft without a perceivable connection to adjacent mine workings this stratification may have a different evolution history further research is needed to show whether different types of stratification based either upon formation or location for example can be classified for this matter more depth dependant physico chemical and temporal measurements should be conducted in flooded underground mines and compared with existing measurements these measurements should be backed up with laboratory investigations and numerical models using e g cfd computational fluid dynamics finally not much is known about the temporal development of mine water stratification consequently it is currently not possible to predict precisely whether stratification will develop in a flooded underground mine or not though nearly all investigated mines are stratified to a certain degree to develop forecasting tools and to be able to use the barrier effects of stratification a more detailed understanding of the hydrodynamics in flooded mines is necessary as has been shown tracer tests have proven to be a suitable test method while investigations using shaft cameras provide valuable new insights in the individual flow scenarios the details of the various vertical pyhsico chemical profiles differ from each other but allow conclusions about flow patterns furthermore stratification seems to be related to the mine set up and comparisons of different mines could be important for further predictions to be able to use stratification for isolating higher mineralized mine water from discharge to receiving water courses it is important to ensure its long term stability causes for stratification breakdown must be excluded as far as possible to obtain a permanent near surface cf layer above a wm layer once the positive effects of stratification have developed be they intentionally or unintentionally caution must be taken to keep the stratification in place possible scenarios that might interfere with a stable stratification might be geothermal pumps in the mine pumping water from deeper parts of a flooded mine or the construction of dewatering adits already during mine planning the closure and potential flooding scenarios should be considered in the view of the cradle to grave concept by implementing an appropriate design the development of a stable cf wm stratification can be favoured in a flooded underground mine and thus can be used as a tool for in situ mitigation of flooded underground mines and to minimize environmental pollution by

16188,layering of water bodies with different physico chemical properties is called stratification this physical effect is known from lakes or oceans but also occurs in flooded underground mines and has been studied in the past this review gives a summary of their investigation methods flow dynamics stratification development and breakdown furthermore the barrier effect of stratification is discussed meaning that less mineralized water bodies cf water bodies on the top are separated from higher mineralized water bodies wm water bodies in the lower parts of the mine this separation causes less mineralized water to discharge from the flooded mine and mine water treatment can be reduced or omitted various options to study mine water stratification will be discussed thereunder tracer tests camera aided depth profile measurements and depth dependant mine water sampling studies about free convection and natural stratification as well as those about using artificial stratification to encapsulate the lower quality water in the deeper mine parts will be presented no forecasting tool for the existence or development of stratification in flooded mines was found in the literature and a discussion about the long term stability of the stratification and its potential implementation will be given the conclusions show that precise predictions of mine water stratification are currently not possible in all detail but wherever stratification occurs it is mostly stable over a longer period of time as the density difference between the cf and wm layers prevents their mixing graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords stratification layering mine water underground mine flooding pollution prevention 1 introduction 1 1 motivation and scope density stratification in flooded underground mines has been described for more than 60 years and it is assumed that the separation of the mine water pool into layers with different water qualities might be used as an in situ remediation method this assumption comes from the observation that the deeper water bodies are usually higher mineralized than the shallower ones and discharging just the shallow water from a flooded underground mine could be a method for faster water quality improvement although numerous researchers have described density stratification in underground mines there is a lack of systematic reviews of the literature on this effect how it is measured how it might develop and how to categorize mine water stratification due to the importance of density stratification for the discharged mine water quality and the current discussions in the witwatersrand south africa and western german coal mining regions of how to use density stratification for improving mine water quality this review paper aims in compiling the state of the current knowledge this paper s scope includes methods for conducting density stratification investigations observations in various underground mines and their interpretation no detailed descriptions of individual measurements of stratification will be given but pattens and measurements common to all depth dependant physico chemical measurements in flooded mine shafts are provided it aims to give a comprehensive overview of the existing literature and the gaps in mine water density stratification research especially for underground mines and it suggests a uniform naming convention this paper introduces the cf wm layer cold fresh warm mineralized concept from oceanography and hopes that it will be used in future mine water stratification research in addition this review paper will draw first conclusions about the reasons for mine water stratification where it occurs and how it can disappear when the conditions change finally this paper will provide a means of how density stratification can be used to improve the discharged mine water quality 1 2 stratification in natural water bodies discharges of polluted and unpolluted mine water are a worldwide problem and in some cases mine water treatment is necessary before further discharge is possible wolkersdorfer 2008 younger et al 2002 in certain cases the occurrence of density stratification in the flooded mine workings results in a relatively better mine water quality close to the surface hence alleviating or reducing the need for extensive mine water treatment thus allowing passive mine water treatment wolkersdorfer et al 2016 stratification or layering in the context of this review paper is the compartmentation of water bodies with different physical or chemical properties before focusing on stratification in flooded underground mines a brief explanation of stratification in other natural water bodies shall be given first detailed stratification studies in lakes were published by findenegg 1933 depending on the time of the year lakes have no or up to three layers named epilimnion top layer metalimnion or thermocline middle layer and hypolimnion bottom layer boehrer and schultze 2009 most publications about lakes and flooded pit lakes cover thermal stratification boehrer and schultze 2008 a more fitting case which better resembles the conditions in a flooded underground mine is salt stratification found in inland lakes caused predominantly by mining activities for instance boehrer et al 1998 kirkland et al 1980 salt stratification occurs when the dissolved salt concentration exceeds 3 g kg in lake water and in some cases concentrations as high as 300 g kg were reported for instance williams 1996 1999 pit lakes differ in their shape and size to natural lakes and much greater depths often cause a permanent stratification in these pit lakes boehrer et al 1998 denimal et al 2005 fisher and lawrence 2006 gammons and duaime 2006 geller et al 2013 miller et al 1996 stevens and lawrence 1998 another example for stratification in natural water bodies is stratification in oceans or adjacent seas like the black sea baltic sea or red sea blanc and anschutz 1995 boehrer and schultze 2008 voorhis and dorson 1975 sometimes with the occurrence of internal waves gill 1982 pedlosky 1990 pond and pickard 1983 thermohaline staircases as a result of salt fingering and or diffusive convection merryfield 2000 radko 2013 appear in the ocean but can also be observed in flooded shafts bao and liu 2019b reichart 2015 rüterkamp and meßer 2000 stratification in boreholes respectively groundwater monitoring wells is described in detail by berthold and börner 2008 in addition to the field and laboratory experiments as well as numerical modelling of groundwater monitoring wells by berthold 2009 a skimming well with saline groundwater in the lower parts and layered freshwater in the upper in the indus river basin in pakistan is an example for stratification of groundwater asghar et al 2002 schelkes 1981 also describes the movement of groundwater in connection with stratification however the reasons for stratification in flooded underground mines usually differ from those in boreholes lakes and oceans since solar radiation has almost no influence on the warming of upper water bodies in boreholes the density differences responsible for stratification are caused mainly by the mineralization of the water burghardt et al 2017 an effect that can also be assumed for flooded underground mines in both cases various water bodies separate rather by chemical changes such as sulfate concentration or physical changes such as electrical conductivity or turbidity wolkersdorfer 2008 if stratification occurs in flooded underground mines water in the upper parts of the mine pool usually has a better quality in other words is less mineralized than that in deeper parts of the mine ladwig et al 1984 nuttall and younger 2003 wolkersdorfer 2008 a strong dependence however on the type of mine ore coal salt and its structure should be considered kories et al 2004 mugova and wolkersdorfer 2018 rüterkamp 2001 as the mining method mine layout and depth seem to have a substantial influence on the occurrence of mine water stratification 1 3 research history and terminology first known investigations of stratification in flooded underground mines were carried out in the u s a by stuart and simpson 1961 describing the presence of layering of the acid water with bottles they took water samples from three different depths determining separated water bodies and measuring lower ph values in greater depths in some of their mine pools in the following years cairney and frost 1975 cutright 1979 as well as sanders thomas inc 1975 continued with further stratification studies however experiments on stratification in flooded underground mines were already carried out in germany at the beginning of the 1960s there temporal stratification of the mine pool could be achieved by injecting fresh water into the maximilian shaft semmler 1964 unfortunately no detailed description of the investigations has been published this is the case for many flooded underground mines with density stratification it would be helpful to bring the stratification into the context of the flooding history but this information is not readily available in most cases the pumps are simply switched off or removed and no follow up monitoring is conducted to our knowledge first precise temperature profiles were recorded by uerpmann 1980 measured over a vertical distance of 300 m at one metre intervals he described single convection cells in various water bodies of flooded shafts and took additional measurements every 5 mm in the area between two water bodies in addition he conducted one of the first experiments on artificial stratification using dyes to observe the mixing behaviour between water bodies and proposed estimated time frames required for stratification to develop he noticed that the flow velocities in the boundary layers were always orders of magnitude lower than those in the convection zones uerpmann 1980 describes that boundary layers with abrupt temperature and concentration changes represent a strong barrier to convective mass transfer ladwig et al 1984 published an extensive report describing a measurement method using downhole probes as well as how to take water samples in a flooded shaft they concluded that the upper water body is less contaminated due to the occurrence of stratification and that the static or near static water level conditions may be responsible for the observed development of water quality stratification furthermore they mention that the stratification appears to be related to discharge elevations at the time of inundation as well as present flow conditions relative positions of mined barrier pillars out fall installations and natural structural features combine to create an environment more favourable to flushing in the shallower parts of the mine system consequently they concluded that higher mineralized or contaminated water usually collects in deeper mine workings ladwig et al 1984 one of the world s first detailed studies about mine flooding and stratification with numerous sensors and depth dependant measurements were conducted within the hope germany mine flooding project this mine was actively flooded with saturated brine from a salt waste rock pile and eventually a freshwater cap cf layer formed on top of the brine accurate depth profiles and flow measurements were taken by herbert 1989 for the flooding process at this potash mine he confirmed research results from previously published articles about stratification and studied turbulent flow conditions in the flooded shaft in the 1990s and 2000s first papers on modelling stratification in flooded underground mines were published with successful simulation of convection cells in flooded shafts czolbe et al 1992 könig and blömer 1999 luckner and morgenstern 2006 rüterkamp 2001 in addition a comparison of stratification in different mines was carried out by coldewey et al 1999 with the result that the occurrence of density stratification under certain boundary conditions is a natural effect first tracer tests in flooded mines to study stratification were conducted by wolkersdorfer 1996 who identified effective velocities of up to 25 m min with an average around 1 m min wolkersdorfer et al 1997 in the past few years research has focused on the following two topics geothermal applications and using mine water stratification for the prevention of large scale mixing processes stratification might influence mine water geothermal applications and was studied by various authors bao and liu 2019a 2019b burnside et al 2016 wieber et al 2019 although this is not a new idea and was already investigated earlier by cutright 1979 taking advantage of stratification as a hydraulic or geochemical barrier to avoid the discharge of higher mineralized water thus reducing or alleviating the need for extensive mine water treatment is described in several research papers heidenreich et al 1991 kindermann 1998 melchers et al 2019 mugova and wolkersdorfer 2019a 2019b wolkersdorfer et al 2016 most of the research about stratification in flooded underground mines has been carried out in europe especially in germany great britain france the czech republic poland and north america most notably in the pennsylvanian anthracite mines research from australia focuses mainly on pit lakes and almost no research relating to mine water stratification seems to have been conducted in asia or south america large differences in the use of the terminology were encountered in the literature many publications about stratification in flooded underground mines are written in german and an exact translation of technical terms into english is not always possible in the first publication on the subject the term layering of acid water was used stuart and simpson 1961 but since 1975 the term stratification has become widely accepted cutright 1979 ladwig et al 1984 sanders and thomas inc 1975 some authors further specify the term stratification such as hydrochemical stratification nuttall and younger 2003 rapantova et al 2013 density stratification coldewey et al 1999 or thermohaline stratification bao and liu 2019b meaning more or less the same effect in addition different names for the individual mine water bodies and the area between them are used lower and upper respectively bottom and top layer or zone is commonly used ladwig et al 1984 sanders and thomas inc 1975 more precise would be terms linked to the chemical composition or perhaps the origin of the water which is ultimately responsible for the differences in density highly mineralized water kories et al 2004 heavy mineralized water or poorer quality water nuttall and younger 2003 is often used to describe the deeper water body the term wm warm mineralized is used in oceanography which can also describe the deeper water body in flooded mines ruddick and gargett 2003 in contrast a near surface water body is commonly referred to as fresh ground water kories et al 2004 wolkersdorfer 2008 clear water zone kindermann 1998 shallow sourced water less mineralized water nuttall and younger 2003 or meteoric water henkel and melchers 2017 rosner 2011 uses the term freshwater cap or freshwater lens and in oceanography the term cf cool fresh in contrast to wm warm mineralised is commonly used ruddick and gargett 2003 for a water body with similar characteristics the expression homogeneous zone is used czolbe et al 1992 a layer between homogeneous water bodies has been called transition between zones ladwig et al 1984 separation zone heidenreich et al 1991 boundary layer coldewey et al 1999 kories et al 2004 melchers et al 2014 intermediate layer wolkersdorfer 2008 as well as transition layer wieber et al 2016 however the use of the term boundary layer is incorrect because the term is already defined and describes a flowing fluid on a wall schlichting and gersten 2006 studies by the authors of this paper show that the intermediate layer is not necessarily present or it is only very thin 2 investigation methods to identify stratification 2 1 depth dependant measurements physico chemical parameters depth dependant measurements with down hole probes fig 1 or dippers are the main investigation method to identify stratification in flooded shafts rapid changes of temperature or electrical conductivity indicate a change of the water s properties and thus stratification coldewey et al 1999 cutright 1979 czolbe et al 1992 ladwig et al 1984 melchers et al 2019 if the vertical electrical conductivity profile shows a sudden increase in values the down hole probe s sensor has reached a higher mineralized water body usually separated from the overlying water body by an intermediate layer fig 2 it can be assumed that historic depth dependant measurements of physico chemical parameters pre 1990s are less precise which makes it difficult to accurately localize the boundary between the water bodies this contrasts with more recent measurements where parameters are recorded at a high spatial resolution unpublished measurements by the authors show that parameters can change considerably within centimetres distance when evaluating the measurement results it needs to be verified that the probe acclimatised prior to the start of the measurement in addition the probe s downward velocity must be slow enough to allow an adjustment to the temperature changes in the shaft water body water samples in flooded mines should be taken after recording a depth profile as the intermediate layer s depth must be considered to avoid that unrepresentative samples are taken usually various parameters are sampled and analysed such as in situ parameters and main as well as trace ions czolbe et al 1992 henkel and melchers 2017 melchers et al 2014 nuttall and younger 2003 rüterkamp 2001 snyder 2012 wieber et al 2016 wolkersdorfer 1996 zeman et al 2008 one of the more recent approaches in studying stratified mine water bodies is using geochemical in conjunction with isotopic markers to investigate the origin of the mine water melchers et al 2019 wolkersdorfer et al 2020 in most flooded mine shafts only one single stratification measurement has been conducted which does not allow a discussion of the temporal stratification development in these shafts only rarely repeated measurements with widely varying results in the same shaft exist in some cases even when additional measurements were repeated after decades the intermediate layer has not substantially changed its position in other cases yet its position has changed considerably or the stratification disappeared coldewey et al 1999 melchers et al 2019 reichart 2015 wieber et al 2016 wolkersdorfer 1996 wolkersdorfer et al 2002 another approach would be to perform continuous depth profile measurements at a shaft without changing the probe s position wolkersdorfer 1996 or fibre optic distributed temperature sensing dts as in the german eduard shaft pers comm kurt schetelig or in the french vouters shaft reichart 2015 reichart et al 2011 2 2 depth dependant measurements chemistry depth dependant mine water sampling for chemical analysis is done since 1961 stuart and simpson 1961 these authors initially lowered empty bottles into the desired depth and waited until the bottles were filled through a short open capillary pipe thereafter the bottles were hauled to the surface and the on site parameters and chemical analysis conducted with the water in these bottles instruments used for chemical sampling so far were messenger tripped bore hole or depth samplers cutright 1979 nuttall and younger 2003 and samplers with additional messenger weights to trigger a locking mechanism like conventional bacon bomb samplers erickson et al 1982 kemmerer stainless steel point samplers bao 2018 snyder 2012 or van dorn plastic point samplers with spring loaded endcaps snyder 2012 additionally samplers with electronic opening and closing mechanisms coldewey et al 1999 erickson et al 1982 rüterkamp 2001 ball valve operated samplers coldewey et al 1999 gzyl and banks 2007 snyder 2012 ruttner samplers chudy et al 2020 uerpmann 1980 wieber et al 2016 or bailers like point source bailers toran 1987 are used furthermore water samples can be collected by pumping with submersible or peristaltic pumps elliot and younger 2007 rapantova et al 2013 toran 1987 or by water sampling below the water level during the course of flooding cutright 1979 wolkersdorfer 1996 passive grab or thief samplers such as the discrete interval sampler nielsen 2006 which can take water samples up to a depth of 1200 m have successfully been used to collect depth dependant water samples in flooded spanish coal mines pers comm daniel gonzález suárez usually the volume of the water samples ranges between 0 5 and 5 l fig 3 systems in which the closing mechanism is triggered by jerking movements are not suitable for flooded shafts the closing mechanism can already be triggered by hitting shaft installations as for example described by coldewey et al 1999 older samplers with only mechanical locking mechanisms messenger weights are suitable to a certain extent but they are not designed for larger depths erickson et al 1982 ladwig et al 1984 stuart and simpson 1961 herbert and sander 1989 developed and patented a sampling device for mine shafts that are flooded with brines this device allows undisturbed sampling of the brine under ambient conditions and the measurement of on site parameters such as ph velocity of speed temperature and conductivity it was first tested and used during the hope germany mine flooding experiment if only surface water chemistry is of interest also telescopic samplers have been used to sample mine water in flooded mines 2 3 use of shaft cameras and underwater robots with underwater cameras it is possible to observe the change from murky water to clear water fig 4 and inflow from galleries and particle movement snyder 2012 stemke et al 2017 initially normal borehole cameras were used wieber et al 2019 however they are not ideal for flooded shafts only a few cameras are available that have been specifically developed for flooded underground mines equipped with powerful lamps and up to 4k image resolution stemke et al 2017 another new development is the use of mine water robots like the autonomous underwater explorer for flooded mines ux 1c from the unexmin project fernandez et al 2019 žibret and žebre 2018 this robot is equipped with navigation instrumentation such as sonar scanner and lasers as well as scientific instrumentation like temperature and pressure sensors 2 4 flow measurements in flooded mines flow measurements in flooded mines can be done in accessible galleries or in shafts in the galleries the flow measurement methods applied in surface water measurements can be used anklin et al 2003 u s department of the interior bureau of reclamation 2001 wolkersdorfer 2008 while flow measurements in the shafts or in the whole flooded mine section need specific techniques rüterkamp et al 2004 discuss selected methods suitable for flooded mines such as acoustic meters kories et al 2004 rüterkamp et al 2004 impeller current meters johnson and younger 2002 radioactive tracers czolbe et al 1992 drift tracers like microspheres or dyed spores wolkersdorfer 1996 or fluorescent dyes like na fluorescein wolkersdorfer 2008 flow measurements in analogue laboratory models such as laser doppler anemometry or thermoanemometry are described in martynenko and khramtsov 2005 knowledge about flow dynamics and flow velocities over longer distances can be gained via tracer tests furthermore it is possible to inject different tracers at different depths into the flooded mine voids wolkersdorfer 2008 tracer tests where tracers were injected below the intermediate layer have shown that the tracer cannot penetrate from the lower water body to the upper one neumann 2007 unger 2002 wackwitz 2002 laboratory investigations are another possibility to investigate stratification berthold 2009 as well as berthold and börner 2008 conducted detailed investigations for boreholes which can only partly be transferred to flooded mine shafts another study was conducted by dmt gmbh co kg using a small scale testing facility consisting of two shafts with three horizontal connections between the shafts they generated an artificial stratification of freshwater on top of highly mineralised water and simulated the influence of the geothermal gradient by using a heating element their aim was to understand mine water stratification convection flow in a shaft and convection loops in a mine coldewey et al 1999 rüterkamp 2001 based on this earlier experiment the same research group conducted a larger and more detailed one on a scale of 1 500 for a 1000 m deep mine allowing also inflow and outflow from and into the shaft frequent measurements of temperature and electrical conductivity allowed numerical cfd models and the dmt box model to be applied eckart et al 2012 eckart et al 2010 the authors of this article are currently investigating mine water stratification on a 4 6 m analogue model the agricola model mine amm several shafts and galleries are connected with each other and a geothermal gradient is simulated by heating elements in situ parameters of the water can be measured at various outlets at each model section main objectives of this experiment are to understand the flooding process of an underground mine as well as to gain new insights into the occurrence and break down of stratification mugova and wolkersdorfer 2018 a laboratory experiment used as an explanation for convection loops between shafts and galleries by wolkersdorfer 1996 was conducted by bau and torrance bau and torrance 1981a 1981b 1983 in their experiments using open and closed convection loops heated at various locations they noticed that free convection loops provide a means for circulating fluid without the use of pumps bau and torrance 1981a transferred to flooded mine shafts the geothermal gradient can be considered the heating element and the free surface of the mine water in the shafts in conjunction with the mine air the cooling element this explains the development of convection cells in the mine pools earlier experiments by creveling et al 1975 explain the temperature and velocity fluctuations that are measured when a probe is located for a while at the same location as has been observed by wolkersdorfer 1996 these fluctuations result from the turbulent flow conditions as they develop in the flooded mine shafts 2 5 numerical stratification modelling numerical modelling of flooded underground mines tries to understand the hydrodynamics in the mine pool by using numerical codes of various complexity a simple code which simulates the flooding process but not the stratification is for example the gram groundwater rebound in abandoned mineworkings code adams and younger 1997 whilst more sophisticated models are using cfd computational fluid dynamics codes to understand the flow and stratification in the mine loredo et al 2016 wolkersdorfer 2008 czolbe et al 1992 developed the finite difference code kasomo to investigate the flow in a flooded underground mine they demonstrated the barrier function of the intermediate layer in the shaft könig and blömer 1999 used the software code spring and rüterkamp et al 2004 compared differential computational fluid dynamic cfd programs for modelling stratification finally using the code cfx rüterkamp et al 2004 modelled a general approach of a flooded shaft and transferred these findings to a real mine in germany based on the results of previous analogue modelling eckart et al 2012 used cfd modelling and their box model for data from a small scale analogue model and applied it to real dimensions of a mine they concluded that modelling of the real world scenario is not possible with the computer capacities that were available at that time reichart 2015 used the cfd code comsol multiphysics for investigating flow and convection in a mine shaft he compared data from a 2d model with an existing mine shaft and used the results for a 3d model bao and liu 2019b worked with openfoam but focused on double diffusive convection associated with stratification they pointed out that stratification can only be successfully modelled with high resolution dense grit confirming conclusions by rüterkamp et al 2004 namely that layers will mix over long time if a shaft has no in or outflow numerical modelling based on mine water tracer tests were conducted by unger 2002 and hultsch 2006 using ansys flotran they were able to model the breakthrough of the tracer in the austrian georgi unterbau and the german felsendome rabenstein mines with the advance of computation capacities more sophisticated models can now be set up nonetheless modelling a fully flooded mine is still a complex task one example to identify the influence of a small scale area would be the on setting area at the shaft at which intermediate layers are often located even if the modelling focuses only on this small area the geometry is relatively complex due to the existing pit under the tilting platform for example which can strongly influence the flow velocity and flow direction likewise in a flooded mine there are usually no smooth shaft walls resulting in turbulent flow shaft installations and reinforcing components also influence the flow hence modelling in flooded mines must be viewed critically as the mine layout and thus the flow regime differs from mine to mine 3 synthesis and discussion processes 3 1 classification of hydrodynamics in flooded underground mines to understand stratification in flooded underground mines knowledge about hydrodynamic principles is relevant for example the shaft lining s roughness and the shaft furniture such as guide rails together with the mine water s velocity determine whether there is turbulent or laminar flow in the shaft water can flow upwards or downwards in the shaft and can noticeably change its flow velocity wolkersdorfer 2008 to develop an understanding of the system the authors have developed a classification for flooded underground mines table 1 which can be used to set up conceptual models of flooded underground mines the first category includes the source of the inflowing water for example precipitation water that infiltrates via the overburden into the mine a ascending water from deep aquifers b or a combination of both moreover the efflorescent salts in the mine workings could be washed out during the initial stage of the mine flooding causing mine water with an elevated mineralisation collecting in the lower parts of the mine and once the efflorescent salts are flushed away the water quality slowly improves building a layer with a better water quality on top of the higher mineralised mine water d convective flow is another category with temperature or density differences of the water causing free or natural convection a whereas free convection is described with the grashof number gr kays and crawford 1993 in eq 1 1 g r l 3 p 2 β δ t g μ 2 with l characteristic length m p fluid density kg m 3 β coefficient of thermal expansion k 1 δ t temperature difference k g gravitational acceleration m s 2 μ dynamic viscosity of fluid ns m 2 in contrast forced convection b for instance by operating pumps or a combination of both c is possible in shallow mines the geothermal gradient has little or no influence 0 but the deeper a mine the more its influence increases 1 in addition it is relevant if a mine behaves as a single shaft mine ssm or a multiple shaft mine msm mines of the msm type have a large number of interconnected shafts and working levels while ssm types usually have one or a small number of shafts with restricted hydraulic connection wolkersdorfer 2006 as the layout of a mine seems to have a decisive influence on flow velocities which in turn have an influence on stratification this classification group is relevant at a flow rate above 1 m min mainly found in multiple shaft mines m high effective velocities occur single shaft mines s usually develop small flow rates below 1 m min these categories are helpful in classifying and consequently comparing flooded underground mines using the metsämonttu mine in finland where stratification has been proven the category for this mine would be aa1mxδ water inflow from above free convection influence of geothermal gradient and multiple shaft mine diffusive convection as much as the chemical quality of the ground water in the aquifers around a mine contributes to the pre flooding water quality in the mines there seems to be no direct relationship between the ground water quality and the stratified mine water quality during or post flooding main reasons are as described in younger 1997 that the mine water quality is mainly controlled by vestigal and juvenil acidities and by efflorescent salts that are dissolved by the ground water flooding the mines only after the first flush the discharged mine water quality from the cf layer slowly reaches background ground water qualities 3 2 occurrence and stability of stratification based on the categories above it can be concluded that the conditions under which stratification occurs can vary greatly from mine to mine and that in most investigated cases stratification can be observed wolkersdorfer et al 2016 stratification occurs at different states of mine water rebound during the flooding process after completed flooding and even during ongoing pumping activities johnson and younger 2002 melchers et al 2015 nuttall and younger 2003 rapantova et al 2013 wieber et al 2016 wolkersdorfer 1996 stratification can appear in the steady state conditions of an already flooded mine shaft as well as in an instationary system while the mine is still in its flooding process coldewey et al 1999 detailed studies about these two conditions in flooded underground mines are still missing but experiments in the authors analogue mine model amm are currently under way in most investigated mines the geothermal gradient causes the mine water in the deeper sections of the mine to get warmer than in shallower sections which when the temperature difference is high enough results in free convection a counterforce to the thermal convection can be the mineralisation of the mine water which might even result in density inversions such preventing free convection numerical and analogue models showed that the water heats from the shaft wall and rises upwards along the walls martynenko and khramtsov 2005 once the ascending water reaches an anomaly for example a gallery or has already cooled down to such an extent that an ascent is no longer possible it flows back through the middle of the shaft until it reaches the shaft s sump or another water body heidenreich et al 1991 this results in density driven free convection cells which have been shown in experiments using radioactive tracers czolbe et al 1992 modelling results suggest that it might not necessarily be one large convection cell but rather many small cells called bales kories et al 2004 which is also discussed in the theoretical explanations by aigner et al 2015 könig and blömer 1999 assume that shafts with smaller diameters develop more convection cells and higher velocities eventually convection cells and therefore homogeneous water bodies develop by the interruption of the liquid movement in the shaft this interruption can be provoked by the geological conditions such as crevasses inflows or different thermal rock conductivity but also by adjacent mine workings coldewey et al 1999 czolbe et al 1992 so far no investigation observed that density stratification caused geological features to occur such as fractures or karst features in no case a direct relationship between the geological setting and the stratification could be identified except that the geological setting is responsible for the mine layout which in turn influences the stratification to a degree not known yet based on all measurements and publications reviewed the mine layout seems to be the key controlling factor for the stratification while inflows of ground water are not that relevant as much as the mineralogical composition of the host rock and the raw material will control the final water quality the stratification itself has no relation with the geological structures this is an indication that the geological setting of the mine seems to be irrelevant for the stratification per se stratification occurs at the boundary of convection cells otherwise homogeneous water bodies and can be considered stable if temperature differences above 10 k δρ 2 kg m³ total dissolved solid differences of more than 3 δρ 20 kg m³ or large differences in turbidity δρ 200 kg m³ occur kranawettreiser 1989 furthermore aigner et al 2015 distinguishes between static stratification which is caused by thermal or saline pressure differences and dynamic stratification which is caused by turbidity laden flow at the intermediate layer between two water bodies mainly molecular diffusion and minor exchange of heat and particles appears czolbe et al 1992 rüterkamp 2001 as has been shown by the laboratory experiments of uerpmann 1980 it has been shown by in situ measurements of various research groups that homogeneous water bodies can reach a thickness of several meters to hundreds of meters whereas the intermediate layer is comparably thin in literature the thickness of the intermediate layer is described as being between a few decimeters 0 6 m and 1 3 m by coldewey et al 1999 or kories et al 2004 and some meters 2 to 5 m by wieber et al 2016 or wolkersdorfer 1996 recent measurements by the authors indicate that the intermediate layer can even be thinner and that delay of the probe or smudging during the measurement could misrepresent the results wolkersdorfer 1996 mentions that the thickness could increase over time towards the sump in contrast wieber et al 2016 and rüterkamp et al 2004 describe a decrease in thickness due to inflowing surface water as per rüterkamp et al 2004 the thickness of the transition zone is influenced by the amount of inflowing and outflowing water and the location or depth of connected galleries depending on the flow velocity there is no exchange between the water body above and the water body below once the intermediate layer reaches a certain thickness aigner et al 2015 this velocities difference dependant thickness of the intermediate s layer can be represented by eq 2 2 δ x δ v 2 24 g δ p p with g gravitational acceleration m s 2 x depth m p fluid density g m 3 v velocity in each of the fluid s layers m s 1 in some cases a staircase profile of the layers was observed which can be attributed to double diffusive convection fig 5 or internal waves eckart et al 2012 radko 2013 wolkersdorfer 2008 which appears because of the diffusivity differences in heat and salinity in mine shafts it has been observed that cf wm cold fresh warm mineralised scenarios are more common than wm cf double diffusion scenarios and that the first are more stable than the latter aigner et al 2015 explain that with increasing velocity differences between the layers waves appear at the boundary between them although not specifically pertaining to the intermediate layer bao and liu 2019b describe staircase profiles in flooded shafts while reichart 2015 discusses the bénard lapwood convection cells in connection with staircase profiles with the current knowledge about mine water stratification it is not conclusively possible to predict the long term stability of stratification as it can change over time table 2 in some mines under cf wm conditions a long term stability seems to exist whilst wm cf conditions are less stable in the long term stable stratification exists when the following conditions apply 3 gebhart et al 1988 3 d d x p t p 0 with x depth m p fluid density g m 3 t temperature k p depth dependant pressure pa another approach to evaluate the stability of stratification in flooded shafts is the richardson number ri or richard s criterion which determines if two layers in a fluid will mix whereby stable conditions usually exist with ri 0 25 gebhart et al 1988 rieutord 2015 wolkersdorfer 2008 which is called miles theorem many factors are known to cause the buildup or breakdown of mine water stratification fig 6 meteoric or infiltration water can seep through the overburden or can flow directly into the mine via shafts near surface inflows can result in a layer of water with lower density sometimes called fresh or surface water cap rosner 2011 wieber et al 2016 which equals a cf over wm situation a good example for the formation of a cf layer are the hermann shafts in germany since its flooding began there have been near surface freshwater water influxes and the cf layer became thicker over time coldewey et al 1999 in the flooded ermelo colliery south africa johnstone et al 2013 describe that the higher mineralized mine water is trapped within the mine voids by a cf layer not only surface water but also rising mine water during the flooding process can result in stratification nuttall and younger 2003 this is probably closely related to an anomaly in the shaft wall during the flooding though this assumption might be possible however it is more likely that galleries or roadways connected to the shaft are of greater importance the occurrence of an intermediate layer at on setting stations was often observed flow into the shaft for example from adjacent mine workings seems to be the main cause for the development of stratification coldewey et al 1999 eckart et al 2012 rüterkamp et al 2004 on the other hand wolkersdorfer 1996 had already described convection loops or thermosiphons derived from experiments carried out by bau and torrance 1981a 1981b 1983 these convection loops between interconnected shafts and galleries could cause higher flow velocities and could be responsible for a jet stream like inflow aigner et al 2015 examples such as the hermann shafts and the sicilia shaft in germany laboratory experiments coldewey et al 1999 melchers et al 2019 and obervations during camera drives support this assumption 4 synthesis and discussion scientific relevance 4 1 processes that cause build up or breakdown of mine water stratification barriers are believed to prevent convection loops since these can break down the stratification wolkersdorfer 1996 ultimately it depends on the spatial position of the convection loops whether they result in stabilizing or destructing the stratification the same applies to infiltrating meteoric or groundwater though it favours the development of a cf layer it can also cause lower density differences between water bodies which means that the necessary density difference for a stable stratification cannot be maintained wieber et al 2016 although being more likely for single mine shafts with no direct in or outflow rain events could cause a rapid sometimes temporary collapse of the stratification external forces affecting the existing stratification can also result in its collapse these include human activities like pumping shaft measurements injections during tracer tests elliot and younger 2014 frolik 2009 wolkersdorfer 2008 or a modification of the flow path for example by installing a drainage adit in addition natural events like storm events or earthquakes can affect the mine water pool and cause a stratification breakdown wolkersdorfer 2008 breaking of dams can change the overall flow regime but also result in the formation of new convection loops nuttall and younger 2003 wolkersdorfer 2008 the same results can occur as soon as the rising mine water table drains off via a gallery or adit as observed during the flooding of the german niederschlema alberoda uranium mine wolkersdorfer 1996 jet streams can also influence the stratification in a negative way especially when they are vertical even small differences in density between the jet and the surrounding water are sufficient for effective mixing stefan and gu 1992 and can thus break down or prevent stratification within a flooded mine bao and liu 2019b used numerical modelling of a mine shaft to show that without further inflows to the shaft the number of layers reduces over time which they call a merging event this might explain the occurrence and breakdown of stratification in a short period of time moreover reichart 2015 assumes from the results of his numerical modelling that a small reversal of the temperature gradient is enough to disrupt the convection cells and thus the stratification 4 2 stratification as an in situ mitigation of mine water natural and artificial stratification in the literature several considerations have been discussed and proposed to take advantage of the barrier effect caused by mine water stratification thereunder for radioactive waste disposal in flooded salt mines heidenreich et al 1991 kindermann 1998 uerpmann 1980 in all cases the aim is to separate the mostly higher mineralised wm water body in a mine from the usually less mineralised cf water body this separation can mitigate or alleviate the need for extensive mine water treatment wolkersdorfer et al 2016 so far it is known that stratification and thus a barrier effect occurs under certain conditions but cannot be predicted reliably which does neither mean it will not occur or that stratification can t be used to help avoiding environmental impacts therefore approaches to artificially create stratification in flooded underground mines exist an example of artificial stratification in pit lakes is described by fisher and lawrence 2006 who generated a cf layer above a wm layer in a 350 m deep pit lake in the 1960s 1970s artificially creating stratification was tested by means of an infiltration test well at the maximilian shaft germany there the injected freshwater pushed the higher mineralized mine water to greater depths a cf layer formed and was stable at least between 1960 and 1972 demonstrating that artificial stratification might be a possibility rüterkamp et al 2004 semmler 1964 the idea of an artificial cf layer was reconsidered and briefly described by kories et al 2004 luckner and morgenstern 2006 as well as eckart et al 2010 but without showing any particular proposals for implementation none of the authors developed a method of how artificial stratification could be carried out in practice where the water supply could come from or if it must be supplied continuously mugova and wolkersdorfer 2019a numerical modelling by rüterkamp et al 2004 bao and liu 2019a and bao and liu 2019b indicated that the cf and wm layers could combine should freshwater not be continuously supplied another possibility to create artificial stratification is to modify the mine water flow paths through horizontal or vertical barriers wolkersdorfer 1996 this 1996 publication is based on a 3 year study of stratification in a flooded underground mine supported by the results of a tracer test and focuses specifically on man made barriers dams or bulkheads to prevent convection loops however these barriers should be installed during the closure phase so far an in situ application has not yet been constructed but it is obvious from the authors investigations and the analogue mine model results that any interruption of convection loops e g closing dams constructing barriers helps to support artificial stratification 5 conclusions and outlook although research about stratification in flooded underground mines has been conducted for many decades the number of publications on this topic is limited while the existing publications focus on the description of the subject many details especially regarding hydrodynamics are still unsolved several possibilities of how stratification can occur are described but the detailed mechanisms of stratification development in flooded underground mines is not yet solved based on the published depth profiles the transition between two water bodies occurs mainly at the on setting stations where shafts and adits connect with each other indicating a relationship between stratification and these connections however detailed studies of the flow pattern in this area have not yet been conducted in addition the current knowledge does not allow predictions at which depth or at which on setting stations the intermediate layer develops stratification also occurs between two individual connections to the shaft without a perceivable connection to adjacent mine workings this stratification may have a different evolution history further research is needed to show whether different types of stratification based either upon formation or location for example can be classified for this matter more depth dependant physico chemical and temporal measurements should be conducted in flooded underground mines and compared with existing measurements these measurements should be backed up with laboratory investigations and numerical models using e g cfd computational fluid dynamics finally not much is known about the temporal development of mine water stratification consequently it is currently not possible to predict precisely whether stratification will develop in a flooded underground mine or not though nearly all investigated mines are stratified to a certain degree to develop forecasting tools and to be able to use the barrier effects of stratification a more detailed understanding of the hydrodynamics in flooded mines is necessary as has been shown tracer tests have proven to be a suitable test method while investigations using shaft cameras provide valuable new insights in the individual flow scenarios the details of the various vertical pyhsico chemical profiles differ from each other but allow conclusions about flow patterns furthermore stratification seems to be related to the mine set up and comparisons of different mines could be important for further predictions to be able to use stratification for isolating higher mineralized mine water from discharge to receiving water courses it is important to ensure its long term stability causes for stratification breakdown must be excluded as far as possible to obtain a permanent near surface cf layer above a wm layer once the positive effects of stratification have developed be they intentionally or unintentionally caution must be taken to keep the stratification in place possible scenarios that might interfere with a stable stratification might be geothermal pumps in the mine pumping water from deeper parts of a flooded mine or the construction of dewatering adits already during mine planning the closure and potential flooding scenarios should be considered in the view of the cradle to grave concept by implementing an appropriate design the development of a stable cf wm stratification can be favoured in a flooded underground mine and thus can be used as a tool for in situ mitigation of flooded underground mines and to minimize environmental pollution by

16189,viruses giardia cysts and cryptosporidium parvum oocysts are all major causes of waterborne diseases that can be uniquely challenging in terms of inactivation removal during water and wastewater treatment and water reuse ozone is a strong disinfectant that has been both studied and utilized in water treatment for more than a century despite the wealth of data examining ozone disinfection direct comparison of results from different studies is challenging due to the complexity of aqueous ozone chemistry and the variety of the applied approaches in this systematic review an analysis of the available ozone disinfection data for viruses giardia cysts and c parvum oocysts along with their corresponding surrogates was performed it was based on studies implementing procedures which produce reliable and comparable datasets datasets were compiled and compared with the current usepa ct models for ozone additionally the use of non pathogenic surrogate organisms for prediction of pathogen inactivation during ozone disinfection was evaluated based on second order inactivation rate constants it was determined that the inactivation efficiency of ozone decreases in the following order viruses giardia cysts c parvum oocysts the usepa ct models were found to be accurate to conservative in predicting inactivation of c parvum oocysts and viruses respectively however they overestimate inactivation of giardia cysts at ozone ct values greater than 1 mg min l 1 common surrogates of these pathogens such as ms2 bacteriophage and bacillus subtilis spores were found to exhibit different inactivation kinetics to mammalian viruses and c parvum oocysts respectively the compilation of data highlights the need for further studies on disinfection kinetics and inactivation

recently in wastewater and water reuse applications burns et al 2007 gerrity et al 2012 von gunten 2018 in the united states a shift to alternative disinfectants i e non chlorine including ozonation was driven by regulations implemented by the united states environmental protection agency usepa these required drinking water utilities to optimize inactivation of protozoan pathogens and viruses

well as viruses von sonntag and von gunten 2012 however direct comparison of results from ozone disinfection studies is challenging due to the complexity of aqueous ozone chemistry in addition to the variety of different approaches utilized to conduct such studies the goal of this review is to systematically analyze available ozone disinfection literature by reviewing studies that implemented procedures producing reliable and comparable datasets specifically the review aims to evaluate a bench scale inactivation kinetics of the three regulated pathogen groups viruses giardia and cryptosporidium and their potential surrogates in buffered ultrapure water or surface water b mechanisms of inactivation and c current research needs as indicated by data gaps in the ultimate findings of this review 2 background in the united states the shift to alternative drinking water disinfectants was driven by usepa treatment regulations over time these regulations specified the required abatement of viruses giardia cysts and c parvum oocysts and defined maximum contaminant levels mcls for dbps this rigorous approach is unique to the usa and only partially applied in other countries where ozone is commonly applied as a disinfectant for drinking water treatment von sonntag and von gunten 2012 amendments to the surface water treatment rule swtr required drinking water treatment plants to achieve removal and or inactivation of at least 4 log10 for virus and 3 log10 for giardia cysts the swtr also introduced the ct concept to establish predicted pathogen inactivation levels based on the concentration of the applied disinfectant c and the contact time t which in the case of full scale systems is the retention time at which 10 of the volume has passed through the reactor basin which must be determined via tracer studies see si s 1 in response to major outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis traced back to contaminated water resources hrudey et al 2003 mac kenzie et al 1994 the interim enhanced surface water treatment rule and eventually the long term 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule lt2eswtr were introduced extending removal requirements and ct models to c parvum oocysts and requiring at least 2 log10 abatement usepa 2006 1998 despite its properties as a strong oxidant and disinfectant there are several ozone characteristics that make the study of its disinfection efficiency difficult ozone is unstable in water and decomposes rapidly thereby making it difficult to accurately measure and characterize its exposure von sonntag and von gunten 2012 furthermore ozone decomposition leads to the formation of hydroxyl radicals another powerful oxidant that can contribute to disinfection and or oxidation hoigné and bader 1975 staehelin and hoigne 1985 von gunten 2003b water quality characteristics such as ph temperature dissolved organic matter dom concentration composition among others are major drivers of ozone decay and hydroxyl radical formation during ozonation elovitz et al 2000 staehelin and hoigne 1985 hydroxyl radicals provide a significant benefit during ozonation by enhancing the oxidation of organic constituents huber et al 2003 von gunten 2003b however the impact of hydroxyl radicals on disinfection is not well established in general it is assumed that hydroxyl radical exposure can be neglected for disinfection of drinking water because of the typically high efficiency of direct ozone reactions and its diffusion limitation von gunten 2003a there are several kinetic models that can be utilized to model the inactivation of a particular organism and the proper model heavily depends on the disinfectant utilized the target organism and the method of application gyürek and finch 1998 the usepa assumes a second order or pseudo first order in certain cases rate law equation 1 to model the inactivation of viruses giardia cysts and c parvum oocysts in water 1 d n d t k n c where n is the number of viable organisms at time t c is the concentration of disinfectant at time t and k is the second order inactivation rate constant integrating the rate equation with the assumption that the disinfectant concentration remains constant over time provides a model in which the disinfectant exposure or ct concentration x contact time discussed further below can be used to predict the log reduction of pathogens 2a n 0 n d n n k c 0 t d t 2b ln n n 0 k c t or 2c l o g 10 n n 0 k ln 10 c t there are more complex models that account for non linear disinfection kinetics i e shouldering and tailing behaviors see gyürek and finch 1998 however the necessity to fit anywhere from 1 3 empirical constants with a lack of description as to what these constants physically represent makes such models difficult to apply to full scale disinfection processes therefore the second order disinfection model has been regularly utilized to estimate disinfection efficacy despite sometimes obvious and often unexplainable deviations from a linear relationship particularly when evaluating ozone disinfection some of these problems are related to the instability of ozone in water which complicates the application of the disinfection kinetic models used to describe and predict inactivation of different microorganisms one case in point is the formation of hydroxyl radicals which need to be scavenged e g by the addition of tertiary butanol t buoh or dmso when trying to isolate the contribution from ozone specifically wolf et al 2018 kinetic studies carried out in absence of such a hydroxyl radical scavenger are fundamentally problematic to determine second order inactivation rate constants furthermore ph and temperature are two factors which need to be carefully monitored because of their effect on ozone stability and inactivation kinetics von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the rapid decay of ozone makes the determination of the ct value i e ozone exposure in real reactors more complicated than simply multiplying the final residual concentration and contact time i e the effluent method which underestimates the true ozone exposure due to ozone instability in solution ozone decay can be taken into consideration for ct determination through the following 3 c t c 0 e k t where c t is the concentration of ozone at time t c0 is the initial ozone concentration and k is the first order ozone decay rate constant accounting for time dependence of c in 1 by substituting 3 into 2a and integrating results in 4 l n n n 0 k c 0 k 1 e k t which is equivalent to the area under the ozone decay curve if ozone exhibits first order decay the integral method requires the collection of a time series of ozone residual measurements throughout the reaction time for accurate calculation of the decay rate constant other methods for estimating the area under the ozone decay curve can be utilized to estimate ozone exposure particularly when ozone does not display first order decay von gunten and hoigne 1994 alternative methods of ct calculation encountered in bench scale ozone disinfection studies include calculating the geometric mean of the initial and final ozone residual and multiplying by the elapsed time which is a simple and relatively accurate method if ozone displays first order decay as described above and can also be used at full scale with respect to different reaction chambers rakness et al 2005 other methods include estimating c as the arithmetic mean of the initial and final ozone residual as well as simply substituting the final residual the variety in ct calculations among studies adds an additional layer of complexity for comparison of data more so if the ct calculation method is not specified the inactivation rate constants k utilized to predict microorganism inactivation are typically derived from bench scale studies evaluating log inactivation vs ct there are several methods for evaluating ozone disinfection at bench scale with specific implications associated with each method bench scale studies include but are not limited to true batch semi batch and quench flow reactor systems true batch tests are conducted by applying a pre determined dose of aqueous ozone to a closed batch reactor with constant agitation the aqueous ozone stock solution is produced by bubbling gaseous ozone oxygen gas mixture through ultrapure water in a chilled reactor to obtain an aqueous ozone concentration in equilibrium to the gas phase concentration according to henry s law hoigne and bader 1994 rakness 2015 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 due to the instability of ozone in aqueous solutions proper determination of ozone exposure during a batch test should include a time series of ozone residual measurements hoigne and bader 1994 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 additionally the added stock solution produces a diluting effect on the test solution which must be accounted for one limitation to batch systems is the inability to accurately characterize the initial phase of ozone decay low exposure scenarios and examining fast reacting compounds or microorganisms buffle et al 2006 hoigne and bader 1994 these problems have been addressed using continuous quench flow systems or reaction systems in which the ozone exposure was controlled by addition of an ozone reactive compound e g cinnamic acid buffle et al 2006 criquet et al 2015 czekalski et al 2016 torii et al 2020 wolf et al 2018 in quench flow systems a mixed sample ozone solution is pumped with a fixed velocity flow regime through a thin reaction tube the length of which can be altered to allow for different contact times this system is ideal for evaluating fast reacting compounds however proper implementation can be challenging and special consideration should be given to mixing and flow characteristics through the reaction tube careful calibration with known ozone reactions is required buffle et al 2006 criquet et al 2015 semi batch tests are conducted by applying ozone gas directly to the test solution allowing the system to reach steady state i e the dissolved ozone in solution remains constant with time and directly applying organism to the constant gas ozone mixture rakness 2015 ozone exposure can be estimated based on the steady state aqueous ozone residual and contact time a benefit to this approach is the reduction in effort necessary to account for ozone decay within the system additionally there is no need to account for a dilution effect that occurs when dosing with an aqueous stock solution however such systems require greater expertise for proper implementation improper design and implementation can produce misleading results for instance if the solution is not fully saturated the determined kinetics are a mixture of both ozone mass transfer and inactivation additionally for many inactivation processes the steady state concentrations in the reactor are very high and require extremely low residence times to achieve realistic ozone exposures which is often not feasible therefore the preferred method for evaluating inactivation kinetics of microorganisms by ozone is through the use of true batch systems for slower inactivating more resistant microbes such as c parvum oocysts and modified batch systems i e addition of cinnamic acid or quench flow systems for faster inactivating less resistant microbes such as viruses there are many parameters that can influence the efficacy of ozone treatment including ph temperature alkalinity and other intrinsic properties of the water matrix these parameters generally affect ozone demand decay or oxidant scavenging kinetics when ph decreases ozone becomes more stable staehelin and hoigne 1985 the role of ph with respect to inactivation of microorganisms is unclear ph can influence the surface properties of microorganisms harden and harris 1952 hsu and huang 2002 michen and graule 2010 righetti and caravaggio 1976 however the extent to which this influences reactivity with ozone is not well understood temperature also plays an important role in the stability of ozone in aqueous solutions increasing temperature increases the first order ozone decay rate which therefore reduces the stability of ozone in solution however increased temperature also increases the rate of ozone inactivation for microorganisms finch and li 1999 li et al 2001 roy et al 1982 therefore temperature changes will affect inactivation kinetics in a complex interplay between ozone stability and susceptibility of microorganisms other water quality parameters such as dissolved organic matter dom are more complex with respect to ozone stability and hence disinfection efficacy von gunten 2003b von sonntag and von gunten 2012 therefore disinfection studies in dom containing matrices can be difficult to conduct and interpret in addition interaction of microorganisms with organic matter e g coating of membranes may alter the susceptibility of microorganisms to ozone in dom heavy matrices such as wastewater it may be difficult to establish an ozone ct with low ozone doses due to rapid ozone demand decay however these low ct or sub residual dosing scenarios can still achieve inactivation of some microorganisms gerrity et al 2012 potentially necessitating alternative crediting frameworks this is also the case when ozone is supplemented with hydrogen peroxide to preferentially drive the formation of hydroxyl radicals i e advanced oxidation process drastically reducing or eliminating ozone ct acero and von gunten 2001 at the bench scale many of these issues can be avoided by using quench flow reactors to understand disinfection kinetics in the early reaction phase an empirical approach avoiding complications with ozone chemistry relies on non ct based frameworks for obtaining disinfection credit in such cases for example gamage et al 2013 and gerrity et al 2012 evaluated the correlation of non ct based parameters such as o3 doc ratio δuv254 absorbance and δtf total fluorescence with inactivation of b subtilis spores escherichia coli and ms2 during wastewater ozonation another study evaluated δuv254 absorbance and oxidation of carbamazepine as surrogate parameters to evaluate disinfection of viruses in surface water and wastewater wolf et al 2019 despite the potential value of these emerging non ct frameworks this review focuses on characterizing ozone disinfection efficacy based on the more traditional ct framework 3 methods 3 1 literature review literature was compiled with the goal of analyzing ozone disinfection efficacy for three pathogen groups regulated in water treatment i e viruses giardia cysts and c parvum oocysts and their potential surrogates web of science core collection was searched during september 2020 using search criteria containing a combination of the following key words ozon and water and inactivation or kinetics or disinfection and virus or protozoa or pathogen or bacteria or microb or adenovirus or enterovirus or calicivirus or ms2 or b subtilis or giardia or cryptosporidium articles which were peer reviewed written in english and published after the year 1980 were considered for inclusion within the review search results were subjected to an initial screening of the titles and abstracts articles were included for full text review if the title and or abstract indicated a ozone was among the disinfectants being analyzed b disinfection in water was evaluated i e excluding ozone as a surface disinfectant or in the gas phase and c microbial inactivation was analyzed i e excluding proxies for microbial disinfection the materials methods sections of selected articles were evaluated via random assignment between three reviewers the evaluated articles were

water matrix i e buffered ultra purified water vs surface water vs wastewater ph ranges of 5 8 use of hydroxyl radical scavengers the publications which evaluated disinfection kinetics in buffered ultra purified water or surface water in batch or quench flow reactors at bench scale were selected for further analyses due to the aforementioned complexities of ozone in dom heavy matrices studies evaluating wastewater were excluded articles which evaluated inactivation mechanisms of ozone for the different pathogen groups were also selected for further review articles that did not fall into either of these categories were omitted from the review the reviewing process and the applied selection criteria are summarized in figure s1 additionally while the core literature search was performed in september 2020 there were no additional relevant publications identified in a subsequent search spanning september 2020 through january 2022 3 2 data analysis to explore the state of the art of bench scale inactivation of viruses giardia cysts and c parvum oocysts by ozone analyses of log10 inactivation as a function of ozone ct exposure as well as reported inactivation rate constants were

manuscript ct was calculated to the best of our ability using the provided residual data c proper implementation of the batch reactor or quench flow reactor set up d utilization of methods which

comparison of ozone ct exposure values and corresponding survival ratios provided as log10 n n0 and second order inactivation rate constants k if applicable ozone ct data and second order inactivation rate constants were extracted directly from the article if ozone ct data were provided calculated using the integral ct method this value was prioritized otherwise priority was given in the following order geometric mean ct arithmetic mean ct select studies which only provided ct information in such form final residual effluent ct if not provided in a study second order inactivation rate constants

inactivation slope i e k could not be determined statistically different p 0 05 from 0 the dataset was excluded if the regression model had a non significant p 0 05 y intercept the model was fitted through the origin otherwise the y intercept model was accepted under the assumption that a positive y intercept provides a more conservative estimate of inactivation based on the resulting reduced slope and a negative y intercept indicates the presence of a lag phase data which contained a significant lag phase i e a phase in which no inactivation occurs despite of ozone ct exposure were fitted

discussion 4 1 literature review and data analysis the aforementioned search criteria yielded 1 399 articles which were subsequently reviewed through several iterations figure s1 this ultimately resulted in 28 articles from which inactivation vs ozone ct exposure data and or second order inactivation rate constants were extracted as well as 10 articles that evaluated ozone inactivation mechanisms for specific pathogen groups datasets from each organism were separated into three temperature ranges 1 9 c 10 19 c and 20 25 c the ph examined in the different datasets ranged from 5 8 due to the overall lack of data datasets with and without hydroxyl radical scavengers were ultimately grouped together which could introduce an additional source of variation within datasets even though the contribution of hydroxyl radical to inactivation is likely minimal 4 2 inactivation of viruses while viruses encompass a variety of morphologies that may influence their resistance to disinfectants sigstam et al 2013 to remain consistent with usepa categorization all mammalian virus data were compiled together regardless of viral species for analyses of mammalian virus surrogates bacteriophage data were analyzed separately six studies met inclusion criteria for the development of log10 inactivation plots and or inactivation rate constant compilation helmer and finch 1993 lim et al 2010 sigmon et al 2015 torii et al 2020 wolf et al 2018 young et al 2020 six mammalian viruses were evaluated including coxsackieviruses b3 and b5 laboratory and environmental strains poliovirus 1 echovirus 11 human adenovirus 2 and murine norovirus bacteriophages ms2 fr qβ ga φx174 t4 t1 and prd1 were evaluated all inactivation data were collected using cell culture most probable number mpn or plaque assays respective to each virus type experiments were conducted in either batch or quench flow reactors fig 1 a d provide an overview of the compiled log10 inactivation of viruses as a function of ozone ct i e exposure for three temperature ranges overall viruses are highly reactive with ozone indicating that efficient inactivation occurs even at very low ozone ct exposure the usepa models shown as dashed line in fig 1a d provide a conservative estimate of virus inactivation underestimating inactivation in most cases the usepa model was developed using data from roy et al 1982 who evaluated poliovirus inactivation using a cstr because of the reactor setup this study did not pass our article selection process and was therefore not analyzed torii et al 2020 discussed the shortcomings in how the data from this study was utilized for usepa models including the use of the average hydraulic residence time as a substitution for the contact time which would lead to an overestimation of ozone ct exposure hydraulic considerations combined with incomplete mixing and the additional safety factor of 3 applied by the usepa may account for the overly conservative nature of the model the data points which cluster directly at or below the usepa models for temperatures ranging from 20 25 c fig 1c belong to a single study examining murine norovirus inactivation these data imply that murine noroviruses may be relatively less susceptible to ozone inactivation than other mammalian viruses however the ozone ct exposure values determined from this study may be inaccurate specifically the study suggests that with ozone decay constants upwards of 5 min 1 and an applied ozone dose of 1 mg l 1 there was still measurable ozone residual at the end of the experimental contact times greater than two minutes with these parameters a residual ozone concentration of 4 5 10 5 mg l can be calculated which is far below the detection for ozone in aqueous solution eq 3 bader and hoigné 1981 this may indicate potential interferences in the ozone residual measurements or other issues with the experimental set up which would lead to less reliable ozone decay data nevertheless as the only representative of the virus family caliciviridae which contains notable human pathogen human norovirus it was necessary to include the data in this review interestingly mammalian viruses appear slightly more resistant to ozone than most bacteriophages at all temperature ranges figures s2a b si indicate that bacteriophage ms2 and closely related ssrna phages fr ga qβ blue symbols in figure s2 are the least resistant to ozone while the dna phages t4 prd1 and φx174 are more resistant red symbols in figure s2 bacteriophages particularly ms2 are often utilized as surrogates for enteric mammalian virus inactivation during water wastewater treatment due to the ease of culturing and enumeration as compared to mammalian viruses amarasiri et al 2017 the results from our assessment indicate that ms2 may provide a slight overestimation of viral pathogen inactivation by ozone bacteriophage t4 or φx174 may be more suitable for conservatively predicting virus inactivation by ozone however further research is necessary the apparent differences in resistance towards ozone between bacteriophages and mammalian viruses are reflected within the compiled second order inactivation rate constants k particularly at lower temperatures table 1 inactivation rate constants for bacteriophages are 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than for mammalian viruses at temperatures from 1 19 c though this is based on a low number of data points n 4 for mammalian viruses n 5 for bacteriophages this pattern of the range persists at 20 25 c however the median values between the two datasets are comparable 2 3 4 7 x 103 mg 1 min 1 l when broken down by individual datasets table 2 the majority of the second order rate constants for both bacteriophages and mammalian viruses fall in the range of 103 104 mg 1 min 1 l for 20 25 c second order rate constants outside of this range correspond to bacteriophages ms2 and qβ on the higher end 1 2 3 1 x 104 mg 1 min 1 l and the mammalian coxsackievirus b5 and murine norovirus at the lower end 0 33 6 1 x 102 mg 1 min 1 l as previously described the second order rate constants associated with murine norovirus should be treated with caution disregarding murine norovirus the higher and lower range of second order inactivation rate constants are all associated with replicate datasets ms2 qβ and coxsackievirus b5 all have additional measured second order inactivation rate constants which fall within 103 104 mg 1 min 1 l many of the second order inactivation rate constants were determined in studies utilizing either traditional batch systems or highly sophisticated systems which allow for the evaluation of very low ct ranges 0 01 mg min l 1 torii et al 2020 wolf et al 2018 young et al 2020 the differences between these reactor systems may influence the variability experienced within the datasets however it should be noted that second order rate constants for the reactions between ozone and specific chemical species have been shown to vary up to a factor of 5 for different studies von sonntag and von gunten 2012 therefore the variability determined within the virus dataset up to 8 fold within the same viral species is not too outstanding the slight differences in susceptibility between viral groups may be explained through inactivation mechanisms due to the differences in capsid morphology genome composition and replication mechanisms for different virus groups e g enteroviruses caliciviruses coliphages etc it is impossible to assign a singular ozone inactivation mechanism for viruses as a generalized group at this stage of the knowledge studies evaluating ozone inactivation mechanisms for the viral genus enterovirus family pircornaviridae are the most abundant roy et al 1981 found rna damage to account for the majority of inactivation for poliovirus 1 torrey et al 2019 came to a similar conclusion for echovirus 11 which was additionally confirmed by young et al 2020 for coxsackievirus b5 results from this study also indicate that multiple genome hits are likely required for inactivation of echovirus 11 and coxsackievirus b5 despite this capsid damage cannot be fully ignored as a potential contributor to ozone inactivation as current methodologies limit the ability to fully differentiate between the two it is possible that differences in capsid composition morphology may be an important factor for the differences in inactivation kinetics between genetically similar isolates of the same viruses determined in torii et al 2021 ozone inactivation mechanisms for viruses relevant to public health outside of picornaviridae such as human adenoviruses and caliciviruses have yet to be determined in contrast kim et al 1980 was able to confirm capsid damage during ozone treatment of bacteriophage f2 though due to the analytical limitations of the time it cannot be concluded that this is the primary inactivation mechanisms of ozone over genome damage bacteriophage f2 along with bacteriophage fr are no longer considered distinct virus species and have since been merged into the viral species ms2 van regenmortel et al 2000 therefore it is appropriate to interpret these results as descriptive of ms2 ms2 belongs to the viral family fiersviridae formerly leviviridae which includes other closely related ssrna bacteriophages in this review such as qβ and ga callanan et al 2020 stockdale et al 2020 further research utilizing updated methods for ms2 and closely related bacteriophages could potentially explain their increased susceptibility to ozone disinfection compared to enteroviruses dna bacteriophages φx174 t4 and prd1 which behaved more similar to the mammalian viruses are all taxonomically distinct from ms2 and other members of fiersviridae up to the order of virus realm ictv 2020 therefore it is inappropriate to assume that ozone inactivation mechanisms for these particular bacteriophages would be similar without further investigations in general more research is needed to explore the inactivation mechanisms and kinetics of dna phages as well as mammalian dna viruses such as human adenoviruses based on similar inactivation mechanisms and kinetics a better surrogate than ms2 could be selected to assess viral inactivation during ozonation 4 3 inactivation of giardia spp seven studies investigating inactivation of giardia spp met the specific analysis criteria for extracting log10 inactivation vs ozone ct exposure data finch et al 1993b haas and kaymak 2003 labatiuk et al 1994 1992a 1992b 1991 li et al 2004 of these seven studies only two second order inactivation rate constants are available for review haas and kaymak 2003 labatiuk et al 1992a the majority of studies evaluated giardia muris a surrogate for the human pathogen giardia lamblia g muris is advantageous in the laboratory setting as it is non pathogenic to humans and maintains reproducible patterns of infection in mouse models belosevic and faubert 1983 there is conflicting evidence of the relative resistance of g muris compared to g lamblia with some studies indicating higher resistance to ozone wickramanayake et al 1985 while others finding no statistical differences finch et al 1993b three different methods in vivo mouse and gerbil models and in vitro excystation were utilized to quantify giardia survival ratios in the selected studies which could lead to variability in study conclusions labatiuk et al 1991 however due to the overall lack of available data studies using either of these methods were included for evaluation compiled log10 inactivation vs ozone ct exposure data at different temperature ranges are provided in fig 2 a c all three temperature ranges indicate significant inactivation of g muris cysts in the lower ct ranges 1 mg min l 1 with a tailing effect for higher ozone exposures this effect is apparent regardless of the experimental matrix because of the tailing effect the usepa models dashed lines in fig 2 overestimate inactivation of giardia cysts for an ozone ct 1 2 mg min l 1 for most temperatures the usepa model was developed from a single study that did not pass through the systematic review protocol due to its use of a semi batch reactor set up wickramanayake et al 1985 usepa 1991 additionally this study was performed at a single temperature 5 c which was used for extrapolation of inactivation models to higher temperatures based on the limited dataset used to develop the model it is expected that it does not accurately predict giardia cyst inactivation for the data analyzed in this review this tailing effect highlights one of the weaknesses of utilizing a linear kinetic model for predicting inactivation the two available second order inactivation rate constants for g muris cysts are provided in table 3 the values differ by over a factor of 10 and seemingly indicate higher efficiency at lower temperatures however it should be noted that the second order inactivation rate constant for t 10 19 c haas and kaymak 2003 was determined at very low ct values all 1 mg min l 1 and therefore is reflective of the initial rapid inactivation phase evident prior to tailing the data used to calculate second order rate constants for t 20 25 c from labatiuk et al 1992a examined higher ct values and therefore exhibited considerable tailing which resulted in a poor model fit r2 0 374 omitting data points influenced by tailing increased the second order rate constant to 3 73 mg 1 min 1 l but remains almost exactly one order of magnitude lower than the second order rate constants determined by haas and kaymak 2003 the compiled data indicate that a linear kinetic model may be inappropriate for estimating inactivation of giardia cysts by ozone at higher ct exposure studies examining the mechanism of giardia cyst inactivation have reported that ozone produces severe degradation of the inner membranous layer of the cyst wall irregular vacuole formation and detachment of the trophozoite within the cyst li et al 2004 these changes in cyst morphology were consistent with cyst inactivation however it remains unclear if the observed tailing effect is related to the inactivation mechanism by ozone labatiuk et al 1992b determined that giardia cysts are rapidly inactivated within the first two minutes of ozonation with little inactivation occurring thereafter even in the presence of considerable ozone residual additionally it was observed that ozone decreased in efficiency with lower concentrations of giardia cysts which would be the scenario encountered after the rapid initial inactivation haas and kaymak 2003 regardless of the potential cause of the tailing effect it is evident that at least 1 log10 inactivation of giardia cysts can be obtained by an ozone exposure of 1 mg min l 1 4 4 inactivation of cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and surrogates eight studies met the criteria for inclusion for log10 inactivation vs ozone ct exposure analysis of c parvum oocysts cho and yoon 2007 craik et al 2003 finch et al 1993a finch and li 1999 gyurek et al 1999 lewin et al 2001 li et al 2001 wohlsen et al 2007 with six of the studies reporting second order inactivation rate constants cho and yoon 2007 craik et al 2003 finch et al 1993a gyurek et al 1999 lewin et al 2001 li et al 2001 the evaluated studies utilized either in vivo mouse models or in vitro excystation to quantify inactivation of c parvum oocysts in studies where both in vivo and in vitro methods were utilized in vivo data were preferentially selected for analysis due to evidence of in vitro methods underestimating inactivation bukhari et al 2000 finch et al 1993a while the studies specifically utilized c parvum the stocks were largely obtained from different sources or batches in addition to c parvum oocysts data evaluating disinfection of bacillus subtilis spores from nine studies were also evaluated to assess its potential as a surrogate for c parvum oocysts cho et al 2006 2003a 2003b 2002 choi et al 2007 craik et al 2002 dow et al 2006 driedger et al 2001 c parvum oocyst inactivation data for three temperature ranges are provided in fig 3 a c c parvum oocysts exhibit greater resistance to ozone than both viruses and giardia the data do not provide evidence of a lag phase or tailing at low or high ozone cts respectively the usepa models dashed lines are closely aligned with the inactivation data from the compiled studies providing the most accurate prediction of inactivation of the three selected pathogen group models the model overpredicts c parvum oocyst inactivation for 8 of the 135 total data points even though this is a good agreement it is unclear if these deviations from the model are due to natural variability of the organism thus indicating the model is not conservative to oocyst inactivation or due to variability in experimental methods the usepa model for c parvum oocysts was developed from the data of four studies li et al 2001 oppenheimer et al 2000 owens et al 2000 rennecker et al 1999 only one of the four studies was included in our analysis li et al 2001 as the remainder of the studies either utilized semi batch systems evaluated inactivation at pilot scale or were not published in a peer reviewed article i e only project report all of which were selective constraints of the literature review process in this article the c parvum oocyst inactivation models developed by usepa utilized a less stringent safety factor due to concerns related to bromate formation therefore it is expected that the model would provide a less conservative prediction of inactivation in comparison to the virus model the inactivation efficiency of b subtilis during ozonation was also examined fig 3d f blue symbols in contrast to c parvum oocysts there is an apparent shouldering or inactivation lag phase at each temperature this lag phase appears to change with temperature but with no clear pattern i e the lag phase in the 10 19 c range appears larger than both 5 9 c and 20 25 c despite a clear temperature relationship determined in driedger et al 2001 this could be due to the grouping of data regardless of ph which has been previously demonstrated to influence the lag phase cho et al 2003b 2003a 2002 dow et al 2006 it is also possible that additional water quality parameters may be influencing the lag dow et al 2006 evaluated parameters influencing the lag phase of b subtilis inactivation and did not find any significant influence of bulk doc concentration or turbidity however differences in dom composition were not considered it is currently unclear which water quality parameter if any may be influencing the extent of the lag phase table 4 provides second order inactivation rate constants for both c parvum oocysts and b subtilis spores respectively using either the second order linear model or delayed chick watson model overall second order inactivation rate constants for c parvum oocysts are much lower than for viruses or giardia cysts indicating that it is much more resistant to ozone in addition to second order rate constants in buffered solutions values in various synthetic or natural surface waters are also provided for each organism based on limited data for both c parvum oocysts and b subtilis spores it is not clear that natural or synthetic surface water significantly influences the inactivation rate the median second order inactivation rate constants for both organisms in natural synthetic surface water fall within the ranges determined in buffered solutions albeit this is based on very limited data in the case of c parvum oocysts to evaluate b subtilis spores as a surrogate for c parvum oocyst inactivation the ozone ct exposure for 2 log10 inactivation were calculated using the respective inactivation models for direct comparison for the temperature range of 20 25 c a ct exposure of 4 8 8 8 mg min l 1 would be necessary for 2 log10 inactivation of c parvum oocysts however for b subtilis a ct ranging from 0 4 to 12 6 mg min l 1 is required the wide variety of factors influencing b subtilis spore inactivation exclude it as a surrogate for c parvum oocyst inactivation in agreement with driedger et al 2001 the consistent lag phase for b subtilis spores but not c parvum oocysts may provide potential evidence of different ozone inactivation mechanisms shouldering can be indicative of a multiple hit inactivation mechanism in which multiple areas of an organism must be damaged by the disinfectant prior to its inactivation kimball 1953 the shouldering phase dissipates once the necessary number of targets are destroyed within the organism usually leading to an exponential phase of inactivation this contrasts with a single hit mechanism in which the destruction of one target results in the inactivation of the organism i e exponential disinfection begins immediately upon application it has been found that the inner membrane of the b subtilis spore is likely the site of lethal damage with ozone damage to the spore coat likely necessary prior to destruction of the inner membrane young and setlow 2004 however it cannot be ruled out that the damage to the inner membrane is limited by ozone diffusion through the spore coat regardless the ultimate effect remains the same in which the spore coat provides an initial resistance to disinfection resulting in a perceived lag phase and thus supports the use of a delayed chick watson model the mechanism of ozone inactivation for c parvum oocysts has not been evaluated previously to the best of our knowledge the oocyst wall is likely composed of an outer glycocalyx layer followed by a lipid hydrocarbon layer a layer of cysteine rich proteins and ultimately a structural polysaccharide layer underneath which exists the sporozoite jenkins et al 2010 the c parvum sporozoite cannot survive without its oocyst and it is unable to complete its life cycle until it reaches the gut of a host excysts and attaches to intestinal lining smith et al 2005 encysting is a lifecycle requirement for c parvum this is in contrast with b subtilis which can freely exist as a vegetative bacterial cell without its spore spore formation is a survival mechanism for low nutrient environmental conditions sella et al 2014 these differences in life cycles and the ensuing differences in cell structures likely influence the discrepancy in ozone inactivation kinetics between the two distinct organisms interestingly studies have determined that in vitro excystation predicts less inactivation of c parvum oocysts when compared to in vivo mouse models for similar ozone exposures bukhari et al 2000 finch et al 1993a i e some sporozoites successfully excyst when provided gut mimicking conditions however they may lack the capability of completing their life cycle once excysted this could indicate damage to the sporozoite by ozone however further research would be necessary to verify this in contrast to previous studies the results from this review did not indicate a large discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro methods figure s3 si 4 5 limitations of previous studies and research needs in this review there were several limitations associated with the comparison of inactivation data from different sources first and foremost a large portion of disinfection studies were excluded during the review process due to the use of non batch or non quench flow reactor designs in particular many of the excluded bench scale studies utilized semi batch reactors this drastically reduced the number of studies for data extraction 69 of 210 articles omitted for this reason semi batch reactors were excluded from examination due to the inherent difficulty in proper application of such systems finch et al 2001 moreover as a reviewer it can be difficult to assess proper implementation of semi batch systems due to the limited information provided within manuscripts a more unified approach to studying ozone disinfection kinetics would help to increase the availability of comparable data produced in future studies in studies utilizing similar approaches there were still many systematic differences that made comparison difficult such as differences in reactor volumes utilized 5 ml to 5 l and ozone residual measurement methods direct absorbance at 260 nm vs indigo trisulfonate at 600 nm the use of hydroxyl radical scavengers table s1 additionally the purity level of the microbial stocks can influence results and skew interpretation due to the interactions between the organic matter present in microbial growth media and ozone mesquita et al 2010 wolf et al 2018 furthermore the method in which ozone ct is determined can influence data interpretation of the 1 038 data points collected for log10 inactivation vs ozone ct 72 data points had sufficient information to estimate ozone ct using the four methods encountered in this review integral geometric mean final residual and arithmetic mean assuming integration of the ozone residual curve provides the most accurate estimation of ozone exposure comparison of this value with the alternative approaches determined that the geometric mean ct method provided the closest estimate of ct exposure based on residual sum of squares fig 4 demonstrates the ability of the geometric mean ct method to accurately estimate the ozone exposure which is to be expected as long as ozone exhibits first order decay in a specific matrix and there is a final residual ozone concentration 0 gyürek and finch 1998 in contrast as shown in fig 4 the arithmetic mean overestimates and the final residual effluent method underestimates the ozone exposure while arithmetic mean deviates less from the integral method when compared to the effluent method it requires the same input values as the geometric mean i e c0 c and t therefore there is no practical reason to utilize the arithmetic over the geometric mean figure s4 si provides a conceptual overview of the different ozone ct estimation methods it should be mentioned that while we have demonstrated only slight deviations in the different ct estimation methods these quick estimation methods begin to deviate considerably with increasing ozone decay rates such as those seen during wastewater treatment therefore it is not recommended to employ these estimation methods under such conditions if an ozone decay curve cannot be collected for whatever reason a more accurate estimation consists of estimating the first order ozone decay rate constant with the initial and final ozone residual concentration measurements and time elapsed between the two 10 k l n c c 0 t the calculated value for k can then be substituted into 4 however this method also requires an assumption of first order ozone decay integration of an ozone residual time series is recommended as best practice studies were also eliminated if they did not provide sufficient information to confidently compare either log10 inactivation and ct or second order inactivation rate constants either through lack of ozone decay data missing pertinent water quality data i e temperature ph etc lack of sufficient reactor set up description improper microbiological data reporting among others it is recommended that ozone disinfection studies should provide the water quality and system characteristics previously described in hoigné 1994 and hoigné and bader 1994 as necessary for general ozone related studies such characteristics include water temperature ph doc concentration alkalinity among others additionally disinfection studies should provide organism strain identifier cultivation and purification techniques initial spike concentrations and particularly the method used to handle data which fall below limits of detection i e avoiding substitution with detection limit while the evaluation of virus inactivation via ozone has progressed through time with increasingly sophisticated techniques studies on giardia cysts and c parvum oocysts have stalled with the most recent publications meeting our selection criteria published more than 14 years ago after several outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis initially spurred interest in this topic fox and lytle 1996 support for such research waned and is still currently lacking this is likely in large part due to limitations in cultivating and assessing viability of each organism which require in vivo animal models however particularly in the case of giardia which deviated the furthest from the usepa models based on data within this review new data would be of great benefit particularly in discerning the cause of the apparent tailing effect similarly ozone inactivation kinetics evaluated at varying temperature ranges were sparse with the majority of studies included within this review evaluating inactivation at 20 25 c furthermore very few studies evaluated inactivation at varying temperatures within the same study as described previously systematic differences between studies make direct comparisons of data difficult therefore it is difficult to provide confident assertations regarding the effect of temperature on disinfection efficacy based on these studies alone once again this was strikingly evident for giardia cysts in which k values for the 10 19 c range appear significantly larger than the 20 25 c which is contrary to what might be expected there is a lack of mechanistic explanations for the different inactivation kinetics exhibited by the different organisms largely due to the lack of studies evaluating inactivation mechanisms of ozone in general particularly for encysted protozoans ozone inactivation mechanisms are summarized in fig 5 however there have been advances in the study of viral inactivation mechanisms torrey et al 2019 and young et al 2020 provide novel methodologies for estimating viral inactivation mechanisms particularly relating to genome destruction these methods could be applied to other virus species and potentially validate the differences in inactivation mechanisms between ms2 and closely related bacteriophages and other ssrna mammalian viruses as well as provide justification for potentially better surrogate candidates such as φx174 or t4 it is important to recognize that while the reported kinetics of surrogate bacteriophages and mammalian viruses appear to deviate from one another when compared to ct requirements for giardia cysts and c parvum oocysts those apparent differences become negligible fig 6 specifically drinking water systems designed for 2 log10 inactivation of c parvum oocysts will require a significant ozone ct exposure i e much greater than 1 mg min l 1 which would ensure considerable inactivation of mammalian viruses and bacteriophages 2 log10 at 20 c however in situations where little to no ozone exposure is achieved such as in sub residual water reuse applications or with ozone aop i e supplemented with h2o2 these differences could become relevant and thus further exploration into alternate virus surrogates is warranted particularly with the increasing interest in ozone for water reuse applications and the significant virus inactivation requirements in such systems 5 conclusions based on a critical review of ozone disinfection the following conclusions can be drawn ozone is an effective disinfectant against chlorine resistant pathogens such as c parvum oocysts can effectively inactivate other pathogens such as giardia cysts and performs rapidly against viruses usepa models which were developed more recently using multiple datasets c parvum oocysts were more accurate than earlier models developed using a single dataset viruses and giardia cysts comparison of the data compiled in this review suggests the need for improvements in usepa models for viruses and giardia cysts further research on the applicability of non pathogenic surrogates such as ms2 and b subtilis spores is necessary the data compiled in this review indicate that these organisms do not accurately reflect the behavior of the pathogens they represent studies directly evaluating pathogenic organisms are costly and time consuming therefore further investigation of appropriate surrogates may help advance the knowledge and ultimately the prediction of ozone disinfection greater emphasis should be placed on minimizing differences in ozone disinfection study approaches and development of standard protocols this would allow for better comparability between studies and allow for greater consensus on ozone inactivation of pathogens declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

16189,viruses giardia cysts and cryptosporidium parvum oocysts are all major causes of waterborne diseases that can be uniquely challenging in terms of inactivation removal during water and wastewater treatment and water reuse ozone is a strong disinfectant that has been both studied and utilized in water treatment for more than a century despite the wealth of data examining ozone disinfection direct comparison of results from different studies is challenging due to the complexity of aqueous ozone chemistry and the variety of the applied approaches in this systematic review an analysis of the available ozone disinfection data for viruses giardia cysts and c parvum oocysts along with their corresponding surrogates was performed it was based on studies implementing procedures which produce reliable and comparable datasets datasets were compiled and compared with the current usepa ct models for ozone additionally the use of non pathogenic surrogate organisms for prediction of pathogen inactivation during ozone disinfection was evaluated based on second order inactivation rate constants it was determined that the inactivation efficiency of ozone decreases in the following order viruses giardia cysts c parvum oocysts the usepa ct models were found to be accurate to conservative in predicting inactivation of c parvum oocysts and viruses respectively however they overestimate inactivation of giardia cysts at ozone ct values greater than 1 mg min l 1 common surrogates of these pathogens such as ms2 bacteriophage and bacillus subtilis spores were found to exhibit different inactivation kinetics to mammalian viruses and c parvum oocysts respectively the compilation of data highlights the need for further studies on disinfection kinetics and inactivation mechanisms by ozone to better fit inactivation models as well as for proper selection of surrogate organisms graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words ozone disinfection cryptosporidium giardia virus pathogen 1 introduction ozone has been widely applied as a disinfectant for water treatment for more than a century rakness 2015 von gunten 2003a von sonntag and von gunten 2012 and more recently in wastewater and water reuse applications burns et al 2007 gerrity et al 2012 von gunten 2018 in the united states a shift to alternative disinfectants i e non chlorine including ozonation was driven by regulations implemented by the united states environmental protection agency usepa these required drinking water utilities to optimize inactivation of protozoan pathogens and viruses relative to the potential formation of disinfection byproducts dbps primarily related to chlorine disinfection usepa 2006 1999 1991 moreover ozone treatment provides auxiliary benefits including transformation of bulk organic matter and oxidation of trace organics and taste and odor compounds camel and bermond 1998 lee et al 2013 lee and von gunten 2016 von gunten 2003b von sonntag and von gunten 2012 viruses giardia cysts and cryptosporidium parvum oocysts are all major causes of waterborne diseases that can be uniquely challenging in terms of inactivation removal during water and wastewater treatment and water reuse betancourt 2019 efstratiou et al 2017 leclerc et al 2002 soller et al 2017 ozone is acknowledged as an effective disinfectant for bacteria encysted protozoans as well as viruses von sonntag and von gunten 2012 however direct comparison of results from ozone disinfection studies is challenging due to the complexity of aqueous ozone chemistry in addition to the variety of different approaches utilized to conduct such studies the goal of this review is to systematically analyze available ozone disinfection literature by reviewing studies that implemented procedures producing reliable and comparable datasets specifically the review aims to evaluate a bench scale inactivation kinetics of the three regulated pathogen groups viruses giardia and cryptosporidium and their potential surrogates in buffered ultrapure water or surface water b mechanisms of inactivation and c current research needs as indicated by data gaps in the ultimate findings of this review 2 background in the united states the shift to alternative drinking water disinfectants was driven by usepa treatment regulations over time these regulations specified the required abatement of viruses giardia cysts and c parvum oocysts and defined maximum contaminant levels mcls for dbps this rigorous approach is unique to the usa and only partially applied in other countries where ozone is commonly applied as a disinfectant for drinking water treatment von sonntag and von gunten 2012 amendments to the surface water treatment rule swtr required drinking water treatment plants to achieve removal and or inactivation of at least 4 log10 for virus and 3 log10 for giardia cysts the swtr also introduced the ct concept to establish predicted pathogen inactivation levels based on the concentration of the applied disinfectant c and the contact time t which in the case of full scale systems is the retention time at which 10 of the volume has passed through the reactor basin which must be determined via tracer studies see si s 1 in response to major outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis traced back to contaminated water resources hrudey et al 2003 mac kenzie et al 1994 the interim enhanced surface water treatment rule and eventually the long term 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule lt2eswtr were introduced extending removal requirements and ct models to c parvum oocysts and requiring at least 2 log10 abatement usepa 2006 1998 despite its properties as a strong oxidant and disinfectant there are several ozone characteristics that make the study of its disinfection efficiency difficult ozone is unstable in water and decomposes rapidly thereby making it difficult to accurately measure and characterize its exposure von sonntag and von gunten 2012 furthermore ozone decomposition leads to the formation of hydroxyl radicals another powerful oxidant that can contribute to disinfection and or oxidation hoigné and bader 1975 staehelin and hoigne 1985 von gunten 2003b water quality characteristics such as ph temperature dissolved organic matter dom concentration composition among others are major drivers of ozone decay and hydroxyl radical formation during ozonation elovitz et al 2000 staehelin and hoigne 1985 hydroxyl radicals provide a significant benefit during ozonation by enhancing the oxidation of organic constituents huber et al 2003 von gunten 2003b however the impact of hydroxyl radicals on disinfection is not well established in general it is assumed that hydroxyl radical exposure can be neglected for disinfection of drinking water because of the typically high efficiency of direct ozone reactions and its diffusion limitation von gunten 2003a there are several kinetic models that can be utilized to model the inactivation of a particular organism and the proper model heavily depends on the disinfectant utilized the target organism and the method of application gyürek and finch 1998 the usepa assumes a second order or pseudo first order in certain cases rate law equation 1 to model the inactivation of viruses giardia cysts and c parvum oocysts in water 1 d n d t k n c where n is the number of viable organisms at time t c is the concentration of disinfectant at time t and k is the second order inactivation rate constant integrating the rate equation with the assumption that the disinfectant concentration remains constant over time provides a model in which the disinfectant exposure or ct concentration x contact time discussed further below can be used to predict the log reduction of pathogens 2a n 0 n d n n k c 0 t d t 2b ln n n 0 k c t or 2c l o g 10 n n 0 k ln 10 c t there are more complex models that account for non linear disinfection kinetics i e shouldering and tailing behaviors see gyürek and finch 1998 however the necessity to fit anywhere from 1 3 empirical constants with a lack of description as to what these constants physically represent makes such models difficult to apply to full scale disinfection processes therefore the second order disinfection model has been regularly utilized to estimate disinfection efficacy despite sometimes obvious and often unexplainable deviations from a linear relationship particularly when evaluating ozone disinfection some of these problems are related to the instability of ozone in water which complicates the application of the disinfection kinetic models used to describe and predict inactivation of different microorganisms one case in point is the formation of hydroxyl radicals which need to be scavenged e g by the addition of tertiary butanol t buoh or dmso when trying to isolate the contribution from ozone specifically wolf et al 2018 kinetic studies carried out in absence of such a hydroxyl radical scavenger are fundamentally problematic to determine second order inactivation rate constants furthermore ph and temperature are two factors which need to be carefully monitored because of their effect on ozone stability and inactivation kinetics von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the rapid decay of ozone makes the determination of the ct value i e ozone exposure in real reactors more complicated than simply multiplying the final residual concentration and contact time i e the effluent method which underestimates the true ozone exposure due to ozone instability in solution ozone decay can be taken into consideration for ct determination through the following 3 c t c 0 e k t where c t is the concentration of ozone at time t c0 is the initial ozone concentration and k is the first order ozone decay rate constant accounting for time dependence of c in 1 by substituting 3 into 2a and integrating results in 4 l n n n 0 k c 0 k 1 e k t which is equivalent to the area under the ozone decay curve if ozone exhibits first order decay the integral method requires the collection of a time series of ozone residual measurements throughout the reaction time for accurate calculation of the decay rate constant other methods for estimating the area under the ozone decay curve can be utilized to estimate ozone exposure particularly when ozone does not display first order decay von gunten and hoigne 1994 alternative methods of ct calculation encountered in bench scale ozone disinfection studies include calculating the geometric mean of the initial and final ozone residual and multiplying by the elapsed time which is a simple and relatively accurate method if ozone displays first order decay as described above and can also be used at full scale with respect to different reaction chambers rakness et al 2005 other methods include estimating c as the arithmetic mean of the initial and final ozone residual as well as simply substituting the final residual the variety in ct calculations among studies adds an additional layer of complexity for comparison of data more so if the ct calculation method is not specified the inactivation rate constants k utilized to predict microorganism inactivation are typically derived from bench scale studies evaluating log inactivation vs ct there are several methods for evaluating ozone disinfection at bench scale with specific implications associated with each method bench scale studies include but are not limited to true batch semi batch and quench flow reactor systems true batch tests are conducted by applying a pre determined dose of aqueous ozone to a closed batch reactor with constant agitation the aqueous ozone stock solution is produced by bubbling gaseous ozone oxygen gas mixture through ultrapure water in a chilled reactor to obtain an aqueous ozone concentration in equilibrium to the gas phase concentration according to henry s law hoigne and bader 1994 rakness 2015 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 due to the instability of ozone in aqueous solutions proper determination of ozone exposure during a batch test should include a time series of ozone residual measurements hoigne and bader 1994 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 additionally the added stock solution produces a diluting effect on the test solution which must be accounted for one limitation to batch systems is the inability to accurately characterize the initial phase of ozone decay low exposure scenarios and examining fast reacting compounds or microorganisms buffle et al 2006 hoigne and bader 1994 these problems have been addressed using continuous quench flow systems or reaction systems in which the ozone exposure was controlled by addition of an ozone reactive compound e g cinnamic acid buffle et al 2006 criquet et al 2015 czekalski et al 2016 torii et al 2020 wolf et al 2018 in quench flow systems a mixed sample ozone solution is pumped with a fixed velocity flow regime through a thin reaction tube the length of which can be altered to allow for different contact times this system is ideal for evaluating fast reacting compounds however proper implementation can be challenging and special consideration should be given to mixing and flow characteristics through the reaction tube careful calibration with known ozone reactions is required buffle et al 2006 criquet et al 2015 semi batch tests are conducted by applying ozone gas directly to the test solution allowing the system to reach steady state i e the dissolved ozone in solution remains constant with time and directly applying organism to the constant gas ozone mixture rakness 2015 ozone exposure can be estimated based on the steady state aqueous ozone residual and contact time a benefit to this approach is the reduction in effort necessary to account for ozone decay within the system additionally there is no need to account for a dilution effect that occurs when dosing with an aqueous stock solution however such systems require greater expertise for proper implementation improper design and implementation can produce misleading results for instance if the solution is not fully saturated the determined kinetics are a mixture of both ozone mass transfer and inactivation additionally for many inactivation processes the steady state concentrations in the reactor are very high and require extremely low residence times to achieve realistic ozone exposures which is often not feasible therefore the preferred method for evaluating inactivation kinetics of microorganisms by ozone is through the use of true batch systems for slower inactivating more resistant microbes such as c parvum oocysts and modified batch systems i e addition of cinnamic acid or quench flow systems for faster inactivating less resistant microbes such as viruses there are many parameters that can influence the efficacy of ozone treatment including ph temperature alkalinity and other intrinsic properties of the water matrix these parameters generally affect ozone demand decay or oxidant scavenging kinetics when ph decreases ozone becomes more stable staehelin and hoigne 1985 the role of ph with respect to inactivation of microorganisms is unclear ph can influence the surface properties of microorganisms harden and harris 1952 hsu and huang 2002 michen and graule 2010 righetti and caravaggio 1976 however the extent to which this influences reactivity with ozone is not well understood temperature also plays an important role in the stability of ozone in aqueous solutions increasing temperature increases the first order ozone decay rate which therefore reduces the stability of ozone in solution however increased temperature also increases the rate of ozone inactivation for microorganisms finch and li 1999 li et al 2001 roy et al 1982 therefore temperature changes will affect inactivation kinetics in a complex interplay between ozone stability and susceptibility of microorganisms other water quality parameters such as dissolved organic matter dom are more complex with respect to ozone stability and hence disinfection efficacy von gunten 2003b von sonntag and von gunten 2012 therefore disinfection studies in dom containing matrices can be difficult to conduct and interpret in addition interaction of microorganisms with organic matter e g coating of membranes may alter the susceptibility of microorganisms to ozone in dom heavy matrices such as wastewater it may be difficult to establish an ozone ct with low ozone doses due to rapid ozone demand decay however these low ct or sub residual dosing scenarios can still achieve inactivation of some microorganisms gerrity et al 2012 potentially necessitating alternative crediting frameworks this is also the case when ozone is supplemented with hydrogen peroxide to preferentially drive the formation of hydroxyl radicals i e advanced oxidation process drastically reducing or eliminating ozone ct acero and von gunten 2001 at the bench scale many of these issues can be avoided by using quench flow reactors to understand disinfection kinetics in the early reaction phase an empirical approach avoiding complications with ozone chemistry relies on non ct based frameworks for obtaining disinfection credit in such cases for example gamage et al 2013 and gerrity et al 2012 evaluated the correlation of non ct based parameters such as o3 doc ratio δuv254 absorbance and δtf total fluorescence with inactivation of b subtilis spores escherichia coli and ms2 during wastewater ozonation another study evaluated δuv254 absorbance and oxidation of carbamazepine as surrogate parameters to evaluate disinfection of viruses in surface water and wastewater wolf et al 2019 despite the potential value of these emerging non ct frameworks this review focuses on characterizing ozone disinfection efficacy based on the more traditional ct framework 3 methods 3 1 literature review literature was compiled with the goal of analyzing ozone disinfection efficacy for three pathogen groups regulated in water treatment i e viruses giardia cysts and c parvum oocysts and their potential surrogates web of science core collection was searched during september 2020 using search criteria containing a combination of the following key words ozon and water and inactivation or kinetics or disinfection and virus or protozoa or pathogen or bacteria or microb or adenovirus or enterovirus or calicivirus or ms2 or b subtilis or giardia or cryptosporidium articles which were peer reviewed written in english and published after the year 1980 were considered for inclusion within the review search results were subjected to an initial screening of the titles and abstracts articles were included for full text review if the title and or abstract indicated a ozone was among the disinfectants being analyzed b disinfection in water was evaluated i e excluding ozone as a surface disinfectant or in the gas phase and c microbial inactivation was analyzed i e excluding proxies for microbial disinfection the materials methods sections of selected articles were evaluated via random assignment between three reviewers the evaluated articles were

water matrix i e buffered ultra purified water vs surface water vs wastewater ph ranges of 5 8 use of hydroxyl radical scavengers the publications which evaluated disinfection kinetics in buffered ultra purified water or surface water in batch or quench flow reactors at bench scale were selected for further analyses due to the aforementioned complexities of ozone in dom heavy matrices studies evaluating wastewater were excluded articles which evaluated inactivation mechanisms of ozone for the different pathogen groups were also selected for further review articles that did not fall into either of these categories were omitted from the review the reviewing process and the applied selection criteria are summarized in figure s1 additionally while the core literature search was performed in september 2020 there were no additional relevant publications identified in a subsequent search spanning september 2020 through january 2022 3 2 data analysis to explore the state of the art of bench scale inactivation of viruses giardia cysts and c parvum oocysts by ozone analyses of log10 inactivation as a function of ozone ct exposure as well as reported inactivation rate constants were

comparison of ozone ct exposure values and corresponding survival ratios provided as log10 n n0 and second order inactivation rate constants k if applicable ozone ct data and second order inactivation rate constants were extracted directly from the article if ozone ct data were provided calculated using the integral ct method this value was prioritized otherwise priority was given in the following order geometric mean ct arithmetic mean ct select studies which only provided ct information in such form final residual effluent ct if not provided in a study second order inactivation rate constants

inactivation slope i e k could not be determined statistically different p 0 05 from 0 the dataset was excluded if the regression model had a non significant p 0 05 y intercept the model was fitted through the origin otherwise the y intercept model was accepted under the assumption that a positive y intercept provides a more conservative estimate of inactivation based on the resulting reduced slope and a negative y intercept indicates the presence of a lag phase data which contained a significant lag phase i e a phase in which no inactivation occurs despite of ozone ct exposure were fitted

discussion 4 1 literature review and data analysis the aforementioned search criteria yielded 1 399 articles which were subsequently reviewed through several iterations figure s1 this ultimately resulted in 28 articles from which inactivation vs ozone ct exposure data and or second order inactivation rate constants were extracted as well as 10 articles that evaluated ozone inactivation mechanisms for specific pathogen groups datasets from each organism were separated into three temperature ranges 1 9 c 10 19 c and 20 25 c the ph examined in the different datasets ranged from 5 8 due to the overall lack of data datasets with and without hydroxyl radical scavengers were ultimately grouped together which could introduce an additional source of variation within datasets even though the contribution of hydroxyl radical to inactivation is likely minimal 4 2 inactivation of viruses while viruses encompass a variety of morphologies that may influence their resistance to disinfectants sigstam et al 2013 to remain consistent with usepa categorization all mammalian virus data were compiled together regardless of viral species for analyses of mammalian virus surrogates bacteriophage data were analyzed separately six studies met inclusion criteria for the development of log10 inactivation plots and or inactivation rate constant compilation helmer and finch 1993 lim et al 2010 sigmon et al 2015 torii et al 2020 wolf et al 2018 young et al 2020 six mammalian viruses were evaluated including coxsackieviruses b3 and b5 laboratory and environmental strains poliovirus 1 echovirus 11 human adenovirus 2 and murine norovirus bacteriophages ms2 fr qβ ga φx174 t4 t1 and prd1 were evaluated all inactivation data were collected using cell culture most probable number mpn or plaque assays respective to each virus type experiments were conducted in either batch or quench flow reactors fig 1 a d provide an overview of the compiled log10 inactivation of viruses as a function of ozone ct i e exposure for three temperature ranges overall viruses are highly reactive with ozone indicating that efficient inactivation occurs even at very low ozone ct exposure the usepa models shown as dashed line in fig 1a d provide a conservative estimate of virus inactivation underestimating inactivation in most cases the usepa model was developed using data from roy et al 1982 who evaluated poliovirus inactivation using a cstr because of the reactor setup this study did not pass our article selection process and was therefore not analyzed torii et al 2020 discussed the shortcomings in how the data from this study was utilized for usepa models including the use of the average hydraulic residence time as a substitution for the contact time which would lead to an overestimation of ozone ct exposure hydraulic considerations combined with incomplete mixing and the additional safety factor of 3 applied by the usepa may account for the overly conservative nature of the model the data points which cluster directly at or below the usepa models for temperatures ranging from 20 25 c fig 1c belong to a single study examining murine norovirus inactivation these data imply that murine noroviruses may be relatively less susceptible to ozone inactivation than other mammalian viruses however the ozone ct exposure values determined from this study may be inaccurate specifically the study suggests that with ozone decay constants upwards of 5 min 1 and an applied ozone dose of 1 mg l 1 there was still measurable ozone residual at the end of the experimental contact times greater than two minutes with these parameters a residual ozone concentration of 4 5 10 5 mg l can be calculated which is far below the detection for ozone in aqueous solution eq 3 bader and hoigné 1981 this may indicate potential interferences in the ozone residual measurements or other issues with the experimental set up which would lead to less reliable ozone decay data nevertheless as the only representative of the virus family caliciviridae which contains notable human pathogen human norovirus it was necessary to include the data in this review interestingly mammalian viruses appear slightly more resistant to ozone than most bacteriophages at all temperature ranges figures s2a b si indicate that bacteriophage ms2 and closely related ssrna phages fr ga qβ blue symbols in figure s2 are the least resistant to ozone while the dna phages t4 prd1 and φx174 are more resistant red symbols in figure s2 bacteriophages particularly ms2 are often utilized as surrogates for enteric mammalian virus inactivation during water wastewater treatment due to the ease of culturing and enumeration as compared to mammalian viruses amarasiri et al 2017 the results from our assessment indicate that ms2 may provide a slight overestimation of viral pathogen inactivation by ozone bacteriophage t4 or φx174 may be more suitable for conservatively predicting virus inactivation by ozone however further research is necessary the apparent differences in resistance towards ozone between bacteriophages and mammalian viruses are reflected within the compiled second order inactivation rate constants k particularly at lower temperatures table 1 inactivation rate constants for bacteriophages are 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than for mammalian viruses at temperatures from 1 19 c though this is based on a low number of data points n 4 for mammalian viruses n 5 for bacteriophages this pattern of the range persists at 20 25 c however the median values between the two datasets are comparable 2 3 4 7 x 103 mg 1 min 1 l when broken down by individual datasets table 2 the majority of the second order rate constants for both bacteriophages and mammalian viruses fall in the range of 103 104 mg 1 min 1 l for 20 25 c second order rate constants outside of this range correspond to bacteriophages ms2 and qβ on the higher end 1 2 3 1 x 104 mg 1 min 1 l and the mammalian coxsackievirus b5 and murine norovirus at the lower end 0 33 6 1 x 102 mg 1 min 1 l as previously described the second order rate constants associated with murine norovirus should be treated with caution disregarding murine norovirus the higher and lower range of second order inactivation rate constants are all associated with replicate datasets ms2 qβ and coxsackievirus b5 all have additional measured second order inactivation rate constants which fall within 103 104 mg 1 min 1 l many of the second order inactivation rate constants were determined in studies utilizing either traditional batch systems or highly sophisticated systems which allow for the evaluation of very low ct ranges 0 01 mg min l 1 torii et al 2020 wolf et al 2018 young et al 2020 the differences between these reactor systems may influence the variability experienced within the datasets however it should be noted that second order rate constants for the reactions between ozone and specific chemical species have been shown to vary up to a factor of 5 for different studies von sonntag and von gunten 2012 therefore the variability determined within the virus dataset up to 8 fold within the same viral species is not too outstanding the slight differences in susceptibility between viral groups may be explained through inactivation mechanisms due to the differences in capsid morphology genome composition and replication mechanisms for different virus groups e g enteroviruses caliciviruses coliphages etc it is impossible to assign a singular ozone inactivation mechanism for viruses as a generalized group at this stage of the knowledge studies evaluating ozone inactivation mechanisms for the viral genus enterovirus family pircornaviridae are the most abundant roy et al 1981 found rna damage to account for the majority of inactivation for poliovirus 1 torrey et al 2019 came to a similar conclusion for echovirus 11 which was additionally confirmed by young et al 2020 for coxsackievirus b5 results from this study also indicate that multiple genome hits are likely required for inactivation of echovirus 11 and coxsackievirus b5 despite this capsid damage cannot be fully ignored as a potential contributor to ozone inactivation as current methodologies limit the ability to fully differentiate between the two it is possible that differences in capsid composition morphology may be an important factor for the differences in inactivation kinetics between genetically similar isolates of the same viruses determined in torii et al 2021 ozone inactivation mechanisms for viruses relevant to public health outside of picornaviridae such as human adenoviruses and caliciviruses have yet to be determined in contrast kim et al 1980 was able to confirm capsid damage during ozone treatment of bacteriophage f2 though due to the analytical limitations of the time it cannot be concluded that this is the primary inactivation mechanisms of ozone over genome damage bacteriophage f2 along with bacteriophage fr are no longer considered distinct virus species and have since been merged into the viral species ms2 van regenmortel et al 2000 therefore it is appropriate to interpret these results as descriptive of ms2 ms2 belongs to the viral family fiersviridae formerly leviviridae which includes other closely related ssrna bacteriophages in this review such as qβ and ga callanan et al 2020 stockdale et al 2020 further research utilizing updated methods for ms2 and closely related bacteriophages could potentially explain their increased susceptibility to ozone disinfection compared to enteroviruses dna bacteriophages φx174 t4 and prd1 which behaved more similar to the mammalian viruses are all taxonomically distinct from ms2 and other members of fiersviridae up to the order of virus realm ictv 2020 therefore it is inappropriate to assume that ozone inactivation mechanisms for these particular bacteriophages would be similar without further investigations in general more research is needed to explore the inactivation mechanisms and kinetics of dna phages as well as mammalian dna viruses such as human adenoviruses based on similar inactivation mechanisms and kinetics a better surrogate than ms2 could be selected to assess viral inactivation during ozonation 4 3 inactivation of giardia spp seven studies investigating inactivation of giardia spp met the specific analysis criteria for extracting log10 inactivation vs ozone ct exposure data finch et al 1993b haas and kaymak 2003 labatiuk et al 1994 1992a 1992b 1991 li et al 2004 of these seven studies only two second order inactivation rate constants are available for review haas and kaymak 2003 labatiuk et al 1992a the majority of studies evaluated giardia muris a surrogate for the human pathogen giardia lamblia g muris is advantageous in the laboratory setting as it is non pathogenic to humans and maintains reproducible patterns of infection in mouse models belosevic and faubert 1983 there is conflicting evidence of the relative resistance of g muris compared to g lamblia with some studies indicating higher resistance to ozone wickramanayake et al 1985 while others finding no statistical differences finch et al 1993b three different methods in vivo mouse and gerbil models and in vitro excystation were utilized to quantify giardia survival ratios in the selected studies which could lead to variability in study conclusions labatiuk et al 1991 however due to the overall lack of available data studies using either of these methods were included for evaluation compiled log10 inactivation vs ozone ct exposure data at different temperature ranges are provided in fig 2 a c all three temperature ranges indicate significant inactivation of g muris cysts in the lower ct ranges 1 mg min l 1 with a tailing effect for higher ozone exposures this effect is apparent regardless of the experimental matrix because of the tailing effect the usepa models dashed lines in fig 2 overestimate inactivation of giardia cysts for an ozone ct 1 2 mg min l 1 for most temperatures the usepa model was developed from a single study that did not pass through the systematic review protocol due to its use of a semi batch reactor set up wickramanayake et al 1985 usepa 1991 additionally this study was performed at a single temperature 5 c which was used for extrapolation of inactivation models to higher temperatures based on the limited dataset used to develop the model it is expected that it does not accurately predict giardia cyst inactivation for the data analyzed in this review this tailing effect highlights one of the weaknesses of utilizing a linear kinetic model for predicting inactivation the two available second order inactivation rate constants for g muris cysts are provided in table 3 the values differ by over a factor of 10 and seemingly indicate higher efficiency at lower temperatures however it should be noted that the second order inactivation rate constant for t 10 19 c haas and kaymak 2003 was determined at very low ct values all 1 mg min l 1 and therefore is reflective of the initial rapid inactivation phase evident prior to tailing the data used to calculate second order rate constants for t 20 25 c from labatiuk et al 1992a examined higher ct values and therefore exhibited considerable tailing which resulted in a poor model fit r2 0 374 omitting data points influenced by tailing increased the second order rate constant to 3 73 mg 1 min 1 l but remains almost exactly one order of magnitude lower than the second order rate constants determined by haas and kaymak 2003 the compiled data indicate that a linear kinetic model may be inappropriate for estimating inactivation of giardia cysts by ozone at higher ct exposure studies examining the mechanism of giardia cyst inactivation have reported that ozone produces severe degradation of the inner membranous layer of the cyst wall irregular vacuole formation and detachment of the trophozoite within the cyst li et al 2004 these changes in cyst morphology were consistent with cyst inactivation however it remains unclear if the observed tailing effect is related to the inactivation mechanism by ozone labatiuk et al 1992b determined that giardia cysts are rapidly inactivated within the first two minutes of ozonation with little inactivation occurring thereafter even in the presence of considerable ozone residual additionally it was observed that ozone decreased in efficiency with lower concentrations of giardia cysts which would be the scenario encountered after the rapid initial inactivation haas and kaymak 2003 regardless of the potential cause of the tailing effect it is evident that at least 1 log10 inactivation of giardia cysts can be obtained by an ozone exposure of 1 mg min l 1 4 4 inactivation of cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and surrogates eight studies met the criteria for inclusion for log10 inactivation vs ozone ct exposure analysis of c parvum oocysts cho and yoon 2007 craik et al 2003 finch et al 1993a finch and li 1999 gyurek et al 1999 lewin et al 2001 li et al 2001 wohlsen et al 2007 with six of the studies reporting second order inactivation rate constants cho and yoon 2007 craik et al 2003 finch et al 1993a gyurek et al 1999 lewin et al 2001 li et al 2001 the evaluated studies utilized either in vivo mouse models or in vitro excystation to quantify inactivation of c parvum oocysts in studies where both in vivo and in vitro methods were utilized in vivo data were preferentially selected for analysis due to evidence of in vitro methods underestimating inactivation bukhari et al 2000 finch et al 1993a while the studies specifically utilized c parvum the stocks were largely obtained from different sources or batches in addition to c parvum oocysts data evaluating disinfection of bacillus subtilis spores from nine studies were also evaluated to assess its potential as a surrogate for c parvum oocysts cho et al 2006 2003a 2003b 2002 choi et al 2007 craik et al 2002 dow et al 2006 driedger et al 2001 c parvum oocyst inactivation data for three temperature ranges are provided in fig 3 a c c parvum oocysts exhibit greater resistance to ozone than both viruses and giardia the data do not provide evidence of a lag phase or tailing at low or high ozone cts respectively the usepa models dashed lines are closely aligned with the inactivation data from the compiled studies providing the most accurate prediction of inactivation of the three selected pathogen group models the model overpredicts c parvum oocyst inactivation for 8 of the 135 total data points even though this is a good agreement it is unclear if these deviations from the model are due to natural variability of the organism thus indicating the model is not conservative to oocyst inactivation or due to variability in experimental methods the usepa model for c parvum oocysts was developed from the data of four studies li et al 2001 oppenheimer et al 2000 owens et al 2000 rennecker et al 1999 only one of the four studies was included in our analysis li et al 2001 as the remainder of the studies either utilized semi batch systems evaluated inactivation at pilot scale or were not published in a peer reviewed article i e only project report all of which were selective constraints of the literature review process in this article the c parvum oocyst inactivation models developed by usepa utilized a less stringent safety factor due to concerns related to bromate formation therefore it is expected that the model would provide a less conservative prediction of inactivation in comparison to the virus model the inactivation efficiency of b subtilis during ozonation was also examined fig 3d f blue symbols in contrast to c parvum oocysts there is an apparent shouldering or inactivation lag phase at each temperature this lag phase appears to change with temperature but with no clear pattern i e the lag phase in the 10 19 c range appears larger than both 5 9 c and 20 25 c despite a clear temperature relationship determined in driedger et al 2001 this could be due to the grouping of data regardless of ph which has been previously demonstrated to influence the lag phase cho et al 2003b 2003a 2002 dow et al 2006 it is also possible that additional water quality parameters may be influencing the lag dow et al 2006 evaluated parameters influencing the lag phase of b subtilis inactivation and did not find any significant influence of bulk doc concentration or turbidity however differences in dom composition were not considered it is currently unclear which water quality parameter if any may be influencing the extent of the lag phase table 4 provides second order inactivation rate constants for both c parvum oocysts and b subtilis spores respectively using either the second order linear model or delayed chick watson model overall second order inactivation rate constants for c parvum oocysts are much lower than for viruses or giardia cysts indicating that it is much more resistant to ozone in addition to second order rate constants in buffered solutions values in various synthetic or natural surface waters are also provided for each organism based on limited data for both c parvum oocysts and b subtilis spores it is not clear that natural or synthetic surface water significantly influences the inactivation rate the median second order inactivation rate constants for both organisms in natural synthetic surface water fall within the ranges determined in buffered solutions albeit this is based on very limited data in the case of c parvum oocysts to evaluate b subtilis spores as a surrogate for c parvum oocyst inactivation the ozone ct exposure for 2 log10 inactivation were calculated using the respective inactivation models for direct comparison for the temperature range of 20 25 c a ct exposure of 4 8 8 8 mg min l 1 would be necessary for 2 log10 inactivation of c parvum oocysts however for b subtilis a ct ranging from 0 4 to 12 6 mg min l 1 is required the wide variety of factors influencing b subtilis spore inactivation exclude it as a surrogate for c parvum oocyst inactivation in agreement with driedger et al 2001 the consistent lag phase for b subtilis spores but not c parvum oocysts may provide potential evidence of different ozone inactivation mechanisms shouldering can be indicative of a multiple hit inactivation mechanism in which multiple areas of an organism must be damaged by the disinfectant prior to its inactivation kimball 1953 the shouldering phase dissipates once the necessary number of targets are destroyed within the organism usually leading to an exponential phase of inactivation this contrasts with a single hit mechanism in which the destruction of one target results in the inactivation of the organism i e exponential disinfection begins immediately upon application it has been found that the inner membrane of the b subtilis spore is likely the site of lethal damage with ozone damage to the spore coat likely necessary prior to destruction of the inner membrane young and setlow 2004 however it cannot be ruled out that the damage to the inner membrane is limited by ozone diffusion through the spore coat regardless the ultimate effect remains the same in which the spore coat provides an initial resistance to disinfection resulting in a perceived lag phase and thus supports the use of a delayed chick watson model the mechanism of ozone inactivation for c parvum oocysts has not been evaluated previously to the best of our knowledge the oocyst wall is likely composed of an outer glycocalyx layer followed by a lipid hydrocarbon layer a layer of cysteine rich proteins and ultimately a structural polysaccharide layer underneath which exists the sporozoite jenkins et al 2010 the c parvum sporozoite cannot survive without its oocyst and it is unable to complete its life cycle until it reaches the gut of a host excysts and attaches to intestinal lining smith et al 2005 encysting is a lifecycle requirement for c parvum this is in contrast with b subtilis which can freely exist as a vegetative bacterial cell without its spore spore formation is a survival mechanism for low nutrient environmental conditions sella et al 2014 these differences in life cycles and the ensuing differences in cell structures likely influence the discrepancy in ozone inactivation kinetics between the two distinct organisms interestingly studies have determined that in vitro excystation predicts less inactivation of c parvum oocysts when compared to in vivo mouse models for similar ozone exposures bukhari et al 2000 finch et al 1993a i e some sporozoites successfully excyst when provided gut mimicking conditions however they may lack the capability of completing their life cycle once excysted this could indicate damage to the sporozoite by ozone however further research would be necessary to verify this in contrast to previous studies the results from this review did not indicate a large discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro methods figure s3 si 4 5 limitations of previous studies and research needs in this review there were several limitations associated with the comparison of inactivation data from different sources first and foremost a large portion of disinfection studies were excluded during the review process due to the use of non batch or non quench flow reactor designs in particular many of the excluded bench scale studies utilized semi batch reactors this drastically reduced the number of studies for data extraction 69 of 210 articles omitted for this reason semi batch reactors were excluded from examination due to the inherent difficulty in proper application of such systems finch et al 2001 moreover as a reviewer it can be difficult to assess proper implementation of semi batch systems due to the limited information provided within manuscripts a more unified approach to studying ozone disinfection kinetics would help to increase the availability of comparable data produced in future studies in studies utilizing similar approaches there were still many systematic differences that made comparison difficult such as differences in reactor volumes utilized 5 ml to 5 l and ozone residual measurement methods direct absorbance at 260 nm vs indigo trisulfonate at 600 nm the use of hydroxyl radical scavengers table s1 additionally the purity level of the microbial stocks can influence results and skew interpretation due to the interactions between the organic matter present in microbial growth media and ozone mesquita et al 2010 wolf et al 2018 furthermore the method in which ozone ct is determined can influence data interpretation of the 1 038 data points collected for log10 inactivation vs ozone ct 72 data points had sufficient information to estimate ozone ct using the four methods encountered in this review integral geometric mean final residual and arithmetic mean assuming integration of the ozone residual curve provides the most accurate estimation of ozone exposure comparison of this value with the alternative approaches determined that the geometric mean ct method provided the closest estimate of ct exposure based on residual sum of squares fig 4 demonstrates the ability of the geometric mean ct method to accurately estimate the ozone exposure which is to be expected as long as ozone exhibits first order decay in a specific matrix and there is a final residual ozone concentration 0 gyürek and finch 1998 in contrast as shown in fig 4 the arithmetic mean overestimates and the final residual effluent method underestimates the ozone exposure while arithmetic mean deviates less from the integral method when compared to the effluent method it requires the same input values as the geometric mean i e c0 c and t therefore there is no practical reason to utilize the arithmetic over the geometric mean figure s4 si provides a conceptual overview of the different ozone ct estimation methods it should be mentioned that while we have demonstrated only slight deviations in the different ct estimation methods these quick estimation methods begin to deviate considerably with increasing ozone decay rates such as those seen during wastewater treatment therefore it is not recommended to employ these estimation methods under such conditions if an ozone decay curve cannot be collected for whatever reason a more accurate estimation consists of estimating the first order ozone decay rate constant with the initial and final ozone residual concentration measurements and time elapsed between the two 10 k l n c c 0 t the calculated value for k can then be substituted into 4 however this method also requires an assumption of first order ozone decay integration of an ozone residual time series is recommended as best practice studies were also eliminated if they did not provide sufficient information to confidently compare either log10 inactivation and ct or second order inactivation rate constants either through lack of ozone decay data missing pertinent water quality data i e temperature ph etc lack of sufficient reactor set up description improper microbiological data reporting among others it is recommended that ozone disinfection studies should provide the water quality and system characteristics previously described in hoigné 1994 and hoigné and bader 1994 as necessary for general ozone related studies such characteristics include water temperature ph doc concentration alkalinity among others additionally disinfection studies should provide organism strain identifier cultivation and purification techniques initial spike concentrations and particularly the method used to handle data which fall below limits of detection i e avoiding substitution with detection limit while the evaluation of virus inactivation via ozone has progressed through time with increasingly sophisticated techniques studies on giardia cysts and c parvum oocysts have stalled with the most recent publications meeting our selection criteria published more than 14 years ago after several outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis initially spurred interest in this topic fox and lytle 1996 support for such research waned and is still currently lacking this is likely in large part due to limitations in cultivating and assessing viability of each organism which require in vivo animal models however particularly in the case of giardia which deviated the furthest from the usepa models based on data within this review new data would be of great benefit particularly in discerning the cause of the apparent tailing effect similarly ozone inactivation kinetics evaluated at varying temperature ranges were sparse with the majority of studies included within this review evaluating inactivation at 20 25 c furthermore very few studies evaluated inactivation at varying temperatures within the same study as described previously systematic differences between studies make direct comparisons of data difficult therefore it is difficult to provide confident assertations regarding the effect of temperature on disinfection efficacy based on these studies alone once again this was strikingly evident for giardia cysts in which k values for the 10 19 c range appear significantly larger than the 20 25 c which is contrary to what might be expected there is a lack of mechanistic explanations for the different inactivation kinetics exhibited by the different organisms largely due to the lack of studies evaluating inactivation mechanisms of ozone in general particularly for encysted protozoans ozone inactivation mechanisms are summarized in fig 5 however there have been advances in the study of viral inactivation mechanisms torrey et al 2019 and young et al 2020 provide novel methodologies for estimating viral inactivation mechanisms particularly relating to genome destruction these methods could be applied to other virus species and potentially validate the differences in inactivation mechanisms between ms2 and closely related bacteriophages and other ssrna mammalian viruses as well as provide justification for potentially better surrogate candidates such as φx174 or t4 it is important to recognize that while the reported kinetics of surrogate bacteriophages and mammalian viruses appear to deviate from one another when compared to ct requirements for giardia cysts and c parvum oocysts those apparent differences become negligible fig 6 specifically drinking water systems designed for 2 log10 inactivation of c parvum oocysts will require a significant ozone ct exposure i e much greater than 1 mg min l 1 which would ensure considerable inactivation of mammalian viruses and bacteriophages 2 log10 at 20 c however in situations where little to no ozone exposure is achieved such as in sub residual water reuse applications or with ozone aop i e supplemented with h2o2 these differences could become relevant and thus further exploration into alternate virus surrogates is warranted particularly with the increasing interest in ozone for water reuse applications and the significant virus inactivation requirements in such systems 5 conclusions based on a critical review of ozone disinfection the following conclusions can be drawn ozone is an effective disinfectant against chlorine resistant pathogens such as c parvum oocysts can effectively inactivate other pathogens such as giardia cysts and performs rapidly against viruses usepa models which were developed more recently using multiple datasets c parvum oocysts were more accurate than earlier models developed using a single dataset viruses and giardia cysts comparison of the data compiled in this review suggests the need for improvements in usepa models for viruses and giardia cysts further research on the applicability of non pathogenic surrogates such as ms2 and b subtilis spores is necessary the data compiled in this review indicate that these organisms do not accurately reflect the behavior of the pathogens they represent studies directly evaluating pathogenic organisms are costly and time consuming therefore further investigation of appropriate surrogates may help advance the knowledge and ultimately the prediction of ozone disinfection greater emphasis should be placed on minimizing differences in ozone disinfection study approaches and development of standard protocols this would allow for better comparability between studies and allow for greater consensus on ozone inactivation of pathogens declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
