16715,the addition of hydrogen to anaerobic digesters is an emerging technique for the sustainable upgrading of biogas to biomethane with renewable electricity however it is critically dependent on the effective gas liquid transfer of hydrogen which is a sparingly soluble gas very little is known about the impact of liquid and gas flow and bubble size on gas liquid transfer during h 2 injection in full scale anaerobic digesters a computational fluid dynamic model was developed using a two fluid approach for non newtonian liquid in the open source computational fluid dynamics cfd platform openfoam the newly developed model was validated against published experimental data sets of a gas mixed laboratory scale anaerobic digester with good agreement between the numerical and experimental velocity fields the hydrodynamics of the full scale in situ biomethanation system using venturi ejectors for h 2 injection was then simulated to investigate gas liquid dynamics including gas liquid mass transfer at different operational conditions gas liquid mixing is mainly controlled by the gas plumes interaction which promotes turbulence at the interaction zone resulting in increasing gas bubbles mixing with the liquid and the gas liquid interfacial area however beyond the plume interaction zone the digester had flow short circuiting and inactive zones it was found that due to this short circuiting behaviour an increase in gas flow rate may not be an effective option in reducing inactive zones although it can increase the gas liquid interfacial area comparative analysis of the impact of gas flow and bubble size indicated that gas flow had a linear effect on both kla and gas holdup but that bubble size had a non linear impact with higher kla values achieved at bubble sizes less than 2 mm comparison against measured data in the same system indicated the predicted kla values were at the same level as measured kla at a bubble size of 2 mm keywords anaerobic digestion gas liquid mixing gas liquid mass transfer hydrodynamics cfd in situ biogas upgrading 1 introduction the use of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar energy have increased liu et al 2017 dramatically and will continue to do so however wind and solar energy sources fluctuate substantially and power produced may become surplus when electricity demand is low or generation is high inkeri et al 2018 power to gas technology provides a pathway of utilising renewable electricity linking the power grid to the gas grid liu et al 2017 the technology considerably increases the energy system s capacity to respond to the dynamic load from wind and photovoltaic power production while capturing carbon dioxide co 2 from the biogas otherwise lost to the atmosphere the technology uses water split into hydrogen h 2 and oxygen o 2 via electrolysis the h 2 is then used to reduce co 2 into methane ch 4 which can immediately be used as natural gas or stored within the existing natural gas infrastructure biological methanation is a promising power to gas technology that utilises derived h 2 from electrolysis to upgrade biogas to a higher ch 4 content munoz et al 2015 typically biogas contains about 50 70 ch 4 and 30 50 co 2 and its upgrading to ch 4 content above 90 98 not only makes it directly usable as natural gas but also reduces co 2 emissions to the atmosphere as a carbon capture and utilisation ccu technology deng and hagg 2010 in the biomethanation process h 2 is biologically utilised to reduce co 2 to ch 4 via methanogenesis angelidaki et al 2019 the reaction is mediated by hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea voelklein et al 2019 biomethanation can be in situ or ex situ in in situ biogas upgrading the h 2 is directly injected into the existing biogas digester and converted by the native population methanogens angelidaki et al 2019 voelklein et al 2019 conversely in ex situ upgrading biogas together with electrolytic hydrogen is directed through an external digester containing a specialised culture of normally thermophilic methanogens angelidaki et al 2019 voelklein et al 2019 in comparison with ex situ upgrading in situ upgrading offers low investment and maintenance cost utilises existing infrastructure angelidaki et al 2019 jensen et al 2020 2018 designs for retrofitting in situ upgrading must utilise existing infrastructure which means that any hydrogen delivery system must be optimised to the digester rather than designing a combined system for effective gas liquid transfer the most important impediment to biomethanisation is a low apparent h 2 consumption rates bassani et al 2016 bhattacharyya and singh 2010 burkhardt et al 2015 diaz et al 2015 guiot et al 2011 inkeri et al 2018 kougias et al 2017 luo and angelidaki 2012 2013 luo et al 2012 pauss et al 1990 szuhaj et al 2016 under most hydrogen loading rates the consumption rate is limited by hydrogen gas transfer determined by the low liquid solubility of hydrogen rather than biochemical capacity of the methanogens inkeri et al 2018 norbertus et al 2011 which results in unreacted h 2 appearing in the biogas the exception is very high hydrogen consumption rates and or main digester feeds which result in a high ammonia e g manure where biomethanisation can deplete co 2 to the point that ph increases above 8 0 which causes general inhibition including to the methanogens luo et al 2012 wang et al 2013 this can be economically controlled by acid addition or increases in loading rate or feed composition wang et al 2013 the overall gas liquid mass transfer rate for a sparingly soluble gas such as h 2 is determined by gas liquid transfer area solubility gas diffusivity and liquid film resistance to transfer pauss et al 1990 gas liquid transfer area is specific for the given digester configurations including h 2 injector type venturi dissolved gas sparger or membrane diaz et al 2015 luo et al 2012 and operating conditions including mixing speed bhattacharyya and singh 2010 luo et al 2012 flow pattern guiot et al 2011 hydrogen delivery systems considered for in situ upgrading include sparging tirunehe and norddahl 2016 hollow fibre membranes luo et al 2012 gas diffusers in combination with an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket digester bassani et al 2016 and venturi type injectors jensen et al 2018 the venturi type injector offers several advantages including external fitment with low investment cost cumby 1987 jensen et al 2020 2018 rubio et al 2002 in comparison with the gas sparging systems it reduces fouling at the gas injection point bauer et al 1963 offering better transfer efficiency than gas lances because of these advantages the venturi type injection system is considered as a key candidate for h 2 injection for the industrial scale biogas digester hjulmand et al 2012 jensen et al 2018 gas injection interacts with hydrodynamic processes inside the digester including gas liquid transfer mixing entrainment of liquid flow re circulation and fluctuations of turbulent eddies there is very limited research into these fundamental hydrodynamic processes in digesters which is governed by three phase gas liquid non newtonian viscosity variable density and biological reactions a mechanistic computational analysis of hydrogen injection systems would substantially assist in providing optimised design of these systems for complete hydrogen consumption given varied biodigester designs and sizes experimental empirical optimisation is expensive and difficult to scale while experiments have been carried out to understand the final results in terms of the mixing behaviour in laboratory or pilot scale digesters capela et al 2009 karim et al 2004 smith et al 1993 terashima et al 2009 varma and dahhan 2007 these should be used in conjunction with theoretical analysis to provide the ability to scale up computational fluid dynamics cfd modelling allows optimisation of design for a wide range of digester configurations and operating conditions baeten et al 2019 cfd analysis of digestion systems has been used to simulate laboratory and pilot scale anaerobic digesters coughtrie et al 2013 karim et al 2007 riquelme et al 2018 shu et al 2019 vesvikar and dahhan 2005 wei et al 2019 as well as full scale digesters dapelo et al 2015 dapelo and bridgeman 2018a 2018b jensen et al 2020 2018 wu 2010a 2010b including gas liquid interaction it has also been used for biomethanation jensen et al 2018 this study jensen et al 2018 focused on effect of gas holdup in venturi gas injection but did not consider hydrodynamic parameters non newtonian rheology gas and liquid re circulation and turbulent energy exchange a detailed hydrodynamic analysis of a full scale digester in the particular context of biomethanation has not been done the aim of this study is therefore to fill this gap by analysing detailed hydrodynamics of a full scale manure based biogas digester fitted with two side entry venturi injectors according to the experimental setup by jensen et al 2020 this incorporates an euler euler two fluid approach considering non newtonian rheology of the liquid unlike previously reported studies the gas bubble diameter is considered as mono dispersed rather than assumed as constant which accounts for bubble volume change with pressure furthermore several gas liquid interfacial momentum exchange models have been adopted from varying assumptions since the published literature lack consensus about which models are appropriate in the context of full scale digester previously reported experimental data sets of a gas mixed laboratory scale anaerobic digester were used for validation karim et al 2004 this allows assessment of bubble plume dynamics mean flow characteristics and turbulent structures to identify the impact on achieving optimal gas liquid interfacial area 2 overview of the physical problem this section provides overview of the gas mixed laboratory scale digester followed by description of the full scale digester 2 1 laboratory scale gas lift digester the numerical model is validated against a set of relevant laboratory scale cases provided by karim et al 2004 in these experiments computed tomography ct and computer radioactive particle tracking carpt techniques were used to measure the flow fields in a laboratory scale gas lift digester having diameter and liquid height of 0 2024 m and 0 222 m respectively the digester was concentrically mounted with a draft tube diameter of about 0 044 m the inlet of the draft tube was located at height of 0 04 m from bottom of the digester the gas was sparged through an injector pipe diameter of 0 005 m positioned at the centre of the draft tube further details of the experiment may be found in karim et al 2004 due to asymmetric nature of the digester the problem may be reduced to two dimensional 2 d asymmetric coughtrie et al 2013 karim et al 2007 wei et al 2019 wu 2010a and the numerical simulation is performed in 2 d asymmetric instead of three dimensional 3 d 2 2 full scale digester for in situ biogas upgrading the system assessed is a 1200 m 3 manure fed digester with an operating volume of 1100 m 3 the height of 12 5 m and a diameter of 10 6 m the digester is mixed by a commercial gasmix system landia denmark consisting of two venturi ejectors mounted 6 5 m above the ground a pump takes out the liquid from the bottom of the digester and supplies it to a venturi ejector when the liquid flows into the venturi restriction a vacuum is formed causing head space gas to draw into the ejector the concomitant gas liquid mixture is injected into the bulk liquid further details on the systems including measured data may be found in jensen et al 2020 2018 a schematic of the physical problem is shown in fig 1 3 numerical methods this section identifies underlying governing equations and implementation for the specific cases 3 1 governing equations the controlling physics may be formulated using euler euler based two fluid model where the gas and liquid phases are assumed as pseudo continuum and inter penetrating to each other agerardi 2003 appels et al 2008 rusche 2002 torvik and svendsen 1990 wu 2010a the continuity and momentum equations for the gas liquid systems may be expressed as drew 1982 marschall 2011 rusche 2002 1 α j ρ j t α j ρ j u j 0 2 α j ρ j u j t α j ρ j u j u j α j p j α j ρ j g j α j ρ j τ j m j here j denotes the gas and liquid phases α is the volume fraction ρ is the density u and p are the velocity and pressure respectively g is the gravitational acceleration τ is the effective reynolds stress tensors and m j represents the interfacial momentum exchange term between the gas and liquid phases the momentum exchange term m j typically comprises of the drag force virtual mass force lift force and turbulent dispersion force and may be expressed as 3 m j m d m v m m l m t d where m d m v m m l and m t d are the drag force virtual mass force lift force and turbulent dispersion force respectively the drag force accounts the amount of resistance on movement of the gas bubbles in liquid which may be expressed as boutet et al 2009 marschall et al 2011 rusche 2002 4 m d r a g 3 4 α g ρ l c d 1 d g u r u r here α g is the gas hold up d g is the bubble diameter c d is the drag coefficient ρ l is the density of the liquid and u r is the relative velocity to date several empirical models have been developed for c d frederix et al 2019 haley 2017 ishii and zuber 1979 shu et al 2019 surgue et al 2017 in this study the well known ishii and zuber 1979 model was used which considered the change in bubble shapes with changing flow regimes in liquid further details of this model may be found in ishii and zuber 1979 the virtual mass force arises due to weight of the surrounding liquid as the gas bubbles travel through them which may be written as boutet et al 2009 marschall et al 2011 rusche 2002 5 m v m α g ρ g c v m d u g d t d u l d t where c v m is the virtual mass force coefficient and assumed as c v m 0 5 drew and passman 1998 kramer 2000 the lift force arises due to lateral dispersion of the liquid and may be expressed as boutet et al 2009 marschall et al 2011 rusche 2002 6 m l α g ρ l c l u g u l u l where c l is the lift force coefficient and modelled using tomiyama correlations tomiyama et al 2002 finally the turbulent dispersion force which arises due to fluctuations of bubbles in turbulent regime may be expressed as boutet et al 2009 marschall et al 2011 rusche 2002 7 m t d ρ l c t d c d u g u l ν t α g α g where c t d is the turbulent dispersion force coefficient and modelled using lopez de bertodano correlations lopez and lahey 1994 the effective reynolds stress tensor τ is a function of the turbulent eddy viscosity ν t which resolved using reynolds averaged navierstokes rans based turbulence model as behzadi et al 2004 rusche 2002 8 ν t f μ c μ ρ k 2 ϵ where f μ and c μ are the empirical constants 3 1 1 rheology the liquid was assumed as the power law fluid and the viscosity may be expressed as wu 2010a 9 η k γ n 1 where k is the consistency coefficient n is the flow behaviour index and γ is the strain rate 3 1 2 bubble diameters the gas bubble diameter was assumed as the mono dispersed which may be expressed as frederix et al 2019 10 d p d g p 0 p 1 3 here d p represents the bubble diameter at pressure p whereas d g is the bubble diameter at the ambient pressure p 0 3 1 3 boundary conditions the boundary conditions are summarised in table 1 3 2 model solution the governing equations were discretised using the finite volume method fvm of openfoam in resolving these equations the euler euler model originally developed by rusche 2002 was employed however this model was unable to consider non newtonian liquid therefore the model was extended for a non newtonian fluid in addition a degassing boundary condition was implemented in the newly developed solver which was not available in the default openfoam suite in resolving the coupled velocity pressure equations the pimple 1 1 pressure implicit method for pressure linked equations algorithm was used whereas the phase fraction equation was resolved using the mules 2 2 multidimensional universal limiter with explicit solution method which is an iterative technique based on the flux corrected transport fct a time marching solution was conducted using a euler scheme which is a first order temporal discretisation scheme in the case of spatial discretisation the convective terms were discretised using gauss scheme along with a combination of limiter for the interpolated convective flux for instance the vanleer scheme was used for the phase fraction the limitedlinear 1 scheme was used for the scalar fields whereas the limitedlinearv 1 was employed for the vector fields finally the stress terms were evaluated using the liner scheme without limiting further details of the mentioned algorithms may be found in moukalled et al 2015 in the case of the laboratory scale digester the geometry is relatively simple and reduced to 2 d axisymmetric the major hurdle in simulating this digester lies on finding the bubble diameter and rheological properties of the liquid since these parameters were not measured for these specific experiments karim et al 2007 vesvikar and dahhan 2005 wei et al 2019 wu 2010a based on the previous studies on this digester coughtrie et al 2013 karim et al 2007 vesvikar and dahhan 2005 wei et al 2019 wu 2010a the bubble diameter was assumed as 5 mm and the rheological properties were evaluated at total solids ts 5 4 the gas flow rate was taken as 0 028 m 3 hr along with momentum closures of drag virtual mass lift and turbulent dispersion a structured grid was used and a mesh dependency study conducted three hexahedral dominated meshes namely coarse n cells 0 7 10 4 medium n cells 1 5 10 4 and fine n cells 3 1 10 4 were constructed here n cells represents the number of mesh cells the skewness and average non orthogonality of these meshes were maintained below 0 35 and zero respectively it was observed that these meshes produced similar results and the difference between the medium and fine meshes was negligible as shown in fig 2 a for axial velocity profiles at z 18 25 cm here z represents the height measured from bottom of the digester therefore the medium mesh was chosen for the simulations in the case of the full scale digester the bubble diameters were considered as d g 1 mm 2 5 mm 5 mm 10 mm and 40 mm typically used for simulating gas liquid systems dapelo et al 2015 dapelo and bridgeman 2018a 2018b jensen et al 2020 2018 lou and zhu 2013 wei et al 2019 the rheological properties of the liquid were taken from the published experimental results at ts 3 5 begdouri 1992 wu 2010a the homogeneous gas liquid injections were considered for both of the injectors a variety of flow rates based on the experimental conditions were used at the these injectors where the liquid and gas flow rates were maintained as equal the simulation was first conducted using drag and virtual mass forces and then a comparative study was performed to evaluate the effect of lift and turbulent dispersion forces due to the complex geometry and full scale size of the digester a tetrahedral dominated unstructured mesh was used to test mesh dependence four different size meshes namely coarse n cells 1 9 10 5 medium n cells 6 6 10 5 fine n cells 11 2 10 5 and finer n cells 16 6 10 5 were tested the skewness and average non orthogonality of these unstructured meshes were maintained in a range of 0 6 to 0 8 and below 15 degrees respectively it was found all these meshes produced similar results however the difference between the fine and finer meshes was marginal as shown in the axial velocity profiles at z 10 m at the flow rates at the left and right injectors of q l 320 m 3 hr and q r 360 m 3 hr respectively in fig 2 b therefore the fine mesh was chosen for the study the simulations were run until a steady state was achieved which was judged by both of the residuals and changed in key outputs including velocity pressure and turbulent properties with time steady state results are unless otherwise noted a minimum residual value was taken as 1 10 7 and the simulations were performed for the total time of 50 s and 200 s for the lab scale and the full scale digesters respectively the university of queensland s high performance computing hpc facility tinaroo was employed for parallel computing of the lab scale digester using 8 processors for 8 hours and the full scale digester using 24 processors for 48 hours 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of the methodology lab scale system fig 3 a shows comparison of the axial velocity profiles in liquid with the experimental results of karim et al 2004 at z 3 75 cm 11 25 cm and 18 25 cm at the flow rate of 0 028 m 3 hr here z represents the height measured from the bottom of the digester fig 3 b and c show the corresponding profiles of turbulent kinetic energy tke and the energy dissipation rate at the mentioned heights as can be seen the predicted axial velocities are quite similar to the experimental observations in both of the cases the upflow appeared within the draft tube i e 0 r r 0 2 followed by a vortex with separation point i e velocity becomes zero and then negative at central regions of the digester followed by these velocity features the turbulent fields varied significantly throughout the digester initially both of the tke and dissipation rates became higher close to the inlet regions i e r r 0 05 due to injected momentum flux of the gases as the flow travelled toward the surface vicinity the tke and energy dissipation rate increased at central regions of the digester which was mainly attributed to the vortex formation at these regions the laboratory results identify that the model is capable of predicting velocity fields in a system with relevant turbulence and gas phase properties and as a system state output indicates that the models selected are appropriate additional key outputs often difficult to observe in an opaque fluid could include bubble diameter bubble velocity particle retention distribution and fluid rheological properties while difficult to measure particularly in full scale systems they would further enhance confidence in the models selected 4 2 hydrodynamics of the full scale biogas digester fig 4 shows the isosurfaces of the generated gas plumes along with streamlines and velocity vectors in liquid with flow rates through left and right injectors of q l 320 m 3 hr and q r 360 m 3 hr respectively and bubble diameter of d g 2 5 mm grey scale is used to visualise the low velocity regions and a single colour is used for isosurfaces and will be used for other figures unless otherwise noted gas bubbles released from the injectors travel towards the liquid surface karpinska and bridgeman 2016 forming two gas plumes the width of these gas plumes increased with axial distance from the injectors and subsequently interacted with each other and with the digester walls near liquid surface vesvikar and dahhan 2005 wu 2014 these interactions promoted turbulence wu 2014 which resulted in wide distribution of gases at central regions of the digester the fluid movement substantially changes followed by these gas distributions close to the injectors the liquid mostly followed the injected momentum flux of the gas liquid as distance above the injector increased the gas bubbles started dragging liquid along their path known as the entrainment process wang et al 2019 and upflow appeared within the plumes fraga et al 2016 wu 2014 as gas bubbles reached the surface they escaped to the atmosphere however the entrained liquid could not follow them into the atmosphere and subsequently directed radially towards the walls and the flow fields generated by the neighbouring gas plume liquid contacting the walls moved downwards due to momentum continuity wu 2010a as shown in fig 5 a where velocity vectors in liquid are demonstrated in x z plane in the latter case as the flow fields generated by one plume enter to its neighbouring flow fields the mutual interaction between the two plumes became stronger and a high shear layer formed in between them the flow fields inside this layer may be considered as a superposition of the two opposite flow fields ying et al 2019 which subsequently resulted in faster liquid dropping at the plumes interaction zone relative to the walls as demonstrated in figs 4 and 5 a as a consequence four vortices represented by flow circulation around a dead zone i e inactive zone with stagnant fluid dapelo et al 2015 formed two in the gas plume interaction zone and others between the digester walls and the upflow columns identified in figs 4 and 5 a these vortices mainly comprised of fluctuations in local velocity fields and turbulent eddies simiano and lakehal 2012 which significantly impeded gas escaping to the atmosphere by dragging them downwards inside the digester fig 5 a shows the vortices are dominant at the plume interaction zone relative to the digester walls which resulted in wider distribution of gas bubbles as well as increased mixing and gas liquid interfacial area at plume interaction zone this effectively increased gas hold up and mass transfer area it should be noticed that in fig 4 the fluid movement mostly remains insignificant below 0 002 m s below z 5 m except at the outlets these low velocity regions may be characterised as a dead zone dapelo et al 2015 the profiles of the tke and the energy dissipation rate at z 6 5 m 10 m and 12 m shown in figs 5 b and c reflects the evolution of turbulent structure throughout the digester in general both tke and energy dissipation rate decreased close to the walls and central region of the digester forming two near symmetric peaks in between them the profiles presented a similar trend in evolution gradual changed in gradients with elevations the peak value increased with elevation for the tke as can be seen in fig 5 b while it decreased for the energy dissipation rate as can be seen in fig 5 c this explains the fluctuation in turbulent eddies increased close to the surface regions however close to the injector regions at z 6 5 m the energy dissipation rate dominated over the tke reflecting the reduction of fluctuations in turbulent eddies simiano and lakehal 2012 the reducing fluctuations of turbulent eddies eventually promoted plume contractions decreasing turbulent eddy viscosity at these regions the increase in energy dissipation rate relative to tke became more pronounced at the right plume compared to that of the left plume as can be seen in figs 5 b and 5 c in light of the local velocity fields in 5 a the dominant energy dissipation rate is mainly attributed to the higher radial velocities at the injector regions overall this section revealed that the hydrodynamic behaviour of the digester is mostly influenced by the gas plumes interaction and the mixing as well as the gas liquid interfacial area may be increased by increasing plumes interaction 4 2 1 effect of the gas bubble diameter this section evaluates the impact of bubble diameter on gas distribution and kla throughout the digester simulations were conducted using a variety of bubble diameters as d g 1 mm 5 mm 10 mm and 40 mm at constant flow rates at the left and right injectors as q l 320 m 3 hr and q r 360 m 3 hr respectively fig 6 shows the isosurfaces of the gas plumes along with the low velocity regions at a d g 1 mm and b d g 5 mm c the profiles of the turbulent eddy viscosity at d g 1 mm and 5 mm at z 12 m and d kla kla represents the mass transfer rate calculated using the higbie 1935 model with apparent kla was determined from spatially distributed bubble size gas volume fractions and velocity fields the isosurfaces exhibited substantial increase in gas distribution at small bubble diameter of d g 1 mm compared to that of d g 5 mm such an increased in gas distribution was mainly attributed to the increasing turbulence at the plumes interaction zone as can be observed in fig 6c where the turbulent eddy viscosity substantially increased at d g 1 mm relative to d g 5 mm fig 6 d shows a decrease in kla with increasing bubble diameter reflecting the fluctuation in turbulent eddies and subsequently the mixing become less dominant with the larger bubble diameter this concludes that an increasing bubble diameter will have an negative impact on the overall gas liquid interfacial area however it should be noticed that in fig 6a and b the digester observed a similar amount of stagnant zone about 40 of total digester volume although the bubble diameter was changed from d g 1 mm to 5 mm this eventually indicates that the inference of bubble diameter on mixing is mainly attributed to the plumes interaction zone and has marginal impact on the flow short circuiting at the digester bottom 4 2 2 effect of the flow rates this section assesses whether increasing flow rates can be a route for increasing mixing and gas liquid interfacial area while decreasing stagnant zone of the digester the simulations considered varying flow rates in a range between q 120 m 3 hr to q 760 m 3 hr while bubble diameter remained constant as d g 2 5 mm it is worth noting that q represents the total mass flow rate injected into the digester and is considered as q q l q r with q l q r fig 7 shows the isosurfaces of the gas plumes along with low velocity regions at a q 120 m 3 hr and b q 710 m 3 hr c the turbulent eddy viscosity profiles at q 120 m 3 hr and 710 m 3 hr at z 12 m and d kla and volume averaged gas holdup as a function of the flow rates as can be seen in fig 7a and b the gas distribution is significantly impacted by increasing flow rates the bubbles tend to more accumulate at the upper central regions of the digester this was mainly attributed to growing turbulent fluctuations as identified in fig 7c due to increased bubble plumes interaction at a higher flow rate of q 710 m 3 hr these increasing turbulent fluctuations with flow rates eventually increased kla and overall gas hold up for the digester as shown in fig 7d it should be noticed that in fig 7a and b the low velocity regions at the bottom of the digester slightly reduced with a significant increased in flow rates almost seven times in magnitude this indicates that the injected liquid flowed along a nearly direct pathway to the outlets and short circuiting occurred due to the short circuiting behaviour the injected liquid had a marginal impact on the digester s overall gas liquid mixing 4 2 3 comparison with the experimental results the hydrogen consumption kinetics for this 1110 m 3 system were experimentally determined in jensen et al 2020 this data can be used to determine the apparent kla for hydrogen and compared to the current modelling study the experimental study injected h 2 at varying rates 8 1 63 8 m 3 hr but with a constant total gas injection rate of 320 m 3 hr 160 m 3 hr through each ejector due to a simultaneous injection of head space gas liquid injection rate was 160 m 3 hr for both ejectors a linear relationship r 0 9985 was found between the h 2 conversion rate and the h 2 injection rate with a slope value of 0 2196 l h 2 converted m 3 reactor m 3 h 2 injected jensen et al 2020 the experimental volumetric mass transfer coefficient can be estimated from standard mass transfer theory i e r h 2 kla c sat 0 where rh 2 and c sat represent h 2 conversion rate and saturation concentration respectively with a henrys coefficient for hydrogen in water k h at 52 c of 1380 4 atm l mol poling et al 2008 the h 2 partial pressure was taken as the volume fraction of h 2 at a total head space pressure of 1 atm the concentration of dissolved h 2 in the liquid was set to zero assuming h 2 conversion is limited by the gas liquid mass transfer rate jensen et al 2020 observed ph was 7 8 7 9 which is below the inhibitory level wang et al 2013 the calculated volumetric mass transfer coefficient was 1 10 3 1 s which compares well with mass transfer coefficients derived from the model at similar injection conditions aligning with a bubble size of approximately 2 mm figs 6d and 7 d this diameter is related to some uncertainty however as important physical quantities like slurry rheology and surface tension were not experimentally determined and the model therefore relied on literature data from similar systems the model demonstrated a beneficial effect of having the two gas plumes interacting with respect to increasing the gas liquid interfacial area for h 2 gas liquid mass transfer the experimental study accordingly found that gas injection through both venturi ejectors is necessary to obtain efficient gas liquid mass transfer rates of h 2 in two of the conducted h 2 injection trials the h 2 injecting ejector was prevented from injecting head space gas simultaneously with h 2 and therefore only injected h 2 at a rate of 12 1 m 3 hr jensen et al 2020 the second ejector was operated normally with a gas injection rate of 160 m 3 hr the obstruction of head space gas injection in the h 2 ejector resulted in a decrease in the relative h 2 conversion from 41 to 50 to 2 4 compared to experiments where the h 2 ejector injected h 2 at a similar rate of 12 1 m 3 hr but at a total gas injection rate of 160 m 3 hr due to the simultaneous injection of head space gas injection the overall agreement between the experimental and modelled observations show promise that the model can be used to optimise the h 2 injection technology further future studies should investigate how to enhance the bubble plume interaction by varying ejector orientation and the number of ejectors the modelled results in this paper suggest that only half of the reactor volume is active for gas liquid mass transfer under the applied experimental conditions a model based assessment of how the dead zone of the reactor can be minimised is a key target for optimisation one option is lowering the vertical position of the ejector however the ejectors current commercial application is to mix the anaerobic digester the high mounting position is needed to generate the vacuum that draws head space gas into the ejector at a sufficiently high rate that as shown in this paper is necessary for proper digester mixing use of biogas mixed ejector for hydrogen transfer is an economical way to mix the digester and provide hydrogen in comparison with more expensive direct hydrogen diffusers and membranes this study indicates that higher hydrogen transfer rates can be achieved which may cause high ph limitations as discussed in the introduction luo et al 2012 wang et al 2013 while the related experimental work jensen et al 2020 did not see inhibitory ph levels ph 7 8 7 9 significantly higher transfer rates could induce high ph inhibition which can be managed as discussed in the introduction it is noted that rather than incorporating biochemistry into the cfd model it is more appropriate to determine optimal configuration and related kla through cfd then use process modelling to determine potential ph issues and management strategies incorporating a suitable high ph inhibition function alemany et al 2020 4 3 effect of sub models this section assesses the impact of lift and turbulent dispersion forces on the hydrodynamics the bubble diameter and the flow rates at the left and right injectors were taken as constant as d g 5 mm q l 320 m 3 hr and q r 330 m 3 hr respectively fig 8 shows the profiles of a local axial velocity and b local gas hold at z 10 m it is clearly observed that the effect of lift and turbulent dispersion forces have marginal impact on the flow fields and gas distributions these marginal impacts eventually indicate that the momentum transfer at the gas liquid interface mainly attributed to the drag force and the injected momentum flux has negligible impact on the bubble lateral dispersion on the contrary it was observed that the lift and turbulent dispersion forces increase the simulation complexity along with the computational cost and it is difficult to achieve an stable solution the virtual mass force also found to have negligible impact on the hydrodynamics but significantly increases the solution stability overall the results reinforce the conclusion that the lift and turbulent dispersion forces may safely be ignored in simulating full scale digesters 5 conclusions a two phase computational model describing the hydrodynamics of a gas liquid system was developed in openfoam and validated by an experimental dataset from a gas lift laboratory digester the model was used to describe the hydrodynamics of a full scale anaerobic digester during venturi based h 2 injection for in situ biomethanation where h 2 conversion is reported limited by the h 2 gas liquid mass transfer rate the predicted volumetric mass transfer coefficients were in good agreement with published experimental data on h 2 conversion rates in the same digester suggesting that the model can be used to optimise h 2 conversion in the physical system the modelled flow field revealed that the formation of two interacting gas plumes in the upper zone of the digester is important for digester mixing and generation of gas liquid interfacial area the bottom part of the digester was conversely stagnant making this part of the digester a dead zone in terms of h 2 gas liquid mass transfer a parametric study revealed that h 2 gas liquid mass transfer could be increased by increasing the flowrates through the ejector or by decreasing the h 2 bubble size regarding model complexity it was found that the lift and turbulent forces had a negligible impact on the hydrodynamics and may safely be ignored to reduce the computational cost for full scale digester simulations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
16715,the addition of hydrogen to anaerobic digesters is an emerging technique for the sustainable upgrading of biogas to biomethane with renewable electricity however it is critically dependent on the effective gas liquid transfer of hydrogen which is a sparingly soluble gas very little is known about the impact of liquid and gas flow and bubble size on gas liquid transfer during h 2 injection in full scale anaerobic digesters a computational fluid dynamic model was developed using a two fluid approach for non newtonian liquid in the open source computational fluid dynamics cfd platform openfoam the newly developed model was validated against published experimental data sets of a gas mixed laboratory scale anaerobic digester with good agreement between the numerical and experimental velocity fields the hydrodynamics of the full scale in situ biomethanation system using venturi ejectors for h 2 injection was then simulated to investigate gas liquid dynamics including gas liquid mass transfer at different operational conditions gas liquid mixing is mainly controlled by the gas plumes interaction which promotes turbulence at the interaction zone resulting in increasing gas bubbles mixing with the liquid and the gas liquid interfacial area however beyond the plume interaction zone the digester had flow short circuiting and inactive zones it was found that due to this short circuiting behaviour an increase in gas flow rate may not be an effective option in reducing inactive zones although it can increase the gas liquid interfacial area comparative analysis of the impact of gas flow and bubble size indicated that gas flow had a linear effect on both kla and gas holdup but that bubble size had a non linear impact with higher kla values achieved at bubble sizes less than 2 mm comparison against measured data in the same system indicated the predicted kla values were at the same level as measured kla at a bubble size of 2 mm keywords anaerobic digestion gas liquid mixing gas liquid mass transfer hydrodynamics cfd in situ biogas upgrading 1 introduction the use of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar energy have increased liu et al 2017 dramatically and will continue to do so however wind and solar energy sources fluctuate substantially and power produced may become surplus when electricity demand is low or generation is high inkeri et al 2018 power to gas technology provides a pathway of utilising renewable electricity linking the power grid to the gas grid liu et al 2017 the technology considerably increases the energy system s capacity to respond to the dynamic load from wind and photovoltaic power production while capturing carbon dioxide co 2 from the biogas otherwise lost to the atmosphere the technology uses water split into hydrogen h 2 and oxygen o 2 via electrolysis the h 2 is then used to reduce co 2 into methane ch 4 which can immediately be used as natural gas or stored within the existing natural gas infrastructure biological methanation is a promising power to gas technology that utilises derived h 2 from electrolysis to upgrade biogas to a higher ch 4 content munoz et al 2015 typically biogas contains about 50 70 ch 4 and 30 50 co 2 and its upgrading to ch 4 content above 90 98 not only makes it directly usable as natural gas but also reduces co 2 emissions to the atmosphere as a carbon capture and utilisation ccu technology deng and hagg 2010 in the biomethanation process h 2 is biologically utilised to reduce co 2 to ch 4 via methanogenesis angelidaki et al 2019 the reaction is mediated by hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea voelklein et al 2019 biomethanation can be in situ or ex situ in in situ biogas upgrading the h 2 is directly injected into the existing biogas digester and converted by the native population methanogens angelidaki et al 2019 voelklein et al 2019 conversely in ex situ upgrading biogas together with electrolytic hydrogen is directed through an external digester containing a specialised culture of normally thermophilic methanogens angelidaki et al 2019 voelklein et al 2019 in comparison with ex situ upgrading in situ upgrading offers low investment and maintenance cost utilises existing infrastructure angelidaki et al 2019 jensen et al 2020 2018 designs for retrofitting in situ upgrading must utilise existing infrastructure which means that any hydrogen delivery system must be optimised to the digester rather than designing a combined system for effective gas liquid transfer the most important impediment to biomethanisation is a low apparent h 2 consumption rates bassani et al 2016 bhattacharyya and singh 2010 burkhardt et al 2015 diaz et al 2015 guiot et al 2011 inkeri et al 2018 kougias et al 2017 luo and angelidaki 2012 2013 luo et al 2012 pauss et al 1990 szuhaj et al 2016 under most hydrogen loading rates the consumption rate is limited by hydrogen gas transfer determined by the low liquid solubility of hydrogen rather than biochemical capacity of the methanogens inkeri et al 2018 norbertus et al 2011 which results in unreacted h 2 appearing in the biogas the exception is very high hydrogen consumption rates and or main digester feeds which result in a high ammonia e g manure where biomethanisation can deplete co 2 to the point that ph increases above 8 0 which causes general inhibition including to the methanogens luo et al 2012 wang et al 2013 this can be economically controlled by acid addition or increases in loading rate or feed composition wang et al 2013 the overall gas liquid mass transfer rate for a sparingly soluble gas such as h 2 is determined by gas liquid transfer area solubility gas diffusivity and liquid film resistance to transfer pauss et al 1990 gas liquid transfer area is specific for the given digester configurations including h 2 injector type venturi dissolved gas sparger or membrane diaz et al 2015 luo et al 2012 and operating conditions including mixing speed bhattacharyya and singh 2010 luo et al 2012 flow pattern guiot et al 2011 hydrogen delivery systems considered for in situ upgrading include sparging tirunehe and norddahl 2016 hollow fibre membranes luo et al 2012 gas diffusers in combination with an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket digester bassani et al 2016 and venturi type injectors jensen et al 2018 the venturi type injector offers several advantages including external fitment with low investment cost cumby 1987 jensen et al 2020 2018 rubio et al 2002 in comparison with the gas sparging systems it reduces fouling at the gas injection point bauer et al 1963 offering better transfer efficiency than gas lances because of these advantages the venturi type injection system is considered as a key candidate for h 2 injection for the industrial scale biogas digester hjulmand et al 2012 jensen et al 2018 gas injection interacts with hydrodynamic processes inside the digester including gas liquid transfer mixing entrainment of liquid flow re circulation and fluctuations of turbulent eddies there is very limited research into these fundamental hydrodynamic processes in digesters which is governed by three phase gas liquid non newtonian viscosity variable density and biological reactions a mechanistic computational analysis of hydrogen injection systems would substantially assist in providing optimised design of these systems for complete hydrogen consumption given varied biodigester designs and sizes experimental empirical optimisation is expensive and difficult to scale while experiments have been carried out to understand the final results in terms of the mixing behaviour in laboratory or pilot scale digesters capela et al 2009 karim et al 2004 smith et al 1993 terashima et al 2009 varma and dahhan 2007 these should be used in conjunction with theoretical analysis to provide the ability to scale up computational fluid dynamics cfd modelling allows optimisation of design for a wide range of digester configurations and operating conditions baeten et al 2019 cfd analysis of digestion systems has been used to simulate laboratory and pilot scale anaerobic digesters coughtrie et al 2013 karim et al 2007 riquelme et al 2018 shu et al 2019 vesvikar and dahhan 2005 wei et al 2019 as well as full scale digesters dapelo et al 2015 dapelo and bridgeman 2018a 2018b jensen et al 2020 2018 wu 2010a 2010b including gas liquid interaction it has also been used for biomethanation jensen et al 2018 this study jensen et al 2018 focused on effect of gas holdup in venturi gas injection but did not consider hydrodynamic parameters non newtonian rheology gas and liquid re circulation and turbulent energy exchange a detailed hydrodynamic analysis of a full scale digester in the particular context of biomethanation has not been done the aim of this study is therefore to fill this gap by analysing detailed hydrodynamics of a full scale manure based biogas digester fitted with two side entry venturi injectors according to the experimental setup by jensen et al 2020 this incorporates an euler euler two fluid approach considering non newtonian rheology of the liquid unlike previously reported studies the gas bubble diameter is considered as mono dispersed rather than assumed as constant which accounts for bubble volume change with pressure furthermore several gas liquid interfacial momentum exchange models have been adopted from varying assumptions since the published literature lack consensus about which models are appropriate in the context of full scale digester previously reported experimental data sets of a gas mixed laboratory scale anaerobic digester were used for validation karim et al 2004 this allows assessment of bubble plume dynamics mean flow characteristics and turbulent structures to identify the impact on achieving optimal gas liquid interfacial area 2 overview of the physical problem this section provides overview of the gas mixed laboratory scale digester followed by description of the full scale digester 2 1 laboratory scale gas lift digester the numerical model is validated against a set of relevant laboratory scale cases provided by karim et al 2004 in these experiments computed tomography ct and computer radioactive particle tracking carpt techniques were used to measure the flow fields in a laboratory scale gas lift digester having diameter and liquid height of 0 2024 m and 0 222 m respectively the digester was concentrically mounted with a draft tube diameter of about 0 044 m the inlet of the draft tube was located at height of 0 04 m from bottom of the digester the gas was sparged through an injector pipe diameter of 0 005 m positioned at the centre of the draft tube further details of the experiment may be found in karim et al 2004 due to asymmetric nature of the digester the problem may be reduced to two dimensional 2 d asymmetric coughtrie et al 2013 karim et al 2007 wei et al 2019 wu 2010a and the numerical simulation is performed in 2 d asymmetric instead of three dimensional 3 d 2 2 full scale digester for in situ biogas upgrading the system assessed is a 1200 m 3 manure fed digester with an operating volume of 1100 m 3 the height of 12 5 m and a diameter of 10 6 m the digester is mixed by a commercial gasmix system landia denmark consisting of two venturi ejectors mounted 6 5 m above the ground a pump takes out the liquid from the bottom of the digester and supplies it to a venturi ejector when the liquid flows into the venturi restriction a vacuum is formed causing head space gas to draw into the ejector the concomitant gas liquid mixture is injected into the bulk liquid further details on the systems including measured data may be found in jensen et al 2020 2018 a schematic of the physical problem is shown in fig 1 3 numerical methods this section identifies underlying governing equations and implementation for the specific cases 3 1 governing equations the controlling physics may be formulated using euler euler based two fluid model where the gas and liquid phases are assumed as pseudo continuum and inter penetrating to each other agerardi 2003 appels et al 2008 rusche 2002 torvik and svendsen 1990 wu 2010a the continuity and momentum equations for the gas liquid systems may be expressed as drew 1982 marschall 2011 rusche 2002 1 α j ρ j t α j ρ j u j 0 2 α j ρ j u j t α j ρ j u j u j α j p j α j ρ j g j α j ρ j τ j m j here j denotes the gas and liquid phases α is the volume fraction ρ is the density u and p are the velocity and pressure respectively g is the gravitational acceleration τ is the effective reynolds stress tensors and m j represents the interfacial momentum exchange term between the gas and liquid phases the momentum exchange term m j typically comprises of the drag force virtual mass force lift force and turbulent dispersion force and may be expressed as 3 m j m d m v m m l m t d where m d m v m m l and m t d are the drag force virtual mass force lift force and turbulent dispersion force respectively the drag force accounts the amount of resistance on movement of the gas bubbles in liquid which may be expressed as boutet et al 2009 marschall et al 2011 rusche 2002 4 m d r a g 3 4 α g ρ l c d 1 d g u r u r here α g is the gas hold up d g is the bubble diameter c d is the drag coefficient ρ l is the density of the liquid and u r is the relative velocity to date several empirical models have been developed for c d frederix et al 2019 haley 2017 ishii and zuber 1979 shu et al 2019 surgue et al 2017 in this study the well known ishii and zuber 1979 model was used which considered the change in bubble shapes with changing flow regimes in liquid further details of this model may be found in ishii and zuber 1979 the virtual mass force arises due to weight of the surrounding liquid as the gas bubbles travel through them which may be written as boutet et al 2009 marschall et al 2011 rusche 2002 5 m v m α g ρ g c v m d u g d t d u l d t where c v m is the virtual mass force coefficient and assumed as c v m 0 5 drew and passman 1998 kramer 2000 the lift force arises due to lateral dispersion of the liquid and may be expressed as boutet et al 2009 marschall et al 2011 rusche 2002 6 m l α g ρ l c l u g u l u l where c l is the lift force coefficient and modelled using tomiyama correlations tomiyama et al 2002 finally the turbulent dispersion force which arises due to fluctuations of bubbles in turbulent regime may be expressed as boutet et al 2009 marschall et al 2011 rusche 2002 7 m t d ρ l c t d c d u g u l ν t α g α g where c t d is the turbulent dispersion force coefficient and modelled using lopez de bertodano correlations lopez and lahey 1994 the effective reynolds stress tensor τ is a function

empirical constants 3 1 1 rheology the liquid was assumed as the power law fluid and the viscosity may be expressed as wu 2010a 9 η k γ n 1 where k is the consistency coefficient n is the flow behaviour index and γ is the strain rate 3 1 2 bubble diameters the gas bubble diameter was assumed as the mono dispersed which may be expressed as frederix et al 2019 10 d p d g p 0 p 1 3 here d p represents the bubble diameter at pressure p whereas d g is the bubble diameter at the ambient pressure p 0 3 1 3 boundary conditions the boundary conditions are summarised in table 1 3 2 model solution the governing equations were discretised using the finite volume method fvm of openfoam in resolving these equations the euler euler model originally developed by rusche 2002 was employed however this model was unable to consider non newtonian liquid therefore the model was extended for a non newtonian fluid in addition a degassing boundary condition was implemented in the newly developed solver which was not available in the default openfoam suite in resolving the coupled velocity pressure equations the pimple 1 1 pressure implicit method for pressure linked equations algorithm was used whereas the phase fraction equation was resolved using the mules 2 2 multidimensional universal limiter with explicit solution method which is an iterative technique based on the flux corrected transport fct a time marching solution was conducted using a euler scheme which is a first order temporal discretisation scheme in the case of spatial discretisation the convective terms were discretised using gauss scheme along with a combination of limiter for the interpolated convective flux for instance the vanleer scheme was used for the phase fraction the limitedlinear 1 scheme was used for the scalar fields whereas the limitedlinearv 1 was employed for the vector fields finally the stress terms were evaluated using the liner scheme without limiting further details of the mentioned algorithms may be found in moukalled et al 2015 in the case of the laboratory scale digester the geometry is relatively simple and reduced to 2 d axisymmetric the major hurdle in simulating this digester lies on finding the bubble diameter and rheological properties of the liquid since these parameters were not measured for these specific experiments karim et al 2007 vesvikar and dahhan 2005 wei et al 2019 wu 2010a based on the previous studies on this digester coughtrie et al 2013 karim et al 2007 vesvikar and dahhan 2005 wei et al 2019 wu 2010a the bubble diameter was assumed as 5 mm and the rheological properties were evaluated at total solids ts 5 4 the gas flow rate was taken as 0 028 m 3 hr along with momentum closures of drag virtual mass lift and turbulent dispersion a structured grid was used and a mesh dependency study conducted three hexahedral dominated meshes namely coarse n cells 0 7 10 4 medium n cells 1 5 10 4 and fine n cells 3 1 10 4 were constructed here n cells represents the number of mesh cells the skewness and average non orthogonality of these meshes were maintained below 0 35 and zero respectively it was observed that these meshes produced similar results and the difference between the medium and fine meshes was negligible as shown in fig 2 a for axial velocity profiles at z 18 25 cm here z represents the height measured from bottom of the digester therefore the medium mesh was chosen for the simulations in the case of the full scale digester the bubble diameters were considered as d g 1 mm 2 5 mm 5 mm 10 mm and 40 mm typically used for simulating gas liquid systems dapelo et al 2015 dapelo and bridgeman 2018a 2018b jensen et al 2020 2018 lou and zhu 2013 wei et al 2019 the rheological properties of the liquid were taken from the published experimental results at ts 3 5 begdouri 1992 wu 2010a the homogeneous gas liquid injections were considered for both of the injectors a variety of flow rates based on the experimental conditions were used at the these injectors where the liquid and gas flow rates were maintained as equal the simulation was first conducted using drag and virtual mass forces and then a comparative study was performed to evaluate the effect of lift and turbulent dispersion forces due to the complex geometry and full scale size of the digester a tetrahedral dominated unstructured mesh was used to test mesh dependence four different size meshes namely coarse n cells 1 9 10 5 medium n cells 6 6 10 5 fine n cells 11 2 10 5 and finer n cells 16 6 10 5 were tested the skewness and average non orthogonality of these unstructured meshes were maintained in a range of 0 6 to 0 8 and below 15 degrees respectively it was found all these meshes produced similar results however the difference between the fine and finer meshes was marginal as shown in the axial velocity profiles at z 10 m at the flow rates at the left and right injectors of q l 320 m 3 hr and q r 360 m 3 hr respectively in fig 2 b therefore the fine mesh was chosen for the study the simulations were run until a steady state was achieved which was judged by both of the residuals and changed in key outputs including velocity pressure and turbulent properties with time steady state results are unless otherwise noted a minimum residual value was taken as 1 10 7 and the simulations were performed for the total time of 50 s and 200 s for the lab scale and the full scale digesters respectively the university of queensland s high performance computing hpc facility tinaroo was employed for parallel computing of the lab scale digester using 8 processors for 8 hours and the full scale digester using 24 processors for 48 hours 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of the methodology lab scale system fig 3 a shows comparison of the axial velocity profiles in liquid with the experimental results of karim et al 2004 at z 3 75 cm 11 25 cm and 18 25 cm at the flow rate of 0 028 m 3 hr here z represents the height measured from the bottom of the digester fig 3 b and c show the corresponding profiles of turbulent kinetic energy tke and the energy dissipation rate at the mentioned heights as can be seen the predicted axial velocities are quite similar to the experimental observations in both of the cases the upflow appeared within the draft tube i e 0 r r 0 2 followed by a vortex with separation point i e velocity becomes zero and then negative at central regions of the digester followed by these velocity features the turbulent fields varied significantly throughout the digester initially both of the tke and dissipation rates became higher close to the inlet regions i e r r 0 05 due to injected momentum flux of the gases as the flow travelled toward the surface vicinity the tke and energy dissipation rate increased at central regions of the digester which was mainly attributed to the vortex formation at these regions the laboratory results identify that the model is capable of predicting velocity fields in a system with relevant turbulence and gas phase properties and as a system state output indicates that the models selected are appropriate additional key outputs often difficult to observe in an opaque fluid could include bubble diameter bubble velocity particle retention distribution and fluid rheological properties while difficult to measure particularly in full scale systems they would further enhance confidence in the models selected 4 2 hydrodynamics of the full scale biogas digester fig 4 shows the isosurfaces of the generated gas plumes along with streamlines and velocity vectors in liquid with flow rates through left and right injectors of q l 320 m 3 hr and q r 360 m 3 hr respectively and bubble diameter of d g 2 5 mm grey scale is used to visualise the low velocity regions and a single colour is used for isosurfaces and will be used for other figures unless otherwise noted gas bubbles released from the injectors travel towards the liquid surface karpinska and bridgeman 2016 forming two gas plumes the width of these gas plumes increased with axial distance from the injectors and subsequently interacted with each other and with the digester walls near liquid surface vesvikar and dahhan 2005 wu 2014 these interactions promoted turbulence wu 2014 which resulted in wide distribution of gases at central regions of the digester the fluid movement substantially changes followed by these gas distributions close to the injectors the liquid mostly followed the injected momentum flux of the gas liquid as distance above the injector increased the gas bubbles started dragging liquid along their path known as the entrainment process wang et al 2019 and upflow appeared within the plumes fraga et al 2016 wu 2014 as gas bubbles reached the surface they escaped to the atmosphere however the entrained liquid could not follow them into the atmosphere and subsequently directed radially towards the walls and the flow fields generated by the neighbouring gas plume liquid contacting the walls moved downwards due to momentum continuity wu 2010a as shown in fig 5 a where velocity vectors in liquid are demonstrated in x z plane in the latter case as the flow fields generated by one plume enter to its neighbouring flow fields the mutual interaction between the two plumes became stronger and a high shear layer formed in between them the flow fields inside this layer may be considered as a superposition of the two opposite flow fields ying et al 2019 which subsequently resulted in faster liquid dropping at the plumes interaction zone relative to the walls as demonstrated in figs 4 and 5 a as a consequence four vortices represented by flow circulation around a dead zone i e inactive zone with stagnant fluid dapelo et al 2015 formed two in the gas plume interaction zone and others between the digester walls and the upflow columns identified in figs 4 and 5 a these vortices mainly comprised of fluctuations in local velocity fields and turbulent eddies simiano and lakehal 2012 which significantly impeded gas escaping to the atmosphere by dragging them downwards inside the digester fig 5 a shows the vortices are dominant at the plume interaction zone relative to the digester walls which resulted in wider distribution of gas bubbles as well as increased mixing and gas liquid interfacial area at plume interaction zone this effectively increased gas hold up and mass transfer area it should be noticed that in fig 4 the fluid movement mostly remains insignificant below 0 002 m s below z 5 m except at the outlets these low velocity regions may be characterised as a dead zone dapelo et al 2015 the profiles of the tke and the energy dissipation rate at z 6 5 m 10 m and 12 m shown in figs 5 b and c reflects the evolution of turbulent structure throughout the digester in general both tke and energy dissipation rate decreased close to the walls and central region of the digester forming two near symmetric peaks in between them the profiles presented a similar trend in evolution gradual changed in gradients with elevations the peak value increased with elevation for the tke as can be seen in fig 5 b while it decreased for the energy dissipation rate as can be seen in fig 5 c this explains the fluctuation in turbulent eddies increased close to the surface regions however close to the injector regions at z 6 5 m the energy dissipation rate dominated over the tke reflecting the reduction of fluctuations in turbulent eddies simiano and lakehal 2012 the reducing fluctuations of turbulent eddies eventually promoted plume contractions decreasing turbulent eddy viscosity at these regions the increase in energy dissipation rate relative to tke became more pronounced at the right plume compared to that of the left plume as can be seen in figs 5 b and 5 c in light of the local velocity fields in 5 a the dominant energy dissipation rate is mainly attributed to the higher radial velocities at the injector regions overall this section revealed that the hydrodynamic behaviour of the digester is mostly influenced by the gas plumes interaction and the mixing as well as the gas liquid interfacial area may be increased by increasing plumes interaction 4 2 1 effect of the gas bubble diameter this section evaluates the impact of bubble diameter on gas distribution and kla throughout the digester simulations were conducted using a variety of bubble diameters as d g 1 mm 5 mm 10 mm and 40 mm at constant flow rates at the left and right injectors as q l 320 m 3 hr and q r 360 m 3 hr respectively fig 6 shows the isosurfaces of the gas plumes along with the low velocity regions at a d g 1 mm and b d g 5 mm c the profiles of the turbulent eddy viscosity at d g 1 mm and 5 mm at z 12 m and d kla kla represents the mass transfer rate calculated using the higbie 1935 model with apparent kla was determined from spatially distributed bubble size gas volume fractions and velocity fields the isosurfaces exhibited substantial increase in gas distribution at small bubble diameter of d g 1 mm compared to that of d g 5 mm such an increased in gas distribution was mainly attributed to the increasing turbulence at the plumes interaction zone as can be observed in fig 6c where the turbulent eddy viscosity substantially increased at d g 1 mm relative to d g 5 mm fig 6 d shows a decrease in kla with increasing bubble diameter reflecting the fluctuation in turbulent eddies and subsequently the mixing become less dominant with the larger bubble diameter this concludes that an increasing bubble diameter will have an negative impact on the overall gas liquid interfacial area however it should be noticed that in fig 6a and b the digester observed a similar amount of stagnant zone about 40 of total digester volume although the bubble diameter was changed from d g 1 mm to 5 mm this eventually indicates that the inference of bubble diameter on mixing is mainly attributed to the plumes interaction zone and has marginal impact on the flow short circuiting at the digester bottom 4 2 2 effect of the flow rates this section assesses whether increasing flow rates can be a route for increasing mixing and gas liquid interfacial area while decreasing stagnant zone of the digester the simulations considered varying flow rates in a range between q 120 m 3 hr to q 760 m 3 hr while bubble diameter remained constant as d g 2 5 mm it is worth noting that q represents the total mass flow rate injected into the digester and is considered as q q l q r with q l q r fig 7 shows the isosurfaces of the gas plumes along with low velocity regions at a q 120 m 3 hr and b q 710 m 3 hr c the turbulent eddy viscosity profiles at q 120 m 3 hr and 710 m 3 hr at z 12 m and d kla and volume averaged gas holdup as a function of the flow rates as can be seen in fig 7a and b the gas distribution is significantly impacted by increasing flow rates the bubbles tend to more accumulate at the upper central regions of the digester this was mainly attributed to growing turbulent fluctuations as identified in fig 7c due to increased bubble plumes interaction at a higher flow rate of q 710 m 3 hr these increasing turbulent fluctuations with flow rates eventually increased kla and overall gas hold up for the digester as shown in fig 7d it should be noticed that in fig 7a and b the low velocity regions at the bottom of the digester slightly reduced with a significant increased in flow rates almost seven times in magnitude this indicates that the injected liquid flowed along a nearly direct pathway to the outlets and short circuiting occurred due to the short circuiting behaviour the injected liquid had a marginal impact on the digester s overall gas liquid mixing 4 2 3 comparison with the experimental results the hydrogen consumption kinetics for this 1110 m 3 system were experimentally determined in jensen et al 2020 this data can be used to determine the apparent kla for hydrogen and compared to the current modelling study the experimental study injected h 2 at varying rates 8 1 63 8 m 3 hr but with a constant total gas injection rate of 320 m 3 hr 160 m 3 hr through each ejector due to a simultaneous injection of head space gas liquid injection rate was 160 m 3 hr for both ejectors a linear relationship r 0 9985 was found between the h 2 conversion rate and the h 2 injection rate with a slope value of 0 2196 l h 2 converted m 3 reactor m 3 h 2 injected jensen et al 2020 the experimental volumetric mass transfer coefficient can be estimated from standard mass transfer theory i e r h 2 kla c sat 0 where rh 2 and c sat represent h 2 conversion rate and saturation concentration respectively with a henrys coefficient for hydrogen in water k h at 52 c of 1380 4 atm l mol poling et al 2008 the h 2 partial pressure was taken as the volume fraction of h 2 at a total head space pressure of 1 atm the concentration of dissolved h 2 in the liquid was set to zero assuming h 2 conversion is limited by the gas liquid mass transfer rate jensen et al 2020 observed ph was 7 8 7 9 which is below the inhibitory level wang et al 2013 the calculated volumetric mass transfer coefficient was 1 10 3 1 s which compares well with mass transfer coefficients derived from the model at similar injection conditions aligning with a bubble size of approximately 2 mm figs 6d and 7 d this diameter is related to some uncertainty however as important physical quantities like slurry rheology and surface tension were not experimentally determined and the model therefore relied on literature data from similar systems the model demonstrated a beneficial effect of having the two gas plumes interacting with respect to increasing the gas liquid interfacial area for h 2 gas liquid mass transfer the experimental study accordingly found that gas injection through both venturi ejectors is necessary to obtain efficient gas liquid mass transfer rates of h 2 in two of the conducted h 2 injection trials the h 2 injecting ejector was prevented from injecting head space gas simultaneously with h 2 and therefore only injected h 2 at a rate of 12 1 m 3 hr jensen et al 2020 the second ejector was operated normally with a gas injection rate of 160 m 3 hr the obstruction of head space gas injection in the h 2 ejector resulted in a decrease in the relative h 2 conversion from 41 to 50 to 2 4 compared to experiments where the h 2 ejector injected h 2 at a similar rate of 12 1 m 3 hr but at a total gas injection rate of 160 m 3 hr due to the simultaneous injection of head space gas injection the overall agreement between the experimental and modelled observations show promise that the model can be used to optimise the h 2 injection technology further future studies should investigate how to enhance the bubble plume interaction by varying ejector orientation and the number of ejectors the modelled results in this paper suggest that only half of the reactor volume is active for gas liquid mass transfer under the applied experimental conditions a model based assessment of how the dead zone of the reactor can be minimised is a key target for optimisation one option is lowering the vertical position of the ejector however the ejectors current commercial application is to mix the anaerobic digester the high mounting position is needed to generate the vacuum that draws head space gas into the ejector at a sufficiently high rate that as shown in this paper is necessary for proper digester mixing use of biogas mixed ejector for hydrogen transfer is an economical way to mix the digester and provide hydrogen in comparison with more expensive direct hydrogen diffusers and membranes this study indicates that higher hydrogen transfer rates can be achieved which may cause high ph limitations as discussed in the introduction luo et al 2012 wang et al 2013 while the related experimental work jensen et al 2020 did not see inhibitory ph levels ph 7 8 7 9 significantly higher transfer rates could induce high ph inhibition which can be managed as discussed in the introduction it is noted that rather than incorporating biochemistry into the cfd model it is more appropriate to determine optimal configuration and related kla through cfd then use process modelling to determine potential ph issues and management strategies incorporating a suitable high ph inhibition function alemany et al 2020 4 3 effect of sub models this section assesses the impact of lift and turbulent dispersion forces on the hydrodynamics the bubble diameter and the flow rates at the left and right injectors were taken as constant as d g 5 mm q l 320 m 3 hr and q r 330 m 3 hr respectively fig 8 shows the profiles of a local axial velocity and b local gas hold at z 10 m it is clearly observed that the effect of lift and turbulent dispersion forces have marginal impact on the flow fields and gas distributions these marginal impacts eventually indicate that the momentum transfer at the gas liquid interface mainly attributed to the drag force and the injected momentum flux has negligible impact on the bubble lateral dispersion on the contrary it was observed that the lift and turbulent dispersion forces increase the simulation complexity along with the computational cost and it is difficult to achieve an stable solution the virtual mass force also found to have negligible impact on the hydrodynamics but significantly increases the solution stability overall the results reinforce the conclusion that the lift and turbulent dispersion forces may safely be ignored in simulating full scale digesters 5 conclusions a two phase computational model describing the hydrodynamics of a gas liquid system was developed in openfoam and validated by an experimental dataset from a gas lift laboratory digester the model was used to describe the hydrodynamics of a full scale anaerobic digester during venturi based h 2 injection for in situ biomethanation where h 2 conversion is reported limited by the h 2 gas liquid mass transfer rate the predicted volumetric mass transfer coefficients were in good agreement with published experimental data on h 2 conversion rates in the same digester suggesting that the model can be used to optimise h 2 conversion in the physical system the modelled flow field revealed that the formation of two interacting gas plumes in the upper zone of the digester is important for digester mixing and generation of gas liquid interfacial area the bottom part of the digester was conversely stagnant making this part of the digester a dead zone in terms of h 2 gas liquid mass transfer a parametric study revealed that h 2 gas liquid mass transfer could be increased by increasing the flowrates through the ejector or by decreasing the h 2 bubble size regarding model complexity it was found that the lift and turbulent forces had a negligible impact on the hydrodynamics and may safely be ignored to reduce the computational cost for full scale digester simulations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
16716,uvc disinfection has been recognised by the who as an effective disinfection treatment to provide decentralized potable water under real conditions there are still unknowns that limit this application including the influence of suspended solids and natural organic matter this work aims to investigate the influence of two key parameters suspended solids and natural organic matter on the efficiency of uvc disinfection of surface water to achieve the drinking water quality requirements established by the who for point of use pou technologies kaolinite turbidity agent and humic acids ha model of organic matter were used in a factorial design of experiments turbidity from 0 to 5 ntu and ha from 0 to 3 5 mg l to investigate their effect on uvc inactivation of ms2 phage in surface water a collimated beam 12 w and a commercial uvc disinfection flow system 16 w designed to provide drinking water at households were used the uvc flow system both in the laboratory and in the field was able to achieve the reduction requirements established by who lrv 3 5 for all tested conditions confirming the good performance of the studied uvc disinfection system the results found in the lab were used to establish a numerical model that predicts the disinfection rate constant as a function of water turbidity and transmittance at 254 nm confidence level 95 the model permitted to elucidate the critical effect of low concentrations of ha in reducing the inactivation rate by 40 for 3 5 mg l ha compared with 0 the non significant detrimental effect of turbidity lower than 5 ntu and the lack of synergistic effects between both parameters at these levels the uvc flow system was also tested in the field in tzabalho chiapas mexico and antioquia colombia with spiked ms2 into natural surface water this investigation opens a potential application to monitor the performance of uvc systems with surface water by monitoring transmittance at 254 nm as a tool to control uvc domestic systems to deliver safe drinking water in a household without the need of expensive and laborious biological monitoring tools keywords disinfection experimental factorial design kaolinite humic acids ms2 bacteriophage 1 introduction in 2010 the united nations un explicitly recognized the human right to water and sanitation which became the sixth sustainable development goal sdg un 2018 many efforts have been devoted to achieving the sdg6 by 2030 guaranteeing universal access to basic sanitation including safe and clean drinking water although current data suggests that efforts are not enough at present one in three people do not have access to clean drinking water exposing them to waterborne diseases unicef who 2019 many water technologies have been developed to reach water safety availability accessibility and affordability for all however there is a general lack of treatment processes specifically designed to operate in low income countries where high technological solutions are not implementable due to large operation and maintenance costs dependence on underdeveloped supply chains for the system components and required technical end user preparation there is the need for technological improvement adequate resources capacities and targeted strategies to achieve the set sdg6 wwap 2015 especially in remote and rural developing regions for these reasons point of use pou technologies that consider the needs of the areas of intervention and the end users have been developed and applied as a more sustainable and accessible solution providing safe access to clean water to remote areas empowering local populations and decreasing the risk of waterborne diseases sobsey et al 2008 the world health organization who established a protocol for the efficacy assessment of household water treatment and storage hwts technologies focusing on the performance against few microbial indicators and recommended consistent utilization by the users who 2016 hwts technologies for disinfection commonly applied include chemical treatment using soluble chlorine based tablets filtration typically using ceramic and sand or bio sand filters sobsey et al 2008 solar treatment using sodis mcguigan et al 2012 and uvc treatment which is the most promising alternative due to its high efficacy against most waterborne pathogens its rapid action and minimal operation cost and consumables only electricity to run the lamps and a pump lui et al 2016 uvc disinfection in low income and remote regions has advantages as a pou system over other approaches because it does not require technical knowledge for operation does not affect taste and odour of the treated water does not produce cancerogenic disinfection by products dbps and no chemical compounds are required curtis et al 2016 however it may require physical pre treatment to improve the optical quality of the water i e to reduce its turbidity and organic content which may be addressed to some extent with the installation of a low cost filtration system a power source may not be available in remote and rural areas which can be resolved with photovoltaic solar panels the need to replace uv lamps every 12 months according to the uv lamp lifetime 8 000 to 10 000 hours maybe a limiting factor in low income communities even if they are not really costly eg 10 per 15w lamp lui et al 2016 most of the applications involved the installation of a single low pressure uvc lamp due to its high germicidal efficiency long lamp lifetime vast availability on the market and proven pou commercial designs bolton and cotton 2008 currently uv led technology is seen as the most promising alternative to uv mercury lamps for their energy efficiency compactness robustness versatility and probable improved inactivation effectiveness by applying multiple wavelengths and adjustable pulsed illumination vilhunen et al 2009 song et al 2016 however it is still a technological solution under development that cannot be considered a sustainable alternative to lp low pressure uvc systems in low income communities mainly due to its very high cost and low availability on the water devices market following the development of a standardized method for the determination of the uv dose in collimated beam systems bolton and linden 2003 numerous studies were conducted on the evaluation of uv disinfection effectiveness and the determination of the effective uv dose necessary for the inactivation of selected pathogens hijnen et al 2005 identified the relationship between waterborne pathogens inactivation and uv dose as follows from higher to lower sensitivity to uv radiation bacteria protozoa cysts and oocysts bacterial spores and viruses which are the most resistant pathogens to uv due to the presence of rna containing uracil instead of thymine which is the most sensitive base to uv moreover ms2 bacteriophage was confirmed to be an appropriate model organism for both biodosimetry experiments and uv disinfection validation due to its high uv resistance when compared to all other waterborne pathogens excluding adenoviruses leenheer and croue 2003 the optical properties of the water or more specifically its transparency in the uvc range is the key to achieve successful disinfection results as expected for a uv driven process thus turbidity and uv transmittance uvt are the most important water parameters in uv disinfection uvt is determined by the presence of inorganic and organic light absorbing compounds including iron salts nitrates and more importantly natural dissolved organic matter nom and dom quantified by dissolved organic carbon doc leenheer and croue 2003 humic matter was found to be a fundamental component of dom having as main constituents fulvic

simulate environmental doc in a number of studies abbt braun et al 2004 small amounts of ha below 3 5 mg l in water can produce a high attenuation of the uv radiation uvt 254 nm 80 approx due to their high absorption spectra in the short uv range water turbidity is defined as the scattered light measured in the visible range at a 90 angle to the direction of the light source the scattering

found to shield microorganisms from uv light through shading and encasement mechanisms loge et al 2001 according to the who it is recommended to reduce water turbidity below 1 ntu and should never exceed 5 ntu before applying an uv disinfection treatment who 2014 common compounds used as turbidity models for inorganic suspended solids ss are kaolinite and test dust who 2014 these accepted models for suspended matter can be added to the water to attain the desired light scattering and turbidity effects regardless their chemical nature organic or inorganic as they are non soluble the single effect of turbidity was studied for ms2 uv inactivation showing non significant effect over the dose for turbidity below 5 25 ntu templeton et al 2006 increasing levels of transmittance showed no decrease in ms2 inactivation for applied uv doses between 10 100 mj cm2 when the proper correction factor was applied batch et al 2004 very little research has been done on the systematic analysis of turbidity and or humic acids and their effect over uvc disinfection efficiency most of the contributions mention these aspects either making simple comparisons between few values of turbidity or scarcely indicating the recommended uvt required to achieve a desired level of disinfection moreover there is not a lot of information on the separate effects the possible synergistic effects and the possible interactions between the two critical parameters turbidity and uvt simulating real conditions commonly found in the field the understanding of these effects is key know how for an efficient application of uvc disinfection to natural surface water sources for the first time this contribution presents a systematic research of the role of two water quality parameters turbidity and dissolved organic matter and their interference in the efficiency of uv viral disinfection in surface water kaolinite load and ha concentration were selected as the two factors of a complete factorial design of experiments where the effect of turbidity and dissolved organic matter in uvc disinfection efficiency were evaluated alone and together ms2 bacteriophage was selected as viral surrogate due to its high resistance to uvc a collimated beam 12 w and a commercial uvc 16 w disinfection flow system specifically designed to provide drinking water at households were used for all experiments in the lab and in the field the results were analysed to determine parametric relationships between both parameters and develop a predictive model for the inactivation rate constant as a function of turbidity

braun et al 2004 cantwell et al 2008 to quantify the effect of turbidity and uvt254 on uvc disinfection performance the log inactivation values of ms2 were measured as a function of applied uv dose

guidelines bolton and linden 2003 a lp mercury lamp with nominal power of 12 w and emission at 254 nm philips was used together with a 100 ml sample vessel with magnetic stirrer more details in supplementary materials and figure s1 a prior to uvc exposure the lp lamp was warmed up for 3 minutes water matrix samples 100 ml were spiked with 100 μl of ms2 bacteriophage pbs suspension getting an initial ms2 concentration of 106 pfu ml the water samples were placed at the centre of the collimated beam on the magnetic stirrer to ensure continuous mixing and they were exposed to uvc radiation water samples of 1 ml were acquired at specific times during the experiment uvc doses ranged between 60 400 mj cm2 60 90 150 180 210 240 260 300 350 and 400 mj cm2 corresponding to irradiation times

experiments the system was cleaned by pumping a 3 hydrogen peroxide solution and washing thoroughly the uvc lamp was warmed up for at least 3 minutes prior to experiments each 5 l water volume was spiked with ms2 and thoroughly mixed samples were taken at the inlet to determine initial ms2 concentration and in triplicates at the outlet of the reactor after a time interval equal to three times the hydraulic retention time of the reactor to ensure the outlet flowrate was stabilized to the selected value supplementary material table s 1 2 6 statistical analysis and numerical model the inactivation results obtained with the collimated beam were analysed in three phases to identify the correlations between turbidity and uvt254 a linear regression analysis was carried out between the uvc doses and the achieved lrvs to obtain the inactivation rate constant the linear regression analysis was conducted for all 27 experiments of the doe obtaining three values of inactivation rate constant for each experimental condition these inactivation rate constants were employed in a general linear model glm statistical analysis performed using the software minitab version 2019 to evaluate the effect of uvt254 and turbidity on inactivation rate constants the complete glm model was defined considering both single variables and their interaction terms up to the second order eq 2 the uvc inactivation rate constants were the response variables y while turbidity and uvt254 were the independent variables x1 and x2 2 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 1 2 β 4 x 2 2 β 5 x 1 x 2 ε where βj are the regression coefficients and ε the random error the adequacy of the glm was assessed by analysis of variance and analysis of residuals based on a normal probability plot and shapiro test the glm eq 2 was simplified eq 3 considering only single variable and interaction terms up to a first order 3 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 1 x 2 ε the adequacy of this glm was again assessed by analysis of variance and analysis of residuals a second linear regression analysis was carried out between the corrected applied uvc dose and measured ms2 lrvs to determine the ms2 inactivation curve 2 7 field

two of the natural surface waters a spring and a waterhole were collected in the community of tzabalho a native and isolated community in los altos de chiapas south mexico the other two water sources were collected from quebrada la miel and quebrada santa rita in medellin antioquia colombia for mexico the two natural water sources considered fig 1 are used daily by local families for drinking cooking and personal hygiene without any treatment water batches 15 l of each source were collected in clean lid closed containers and stored at ambient temperature in the dark for few hours 24 h for particle sedimentation and reduction of turbidity as ms2 is not naturally present in the environment water batches 15 l were spiked with a stock solution of ms2 initial concentration was of 106 pfu ml the uvc disinfection system evans mexico had a 16 w lp lamp emission 254 nm due to high turbidity 100 ntu waterhole the water was pre treated with a filtration unit consisting of three 2 5 x10 spun filters of 10 5 and 1 μm hydronix water tech usa installed in series the surface water with ms2 was pumped through the system at 3 3 l min using a pressure pump seaflo sfdp1 012 03521 china water samples were taken before and after treatment at inlet and outlet of the system for analysis and ms2 enumeration turbidity a254 and uvt254 were measured with a turbidimeter hana instruments hi 98703

results of all ms2 inactivation experiments for all 9 water conditions were evaluated with the linear least square fitting method estimating inactivation rate constant and intercept with the corresponding correlation coefficient r2 fig 2 supporting material figure s 6 linear regression analysis was applied to determine the inactivation curves for the 9 conditions of the experimental plan obtaining an average value of ms2 inactivation rate constant for each experimental condition table 2 the inactivation rate constant values ranged between 0 012 0 020 cm2 mj these were plotted separately against uvt254 and turbidity fig 3 to have a clear visual representation of results the relation between lrvs and applied uvc doses followed a linear trend fig 2 as described by chick and watson inactivation model watson 1908 showing neither shouldering nor tailing effect as previous studies hinjen et al 2005 batch et al 2004 table 2 shows that both uvt254 and turbidity affected uvc inactivation rate constant to a different extent the results obtained in presence of ha tests 2 3 5 6 8 9 resulted in decreased inactivation rate constants for the same applied uvc dose in comparison to those without ha tests 1 4 7 fig 3 a turbidity showed a very small effect on the inactivation rate constants when comparing experiments with different turbidity levels and equal concentrations of ha fig 3 b in the absence of ha the inactivation rate constant was 0 019 0 002 cm2 mj for 0 ntu 0 020 0 002 cm2 mj for 2 5 ntu and 0 018 0 003 cm2 mj for 5 ntu a similar trend was observed in the presence of 1 75 mg l ha with a lower kinetic constant of 0 013 0 014 0 001 cm2 mj and for the case 3 5 mg l ha with a very similar kinetic constant of 0 012 0 013 0 001 cm2 mj the observed effect of turbidity is in agreement with previous results by batch et al 2004 and hijnen et al 2006 which showed no decrease in inactivation rate constant for turbidity 0 3 ntu and 5 25 ntu respectively thus the ha concentration which contributes directly to uvt254 greatly affects the inactivation rate constant whereas turbidity does not have a significant effect table 2 fig 3 this can be attributed to radiation absorption by ha which negatively influences the efficiency of advanced oxidation treatment processes uv uv h2o2 photo fenton photocatalysis by an increase in light radiation absorbance reducing the water matrix uvt254 cantwell et al 2008 templeton et al 2006 cantwell et al 2008 showed a 50 decrease in lrv of bacteria for water samples containing 120 mg l of ha with respect to those containing no ha due to uv radiation absorbance of ha and ha coating of bacteria cells that reduced their sensitivity to uv radiation templeton et al 2006 found similar results when studying uv inactivation of bacteriophages in samples containing ha up to 150 mg l to confirm the insignificant effect of turbidity on the inactivation rate constant within the range studies in this work the optical properties of kaolinite suspensions were experimentally determined showing that kaolinite particles only scatter light without absorbing it li et al 2018 the absorption coefficient and the scattering coefficient were found equal to 0 cm2 mg and 5 86 cm2 mg respectively further investigations on the optical properties of kaolinite and their role on uv disinfection will be carried out as a result of these findings it can be concluded that the optical behaviour of kaolinite particles does not have a detrimental effect on viral uvc inactivation while the uvc light attenuation due to uv radiation absorption by ha strongly reduces the viral inactivation the results were also statistically analysed to determine potential interactions between both factors section 3 2 3 2 statistical analysis and modelling to investigate the interaction between the inactivation rate k turbidity symbolised as t in the following equations and uvt254 a statistical analysis was conducted for two models of decreasing complexity a complete glm with equation 4 glm1 and a simplified glm with equation 5 glm2 4 k 7 1 0 6 uv t 254 2 6 1 0 6 t 2 0 0017 uv t 254 0 0055 t 6 2 1 0 5 uv t 254 t 0 08 5 k 4 4 1 0 4 uv t 254 1 84 1 0 3 t 1 7 1 0 5 uv t 254 t 0 02 where k cm2 mj is the inactivation rate constant uvt254 is the measured transmittance at wavelength 254 nm and t is the measured turbidity level ntu the two models were statistically analysed resulting in a r2 of 93 8 and 86 7 for glm1 and glm2 respectively determining a goodness of fit of both models glm2 was selected for the study for its mathematical simplicity compared to glm1 while guaranteeing goodness of fit the analysis of variance confidence interval 95 for glm2 determined that the only significant term was the uvt254 term since the p value was 0 006 less than the significance level of 0 05 the other terms turbidity and the interaction term resulted having a p value greater than the significance level respectively of 0 566 and 0 648 the model was further simplified obtaining a simple linear model lm with k as a function of uvt254 equation 6 6 k 3 8 1 0 4 uv t 254 0 018 the statistical analysis resulted in a r2 value of 84 6 confirming the results of glm2 and showing that the applied simplification only results in a 2 decrease of r2 glm2 and lm adequacy was also assessed through the analysis of residuals showing that all assumptions at the base of the analysis residuals normally distributed random and independent distribution of residuals constant variance of residuals were met thus both glm2 and lm adequately describe the inactivation rate constant k from the statistical analysis it can be concluded that for the ranges considered in the present work uvc disinfection efficiency is affected significantly by uvt254 yet insignificantly by turbidity similarly batch et al 2004 conducted a t statistics which indicated no decrease in ms2 inactivation with increasing turbidity confirming the statistical analysis results the proposed model equation 6 was used to estimate the viral inactivation rate constant for each experimental condition based on the samples uvt254 measurements the model was validated by comparing the estimated viral inactivation rate constant values with the experimental ones determined through linear regression table s 2 the results show that the proposed model is able to predict the viral inactivation rate constant quite accurately almost every estimated inactivation rate constant value falls within the 95 ci of the experimentally determined inactivation rate constants with exception of experiment 2 and 9 which distance 0 0007 and 0 0002 from the upper bound and lower bound of their respective ci the goodness of the model can also be observed from the percent error which is 10 for all estimated inactivation rate constant values except 2 fig 4 3 3 ms2 dose response curve analysis the following analysis was carried out to compare literature and expands the understanding of the ms2 dose response a linear regression analysis was conducted on the inactivation experiment results considering the corrected applied uvc dose for the determination of the effective ms2 inactivation curve the inactivation curve fig 5 a was defined by equation 7 7 lrv 0 0261 0 0007 uvc dose 0 64 0 08 where the uvc dose is expressed in mj cm2 and lrv is dimensionless it can be seen that the correction suggested by bolton and linden 2003 was able to adequately correct the applied uvc dose obtaining a uniform linear distribution of the data points fig 5 a it should be noted that not all data points perfectly follow the linear regression curve fig 5 a this can be attributed to the applied correction bolton and linden 2003 which does not consider i sample depths greater than 1 cm for which an appropriate divergence factor should be calculated and ii effects of turbidity as light scattering that might increase the uvc fluence rate in the reactor increasing the delivered uvc dose it is noticeable that the inactivation rate constant k of the inactivation curve defined by equation 7 is slightly lower than the ones reported in literature table s 3 loge et al 2001 cantwell et al 2008 beck et al 2015 2016 this could be due to the higher corrected uvc dose values considered for the inactivation experiments which ranged from 12 267 mj cm2 compared to those used in past studies epa 2006 park et al 2011 the inactivation curve could be better represented by two linear models fig 5 b the first for low uvc doses ranging from 10 90 mj cm2 and the second for high uvc doses ranging from 90 250 mj cm2 the inactivation rate for the first curve is similar to the one reported in literature which was also determined for a low uvc dose range from 5 139 mj cm2 hijnen et al 2006 while the inactivation rate k for the second curve resulted equal to that of the inactivation curve defined by equation 7 table s 3 these results are in good agreement with the ones of beck et al 2015 showing that the dose response curve has curvature and is not completely linear for this reason a two linear regression model for the dose response curve would have great application i as a tool in estimating the viral inactivation of a lp uvc system in a rapid and precise way and ii in uvc flow reactor modelling for which it is a fundamental parameter requiring high accuracy 3 4 uvc inactivation in flow systems the aim of these tests is to show the efficacy of the uvc flow system to provide clean and safe water at a household the flow inactivation experiments were conducted for experimental condition 1 utilizing pure water experiment 1 of doe and experimental condition 9 with 3 5 mg l of ha and turbidity of 5 ntu experiment 9 of doe the results are summarised in table 3 and confronted with lrv requirements for hwt systems established by who which state that for viruses a minimum of 3 log reduction and a maximum of 5 log reduction are needed to achieve a protective or a highly protective level protection for viral waterborne pathogens who 2016 the lrvs for condition 1 were higher than those for condition 9 due to the lower turbidity and uvt254 of 1 for 1 over a 5 lrv was obtained with a flowrate of 1 50 l min and over a 3 lrv with flowrates of 3 00 and 5 20 l min for 9 over 3 lrv was achieved only with flowrate of 1 50 l min while it was not able to meet a 3 lrv with the greater flowrates therefore with water characterized by significant content of organic matter few mg l of ha or similar the operating flowrate should be set lower than 1 50 l min to meet the criteria for a highly protective hwt system these results are in agreement with the ones shown by brownell et al 2008 who assessed the performance of a similar uvc technology determining that the system was able to achieve 4 1 4 5 lrv of ms2 when operated at a flowrate of 5 l min characterized by very low absorbance 0 002 0 01 cm 1 at wavelength 254nm younis et al 2019 also showed the ability of a uvc technology equipped with a swirl at reactor inlet to achieve a 7 1 and 5 5 viral lrv for flowrates of 9 46 and 12 9 l min respectively both with water uvt254 of 95 although these results are in accordance with those obtained in the collimated beam inactivation experiments section 3 1 showing the negative effect of high ha concentration in the water on viral uvc disinfection efficiency they should be further analysed coupled with reactor hydraulics and uvc fluence distribution in the reactor chamber through reactor modelling 3 5 field tests results results from the field are summarized in table 3 chemical actinometry determined a lamp intensity of 5 2 mw cm2 in mexico the water quality of the spring source was better than the one of the waterhole where turbidity was above 100 ntu with settling and filtration pre treatment turbidity was reduced to 12 1 ntu and 5 00 ntu respectively organic matter om decreased 20 3 and uvt254 increased from 59 3 to 69 0 initial ms2 concentration was of 1 3 106 pfu ml spring water presented turbidity and om levels below 1 ntu and 1 mg l respectively with filtration turbidity was reduced to 87 0 and om decreased 6 5 uvt254 slightly increased from 83 4 to 84 3 due to the retention of small amounts of dissolved organic and suspended matter in the filters initial ms2 concentration was of 3 2 106 pfu ml with regard to surface waters from colombia the water quality of the two water sources resulted similar initial turbidity for the source la miel ranged between 3 72 and 2 10 ntu while the one for santa rita ranged between 8 13 and 2 19 ntu after filtration turbidity decreased by 20 to 33 for both sources and uvt254 increased by 2 07 for la miel and between 1 35 5 43 for santa rita initial ms2 concentration was in the order of 106 pfu ml for both sources field results are in agreement with laboratory results figure s 7 showing that the considered uvc disinfection system is able to meet the who reduction requirements not only in the laboratory but also in field even in the worst water quality condition m borehole water uvt254 of 69 and turbidity of 5 ntu the system was able to achieve a protective level of 3 5 viral lrv one of the main problems with uvc disinfection in rural developing regions is the need to monitor the system s operation to guarantee disinfection efficiency without the frequent microbiological testing lab and field inactivation experiments were utilized to test a simple model for flowrate estimation given a target viral lrv supporting material section s 1 4 the simple model underestimated the lrvs by 64 to 88 as it does not account for the hydrodynamic behaviour or radiation distribution in the uvc flow system there is need for more research and a deeper understanding of the phenomena occurring in the reactor chamber as reactor hydraulics distribution of the uvc dose and the role on light scattering phenomena which might be key in mass photonic transfer inside the reactor these factors are of fundamental importance for the precise modelling of the reactor behaviour to accurately predict the lrv achieved by the system treating a flowrate with known water quality parameters bolton and cotton 2008 hijnen et al 2005 4 conclusions this study presented the assessment of uvc disinfection performance as a function of water quality parameters namely uvt254 and turbidity we first established the critical role of dom and the non significant effect of turbidity on uvc disinfection efficiency within the experimental range studied from 77 to 100 of uvt254 and from 0 to 5 35 ntu of turbidity this permitted the definition of a linear model to estimate the ms2 inactivation rate constant only as a function of uvt254 and therefore the uv dose required to achieve a set reduction of ms2 the collimated beam inactivation results along with the corrected applied uvc dose were utilized to determine the uv dose response curve for ms2 which was best described by two linear fittings for low uvc doses 10 90 mj cm2 with an inactivation rate constant of 0 050 cm2 mj and for high uvc doses 90 mj cm2 with 0 026 cm2 mj it was noticed that the correction applied to the uvc dose enabled to obtain an overall uniform linear distribution highlighting some discrepancies in fact the conditions characterized by only turbidity resulted having greater residuals 0 28 0 88 compared to the other conditions these could be attributed to the lack of a light scattering correction factor to account for the phenomena associated to the presence of inorganic particulate matter that may have an important effect on the accuracy of the estimation of the applied uv dose the flow inactivation experiments in the laboratory and in the field confirmed the good performance of the studied uvc disinfection system which was able to meet the reduction requirements established by who the lab tests confirmed lrv of 5 8 4 5 and 3 9 for flowrates of 1 5 3 0 and 5 2 l min respectively for clean water uvt254 100 turbidity 0 ntu and 3 lrv for 1 5 l min for dirty water characterized by uvt254 of 77 and turbidity of 5 35 ντu whereas in field testing with spring water and water hole water it achieved a 5 0 and 3 5 lrv for uvt254 of 93 9 and 66 9 respectively this investigation opens a potential application to monitor the performance of uvc systems with surface water by monitoring uvt254 as a tool to control uvc domestic systems to deliver safe drinking water in a household without the need for frequent microbiological analysis which may not be easily available there is a need for more work on uvc reactor modelling to consider fluid dynamics and radiation distribution within commercial uvc systems to correlate to the curtis 2016 dose

16716,uvc disinfection has been recognised by the who as an effective disinfection treatment to provide decentralized potable water under real conditions there are still unknowns that limit this application including the influence of suspended solids and natural organic matter this work aims to investigate the influence of two key parameters suspended solids and natural organic matter on the efficiency of uvc disinfection of surface water to achieve the drinking water quality requirements established by the who for point of use pou technologies kaolinite turbidity agent and humic acids ha model of organic matter were used in a factorial design of experiments turbidity from 0 to 5 ntu and ha from 0 to 3 5 mg l to investigate their effect on uvc inactivation of ms2 phage in surface water a collimated beam 12 w and a commercial uvc disinfection flow system 16 w designed to provide drinking water at households were used the uvc flow system both in the laboratory and in the field was able to achieve the reduction requirements established by who lrv 3 5 for all tested conditions confirming the good performance of the studied uvc disinfection system the results found in the lab were used to establish a numerical model that predicts the disinfection rate constant as a function of water turbidity and transmittance at 254 nm confidence level 95 the model permitted to elucidate the critical effect of low concentrations of ha in reducing the inactivation rate by 40 for 3 5 mg l ha compared with 0 the non significant detrimental effect of turbidity lower than 5 ntu and the lack of synergistic effects between both parameters at these levels the uvc flow system was also tested in the field in tzabalho chiapas mexico and antioquia colombia with spiked ms2 into natural surface water this investigation opens a potential application to monitor the performance of uvc systems with surface water by monitoring transmittance at 254 nm as a tool to control uvc domestic systems to deliver safe drinking water in a household without the need of expensive and laborious biological monitoring tools keywords disinfection experimental factorial design kaolinite humic acids ms2 bacteriophage 1 introduction in 2010 the united nations un explicitly recognized the human right to water and sanitation which became the sixth sustainable development goal sdg un 2018 many efforts have been devoted to achieving the sdg6 by 2030 guaranteeing universal access to basic sanitation including safe and clean drinking water although current data suggests that efforts are not enough at present one in three people do not have access to clean drinking water exposing them to waterborne diseases unicef who 2019 many water technologies have been developed to reach water safety availability accessibility and affordability for all however there is a general lack of treatment processes specifically designed to operate in low income countries where high technological solutions are not implementable due to large operation and maintenance costs dependence on underdeveloped supply chains for the system components and required technical end user preparation there is the need for technological improvement adequate resources capacities and targeted strategies to achieve the set sdg6 wwap 2015 especially in remote and rural developing regions for these reasons point of use pou technologies that consider the needs of the areas of intervention and the end users have been developed and applied as a more sustainable and accessible solution providing safe access to clean water to remote areas empowering local populations and decreasing the risk of waterborne diseases sobsey et al 2008 the world health organization who established a protocol for the efficacy assessment of household water treatment and storage hwts technologies focusing on the performance against few microbial indicators and recommended consistent utilization by the users who 2016 hwts technologies for disinfection commonly applied include chemical treatment using soluble chlorine based tablets filtration typically using ceramic and sand or bio sand filters sobsey et al 2008 solar treatment using sodis mcguigan et al 2012 and uvc treatment which is the most promising alternative due to its high efficacy against most waterborne pathogens its rapid action and minimal operation cost and consumables only electricity to run the lamps and a pump lui et al 2016 uvc disinfection in low income and remote regions has advantages as a pou system over other approaches because it does not require technical knowledge for operation does not affect taste and odour of the treated water does not produce cancerogenic disinfection by products dbps and no chemical compounds are required curtis et al 2016 however it may require physical pre treatment to improve the optical quality of the water i e to reduce its turbidity and organic content which may be addressed to some extent with the installation of a low cost filtration system a power source may not be available in remote and rural areas which can be resolved with photovoltaic solar panels the need to replace uv lamps every 12 months according to the uv lamp lifetime 8 000 to 10 000 hours maybe a limiting factor in low income communities even if they are not really costly eg 10 per 15w lamp lui et al 2016 most of the applications involved the installation of a single low pressure uvc lamp due to its high germicidal efficiency long lamp lifetime vast availability on the market and proven pou commercial designs bolton and cotton 2008 currently uv led technology is seen as the most promising alternative to uv mercury lamps for their energy efficiency compactness robustness versatility and probable improved inactivation effectiveness by applying multiple wavelengths and adjustable pulsed illumination vilhunen et al 2009 song et al 2016 however it is still a technological solution under development that cannot be considered a sustainable alternative to lp low pressure uvc systems in low income communities mainly due to its very high cost and low availability on the water devices market following the development of a standardized method for the determination of the uv dose in collimated beam systems bolton and linden 2003 numerous studies were conducted on the evaluation of uv disinfection effectiveness and the determination of the effective uv dose necessary for the inactivation of selected pathogens hijnen et al 2005 identified the relationship between waterborne pathogens inactivation and uv dose as follows from higher to lower sensitivity to uv radiation bacteria protozoa cysts and oocysts bacterial spores and viruses which are the most resistant pathogens to uv due to the presence of rna containing uracil instead of thymine which is the most sensitive base to uv moreover ms2 bacteriophage was confirmed to be an appropriate model organism for both biodosimetry experiments and uv disinfection validation due to its high uv resistance when compared to all other waterborne pathogens excluding adenoviruses leenheer and croue 2003 the optical properties of the water or more specifically its transparency in the uvc range is the key to achieve successful disinfection results as expected for a uv driven process thus turbidity and uv transmittance uvt are the most important water parameters in uv disinfection uvt is determined by the presence of inorganic and organic light absorbing compounds including iron salts nitrates and more importantly natural dissolved organic matter nom and dom quantified by dissolved organic carbon doc leenheer and croue 2003 humic matter was found to be a fundamental component of dom having as main constituents fulvic acids and humic acids ha which are responsible for uv and visible light absorption and add colour to natural waters rodriguez and nunez 2011 filella 2009 ha has been widely used as a model compound to simulate environmental doc in a number of studies abbt braun et al 2004 small amounts of ha below 3 5 mg l in water can produce a high attenuation of the uv radiation uvt 254 nm 80 approx due to their high absorption spectra in the short uv range water turbidity is defined as the scattered light measured in the visible range at a 90 angle to the direction of the light source the scattering particulate matter organic and inorganic in the water scatters and or absorbs uv radiation reducing the uv fluence rate delivered to the microorganisms epa 2006 micro particles 1 10 μm diameter were found to shield microorganisms from uv light through shading and encasement mechanisms loge et al 2001 according to the who it is recommended to reduce water turbidity below 1 ntu and should never exceed 5 ntu before applying an uv disinfection treatment who 2014 common compounds used as turbidity models for inorganic suspended solids ss are kaolinite and test dust who 2014 these accepted models for suspended matter can be added to the water to attain the desired light scattering and turbidity effects regardless their chemical nature organic or inorganic as they are non soluble the single effect of turbidity was studied for ms2 uv inactivation showing non significant effect over the dose for turbidity below 5 25 ntu templeton et al 2006 increasing levels of transmittance showed no decrease in ms2 inactivation for applied uv doses between 10 100 mj cm2 when the proper correction factor was applied batch et al 2004 very little research has been done on the systematic analysis of turbidity and or humic acids and their effect over uvc disinfection efficiency most of the contributions mention these aspects either making simple comparisons between few values of turbidity or scarcely indicating the recommended uvt required to achieve a desired level of disinfection moreover there is not a lot of information on the separate effects the possible synergistic effects and the possible interactions between the two critical parameters turbidity and uvt simulating real conditions commonly found in the field the understanding of these effects is key know how for an efficient application of uvc disinfection to natural surface water sources for the first time this contribution presents a systematic research of the role of two water quality parameters turbidity and dissolved organic matter and their interference in the efficiency of uv viral disinfection in surface water kaolinite load and ha concentration were selected as the two factors of a complete factorial design of experiments where the effect of turbidity and dissolved organic matter in uvc disinfection efficiency were evaluated alone and together ms2 bacteriophage was selected as viral surrogate due to its high resistance to uvc a collimated beam 12 w and a commercial uvc 16 w disinfection flow system specifically designed to provide drinking water at households were used for all experiments in the lab and in the field the results were analysed to determine parametric relationships between both parameters and develop a predictive model for the inactivation rate constant as a function of turbidity

quality requirements who 2014 that allowed for model validation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design of lab tests the experimental design doe was constructed to evaluate the effect of dom and turbidity on uvc disinfection efficiency the concentration of humic acid ha and turbidity were chosen as the doe factors the doe was based on a full factorial design characterized by two factors with three levels each identifying nine experimental conditions table 1 for each experimental condition ms2 inactivation experiments were conducted in triplicates randomly and independently to guarantee statistical significance of results inactivation experiments were conducted in the collimated beam system for all 9 conditions and in a uvc disinfection flow system operating at three flowrates 1 5 3 0 and 5 2 l min only for conditions 1 and 9 namely the best and the worst water quality conditions 2 2 synthetic water sample preparation to evaluate the effect of dom and turbidity ha

braun et al 2004 cantwell et al 2008 to quantify the effect of turbidity and uvt254 on uvc disinfection performance the log inactivation values of ms2 were measured as a function of applied uv dose

guidelines bolton and linden 2003 a lp mercury lamp with nominal power of 12 w and emission at 254 nm philips was used together with a 100 ml sample vessel with magnetic stirrer more details in supplementary materials and figure s1 a prior to uvc exposure the lp lamp was warmed up for 3 minutes water matrix samples 100 ml were spiked with 100 μl of ms2 bacteriophage pbs suspension getting an initial ms2 concentration of 106 pfu ml the water samples were placed at the centre of the collimated beam on the magnetic stirrer to ensure continuous mixing and they were exposed to uvc radiation water samples of 1 ml were acquired at specific times during the experiment uvc doses ranged between 60 400 mj cm2 60 90 150 180 210 240 260 300 350 and 400 mj cm2 corresponding to irradiation times

correlation samples with higher turbidity and uvt254 were tested with higher uvc dose values to obtain significant countable results water samples were limited to 1 ml to minimize modifications of conditions during experiment execution serial ten fold dilutions of the samples were performed and assessed in triplicates section 2 3 ms2 count was performed and expressed as logarithmic reduction

experiments the system was cleaned by pumping a 3 hydrogen peroxide solution and washing thoroughly the uvc lamp was warmed up for at least 3 minutes prior to experiments each 5 l water volume was spiked with ms2 and thoroughly mixed samples were taken at the inlet to determine initial ms2 concentration and in triplicates at the outlet of the reactor after a time interval equal to three times the hydraulic retention time of the reactor to ensure the outlet flowrate was stabilized to the selected value supplementary material table s 1 2 6 statistical analysis and numerical model the inactivation results obtained with the collimated beam were analysed in three phases to identify the correlations between turbidity and uvt254 a linear regression analysis was carried out between the uvc doses and the achieved lrvs to obtain the inactivation rate constant the linear regression analysis was conducted for all 27 experiments of the doe obtaining three values of inactivation rate constant for each experimental condition these inactivation rate constants were employed in a general linear model glm statistical analysis performed using the software minitab version 2019 to evaluate the effect of uvt254 and turbidity on inactivation rate constants the complete glm model was defined considering both single variables and their interaction terms up to the second order eq 2 the uvc inactivation rate constants were the response variables y while turbidity and uvt254 were the independent variables x1 and x2 2 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 1 2 β 4 x 2 2 β 5 x 1 x 2 ε where βj are the regression coefficients and ε the random error the adequacy of the glm was assessed by analysis of variance and analysis of residuals based on a normal probability plot and shapiro test the glm eq 2 was simplified eq 3 considering only single variable and interaction terms up to a first order 3 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 1 x 2 ε the adequacy of this glm was again assessed by analysis of variance and analysis of residuals a second linear regression analysis was carried out between the corrected applied uvc dose and measured ms2 lrvs to determine the ms2 inactivation curve 2 7 field

two of the natural surface waters a spring and a waterhole were collected in the community of tzabalho a native and isolated community in los altos de chiapas south mexico the other two water sources were collected from quebrada la miel and quebrada santa rita in medellin antioquia colombia for mexico the two natural water sources considered fig 1 are used daily by local families for drinking cooking and personal hygiene without any treatment water batches 15 l of each source were collected in clean lid closed containers and stored at ambient temperature in the dark for few hours 24 h for particle sedimentation and reduction of turbidity as ms2 is not naturally present in the environment water batches 15 l were spiked with a stock solution of ms2 initial concentration was of 106 pfu ml

obtaining an average value of ms2 inactivation rate constant for each experimental condition table 2 the inactivation rate constant values ranged between 0 012 0 020 cm2 mj these were plotted separately against uvt254 and turbidity fig 3 to have a clear visual representation of results the relation between lrvs and applied uvc doses followed a linear trend fig 2 as described by chick and watson inactivation model watson 1908 showing neither shouldering nor tailing effect as previous studies hinjen et al 2005 batch et al 2004 table 2 shows that both uvt254 and turbidity affected uvc inactivation rate constant to a different extent the results obtained in presence of ha tests 2 3 5 6 8 9 resulted in decreased inactivation rate constants for the same applied uvc dose in comparison to those without ha tests 1 4 7 fig 3 a turbidity showed a very small effect on the inactivation rate constants when comparing experiments with different turbidity levels and equal concentrations of

turbidity is in agreement with previous results by batch et al 2004 and hijnen et al 2006 which showed no decrease in inactivation rate constant for turbidity 0 3 ntu and 5 25 ntu respectively thus the ha concentration which contributes directly to uvt254 greatly affects the inactivation rate constant whereas turbidity does not have a significant effect table 2 fig 3 this can be attributed to radiation absorption by ha which negatively influences the efficiency of advanced oxidation treatment processes uv uv h2o2 photo fenton photocatalysis by an increase in light radiation absorbance reducing the water matrix uvt254 cantwell et al 2008 templeton et al 2006 cantwell et al 2008 showed a 50 decrease in lrv of bacteria for water samples containing 120 mg l of ha with respect to those containing no ha due to uv radiation absorbance of ha and ha coating of bacteria cells that reduced their sensitivity to uv radiation templeton et al 2006 found similar results when studying uv inactivation of bacteriophages in samples containing ha up to 150 mg l to confirm the insignificant effect of turbidity on the inactivation rate constant within the range studies in this work the optical properties of kaolinite suspensions were experimentally determined showing that kaolinite particles only scatter light without absorbing it li et al 2018 the absorption coefficient and the scattering coefficient were found equal to 0 cm2 mg and 5 86 cm2 mg respectively further investigations on the optical properties of kaolinite and their role on uv disinfection will be carried out as a result of these findings it can be concluded that the optical behaviour of kaolinite particles does not have a detrimental effect on viral uvc inactivation while the uvc light attenuation due to uv radiation absorption by ha strongly reduces the viral inactivation the results were also statistically analysed to determine potential interactions between both factors section 3 2 3 2 statistical analysis and modelling to investigate the interaction between the inactivation rate k turbidity symbolised as t in the following equations and uvt254 a statistical analysis was conducted for two models of decreasing complexity a complete glm with equation 4 glm1 and a simplified glm with equation 5 glm2 4 k 7 1 0 6 uv t 254 2 6 1 0 6 t 2 0 0017 uv t 254 0 0055 t 6 2 1 0 5 uv t 254 t 0 08 5 k 4 4 1 0 4 uv t 254 1 84 1 0 3 t 1 7 1 0 5 uv t 254 t 0 02 where k cm2 mj is the inactivation rate constant uvt254 is the measured transmittance at wavelength 254 nm and t is the measured turbidity level ntu the two models were statistically analysed resulting in a r2 of 93 8 and 86 7 for glm1 and glm2 respectively determining a goodness of fit of both models glm2 was selected for the study for its mathematical simplicity compared to glm1 while guaranteeing goodness of fit the analysis of variance confidence interval 95 for glm2 determined that the only significant term was the uvt254 term since the p value was 0 006 less than the significance level of 0 05 the other terms turbidity and the interaction term resulted having a p value greater than the significance level respectively of 0 566 and 0 648 the model was further simplified obtaining a simple linear model lm with k as a function of uvt254 equation 6 6 k 3 8 1 0 4 uv t 254 0 018 the statistical analysis resulted in a r2 value of 84 6 confirming the results of glm2 and showing that the applied simplification only results in a 2 decrease of r2 glm2 and lm adequacy was also assessed through the analysis of residuals showing that all assumptions at the base of the analysis residuals normally distributed random and independent distribution of residuals constant variance of residuals were met thus both glm2 and lm adequately describe the inactivation rate constant k from the statistical analysis it can be concluded that for the ranges considered in the present work uvc disinfection efficiency is affected significantly by uvt254 yet insignificantly by turbidity similarly batch et al 2004 conducted a t statistics which indicated no decrease in ms2 inactivation with increasing turbidity confirming the statistical analysis results the proposed model equation 6 was used to estimate the viral inactivation rate constant for each experimental condition based on the samples uvt254 measurements the model was validated by comparing the estimated viral inactivation rate constant values with the experimental ones determined through linear regression table s 2 the results show that the proposed model is able to predict the viral inactivation rate constant quite accurately almost every estimated inactivation rate constant value falls within the 95 ci of the experimentally determined inactivation rate constants with exception of experiment 2 and 9 which distance 0 0007 and 0 0002 from the upper bound and lower bound of their respective ci the goodness of the model can also be observed from the percent error which is 10 for all estimated inactivation rate constant values except 2 fig 4 3 3 ms2 dose response curve analysis the following analysis was carried out to compare literature and expands the understanding of the ms2 dose response a linear regression analysis was conducted on the inactivation experiment results considering the corrected applied uvc dose for the determination of the effective ms2 inactivation curve the inactivation curve fig 5 a was defined by equation 7 7 lrv 0 0261 0 0007 uvc dose 0 64 0 08 where the uvc dose is expressed in mj cm2 and lrv is dimensionless it can be seen that the correction suggested by bolton and linden 2003 was able to adequately correct the applied uvc dose obtaining a uniform linear distribution of the data points fig 5 a it should be noted that not all data points perfectly follow the linear regression curve fig 5 a this can be attributed to the applied correction bolton and linden 2003 which does not consider i sample depths greater than 1 cm for which an appropriate divergence factor should be calculated and ii effects of turbidity as light scattering that might increase the uvc fluence rate in the reactor increasing the delivered uvc dose it is noticeable that the inactivation rate constant k of the inactivation curve defined by equation 7 is slightly lower than the ones reported in literature table s 3 loge et al 2001 cantwell et al 2008 beck et al 2015 2016 this could be due to the higher corrected uvc dose values considered for the inactivation experiments which ranged from 12 267 mj cm2 compared to those used in past studies epa 2006 park et al 2011 the inactivation curve could be better represented by two linear models fig 5 b the first for low uvc doses ranging from 10 90 mj cm2 and the second for high uvc doses ranging from 90 250 mj cm2 the inactivation rate for the first curve is similar to the one reported in literature which was also determined for a low uvc dose range from 5 139 mj cm2 hijnen et al 2006 while the inactivation rate k for the second curve resulted equal to that of the inactivation curve defined by equation 7 table s 3 these results are in good agreement with the ones of beck et al 2015 showing that the dose response curve has curvature and is not completely linear for this reason a two linear regression model for the dose response curve would have great application i as a tool in estimating the viral inactivation of a lp uvc system in a rapid and precise way and ii in uvc flow reactor modelling for which it is a fundamental parameter requiring high accuracy 3 4 uvc inactivation in flow systems the aim of these tests is to show the efficacy of the uvc flow system to provide clean and safe water at a household the flow inactivation experiments were conducted for experimental condition 1 utilizing pure water experiment 1 of doe and experimental condition 9 with 3 5 mg l of ha and turbidity of 5 ntu experiment 9 of doe the results are summarised in table 3 and confronted with lrv requirements for hwt systems established by who which state that for viruses a minimum of 3 log reduction and a maximum of 5 log reduction are needed to achieve a protective or a highly protective level protection for viral waterborne pathogens who 2016 the lrvs for condition 1 were higher than those for condition 9 due to the lower turbidity and uvt254 of 1 for 1 over a 5 lrv was obtained with a flowrate of 1 50 l min and over a 3 lrv with flowrates of 3 00 and 5 20 l min for 9 over 3 lrv was achieved only with flowrate of 1 50 l min while it was not able to meet a 3 lrv with the greater flowrates therefore with water characterized by significant content of organic matter few mg l of ha or similar the operating flowrate should be set lower than 1 50 l min to meet the criteria for a highly protective hwt system these results are in agreement with the ones shown by brownell et al 2008 who assessed the performance of a similar uvc technology determining that the system was able to achieve 4 1 4 5 lrv of ms2 when operated at a flowrate of 5 l min characterized by very low absorbance 0 002 0 01 cm 1 at wavelength 254nm younis et al 2019 also showed the ability of a uvc technology equipped with a swirl at reactor inlet to achieve a 7 1 and 5 5 viral lrv for flowrates of 9 46 and 12 9 l min respectively both with water uvt254 of 95 although these results are in accordance with those obtained in the collimated beam inactivation experiments section 3 1 showing the negative effect of high ha concentration in the water on viral uvc disinfection efficiency they should be further analysed coupled with reactor hydraulics and uvc fluence distribution in the reactor chamber through reactor modelling 3 5 field tests results results from the field are summarized in table 3 chemical actinometry determined a lamp intensity of 5 2 mw cm2 in mexico the water quality of the spring source was better than the one of the waterhole where turbidity was above 100 ntu with settling and filtration pre treatment turbidity was reduced to 12 1 ntu and 5 00 ntu respectively organic matter om decreased 20 3 and uvt254 increased from 59 3 to 69 0 initial ms2 concentration was of 1 3 106 pfu ml spring water presented turbidity and om levels below 1 ntu and 1 mg l respectively with filtration turbidity was reduced to 87 0 and om decreased 6 5 uvt254 slightly increased from 83 4 to 84 3 due to the retention of small amounts of dissolved organic and suspended matter in the filters initial ms2 concentration was of 3 2 106 pfu ml with regard to surface waters from colombia the water quality of the two water sources resulted similar initial turbidity for the source la miel ranged between 3 72 and 2 10 ntu while the one for santa rita ranged between 8 13 and 2 19 ntu after filtration turbidity decreased by 20 to 33 for both sources and uvt254 increased by 2 07 for la miel and between 1 35 5 43 for santa rita initial ms2 concentration was in the order of 106 pfu ml for both sources field results are in agreement with laboratory results figure s 7 showing that the considered uvc disinfection system is able to meet the who reduction requirements not only in the laboratory but also in field even in the worst water quality condition m borehole water uvt254 of 69 and turbidity of 5 ntu the system was able to achieve a protective level of 3 5 viral lrv one of the main problems with uvc disinfection in rural developing regions is the need to monitor the system s operation to guarantee disinfection efficiency without the frequent microbiological testing lab and field inactivation experiments were utilized to test a simple model for flowrate estimation given a target viral lrv supporting material section s 1 4 the simple model underestimated the lrvs by 64 to 88 as it does not account for the hydrodynamic behaviour or radiation distribution in the uvc flow system there is need for more research and a deeper understanding of the phenomena occurring in the reactor chamber as reactor hydraulics distribution of the uvc dose and the role on light scattering phenomena which might be key in mass photonic transfer inside the reactor these factors are of fundamental importance for the precise modelling of the reactor behaviour to accurately predict the lrv achieved by the system treating a flowrate with known water quality parameters bolton and cotton 2008 hijnen et al 2005 4 conclusions this study presented the assessment of uvc disinfection performance as a function of water quality parameters namely uvt254 and turbidity we first established the critical role of dom and the non significant effect of turbidity on uvc disinfection efficiency within the experimental range studied from 77 to 100 of uvt254 and from 0 to 5 35 ntu of turbidity this permitted the definition of a linear model to estimate the ms2 inactivation rate constant only as a function of uvt254 and therefore the uv dose required to achieve a set reduction of ms2 the collimated beam inactivation results along with the corrected applied uvc dose were utilized to determine the uv dose response curve for ms2 which was best described by two linear fittings for low uvc doses 10 90 mj cm2 with an inactivation rate constant of 0 050 cm2 mj and for high uvc doses 90 mj cm2 with 0 026 cm2 mj it was noticed that the correction applied to the uvc dose enabled to obtain an overall uniform linear distribution highlighting some discrepancies in fact the conditions characterized by only turbidity resulted having greater residuals 0 28 0 88 compared to the other conditions these could be attributed to the lack of a light scattering correction factor to account for the phenomena associated to the presence of inorganic particulate matter that may have an important effect on the accuracy of the estimation of the applied uv dose the flow inactivation experiments in the laboratory and in the field confirmed the good performance of the studied uvc disinfection system which was able to meet the reduction requirements established by who the lab tests confirmed lrv of 5 8 4 5 and 3 9 for flowrates of 1 5 3 0 and 5 2 l min respectively for clean water uvt254 100 turbidity 0 ntu and 3 lrv for 1 5 l min for dirty water characterized by uvt254 of 77 and turbidity of 5 35 ντu whereas in field testing with spring water and water hole water it achieved a 5 0 and 3 5 lrv for uvt254 of 93 9 and 66 9 respectively this investigation opens a potential application to monitor the performance of uvc systems with surface water by monitoring uvt254 as a tool to control uvc domestic systems to deliver safe drinking water in a household without the need for frequent microbiological analysis which may not be easily available there is a need for more work on uvc reactor modelling to consider fluid dynamics and radiation distribution within commercial uvc systems to correlate to the curtis 2016 dose

16717,drinking water softening is often implemented to increase consumer convenience e g by reducing lime scaling and soap use softening reduces hardness but changes also the overall mineral composition of the water depending on the technology a broad spectrum of effects from softening has to be considered in relation to e g health and corrosion when selecting softening technology and design otherwise adverse effects may be overlooked in the attempt to increase consumer convenience we here provided a framework for evaluating softening technologies using water quality indicators for lime scaling soap use corrosion human health taste and removal of contaminants none of the evaluated softening technologies scored positive on all the included water quality indicators precipitation technologies lime soda ash softening and pellet softening reduce the predicted copper and lead release but negatively affect stainless steel corrosion expressed by the larson ratio pellet softening does not remove magnesium which may limit the achievable softening depth but maintains a protective effect against cardio vascular diseases strong acid cation exchange is not expected to affect the included corrosion indicators whereas the effects from membrane separation nanofiltration and reverse osmosis and weak acid cation exchange depend on the specific source water and process design all the evaluated technologies reduce hardness calcium carbonate precipitation potential ccpp and atopic eczema but have potential adverse effects on dental carries expressed by dmf s our framework provides a better understanding of softening and can prepare water utility planners and managers for better decisions that balance the positive and adverse effects from drinking water softening graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords corrosion health lime scaling membrane separation ion exchange pellet softening 1 introduction centralized drinking water softening can provide socioeconomic and environmental benefits in areas with hard drinking water beeftink et al 2021 godskesen et al 2012 van der bruggen et al 2009 historically softening has been implemented to reduce copper cu and lead pb released from pipe materials and thereby comply with drinking water quality guidelines mons et al 2007 nowadays softening is often motivated in improvement of consumer convenience by reducing adverse effects from hard water such as increased soap use and lime scaling in household installations and appliances hofman et al 2007 mons et al 2007 thus the resulting water quality and softening depth i e hardness removal is not defined by specific guidelines but by the motivation for improvement of the water characteristics by the effects in the distribution system and by the consumers drinking water softening technologies reduces the water hardness which in practice is defined as the sum of calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 ions de moel et al 2006 loewenthal and marais 1976 softening technologies not only reduce hardness but they also alter the overall mineral composition of the drinking water differently depending on the technology mons et al 2007 ruhland and jekel 2004 consequently the effects from softening are beyond hardness removal tang et al 2019b and may also include effects on e g corrosion health and taste if hardness removal is the only aspect considered when designing the softening process adverse effects may be overlooked compromising the overall benefits from softening it is very difficult to quantify how water treatment processes affect e g lime scaling or corrosion from the individual water quality parameters but it can be predicted by water quality indicators or indices indicators integrate a broad range of effects and are often applied in decision support analyses such as multi criteria decision analysis to account for technical e g performance environmental e g carbon footprint and energy use economic e g net present value and construction costs and sociocultural e g cultural acceptance aspects beeftink et al 2021 godskesen et al 2018 hajkowicz and collins 2007 hamouda and huck 2010 considering all the above aspects allows for a broad evaluation of e g environmental and economic sustainability of the treatment process godskesen et al 2018 marques et al 2015 but can also increase the complexity and data requirement hamouda et al 2014 unfortunately in the desire to overcome this complexity the evaluation of water quality is sometimes limited to a few indicators such as removal efficiency for a single water quality parameter or pollutant e g hamouda and huck 2010 santos et al 2016 thereby neglecting the effects on the overall water quality so far literature has either focused on the individual drinking water softening technologies e g höll and hagen 2002 shahmansouri and bellona 2015 van der bruggen et al 2001 or reviewed the removal of specific individual water quality parameters by various treatment processes e g kapoor and viraraghavan 1997 karunanithi et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 only few papers have addressed the selection of softening technology and they only include few technologies and water quality effects bergman 1995 ruhland and jekel 2004 sombekke et al 1997 tang et al 2019b thompson and azar 1999 to our knowledge a framework does not exist to evaluate softening technologies based on a broad spectrum of water quality indicators such a framework can provide decision support when choosing softening technology by achieving the full potential of softening while limiting adverse consequences on e g corrosion and human health ultimately optimizing the overall water quality after softening our study aimed to provide a framework for evaluation and comparison of softening technologies and their effects on soap use corrosion lime scaling taste and health using selected water quality indicators to fulfill the aim we 1 identified relevant indicators for water quality and their targets 2 identified softening technologies currently used in full scale and 3 evaluated how each softening technology affects our chosen water quality indicators 2 materials and methods 2 1 evaluation method to evaluate the softening technologies and their consequences experienced by the consumers we developed a framework with four steps fig 1 we distinguished between water quality parameters and water quality indicators consequences of softening such as corrosion or human health effects can be predicted using water quality indicators e g larson ratio and ccpp whereas water quality parameters refer to ionic species and other drinking water components required to calculate the indicators e g ca2 or mg2 concentrations in the first step of the framework we identified relevant indicators section 2 2 as well as their targets and the water quality parameters required to quantify them step 2 section 3 1 in the third step we identified softening technologies currently used in full scale softening and screened for how they change the water quality parameters of importance for each indicator section 3 2 and 3 3 in the final step of the framework technology evaluation we evaluated how each of the softening technologies affect the water quality indicators based on the changes to the water quality parameters section 3 4 for consistency we describe a parameter change that brings an indicator further away from the identified target as an adverse effect on the other hand a positive effect describes a parameter change that brings the indicator closer to the target table 1 based on the evaluation of the individual parameters the overall effect on the water quality indicator was assessed table 1 if a technology did not change the parameters the overall effect was categorized as no effect if a technology had only adverse changes to the parameters the overall effect was characterized as adverse and similarly for positive effects if the technology provided a mix of positive and adverse changes to the parameters the overall effect was characterized as indecisive if a technology only changed a water quality parameter less than 15 from its initial value we considered that there would be no relevant water quality effects 2 2 water quality indicators we selected a range of existing water quality indicators to evaluate a broad spectrum of consequences from softening table 2 softening is implemented for various reasons e g to reduce soap use lime scaling or corrosion of copper and lead from pipe materials to the drinking water mons et al 2007 and consequently we included indicators to quantify these effects table 2 we included the larson ratio commonly used to assess the corrosion potential of drinking water we included the health effects selected by rygaard et al 2009 dental caries cardiovascular diseases and atopic eczema who valuated the effects from water quality changes due to reverse osmosis finally we included water taste and the technologies ability to act as a barrier towards organic and inorganic contaminants in the evaluation table 2 we categorized the different water quality indicators based on their consequences e g corrosion health and taste in a drinking water system water quality parameters required to calculate the indicators and their target values were identified in the cited literature furthermore we identified if minimizing or maximizing the parameter concentrations brings the indicator closer to the target value 2 3 technology screening dtu findit that encompasses databases such as web of science scopus and more dtu library 2021 was used to identify technologies for centralized drinking water softening and their effects on water quality search words included general terms e g water softening and hardness removal specific technologies e g cation exchange and pellet softening groups of water quality parameters e g divalent ion removal and specific water quality parameters e g sulphate removal drinking water the search included the entire paper and no restrictions on year publication although recent publications 2010 and onwards were prioritized over older publications we limited the literature search to technologies currently commercially available for full scale centralized drinking water softening excluding emerging technologies and technologies for pre and post treatment technologies that remove hardness from the water excluding technologies claiming to physically reduce lime scaling in households using e g ultrasound electromagnetism and electrostatic forces studies that include water samples from actual drinking water systems excluding studies with synthetically prepared water solutions with a limited number of ions the latter point was necessary because membrane treatment of synthetic water compositions may vary greatly from natural waters where e g the interaction between ions and ionic strength affect the rejection of ions santafé moros et al 2005 some studies report water quality changes as concentrations before cbefore softening and after softening cafter softening when appropriate see section 3 3 we converted these concentration changes to a percent removal rejection eq 1 1 percent removal c before softening c after softening c before softening 100 3 results 3 1 identification of indicator targets and relevant water quality parameters to evaluate if water quality changes were positive or adverse we identified a qualitative target e g as high as possible for each of the indicators presented in table 2 i e step 2 in fig 1 table 3 the targets only apply for the specific indicator and may represent a less optimal target for other impacts unrelated to the softening technology for instance ph should be as high as possible to avoid copper corrosion but a high ph reduces the efficiency of chlorine disinfection lahav and birnhack 2007 which was not included in our evaluation in addition we identified water quality parameters required to calculate the indicators and if the concentrations of these parameters should be minimized or maximized in hard water to approach the indicator targets table 3 hardness and thereby the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 should be as low as possible to reduce soap use mons et al 2007 ccpp is mainly affected by the concentrations of ca2 and hco3 as well as ph and temperature apha awwa wef 2017 which are the parameters included in this study however ccpp is most accurately calculated when a range of further ionic species are included as discussed in tang et al 2021 ccpp should be as low as possible to reduce lime scaling however it should be slightly positive to avoid water that is caco3 dissolving which can lead to corrosion lahav and birnhack 2007 the larson ratio should be as low as possible to prevent steel corrosion larson and skold 1958 the larson ratio decreases with increasing hco3 concentration or decreasing concentrations of cl and so4 2 on the other hand increasing so4 2 concentration may also reduce pb release from pipe materials showing that some water quality parameters have contradictory effects on corrosion table 3 copper cu release from especially new pipe materials increases with decreasing ph and increasing alkalinity and should be as low as possible edwards et al 1996 lead pb release from pipes can be predicted from the water alkalinity temperature ph cl and so4 2 concentrations imran et al 2006 temperature alkalinity and cl should be minimized and ph and so4 2 should be maximized for the pb release to be as low as possible decayed missing and filled tooth surfaces dmf s caused by caries among danish school children was related to the ca2 and f concentration in drinking water arvin et al 2017 bruvo et al 2008 dmf s increases with decreasing concentrations of ca2 and f ca2 has been associated with atopic eczema among children mcnally et al 1998 and should be minimized mg2 likely has a protective effect towards cardiovascular diseases kozisek 2020 and should for that purpose be maximized taste we were unable to identify an indicator for predicting water taste platikanov et al 2013 identified ions with a positive effect ca2 mg2 so4 2 and hco3 and with a negative effect na k and cl on drinking water taste using trained panellists the total dissolved solids tds also affected drinking water taste with preferred values around 200 400 mg l platikanov et al 2013 which was not considered further since tds after softening depends on the source water tds that may either be below within or above the optimal range organic and inorganic contaminants are unwanted we considered the overall potential of the technologies to act as barriers towards pesticides and heavy metals 3 2 technologies for centralised drinking water softening technologies for full scale drinking water softening falls into three types depending on the mechanism for hardness removal fig 2 precipitation technologies hardness ions are removed as solid minerals due to precipitation ion exchange technologies hardness ions are exchanged with other ions counter ions into the water membrane separation technologies hardness ions are separated from the water using semi permeable membranes the technologies can be further subdivided within each mechanism precipitation can e g be divided into pellet softening and lime soda ash softening fig 2 different choices of precipitation chemical type of ion exchange resin and type of membrane form the softening technology the treatment process and design affects the reactions for hardness removal and accordingly the final water quality in terms of e g addition of ions due to chemical addition table 4 the chemical reactions reflect the main reaction for hardness removal and parameters directly related to hardness removal but the overall changes of the water quality also depend on the process design chemical equilibria limitations membrane type other ions precipitating with caco3 etc tang et al 2019a van der bruggen and vandecasteele 2003 van dijk and wilms 1991 consequently the chemical reactions in table 4 only predict the major changes to water quality actually observed in full scale softening 3 3 changes to water quality parameters to evaluate the changes to the selected indicators table 3 in the third step of our framework fig 1 we included changes to water quality observed in i e from chemical water analyses pilot scale and full scale drinking water softening in literature supporting information a literature reporting of changes to water quality varies depending on the softening technology fig 3 in the precipitation technologies and weak acid cation exchange limitations in chemical equilibria or the process design itself establishes a de facto achievable minimum concentration fig 3 for instance if ph is too high in pellet softening caco3 will precipitate in the water phase homogenous nucleation and not onto pellets resulting in a minimum achievable concentration van dijk and wilms 1991 in membrane separation the removal of ions is typically quantified by the rejection which is the percentage removal from the feed influent water stream table 3 the removal of ions by membrane separation depends on e g the membrane characteristics and feed water composition shahmansouri and bellona 2015 particularly nanofiltration membranes are highly selective and rejects divalent ions to a higher degree than monovalent ions nasr et al 2013 consequently the reported rejections for a single water quality parameter may vary from case to case in ion exchange ions released from the resin into the water i e counter ions are added to the water in molar concentrations equivalent to the ions adsorbed to the resin clifford 1999 höll and hagen 2002 ions are also added to the water in the precipitation technologies in concentrations equivalent to the chemical dosage de moel et al 2006 we report equivalent effects on water quality parameters as the molar change based on either the softening depth xsoftening depth or chemical dosage xchemical added 3 3 1 hardness removal some of the included softening technologies remove total hardness whereas others only remove carbonate hardness hu et al 2018 reported a ca2 removal efficiency of 90 in a new pellet reactor design circulating the water and concluded that it was more efficient than the full scale pellet softening in the netherlands reported by hofman et al 2006 that removed about 50 of the ca2 hu et al 2018 softened water with a relatively high temperature 18 21 c which increases caco3 precipitation van schagen et al 2008 and did not consider that removal in conventional dutch pellet reactors also was limited by targets set for minimum ca2 in the effluent hofman et al 2007 this example illustrates the importance of reporting water quality changes in transparent and comparable manners nanofiltration reverse osmosis and strong acid cation exchange remove nearly all hardness from drinking water in practice a water stream is typically by passed the softening process and is mixed with the softened water to reach the target hardness lime soda ash softening can be operated at higher ph 10 8 than pellet softening and can consequently remove mg2 as mg oh 2 in addition to ca2 benefield and morgan 1999 hammer and hammer 2008 for water types with high mg2 hardness it may not be possible to achieve the desired softening depth with the precipitation technologies operated at ph 10 8 in weak acid cation exchange the regeneration frequency and thereby water consumption increases with increasing softening depth which limit the feasible softening depth 3 3 2 effects on ph alkalinity and temperature the softening technologies may reduce increase or have no effect on ph and decrease or have no effect on alkalinity table 6 none of the technologies affect the water temperature ph increases during lime soda ash softening and pellet softening due to the addition of a chemical base although the removal of ca2 as caco3 partially decreases ph table 4 when ca2 is removed as caco3 co3 2 is removed from the water which reduces the alkalinity depending on the softening chemical hco3 and ca2 are removed in a 1 1 or 2 1 molar ratio table 4 thus use of ca oh 2 as the chemical base would maximize the removal of hco3 and use of na2co3 would avoid hco3 removal if necessary co2 g is not rejected by reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membranes resulting in ph reduction alkalinity is nearly completely removed during reverse osmosis and partially removed by nanofiltration table 6 in weak acid cation exchange ca2 and mg2 are exchanged with h that is removed from the water with hco3 as co2 the removal of co2 from the water increases ph and decreases the alkalinity höll and hagen 2002 on the other hand strong acid cation exchange has no influence on neither ph nor alkalinity clifford 1999 3 3 3 effects on other ions na k cl f and so4 2 the who has not recommended guideline concentrations for k or so4 2 due to a low risk towards human health at concentrations typically observed in drinking water who 2017 consequently removal of k and so4 2 from drinking water has only little attention in literature some ions can crystallize with caco3 during precipitation and can be removed from the water together with hardness whereas others typically not forming carbonate minerals remain in the water tang et al 2019a tang et al 2019a observed 4 removal of k during pellet softening with naoh we were unable to find data for the other precipitation technologies but expect comparable results due to the similar mechanisms during pellet softening with naoh and soda ash softening na is added to the water in concentrations equivalent to the chemical dosage table 7 the na guideline concentration can be exceeded if the na in the source water is high which can limit the chemical dosage and thereby softening depth or need for alternative technologies or process design lime softening is reported to partially remove f as calcium fluoride caf2 due to the high solubility of caf2 the theoretical minimum concentration of f after softening is 7 5 mg l ayoob et al 2008 which is above the maximum guideline of 1 5 mg l who 2017 and thereby not relevant for evaluation of the effects on dental caries expressed by dmf s na k cl and f are monovalent ions that are nearly completely removed by reverse osmosis and partially removed by nanofiltration table 7 the removal depends e g on the feed water composition e g nasr et al 2013 observed decreased f removal in nanofiltration with increasing ca2 feed concentrations indicating that f removal is reduced in hard water types so4 2 is divalent and can be nearly completely removed by both nanofiltration and reverse osmosis table 7 in strong acid cation exchange na is exchanged from the resin into the drinking water increasing the concentration in a 2 1 molar ratio with the divalent ions ca2 and mg2 berrios et al 2014 no anions are removed from or added to the water during the process table 7 if weak acid cation exchange is combined with strong base anion exchange anions are also removed with hardness the strong base anion exchange resin has higher affinity for divalent so4 2 compared to monovalent no3 and cl thus the removal of no3 and cl is reduced at high so4 2 concentrations höll and hagen 2002 kapoor and viraraghavan 1997 3 3 4 effects on organic and inorganic contaminants groundwater and surface water can contain various organic and inorganic contaminants which are harmful to human health and must be removed from the water rosborg and kozisek 2019 removing the contaminants with water hardness in a single process step can be desirable from an economic perspective van der bruggen et al 2001 both nanofiltration and reverse osmosis can reject organic contaminants but the removal efficiency is complex and depends both on the compound the water composition and the membrane characteristics bellona et al 2004 thus the membrane type should be carefully selected for removal of the target compound plakas and karabelas 2008 nanofiltration membranes are especially promising for removing organic contaminants together with water hardness and can be designed to remove organic compounds but only partially remove water hardness to avoid remineralization after the process van der bruggen and vandecasteele 2003 an investigation of removal of 12 pharmaceuticals and three oestrogens during pellet softening revealed only little removal of the pharmaceuticals 5 7 whereas the highly hydrophobic oestrogens were removed by 57 60 most likely due to sorption onto the pellets maeng et al 2016 this indicates that organic compounds may be removed during pellet softening due to sorption but otherwise remain in the water similarly lime softening has only limited removal of organic compounds compared to membrane softening bergman 1995 with sorption and potentially co precipitation being the main mechanisms for removal liao and randtke 1986 softening technologies that combine weak acid cation exchange and anion exchange can potentially remove organic compounds since anionic resins are known to remove organic contaminants hsu and singer 2009 however the effects on specific compounds are unknown nanofiltration and reverse osmosis may remove heavy metals such as arsenic choong et al 2007 from drinking water together with hardness the removal of a specific ions depends on e g the membrane type ph as well as operating conditions such as trans membrane pressure and crossflow velocity choong et al 2007 lime softening can be adapted to also remove arsenic from the water but requires the addition of chlorine for oxidation of arsenic and ph 10 5 choong et al 2007 in pellet softening carbonate forming ions e g nickel iron and strontium were partially removed whereas ions not forming carbonates arsenic and potassium were not removed tang et al 2019a ion exchange can remove other ions than hardness and has higher affinity for multivalent than monovalent ions barrios et al 2008 if the resin has high affinity for a specific ion it may decrease the efficiency of the regeneration process snoeyink et al 1987 3 4 effects on water quality indicators the influence of softening technologies on the selected water quality indicators was evaluated from the observed changes to the water quality parameters table 5 table 6 and table 7 in the fourth and final step of our framework fig 1 the evaluation of each indicator is available in the supporting information b the evaluation included only the overall effect on the indicators and not absolute and relative changes since this depends on the specific water type and process design for example the larson ratio calculated from the concentrations of cl so4 2 and hco3 should be as low as possible to avoid corrosion in steel pipes and installations table 3 increasing concentrations of cl and so4 2 increase the larson ratio thereby affecting the indicator adversely whereas increasing hco3 decrease the larson ratio and subsequently the corrosion potential lime softening and pellet softening do not affect so4 2 or cl table 7 but reduce hco3 table 6 and will consequently increase the larson ratio which is an overall adverse effect table 8 soda ash softening and strong acid cation exchange have no effect on hco3 so4 2 and cl table 7 and table 6 and thus no effect on the larson ratio finally nanofiltration reverse osmosis and weak acid cation exchange can remove both so4 2 cl and hco3 from the water consequently the overall effect on the larson ratio depends on the specific water type and process design and is therefore indecisive table 8 ccpp depends highly on ph tang et al 2021 and in practice nanofiltration and reverse osmosis reduces ph and thereby ccpp which often result in undesired negative ccpp values requiring post treatment e g metsämuuronen et al 2014 tang et al 2019b thus even though ccpp is reduced the negative values often require post treatment and it would be misleading to categorize them as an overall positive effect to avoid this we did not include ph in the evaluation of ccpp the precipitation technologies tend to affect indicators similarly independent of the technology table 9 lime and soda ash softening can potentially remove mg2 and thereby adversely affect the risk of cardio vascular diseases which is not affected by pellet softening the precipitation technologies all increase the larson ratio and hence have an adverse effect on steel corrosion but a positive effect on both cu and pb release that are decreased table 9 thus the distribution system materials should be considered when designing a softening process based on precipitation all softening technologies have positive effects on soap use hardness reduction the potential for lime scaling ccpp reduction and atopic eczema ca2 removal but potentially adverse effects on dental health dmf s table 9 which is mainly due to the removal of ca2 the membrane separation processes remove many different ions but the specific removal may vary and consequently it was not possible to predict the effects on steel corrosion larson ratio pb release cu release or taste the membrane technologies have adverse effects on cardiovascular diseases due to mg2 removal table 9 the ion exchange technologies are based on the same mechanism but affect the water quality indicators differently strong acid ion exchange only affects a few ionic species resulting in no effect on the three corrosion indicators table 9 the effects from weak acid cation exchange on the corrosion indicators were indecisive the softening technologies affect the remaining indicators differently illustrating that the effects on the overall water quality is technology specific furthermore none of the softening technologies have a positive effect on all of the included indicators indicating that the softening technology choice must balance adverse and positive effects 4 discussion nowadays softening is often implemented to increase consumer convenience by reducing lime scaling and soap use in households we found that all the technologies reduce lime scaling expressed by the ccpp and soap use expressed by hardness but also alters the overall mineral composition of water affecting corrosion health and taste predicted by indicators we included eight indicators as well as taste and contaminant removal but further indicators may be relevant to include depending on e g the water type distribution pipe materials and national standards for evaluating water quality an evaluation of a broad spectrum of water quality indicators provided information on both positive and adverse effects from softening which can support decisions when designing the softening process to our knowledge such framework has not previously been provided the evaluation of softening technologies using water quality indicators can be further improved by quantify indicators for each specific case we considered the overall positive or adverse effects from the softening technologies on the selected indicators in practice the indicators should be calculated based on the actual water type in question to compare the absolute effects from each technology if possible the indicators should be compared to targets that water quality managers may set for each case consideration of the entire treatment train we evaluated the softening technologies as isolated units however in practice the softening technologies are part of a treatment train consisting of also e g filtration aeration and ph adjustment that also affect the mineral composition of the drinking water tang et al 2019b moreover pre and post treatment may be necessary before and after softening to e g remove ionic species that can foul the softening unit or adjust ph after softening berrios et al 2014 tang et al 2019b the effects experienced in the distribution networks and by the consumers depend on the water quality leaving the drinking water treatment plant which should form the basis when predicting the effects in specific cases better understanding of relations between indicators and consequences indicators are not perfect representations of the consequences they predict for instance corrosion covers a range of complex chemical and physical processes that are difficult to predict loewenthal et al 2004 likewise the relationship between magnesium and cardio vascular diseases is not fully understood who 2017 resulting in only indicative suggested concentrations rosborg and kozisek 2019 we suggest that future research focus on the understanding between theoretical indicators and the phenomena they predict implementation of softening will especially benefit from improved understanding of the relationship between ccpp and lime scaling to maximize the positive effects from softening tang et al 2021 historically water treatment technologies have been evaluated based on technical and economic aspects but nowadays environmental and societal effects are increasingly considered as well hamouda et al 2009 evaluation of eight water quality parameters commonly measured in drinking water in addition to water hardness alkalinity ph temperature so4 2 cl f na and k allowed for a broad evaluation of effects on corrosion health and taste contributing to better understanding of softening in an overall systems perspective our framework can be expanded with economic environmental technical and societal indicators already used for decision support to further optimize the implementation of softening water utilities can use this systematic approach and overview to make informed decisions weight positive and adverse effects from softening and justify the choice of softening technology to consumers and other stakeholders 5 conclusions we evaluated the effects from centralized softening technologies on selected water quality indicators within soap use hardness and limescale ccpp corrosion larson ratio and predicted pb and cu release health dmf s ca2 and mg2 taste and the removal of contaminants using existing water quality indicators and conclude that softening technologies can be divided into three types depending on the hardness removal mechanism that determines the changes to the overall water quality and whether hardness can be fully or only partially removed from the water precipitation lime soda ash and pellet softening membrane separation nanofiltration and reverse osmosis and ion exchange strong acid and weak acid cation exchange technologies all the included technologies have a potential positive effect on hardness reduction ccpp and atopic eczema but potential adverse effects on dental carries expressed by dmf s due to reduction of the ca2 concentration the technologies are expected to have an overall adverse effect on the water taste except reverse osmosis and weak acid cation exchange where it depends on the specific water type and softening depth the precipitation technologies have a positive effect on predicted cu and pb release but an adverse effect on steel corrosion expressed by the larson ratio membrane separation and weak acid cation exchange can have either an adverse no or positive effect on the corrosion indicators whereas strong acid cation exchange is not expected to affect the included corrosion indicators both ion exchange and precipitation has the potential for removing some heavy metals but especially membranes can potentially remove organic and inorganic contaminants thereby providing softening and contaminant removal in a single process step none of the included softening technologies result in only positive effects on the included water quality indicators better understanding of potential adverse effects from softening allows for planning of preventive measures water utilities can use our framework to balance the positive and adverse effects from softening and thereby optimizing decision support and the implementation of softening

16717,drinking water softening is often implemented to increase consumer convenience e g by reducing lime scaling and soap use softening reduces hardness but changes also the overall mineral composition of the water depending on the technology a broad spectrum of effects from softening has to be considered in relation to e g health and corrosion when selecting softening technology and design otherwise adverse effects may be overlooked in the attempt to increase consumer convenience we here provided a framework for evaluating softening technologies using water quality indicators for lime scaling soap use corrosion human health taste and removal of contaminants none of the evaluated softening technologies scored positive on all the included water quality indicators precipitation technologies lime soda ash softening and pellet softening reduce the predicted copper and lead release but negatively affect stainless steel corrosion expressed by the larson ratio pellet softening does not remove magnesium which may limit the achievable softening depth but maintains a protective effect against cardio vascular diseases strong acid cation exchange is not expected to affect the included corrosion indicators whereas the effects from membrane separation nanofiltration and reverse osmosis and weak acid cation exchange depend on the specific source water and process design all the evaluated technologies reduce hardness calcium carbonate precipitation potential ccpp and atopic eczema but have potential adverse effects on dental carries expressed by dmf s our framework provides a better understanding of softening and can prepare water utility planners and managers for better decisions that balance the positive and adverse effects from drinking water softening graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords corrosion health lime scaling membrane separation ion exchange pellet softening 1 introduction centralized drinking water softening can provide socioeconomic and environmental benefits in areas with hard drinking water beeftink et al 2021 godskesen et al 2012 van der bruggen et al 2009 historically softening has been implemented to reduce copper cu and lead pb released from pipe materials and thereby comply with drinking water quality guidelines mons et al 2007 nowadays softening is often motivated in improvement of consumer convenience by reducing adverse effects from hard water such as increased soap use and lime scaling in household installations and appliances hofman et al 2007 mons et al 2007 thus the resulting water quality and softening depth i e hardness removal is not defined by specific guidelines but by the motivation for improvement of the water characteristics by the effects in the distribution system and by the consumers drinking water softening technologies reduces the water hardness which in practice is defined as the sum of calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 ions de moel et al 2006 loewenthal and marais 1976 softening technologies not only reduce hardness but they also alter the overall mineral composition of the drinking water differently depending on the technology mons et al 2007 ruhland and jekel 2004 consequently the effects from softening are beyond hardness removal tang et al 2019b and may also include effects on e g corrosion health and taste if hardness removal is the only aspect considered when designing the softening process adverse effects may be overlooked compromising the overall benefits from softening it is very difficult to quantify how water treatment processes affect e g lime scaling or corrosion from the individual water quality parameters but it can be predicted by water quality indicators or indices indicators integrate a broad range of effects and are often applied in decision support analyses such as multi criteria decision analysis to account for technical e g performance environmental e g carbon footprint and energy use economic e g net present value and construction costs and sociocultural e g cultural acceptance aspects beeftink et al 2021 godskesen et al 2018 hajkowicz and collins 2007 hamouda and huck 2010 considering all the above aspects allows for a broad evaluation of e g environmental and economic sustainability of the treatment process godskesen et al 2018 marques et al 2015 but can also increase the complexity and data requirement hamouda et al 2014 unfortunately in the desire to overcome this complexity the evaluation of water quality is sometimes limited to a few indicators such as removal efficiency for a single water quality parameter or pollutant e g hamouda and huck 2010 santos et al 2016 thereby neglecting the effects on the overall water quality so far literature has either focused on the individual drinking water softening technologies e g höll and hagen 2002 shahmansouri and bellona 2015 van der bruggen et al 2001 or reviewed the removal of specific individual water quality parameters by various treatment processes e g kapoor and viraraghavan 1997 karunanithi et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 only few papers have addressed the selection of softening technology and they only include few technologies and water quality effects bergman 1995 ruhland and jekel 2004 sombekke et al 1997 tang et al 2019b thompson and azar 1999 to our knowledge a framework does not exist to evaluate softening technologies based on a broad spectrum of water quality indicators such a framework can provide decision support when choosing softening technology by achieving the full potential of softening while limiting adverse consequences on e g corrosion and human health ultimately optimizing the overall water quality after softening our study aimed to provide a framework for evaluation and comparison of softening technologies and their effects on soap use corrosion lime scaling taste and health using selected water quality indicators to fulfill the aim we 1 identified relevant indicators for water quality and their targets 2 identified softening technologies currently used in full scale and 3 evaluated how each softening technology affects our chosen water quality indicators 2 materials and methods 2 1 evaluation method to evaluate the softening technologies and their consequences experienced by the consumers we developed a framework with four steps fig 1 we distinguished between water quality parameters and water quality indicators consequences of softening such as corrosion or human health effects can be predicted using water quality indicators e g larson ratio and ccpp whereas water quality parameters refer to ionic species and other drinking water components required to calculate the indicators e g ca2 or mg2 concentrations in the first step of the framework we identified relevant indicators section 2 2 as well as their targets and the water quality parameters required to quantify them step 2 section 3 1 in the third step we identified softening technologies currently used in full scale softening and screened for how they change the water quality parameters of importance for each indicator section 3 2 and 3 3 in the final step of the framework technology evaluation we evaluated how each of the softening technologies affect the water quality indicators based on the changes to the water quality parameters section 3 4 for consistency we describe a parameter change that brings an indicator further away from the identified target as an adverse effect on the other hand a positive effect describes a parameter change that brings the indicator closer to the target table 1 based on the evaluation of the individual parameters the overall effect on the water quality indicator was assessed table 1 if a technology did not change the parameters the overall effect was categorized as no effect if a technology had only adverse changes to the parameters the overall effect was characterized as adverse and similarly for positive effects if the technology provided a mix of positive and adverse changes to the parameters the overall effect was characterized as indecisive if a technology only changed a water quality parameter less than 15 from its initial value we considered that there would be no relevant water quality effects 2 2 water quality indicators we selected a range of existing water quality indicators to evaluate a broad spectrum of consequences from softening table 2 softening is implemented for various reasons e g to reduce soap use lime scaling or corrosion of copper and lead from pipe materials to the drinking water mons et al 2007 and consequently we included indicators to quantify these effects table 2 we included the larson ratio commonly used to assess the corrosion potential of drinking water we included the health effects selected by rygaard et al 2009 dental caries cardiovascular diseases and atopic eczema who valuated the effects from water quality changes due to reverse osmosis finally we included water taste and the technologies ability to act as a barrier towards organic and inorganic contaminants in the evaluation table 2 we categorized the different water quality indicators based on their consequences e g corrosion health and taste in a drinking water system water quality parameters required to calculate the indicators and their target values were identified in the cited literature furthermore we identified if minimizing or maximizing the parameter concentrations brings the indicator closer to the target value 2 3 technology screening dtu findit that encompasses databases such as web of science scopus and more dtu library 2021 was used to identify technologies for centralized drinking water softening and their effects on water quality search words included general terms e g water softening and hardness removal specific technologies e g cation exchange and pellet softening groups of water quality parameters e g divalent ion removal and specific water quality parameters e g sulphate removal drinking water the search included the entire paper and no restrictions on year publication although recent publications 2010 and onwards were prioritized over older publications we limited the literature search to technologies currently commercially available for full scale centralized drinking water softening excluding emerging technologies and technologies for pre and post treatment technologies that remove hardness from the water excluding technologies claiming to physically reduce lime scaling in households using e g ultrasound electromagnetism and electrostatic forces studies that include water samples from actual drinking water systems excluding studies with synthetically prepared water solutions with a limited number of ions the latter point was necessary because membrane treatment of synthetic water compositions may vary greatly from natural waters where e g the interaction between ions and ionic strength affect the rejection of ions santafé moros et al 2005 some studies report water quality changes as concentrations before cbefore softening and after softening cafter softening when appropriate see section 3 3 we converted these concentration changes to a percent removal rejection eq 1 1 percent removal c before softening c after softening c before softening 100 3 results 3 1 identification of indicator targets and relevant water quality parameters to evaluate if water quality changes were positive or adverse we identified a qualitative target e g as high as possible for each of the indicators presented in table 2 i e step 2 in fig 1 table 3 the targets only apply for the specific indicator and may represent a less optimal target for other impacts unrelated to the softening technology for instance ph should be as high as possible to avoid copper corrosion but a high ph reduces the efficiency of chlorine disinfection lahav and birnhack 2007 which was not included in our evaluation in addition we identified water quality parameters required to calculate the indicators and if the concentrations of these parameters should be minimized or maximized in hard water to approach the indicator targets table 3 hardness and thereby the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 should be as low as possible to reduce soap use mons et al 2007 ccpp is mainly affected by the concentrations of ca2 and hco3 as well as ph and temperature apha awwa wef 2017 which are the parameters included in this study however ccpp is most accurately calculated when a range of further ionic species are included as discussed in tang et al 2021 ccpp should be as low as possible to reduce lime scaling however it should be slightly positive to avoid water that is caco3 dissolving which can lead to corrosion lahav and birnhack 2007 the larson ratio should be as low as possible to prevent steel corrosion larson and skold 1958 the larson ratio decreases with increasing hco3 concentration or decreasing concentrations of cl and so4 2 on the other hand increasing so4 2 concentration may also reduce pb release from pipe materials showing that some water quality parameters have contradictory effects on corrosion table 3 copper cu release from especially new pipe materials increases with decreasing ph and increasing alkalinity and should be as low as possible edwards et al 1996 lead pb release from pipes can be predicted from the water alkalinity temperature ph cl and so4 2 concentrations imran et al 2006 temperature alkalinity and cl should be minimized and ph and so4 2 should be maximized for the pb release to be as low as possible decayed missing and filled tooth surfaces dmf s caused by caries among danish school children was related to the ca2 and f concentration in drinking water arvin et al 2017 bruvo et al 2008 dmf s increases with decreasing concentrations of ca2 and f ca2 has been associated with atopic eczema among children mcnally et al 1998 and should be minimized mg2 likely has a protective effect towards cardiovascular diseases kozisek 2020 and should for that purpose be maximized taste we were unable to identify an indicator for predicting water taste platikanov et al 2013 identified ions with a positive effect ca2 mg2 so4 2 and hco3 and with a negative effect na k and cl on drinking water taste using trained panellists the total dissolved solids tds also affected drinking water taste with preferred values around 200 400 mg l platikanov et al 2013 which was not considered further since tds after softening depends on the source water tds that may either be below within or above the optimal range organic and inorganic contaminants are unwanted we considered the overall potential of the technologies to act as barriers towards pesticides and heavy metals 3 2 technologies for centralised drinking water softening technologies for full scale drinking water softening falls into three types depending on the mechanism for hardness removal fig 2 precipitation technologies hardness ions are removed as solid minerals due to precipitation ion exchange technologies hardness ions are exchanged with other ions counter ions into the water membrane separation technologies hardness ions are separated from the water using semi permeable membranes the technologies can be further subdivided within each mechanism precipitation can e g be divided into pellet softening and lime soda ash softening fig 2 different choices of precipitation chemical type of ion exchange resin and type of membrane form the softening technology the treatment process and design affects the reactions for hardness removal and accordingly the final water quality in terms of e g addition of ions due to chemical addition table 4 the chemical reactions reflect the main reaction for hardness removal and parameters directly related to hardness removal but the overall changes of the water quality also depend on the process design chemical equilibria limitations membrane type other ions precipitating with caco3 etc tang et al 2019a van der bruggen and vandecasteele 2003 van dijk and wilms 1991 consequently the chemical reactions in table 4 only predict the major changes to water quality actually observed in full scale softening 3 3 changes to water quality parameters to evaluate the changes to the selected indicators table 3 in the third step of our framework fig 1 we included changes to water quality observed in i e from chemical water analyses pilot scale and full scale drinking water softening in literature supporting information a literature reporting of changes to water quality varies depending on the softening technology fig 3 in the precipitation technologies and weak acid cation exchange limitations in chemical equilibria or the process design itself establishes a de facto achievable minimum concentration fig 3 for instance if ph is too high in pellet softening caco3 will precipitate in the water phase homogenous nucleation and not onto pellets resulting in a minimum achievable concentration van dijk and wilms 1991 in membrane separation the removal of ions is typically quantified by the rejection which is the percentage removal from the feed influent water stream table 3 the removal of ions by membrane separation depends on e g the membrane characteristics and feed water composition shahmansouri and bellona 2015 particularly nanofiltration membranes are highly selective and rejects divalent ions to a higher degree than monovalent ions nasr et al 2013 consequently the reported rejections for a single water quality parameter may vary from case to case in ion exchange ions released from the resin into the water i e counter ions are added to the water in molar concentrations equivalent to the ions adsorbed to the resin clifford 1999 höll and hagen 2002 ions are also added to the water in the precipitation technologies in concentrations equivalent to the chemical dosage de moel et al 2006 we report equivalent effects on water quality parameters as the molar change based on either the softening depth xsoftening depth or chemical dosage xchemical added 3 3 1 hardness removal some of the included softening technologies remove total hardness whereas others only remove carbonate hardness hu et al 2018 reported a ca2 removal efficiency of 90 in a new pellet reactor design circulating the water and concluded that it was more efficient than the full scale pellet softening in the netherlands reported by hofman et al 2006 that removed about 50 of the ca2 hu et al 2018 softened water with a relatively high temperature 18 21 c which increases caco3 precipitation van schagen et al 2008 and did not consider that removal in conventional dutch pellet reactors also was limited by targets set for minimum ca2 in the effluent hofman et al 2007 this example illustrates the importance of reporting water quality changes in transparent and comparable manners nanofiltration reverse osmosis and strong acid cation exchange remove nearly all hardness from drinking water in practice a water stream is typically by passed the softening process and is mixed with the softened water to reach the target hardness lime soda ash softening can be operated at higher ph 10 8 than pellet softening and can consequently remove mg2 as mg oh 2 in addition to ca2 benefield and morgan 1999 hammer and hammer 2008 for water types with high mg2 hardness it may not be possible to achieve the desired softening depth with the precipitation technologies operated at ph 10 8 in weak acid cation exchange the regeneration frequency and thereby water consumption increases with increasing softening depth which limit the feasible softening depth 3 3 2 effects on ph alkalinity and temperature the softening technologies may reduce increase or have no effect on ph and decrease or have no effect on alkalinity table 6 none of the technologies affect the water temperature ph increases during lime soda ash softening and pellet softening due to the addition of a chemical base although the removal of ca2 as caco3 partially decreases ph table 4 when ca2 is removed as caco3 co3 2 is removed from the water which reduces the alkalinity depending on the softening chemical hco3 and ca2 are removed in a 1 1 or 2 1 molar ratio table 4 thus use of ca oh 2 as the chemical base would maximize the removal of hco3 and use of na2co3 would avoid hco3 removal if necessary co2 g is not rejected by reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membranes resulting in ph reduction alkalinity is nearly completely removed during reverse osmosis and partially removed by nanofiltration table 6 in weak acid cation exchange ca2 and mg2 are exchanged with h that is removed from the water with hco3 as co2 the removal of co2 from the water increases ph and decreases the alkalinity höll and hagen 2002 on the other hand strong acid cation exchange has no influence on neither ph nor alkalinity clifford 1999 3 3 3 effects on other ions na k cl f and so4 2 the who has not recommended guideline concentrations for k or so4 2 due to a low risk towards human health at concentrations typically observed in drinking water who 2017 consequently removal of k and so4 2 from drinking water has only little attention in literature some ions can crystallize with caco3 during precipitation and can be removed from the water together with hardness whereas others typically not forming carbonate minerals remain in the water tang et al 2019a tang et al 2019a observed 4 removal of k during pellet softening with naoh we were unable to find data for the other precipitation technologies but expect comparable results due to the similar mechanisms during pellet softening with naoh and soda ash softening na is added to the water in concentrations equivalent to the chemical dosage table 7 the na guideline concentration can be exceeded if the na in the source water is high which can limit the chemical dosage and thereby softening depth or need for alternative technologies or process design lime softening is reported to partially remove f as calcium fluoride caf2 due to the high solubility of caf2 the theoretical minimum concentration of f after softening is 7 5 mg l ayoob et al 2008 which is above the maximum guideline of 1 5 mg l who 2017 and thereby not relevant for evaluation of the effects on dental caries expressed by dmf s na k cl and f are monovalent ions that are nearly completely removed by reverse osmosis and partially removed by nanofiltration table 7 the removal depends e g on the feed water composition e g nasr et al 2013 observed decreased f removal in nanofiltration with increasing ca2 feed concentrations indicating that f removal is reduced in hard water types so4 2 is divalent and can be nearly completely removed by both nanofiltration and reverse osmosis table 7 in strong acid cation exchange na is exchanged from the resin into the drinking water increasing the concentration in a 2 1 molar ratio with the divalent ions ca2 and mg2 berrios et al 2014 no anions are removed from or added to the water during the process table 7 if weak acid cation exchange is combined with strong base anion exchange anions are also removed with hardness the strong base anion exchange resin has higher affinity for divalent so4 2 compared to monovalent no3 and cl thus the removal of no3 and cl is reduced at high so4 2 concentrations höll and hagen 2002 kapoor and viraraghavan 1997 3 3 4 effects on organic and inorganic contaminants groundwater and surface water can contain various organic and inorganic contaminants which are harmful to human health and must be removed from the water rosborg and kozisek 2019 removing the contaminants with water hardness in a single process step can be desirable from an economic perspective van der bruggen et al 2001 both nanofiltration and reverse osmosis can reject organic contaminants but the removal efficiency is complex and depends both on the compound the water composition and the membrane characteristics bellona et al 2004 thus the membrane type should be carefully selected for removal of the target compound plakas and karabelas 2008 nanofiltration membranes are especially promising for removing organic contaminants together with water hardness and can be designed to remove organic compounds but only partially remove water hardness to avoid remineralization after the process van der bruggen and vandecasteele 2003 an investigation of removal of 12 pharmaceuticals and three oestrogens during pellet softening revealed only little removal of the pharmaceuticals 5 7 whereas the highly hydrophobic oestrogens were removed by 57 60 most likely due to sorption onto the pellets maeng et al 2016 this indicates that organic compounds may be removed during pellet softening due to sorption but otherwise remain in the water similarly lime softening has only limited removal of organic compounds compared to membrane softening bergman 1995 with sorption and potentially co precipitation being the main mechanisms for removal liao and randtke 1986 softening technologies that combine weak acid cation exchange and anion exchange can potentially remove organic compounds since anionic resins are known to remove organic contaminants hsu and singer 2009 however the effects on specific compounds are unknown nanofiltration and reverse osmosis may remove heavy metals such as arsenic choong et al 2007 from drinking water together with hardness the removal of a specific ions depends on e g the membrane type ph as well as operating conditions such as trans membrane pressure and crossflow velocity choong et al 2007 lime softening can be adapted to also remove arsenic from the water but requires the addition of chlorine for oxidation of arsenic and ph 10 5 choong et al 2007 in pellet softening carbonate forming ions e g nickel iron and strontium were partially removed whereas ions not forming carbonates arsenic and potassium were not removed tang et al 2019a ion exchange can remove other ions than hardness and has higher affinity for multivalent than monovalent ions barrios et al 2008 if the resin has high affinity for a specific ion it may decrease the efficiency of the regeneration process snoeyink et al 1987 3 4 effects on water quality indicators the influence of softening technologies on the selected water quality indicators was evaluated from the observed changes to the water quality parameters table 5 table 6 and table 7 in the fourth and final step of our framework fig 1 the evaluation of each indicator is available in the supporting information b the evaluation included only the overall effect on the indicators and not absolute and relative changes since this depends on the specific water type and process design for example the larson ratio calculated from the concentrations of cl so4 2 and hco3 should be as low as possible to avoid corrosion in steel pipes and installations table 3 increasing concentrations of cl and so4 2 increase the larson ratio thereby affecting the indicator adversely whereas increasing hco3 decrease the larson ratio and subsequently the corrosion potential lime softening and pellet softening do not affect so4 2 or cl table 7 but reduce hco3 table 6 and will consequently increase the larson ratio which is an overall adverse effect table 8 soda ash softening and strong acid cation exchange have no effect on hco3 so4 2 and cl table 7 and table 6 and thus no effect on the larson ratio finally nanofiltration reverse osmosis and weak acid cation exchange can remove both so4 2 cl and hco3 from the water consequently the overall effect on the larson ratio depends on the specific water type and process design and is therefore indecisive table 8 ccpp depends highly on ph tang et al 2021 and in practice nanofiltration and reverse osmosis reduces ph and thereby ccpp which often result in undesired negative ccpp values requiring post treatment e g metsämuuronen et al 2014 tang et al 2019b thus even though ccpp is reduced the negative values often require post treatment and it would be misleading to categorize them as an overall positive effect to avoid this we did not include ph in the evaluation of ccpp the precipitation technologies tend to affect indicators similarly independent of the technology table 9 lime and soda ash softening can potentially remove mg2 and thereby adversely affect the risk of cardio vascular diseases which is not affected by pellet softening the precipitation technologies all increase the larson ratio and hence have an adverse effect on steel corrosion but a positive effect on both cu and pb release that are decreased table 9 thus the distribution system materials should be considered when designing a softening process based on precipitation all softening technologies have positive effects on soap use hardness reduction the potential for lime scaling ccpp reduction and atopic eczema ca2 removal but potentially adverse effects on dental health dmf s table 9 which is mainly due to the removal of ca2 the membrane separation processes remove many different ions but the specific removal may vary and consequently it was not possible to predict the effects on steel corrosion larson ratio pb release cu release or taste the membrane technologies have adverse effects on cardiovascular diseases due to mg2 removal table 9 the ion exchange technologies are based on the same mechanism but affect the water quality indicators differently strong acid ion exchange only affects a few ionic species resulting in no effect on the three corrosion indicators table 9 the effects from weak acid cation exchange on the corrosion indicators were indecisive the softening technologies affect the remaining indicators differently illustrating that the effects on the overall water quality is technology specific furthermore none of the softening technologies have a positive effect on all of the included indicators indicating that the softening technology choice must balance adverse and positive effects 4 discussion nowadays softening is often implemented to increase consumer convenience by reducing lime scaling and soap use in households we found that all the technologies reduce lime scaling expressed by the ccpp and soap use expressed by hardness but also alters the overall mineral composition of water affecting corrosion health and taste predicted by indicators we included eight indicators as well as taste and contaminant removal but further indicators may be relevant to include depending on e g the water type distribution pipe materials and national standards for evaluating water quality an evaluation of a broad spectrum of water quality indicators provided information on both positive and adverse effects from softening which can support decisions when designing the softening process to our knowledge such framework has not previously been provided the evaluation of softening technologies using water quality indicators can be further improved by quantify indicators for each specific case we considered the overall positive or adverse effects from the softening technologies on the selected indicators in practice the indicators should be calculated based on the actual water type in question to compare the absolute effects from each technology if possible the indicators should be compared to targets that water quality managers may set for each case consideration of the entire treatment train we evaluated the softening technologies as isolated units however in practice the softening technologies are part of a treatment train consisting of also e g filtration aeration and ph adjustment that also affect the mineral composition of the drinking water tang et al 2019b moreover pre and post treatment may be necessary before and after softening to e g remove ionic species that can foul the softening unit or adjust ph after softening berrios et al 2014 tang et al 2019b the effects experienced in the distribution networks and by the consumers depend on the water quality leaving the drinking water treatment plant which should form the basis when predicting the effects in specific cases better understanding of relations between indicators and consequences indicators are not perfect representations of the consequences they predict for instance corrosion covers a range of complex chemical and physical processes that are difficult to predict loewenthal et al 2004 likewise the relationship between magnesium and cardio vascular diseases is not fully understood who 2017 resulting in only indicative suggested concentrations rosborg and kozisek 2019 we suggest that future research focus on the understanding between theoretical indicators and the phenomena they predict implementation of softening will especially benefit from improved understanding of the relationship between ccpp and lime scaling to maximize the positive effects from softening tang et al 2021 historically water treatment technologies have been evaluated based on technical and economic aspects but nowadays environmental and societal effects are increasingly considered as well hamouda et al 2009 evaluation of eight water quality parameters commonly measured in drinking water in addition to water hardness alkalinity ph temperature so4 2 cl f na and k allowed for a broad evaluation of effects on corrosion health and taste contributing to better understanding of softening in an overall systems perspective our framework can be expanded with economic environmental technical and societal indicators already used for decision support to further optimize the implementation of softening water utilities can use this systematic approach and overview to make informed decisions weight positive and adverse effects from softening and justify the choice of softening technology to consumers and other stakeholders 5 conclusions we evaluated the effects from centralized softening technologies on selected water quality indicators within soap use hardness and limescale ccpp corrosion larson ratio and predicted pb and cu release health dmf s ca2 and mg2 taste and the removal of contaminants using existing water quality indicators and conclude that softening technologies can be divided into three types depending on the hardness removal mechanism that determines the changes to the overall water quality and whether hardness can be fully or only partially removed from the water precipitation lime soda ash and pellet softening membrane separation nanofiltration and reverse osmosis and ion exchange strong acid and weak acid cation exchange technologies all the included technologies have a potential positive effect on hardness reduction ccpp and atopic eczema but potential adverse effects on dental carries expressed by dmf s due to reduction of the ca2 concentration the technologies are expected to have an overall adverse effect on the water taste except reverse osmosis and weak acid cation exchange where it depends on the specific water type and softening depth the precipitation technologies have a positive effect on predicted cu and pb release but an adverse effect on steel corrosion expressed by the larson ratio membrane separation and weak acid cation exchange can have either an adverse no or positive effect on the corrosion indicators whereas strong acid cation exchange is not expected to affect the included corrosion indicators both ion exchange and precipitation has the potential for removing some heavy metals but especially membranes can potentially remove organic and inorganic contaminants thereby providing softening and contaminant removal in a single process step none of the included softening technologies result in only positive effects on the included water quality indicators better understanding of potential adverse effects from softening allows for planning of preventive measures water utilities can use our framework to balance the positive and adverse effects from softening and thereby optimizing decision support and the implementation of softening

16718,the gas stripping process is widely used for the removal and recovery of ammonia from wastewater the ammonia removal in the stripping process depends on the ph temperature and air supply and in general 10 5 60 c 5 l min or more are recommended as near optimal however alkaline chemicals and energy can seriously burden the stripping process operation depending on the wastewater characteristics herein external electric field coupled ammonia stripping which improves ammonia removal from aqueous solutions was investigated the ammonia removal in the conventional stripping was between 17 7 and 90 6 depending on how close to the near optimal conditions the electric field increased the removal efficiency from 51 1 to 94 3 as the strength and frequency increased to 15 v cm and 50 mhz the electric field promotion of ammonia stripping correlated closely with the increase in ammonia molecular diffusion the electric field has been shown to improve the diffusion of ammonia molecules without dielectric heating by increasing the kinetic energy the electric field improved the ammonia removal more as the ph temperature and air supply conditions were far from optimal the electric field reduces the alkaline chemicals and the electric energy for heating and air supply and the energy consumption to form the electric field is only a few watts the electric field coupled process offers a new gas stripping platform that can economically improve ammonia removal from wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ammonia stripping low strength electric field diffusion ph temperature air supply 1 introduction wastewater is a mass source that can release nitrogenous compounds into the ecosystem large influx of nitrogen compounds into the ecosystem can distort the nitrogen cycle and put a considerable burden on maintaining homeostasis the removal of nitrogen compounds from wastewater has been of serious concern to environmental engineers among the nitrogen compounds ammonia nitrogen is produced by the anaerobic decomposition of nitrogenous organics in agricultural wastewater manure and wastewater sludge or discharge from the fine chemicals metal finishing and semiconductor industries ata et al 2017 folino et al 2020 jia et al 2017 quan et al 2009 the removal and recovery of ammonia from wastewater can significantly contribute to the conservation of the environment the recovered ammonia is commonly reused as fertilizer for crops or as an energy source folino et al 2020 xue et al 2019 ammonia is a soluble gas with a low henry constant in aqueous solution there are two forms of ammonia free ammonia and ammonium ions quan et al 2009 free ammonia is highly volatile and can easily migrate from liquid to gas therefore the stripping process has been used for a long time to remove and recover ammonia from wastewater kinidi et al 2018 quan et al 2009 the ammonia removal from wastewater in the stripping process depends on the mass transfer at the gas liquid interface the overall mass transfer is controlled by diffusion through a gas film and is theoretically independent of the ammonia concentration quan et al 2009 the henry constant is the fraction of ammonia molecules that are partitioned into liquid and gas phases at equilibrium an ammonia fraction in the liquid phase higher than equilibrium drives the mass transfer from the liquid to the gas through the gas liquid interface it is well known that ammonia removal in the stripping process depends on the ph temperature and air supply folino et al 2020 jia et al 2017 kinidi et al 2018 yoon et al 2008 the free ammonia fraction increases with ph which increases the thermodynamic driving force for ammonia stripping jia et al 2017 kinidi et al 2018 yoon et al 2008 as the temperature increases the activation energy for diffusion decreases by increasing the molecular kinetic energy oelkers 1991 thus the ammonia solubility decreases with temperature increasing the driving force for stripping from the aqueous solution the bubble type air supplied to the stripping process increases the turbulence of water and the air liquid interface area the liquid turbulence increases the diffusion coefficient at the air liquid interface thus the mass transfer for ammonia stripping depends on the liquid turbulence and the air liquid interface area ata et al 2017 folino et al 2020 yoon et al 2008 attempts have been made to improve ammonia stripping by increasing the ph temperature and air supply kinidi et al 2018 quan et al 2009 however wastewater with high acidity requires a lot of alkaline chemical to increase the ph junjie et al 2020 in addition the increase in water temperature or air supply increases energy consumption van der hoek et al 2018 therefore ammonia stripping with high performance was not economical based on the microscopic point of view the insights into molecular kinetic energy can provide a new way to improve ammonia stripping with less energy input the external electric field induces the dipole moment of polar molecules converting the molecular interactions to kinetic energy kholmetskii et al 2014 sowlati hashjin and matta 2013 in particular in an aqueous solution polar molecules such as water and ammonia align in the electric field direction or increase the rotational and translational motion increasing the kinetic energy evans and evans 1984 luca et al 2013 murad 2011 sowlati hashjin and matta 2013 sun et al 2016 an example is the microwave used to heat water or food horikoshi et al 2018 lin et al 2009 microwaves rotate polar molecules and the rotation generates heat by intermolecular friction with adjacent molecules which is called dielectric heating english and waldron 2015 lin et al 2009 the microwave generated heat significantly improves ammonia stripping ata et al 2017 kinidi et al 2018 lin et al 2009 however microwaves consume a large amount of energy to heat water so their application to ammonia stripping is limited the dielectric heating of water depends on the microwave strength and frequency english and waldron 2015 floros et al 2017 hirokosh et al 2018 sun et al 2016 in high frequency electric fields with relatively low strength the rotational and translational motion becomes active but the dielectric heating is insignificant english and waldron 2015 evans and evans 1984 this suggests that high frequency electric fields of low strength have great potential to improve the economy of ammonia stripping this study demonstrates that high frequency electric fields of low strength improve ammonia stripping without dielectric heating of the aqueous solution the ammonia stripping depending on ph temperature and air supply was experimentally investigated under electric fields of various frequencies and strengths the electric field promoted ammonia stripping at sub optimal ph temperature and air supply conditions was also predicted using deep learning the implications of electric field coupled ammonia stripping in the practical application are also discussed based on ammonia removal alkaline chemical requirements and energy consumption the findings are believed to contribute significantly to the economic stripping of ammonia from wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus a lab scale ammonia stripping apparatus consisting of a cylindrical stripping chamber effective volume 0 5 l and an absorption chamber effective volume 0 5 l was prepared fig 1 the stripping chamber was covered with an acrylic plate as an air diffuser a porous ceramic stone pore size 100 µm canhu aquarium co ltd china was placed on the chamber bottom the porous ceramic stone was connected to an air pump dk 8000 daekwang electronic inc korea with a plastic tube an air valve was installed in the tube to control the air supply a titanium foil 0 1t baoji hongtada nonferrous metal materials co ltd china was coated with a dielectric material glossy film g2140 printec co ltd korea and used as the electrodes the electrode pair was rolled into an annular type 26 cm 9 cm inner wall of the reaction tank 5 5 cm 7 cm outer wall of the acrylic tube and installed on the inner wall and the center respectively of the stripping chamber the electrodes were connected to the terminals of a dc or ac voltage source dp30 03tp toyotech co ltd korea tgf4242 aim tti instruments uk using conductive wires an air outlet was placed on the cover of the stripping chamber the absorption chamber had the same shape as the stripping chamber but no electrodes were installed the air outlet was connected to the porous stone in the absorption chamber with a plastic tube the absorption chamber was filled with 0 5 l of a 10 solution of sulfuric acid junsei chemical co ltd japan the water temperature was controlled using a water bath during the ammonia stripping 2 2 experimental methods the artificial ammonia wastewater ca 1 000 mg n l was synthesized by adding 3 819 g of nh4cl junsei chemical co ltd japan into 1 l of distilled water for the experiment wastewater of 0 5 l was added to the stripping chamber the wastewater was exposed to an electric field by applying a voltage to the electrode air was then supplied to the stripping chamber and ammonia in the exhaust gas was absorbed in the absorption chamber during the ammonia stripping changes in the ph temperature ammonia concentration and electric energy consumption were monitored over time the electric field coupled ammonia stripping was investigated at a field frequency of 0 50 mhz and an initial ph of 9 5 11 0 the initial ph was adjusted using a naoh solution of 50 junsei chemical co ltd japan ammonia stripping without electric fields was also tested under the same conditions and used as control the electric field coupled ammonia stripping depending on the temperature air supply and electric field strength was also examined at 22 59 c 0 5 4 l min and 5 15 v cm in the above experiments general conditions excluding the target parameter were selected from ph 10 5 22 1 c 1 l min 1 mhz and 10 v cm the electric field coupled ammonia stripping experiments under near optimal conditions were also performed at ph 10 5 60 c 4 l min 50 mhz and 15 v cm all ammonia stripping experiments were performed in duplicate the electric field coupled ammonia stripping at sub optimal ph temperature or air supply was studied based on the deep learning prediction a deep neural network dnn with 7 hidden layers and 16 nodes was constructed by repeating the data fitting to the model paying attention to overfitting or underfitting using the tensorflow keras package in the python platform the dnn model was learned using the experimental data 338 data sets obtained from the ammonia stripping under electric fields a total of 8 parameters including ph temperature electric field electric field strength frequency air supply time and initial ammonia concentration were used as the input data while the residual ammonia concentration was used as the output the input data was scaled with minmaxscaler of the preprocessing module in the sci kit learn package the input data was partitioned into the training data 75 and test data 25 a portion 30 of the training data was used as the validation data the elu was used as the activation function in the dnn model the nadam mse and mae were used as the optimizer loss function and metrics respectively the root mean square error rmse r2 and cosine similarity were used as the indicators for verifying test data the r2 and cosine similarity of the predicted result for the validation data of the trained dnn model were 0 92 and 0 99 respectively 2 3 analysis and calculation ammonia nitrogen was analyzed by the nessler method usepa 350 2 using uv t60 uv visible spectrophotometer pg instrument ltd uk the ph was measured using a ph meter orion 370 thermo fisher scientific inc usa the air supply was measured with a flow meter rma 26 ssv 1 5l min dwyer instrument inc usa the temperature change in water was measured by a temperature sensor ds18b20 connected to the arduino uno when the electric field was applied the electric power consumption depending on the strength and frequency of the electric field was measured using a smart plug bplug s01 a nine co ltd korea the change of free ammonia fraction with ph and temperature was obtained with eq 1 and the temperature dependence of ka was calculated with eq 2 emerson et al 1975 n h 3 100 1 10 ph k a 1 p k a 0 0901821 2729 92 t 2 where pka is log ka and t is the absolute temperature assuming that the ammonia partial pressure in the air phase is low the ammonia stripping can be expressed as the rate change in log ammonia nitrogen concentration over time as shown in eq 3 below quan et al 2009 ln c l a t c l a 0 k ga t 3 therefore the overall mass transfer coefficient kga was obtained by fitting the residual ammonia concentration over time predicted from the deep learning model to the above eq 3 the curve fit function of the optimization module of the scipy package in python was used for the fitting 3 results and discussion 3 1 electric field promotion of ammonia stripping the external electric field significantly improved the ammonia removal in the stripping process in the ammonia stripping process free ammonia molecules are removed from the liquid phase by mass transfer at the gas liquid interface the thermodynamic potential inducing the mass transfer at the interface is the oversaturation of free ammonia compared with the equilibrium and the fraction of free ammonia molecules depends on the ph the molecular diffusion of ammonia controls the rate of mass transfer at the interface the kinetic energy associated with the rotational vibrational and translational motions of molecules dominates the molecular diffusion in the aqueous solution evans and evans 1984 murad 2011 luca et al 2013 sowlati hashjin and matta 2013 heat increases the kinetic energy to promote molecular diffusion oelkers 1991 in control without an electric field the ammonia removal in the stripping process was very slow at ph of 10 5 temperature of 22 c and air supply of 1 l min at only 14 6 for 180 minutes fig 2 a during the stripping process the ph change was very small at only 0 17 fig 2b this indicates that during the stripping process the free ammonia fraction in control was theoretically maintained above 90 based on the estimation using eqs 1 and 2 the thermodynamic potential for the mass transfer of free ammonia molecules appears to have been too small in control due to the low temperature or air supply the ammonia stripping process is generally operated under conditions in which the ph temperature and air supply are combined at ph 10 5 60 c and 5 l min or more respectively jia et al 2017 lin et al 2009 yoon et al 2008 increasing the ph temperature and air supply at the same time can improve the ammonia removal in the stripping process however ammonia air stripping under the above conditions is not cost effective because it requires significant alkaline chemicals and energy consumption kidini et al 2018 lin et al 2009 it was observed that an electrostatic field of 10 v cm improves the ammonia removal to 26 6 which was higher than the control in the stripping process fig 2a the electrostatic field rotates polar molecules and the molecular rotation is coupled to the translational motion english and waldron 2015 evans and evans 1984 luca et al 2013 the coupled molecular motion under the electrostatic field enhances the diffusion which accelerates the ammonia stripping however the alternating electric field at a frequency of 0 2 mhz slightly improved the ammonia stripping over the electrostatic field as the field frequency increased to 50 mhz the ammonia removal in the stripping process further increased to 66 1 according to the frequency the electromagnetic field oscillates the polarity english and waldron 2015 lemeshko et al 2013 the polarity oscillations rotate polar molecules destroying or weakening the hydrogen bonds ata et al 2017 lin et al 2009 also the rotational motion can be coupled with the translational motion to promote the diffusion of polar molecules however ultra high frequency electric fields such as a microwave of 2 45 ghz induce dielectric heating ata et al 2017 díaz ortiz et al 2019 horikoshi et al 2018 kinidi et al 2018 the dielectric heating rapidly raises the water temperature dramatically improving the ammonia removal in the ammonia stripping process kinidi et al 2018 lin et al 2009 then the energy consumption for dielectric heating is proportional to the increase in water temperature fortunately until the electric field frequency increased to 50 mhz the water temperature increase was negligible fig 2b at low strength of around 10 v cm the high frequency electric field of 300 mhz or less do not appear to heat the aqueous solution dielectrically the electric energy required to establish the electric field in the aqueous solution was only 24 wh including the 22 wh of standby energy for the pulse generator this indicates that the high frequency electric field of low strength can be a breakthrough to overcome the limitations in ammonia stripping such as the excess consumption of energy and alkaline chemicals 3 2 ph on ammonia stripping under the electric field the electric field greatly improved the ammonia stripping at low ph but depended on the electric field frequency in an aqueous solution the ammonia stripping performance is influenced by the fraction of free ammonia depending on the ph the theoretical fractions of free ammonia estimated with eqs 1 and 2 at ph 9 5 10 5 and 11 are 59 8 93 6 and 97 9 respectively at 22 c ammonia can be easily removed from aqueous solutions above ph 10 5 in the stripping process folino et al 2020 kinidi et al 2018 however wastewater with high acidity requires too much alkaline chemical to increase the ph to 10 5 or higher junjie et al 2020 as the ph increased from ph 9 5 to 11 ammonia removal in the stripping process significantly increased from 39 2 to 60 7 at a frequency of 1 mhz fig 3 a this indicates that the ammonia stripping under electric fields was also highly dependent on the ph however while at ph 9 5 where the free ammonia fraction is low the ammonia removal was improved at a frequency of 1 mhz interestingly below 1 mhz no improvement in the ammonia removal in the stripping process was observed fig 3b this means that the thermodynamic potential to induce ammonia removal is dependent on the electric field frequency the electromagnetic wave energy is a function of the planck constant and frequency described in the planck relation this implies that the high frequency electric field above 1 mhz reduces the alkaline chemical requirement for ammonia stripping at ph 11 the electric field improved the ammonia removal in the stripping process regardless of the frequency fig 3c this suggests that when the molecular ammonia fraction is high the electric field improves ammonia removal during the stripping process until the mass transfer is limited by other factors such as air supply or water temperature 3 3 the effects of temperature air supply and field strength on ammonia stripping under electric fields the electric field significantly improved ammonia stripping at low temperature the boltzmann distribution shows that the kinetic energy of molecules increases with increasing temperature the kinetic energy promotes molecular diffusion by enhancing the rotational and translational motions so increasing the temperature can improve the ammonia removal in the stripping process however ammonia stripping at a high temperature requires considerable heating energy as the temperature increased from 22 to 59 c the electric field of 1 mhz and 10 v cm increased the ammonia removal from 52 5 to 88 9 fig 4 a the electric field improves the diffusion of polar molecules by increasing the kinetic energy like temperature the electric field may have a synergy with temperature to further enhance the diffusion of molecules for ammonia removal in the stripping process however it is worth noting that at the low temperature of 22 c the electric field significantly improved ammonia removal in the stripping process fig 2a this indicates that the electric field reduces the heating energy required for ammonia stripping especially from low temperature wastewater as the air supply increased the electric field further improved ammonia stripping the bubble type air supplied to the ammonia stripping process provides a wide gas liquid interface for the mass transfer and increases the turbulence in the aqueous solution ata et al 2017 yoon et al 2008 thus increasing the air supply can improve the ammonia removal in the stripping process quan et al 2009 in the conventional ammonia stripping process an economically feasible air supply was 5 l min for anaerobic digestion effluent lei et al 2007 however as the air supply increases the energy consumption for the air blower increases at a low air supply of 1 l min the electric field of 1 mhz and 10 v cm significantly improved the ammonia removal to 47 5 in the stripping process compared to 14 6 of the control fig 4b at low air supply the electric field appears to have enhanced the diffusion of ammonia molecules at the interface improving the mass transfer this indicates that the electric field can reduce the amount of air supply required for ammonia stripping increasing the air supply from 0 5 to 4 0 l min significantly improved the ammonia removal from 26 7 to 79 5 in the stripping process the air supply appears to be a limiting factor for mass transfer in the ammonia stripping process under an electric field as the strength increased the electric field further improved the ammonia removal from 46 4 to 56 8 fig 4c an electric field confines polar molecules and the field polarity oscillating with the frequency rotates polar molecules kholmetskii et al 2014 lin et al 2009 it is well known that the electromagnetic wave energy carried is proportional to its strength squared in dielectric materials such as aqueous solutions the strength of the electric field attenuates with distance hence the molecular motion in a solution can vary depending on the electric field strength murad 2011 under the low temperature of 22 c and an air supply of 1 l min at a frequency of 1 mhz an electric field of 10 v cm significantly improved the ammonia removal in the stripping process compared to the control fig 4c notably the ammonia removal at 15 v cm was higher than that at 5 or 10 v cm the increase of ammonia removal with field strength appears to reflect an increase in the field range that forces the polar molecular movement in the aqueous solution 3 4 electric field improved mass transfer an electric field that oscillates polarity with the frequency increases the polar molecular kinetic energy evans and evans 1984 kholmetskii et al 2014 lin et al 2009 the kinetic energy of molecules accelerates molecular diffusion evans and evans 1984 mcmanamey et al 1973 murad 2011 as the electric field frequency increased in ammonia stripping the overall mass transfer coefficient kga significantly increased fig 5 a this indicates that as the electric field frequency increases the diffusion of ammonia molecules increases however the overall mass transfer coefficient was gradually saturated from over 10 mhz of electric field frequency in the stripping process the ammonia removal was correlated with the overall mass transfer coefficient fig 5b this indicates that ammonia removal in the stripping process depends on molecular diffusion the overall mass transfer coefficients under the electrostatic field were less than 0 004 min 1 higher than the control as the electric field frequency increased the overall mass transfer coefficient significantly increased to 0 01 min 1 however above 0 003 min 1 the dependence of the ammonia removal on the mass transfer coefficient decreased slightly in the stripping process with high mass transfer rates ph temperature and air supply conditions appear to become slightly more important for ammonia removal 3 5 electric field coupled ammonia stripping under sub optimal conditions the experimental conditions including ph 9 5 the temperature of 22 c and the air supply of 1 l min are sub optimal for ammonia stripping the deep learning prediction shows the electric field promoted ammonia removals in the stripping process at suboptimal ph temperature and air supply fig 6 the ammonia removal in stripping without an electric field varied from 17 7 to 90 6 depending on ph temperature and air supply conditions in the ammonia stripping without an electric field the ammonia removal efficiency decreased up to 80 1 by a single sub optimal condition the effect of a single sub optimal condition on the ammonia removal was in the order of air temperature and ph condition fig 6a c the ammonia removal further decreased up to 26 3 by simultaneous two sub optimal conditions for the stripping fig 6d f the simultaneous sub optimal temperature and air supply affected the ammonia stripping more than the sub optimal ph and temperature or the sub optimal ph and air supply the electric field of 15 v cm and 50 mhz increased the ammonia removal to 92 6 at a single sub optimal condition and 87 7 at two sub optimal conditions at the near optimal conditions of ph 10 5 60 c and 5 l min for the stripping the ammonia removal was very high at more than 94 3 under the electric field of 10 mhz and 15 v cm 3 6 implications of electric field coupled ammonia stripping the low intensity alternating electric field economically improves the operating cost and ammonia removal of the ammonia stripping process in the ammonia stripping process the migration of ammonia molecules from the liquid phase to the gas phase depends on the fraction of free ammonia in water the area of the gas liquid interface and the diffusion of ammonia molecules quan et al 2009 the free ammonia fraction and the gas liquid interface area can be increased as ph and air bubble supply increase respectively jia et al 2017 kinidi et al 2018 yoon et al 2008 the diffusion of ammonia molecules is controlled by molecular kinetic energy increasing with temperature oelkers 1991 thus in general the recommended conditions of ph temperature and air supply are 10 5 60 c and 5 l min or more in ammonia stripping jia et al 2017 lin et al 2009 yoon et al 2008 however the alkaline chemicals required to raise the ph and the energy required for high temperatures and sufficient air supply increase the operating cost of the stripping process it is worth noting that the external electric field induces the dipole moment of polar molecules accelerating the rotation vibration and translational motion increasing the kinetic energy kholmetskii et al 2014 sowlati hashjin and matta 2013 evans and evans 1984 luca et al 2013 it implies that the kinetic energy of polar molecules including ammonia can be increased by external electric fields as well as temperature in previous studies on molecular dynamics an electric field induced motion depended on the type and composition of ionic or polar molecules in an aqueous solution zhu and han 2018 as shown in fig 2 4 the ammonia removal efficiency was not high enough in the stripping process without an electric field even under the near optimal conditions however the electric fields below 15 v cm and 50 mhz significantly improved the ammonia removal even under the sub optimal conditions with the field strength and frequency increased in ammonia stripping the overall mass transfer coefficient depends on the electric field frequency and the ammonia removal is closely related to the overall mass transfer coefficient fig 5 it implies that the electric field promotes the diffusion of ammonia molecules and thus improves the ammonia removal during the stripping process however very intense molecular motion increases the solution temperature by intermolecular friction induced dielectric heating and the increase in temperature increases the energy consumption english and waldron 2015 lin et al 2009 fortunately the temperature increase was not significant under the electric field below 15 v cm and 50 mhz fig 2 moreover the standby energy of the pulse generator establishing the electric fields was only 22 w while the electric energy dissipated through the electrodes is as small as 2 w at 15 v cm and 50 mhz the electrode for the electric field can dissipate more electrical energy depending on the size but the standby energy does not increase proportionally with the size of the system there are several advantages of electric field coupled ammonia stripping deduced from the ammonia removal under sub optimal conditions as shown in fig 6 the ammonia removal in control was 82 6 at a single sub optimal ph of 10 7 however under the electric field of 15 v cm and 50 mhz the ammonia removal of 82 6 can be obtained at a low ph of 9 5 this indicates that the electric field in the stripping improves the ammonia removal at low ph and thus reduces the alkaline chemicals required to raise the ph in addition the ammonia removal in the stripping under the electric field was 87 5 at a single sub optimal temperature of 22 c however the ammonia removal of 87 5 was observed at 36 8 c in control without the electric field this means that the electric field promotes the molecular diffusion of ammonia to improve the ammonia removal from wastewater at low temperatures the air supply is also an essential factor that significantly affects the energy consumption of the ammonia stripping process at the single sub optimal air supply of 0 5 l min the ammonia removal in the stripping was 87 7 under the electric field saved the air supply of about 3 23 l min than the control without the electric field in conventional ammonia stripping packing materials are often used to increase the turbulence of the aqueous solution kinidi et al 2018 quan et al 2009 however some cations including calcium and magnesium react with carbonate ions which often causes scaling problems the scale accumulated on the packing material can deteriorate the ammonia stripping performance kinidi et al 2018 in the ammonia stripping with electric fields there is also a concern that scale may be formed on the electrode surface however electric fields with high frequency are currently applied as an anti scaling technology zhao et al 2021 zhu and han 2018 cho and choi 1998 although it is necessary to confirm from real wastewater studies ammonia stripping assisted with electric fields is expected to be somewhat free from scale problems the electric field coupled ammonia stripping improves the ammonia removal from wastewater in particular in non optimal conditions for ammonia stripping the electric field reduces the use of alkaline chemicals to raise the ph thermal energy to heat wastewater and electrical energy to supply air however the small electric energy consumption required to establish the electric field does not burden the operation of the ammonia stripping process the electric field coupled ammonia stripping is a new platform that can economically improve ammonia removal from wastewater 4 conclusion the electric field is a new veiled parameter that can significantly improve ammonia stripping from an aqueous solution as the frequency and strength increase to 50 mhz and 15 v cm the electric field increases ammonia removal in the stripping process the electric field does not heat the aqueous solution dielectrically hence the energy consumption is negligible the electric field improves ammonia stripping by rotating and translating the molecules promoting diffusion the electric field saves the alkaline chemicals and energy required for ammonia stripping the electric field coupled ammonia stripping provides a new platform for economical ammonia stripping from wastewater declaration of competing interest none

16718,the gas stripping process is widely used for the removal and recovery of ammonia from wastewater the ammonia removal in the stripping process depends on the ph temperature and air supply and in general 10 5 60 c 5 l min or more are recommended as near optimal however alkaline chemicals and energy can seriously burden the stripping process operation depending on the wastewater characteristics herein external electric field coupled ammonia stripping which improves ammonia removal from aqueous solutions was investigated the ammonia removal in the conventional stripping was between 17 7 and 90 6 depending on how close to the near optimal conditions the electric field increased the removal efficiency from 51 1 to 94 3 as the strength and frequency increased to 15 v cm and 50 mhz the electric field promotion of ammonia stripping correlated closely with the increase in ammonia molecular diffusion the electric field has been shown to improve the diffusion of ammonia molecules without dielectric heating by increasing the kinetic energy the electric field improved the ammonia removal more as the ph temperature and air supply conditions were far from optimal the electric field reduces the alkaline chemicals and the electric energy for heating and air supply and the energy consumption to form the electric field is only a few watts the electric field coupled process offers a new gas stripping platform that can economically improve ammonia removal from wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ammonia stripping low strength electric field diffusion ph temperature air supply 1 introduction wastewater is a mass source that can release nitrogenous compounds into the ecosystem large influx of nitrogen compounds into the ecosystem can distort the nitrogen cycle and put a considerable burden on maintaining homeostasis the removal of nitrogen compounds from wastewater has been of serious concern to environmental engineers among the nitrogen compounds ammonia nitrogen is produced by the anaerobic decomposition of nitrogenous organics in agricultural wastewater manure and wastewater sludge or discharge from the fine chemicals metal finishing and semiconductor industries ata et al 2017 folino et al 2020 jia et al 2017 quan et al 2009 the removal and recovery of ammonia from wastewater can significantly contribute to the conservation of the environment the recovered ammonia is commonly reused as fertilizer for crops or as an energy source folino et al 2020 xue et al 2019 ammonia is a soluble gas with a low henry constant in aqueous solution there are two forms of ammonia free ammonia and ammonium ions quan et al 2009 free ammonia is highly volatile and can easily migrate from liquid to gas therefore the stripping process has been used for a long time to remove and recover ammonia from wastewater kinidi et al 2018 quan et al 2009 the ammonia removal from wastewater in the stripping process depends on the mass transfer at the gas liquid interface the overall mass transfer is controlled by diffusion through a gas film and is theoretically independent of the ammonia concentration quan et al 2009 the henry constant is the fraction of ammonia molecules that are partitioned into liquid and gas phases at equilibrium an ammonia fraction in the liquid phase higher than equilibrium drives the mass transfer from the liquid to the gas through the gas liquid interface it is well known that ammonia removal in the stripping process depends on the ph temperature and air supply folino et al 2020 jia et al 2017 kinidi et al 2018 yoon et al 2008 the free ammonia fraction increases with ph which increases the thermodynamic driving force for ammonia stripping jia et al 2017 kinidi et al 2018 yoon et al 2008 as the temperature increases the activation energy for diffusion decreases by increasing the molecular kinetic energy oelkers 1991 thus the ammonia solubility decreases with temperature increasing the driving force for stripping from the aqueous solution the bubble type air supplied to the stripping process increases the turbulence of water and the air liquid interface area the liquid turbulence increases the diffusion coefficient at the air liquid interface thus the mass transfer for ammonia stripping depends on the liquid turbulence and the air liquid interface area ata et al 2017 folino et al 2020 yoon et al 2008 attempts have been made to improve ammonia stripping by increasing the ph temperature and air supply kinidi et al 2018 quan et al 2009 however wastewater with high acidity requires a lot of alkaline chemical to increase the ph junjie et al 2020 in addition the increase in water temperature or air supply increases energy consumption van der hoek et al 2018 therefore ammonia stripping with high performance was not economical based on the microscopic point of view the insights into molecular kinetic energy can provide a new way to improve ammonia stripping with less energy input the external electric field induces the dipole moment of polar molecules converting the molecular interactions to kinetic energy kholmetskii et al 2014 sowlati hashjin and matta 2013 in particular in an aqueous solution polar molecules such as water and ammonia align in the electric field direction or increase the rotational and translational motion increasing the kinetic energy evans and evans 1984 luca et al 2013 murad 2011 sowlati hashjin and matta 2013 sun et al 2016 an example is the microwave used to heat water or food horikoshi et al 2018 lin et al 2009 microwaves rotate polar molecules and the rotation generates heat by intermolecular friction with adjacent molecules which is called dielectric heating english and waldron 2015 lin et al 2009 the microwave generated heat significantly improves ammonia stripping ata et al 2017 kinidi et al 2018 lin et al 2009 however microwaves consume a large amount of energy to heat water so their application to ammonia stripping is limited the dielectric heating of water depends on the microwave strength and frequency english and waldron 2015 floros et al 2017 hirokosh et al 2018 sun et al 2016 in high frequency electric fields with relatively low strength the rotational and translational motion becomes active but the dielectric heating is insignificant english and waldron 2015 evans and evans 1984 this suggests that high frequency electric fields of low strength have great potential to improve the economy of ammonia stripping this study demonstrates that high frequency electric fields of low strength improve ammonia stripping without dielectric heating of the aqueous solution the ammonia stripping depending on ph temperature and air supply was experimentally investigated under electric fields of various frequencies and strengths the electric field promoted ammonia stripping at sub optimal ph temperature and air supply conditions was also predicted using deep learning the implications of electric field coupled ammonia stripping in the practical application are also discussed based on ammonia removal alkaline chemical requirements and energy consumption the findings are believed to contribute significantly to the economic stripping of ammonia from wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus a lab scale ammonia stripping apparatus consisting of a cylindrical stripping chamber effective volume 0 5 l and an absorption chamber effective volume 0 5 l was prepared fig 1 the stripping chamber was covered with an acrylic plate as an air diffuser a

film g2140 printec co ltd korea and used as the electrodes the electrode pair was rolled into an annular type 26 cm 9 cm inner wall of the reaction tank 5 5 cm 7 cm outer wall of the acrylic tube and installed on the inner wall and the center respectively of the stripping chamber the electrodes were connected to the terminals of a dc or ac voltage source dp30 03tp toyotech co ltd korea tgf4242 aim tti instruments uk using conductive wires an air outlet was placed on the cover of the stripping chamber the absorption chamber had the same shape as the stripping chamber but no electrodes were installed the air outlet was connected to the porous stone in the absorption chamber with a plastic tube the absorption chamber was filled with 0 5 l of a 10 solution of sulfuric acid junsei chemical co ltd japan the water temperature was controlled using a water bath during the ammonia stripping 2 2 experimental methods the artificial ammonia wastewater ca 1 000 mg n l was synthesized by adding 3 819 g of nh4cl junsei chemical co ltd japan into 1 l of distilled water for the experiment wastewater of 0 5 l was added to the stripping chamber the wastewater was exposed to an electric field by applying a voltage to the electrode air was then supplied to the stripping chamber and ammonia in the exhaust gas was absorbed in the absorption chamber during the ammonia stripping changes in the ph temperature ammonia concentration and electric energy consumption were monitored over time the electric field coupled ammonia stripping was investigated at a field frequency of 0 50 mhz and an initial ph of 9 5 11 0 the initial ph was adjusted using a naoh solution of 50 junsei chemical co ltd japan ammonia stripping without electric fields was also tested under the same conditions and used as control the electric field coupled ammonia stripping depending on the temperature air supply and electric field strength was also examined at 22 59 c 0 5 4 l min and 5 15 v cm in the above experiments general conditions excluding the target parameter were selected from ph 10 5 22 1 c 1 l min 1 mhz and 10 v cm the electric field coupled ammonia stripping experiments under near optimal conditions were also performed at ph 10 5 60 c 4 l min 50 mhz and 15 v cm all ammonia stripping experiments were performed in duplicate the electric field coupled ammonia stripping at sub optimal ph temperature or air supply was studied based on the deep learning prediction a deep neural network dnn with 7 hidden layers and 16 nodes was constructed by repeating the data fitting to the model paying attention to overfitting or underfitting using the tensorflow keras package in the python platform the dnn model was learned using the experimental data 338 data sets obtained from the ammonia stripping under electric fields a total of 8 parameters including ph temperature electric field electric field strength frequency air supply time and initial ammonia concentration were used as the input data while the residual ammonia concentration was used as the output the input data was scaled with minmaxscaler of the preprocessing module in the sci kit learn package the input data was partitioned into the training data 75 and test data 25 a portion 30 of the training data was used as the validation data the elu was used as the activation function in the dnn model the nadam mse and mae were used as the optimizer loss function and metrics respectively the root mean square error rmse r2 and cosine similarity were used as the indicators for verifying test data the r2 and cosine similarity of the predicted result for the validation data of the trained dnn model were 0 92 and 0 99 respectively 2 3 analysis and calculation ammonia nitrogen was analyzed by the nessler method usepa 350 2 using uv t60 uv visible spectrophotometer pg instrument ltd uk the ph was measured using a ph meter orion 370 thermo fisher scientific inc usa the air supply was measured with a flow meter rma 26 ssv 1 5l min dwyer instrument inc usa the temperature change in water was measured by a temperature sensor ds18b20 connected to the arduino uno when the electric field was applied the electric power consumption depending on the strength and frequency of the electric field was measured using a smart plug bplug s01 a nine co ltd korea the change of free ammonia fraction with ph and temperature was obtained with eq 1 and the temperature dependence of ka was calculated with eq 2 emerson et al 1975 n h 3 100 1 10 ph k a 1 p k a 0 0901821 2729 92 t 2 where pka is log ka and t is the absolute temperature assuming that the ammonia partial pressure in the air phase is low the ammonia stripping can be expressed as the rate change in log ammonia nitrogen concentration over time as shown in eq 3 below quan et al 2009 ln c l a t c l a 0 k ga t 3 therefore the overall mass transfer coefficient kga was obtained by fitting the residual ammonia concentration over time predicted from the deep learning model to the above eq 3 the curve fit function of the optimization module of the scipy package in python was used for the fitting 3 results and discussion 3 1 electric field promotion of ammonia stripping the external electric field significantly improved the ammonia removal in the stripping process in the ammonia stripping process free ammonia molecules are removed from the liquid phase by mass transfer at the gas liquid interface the thermodynamic potential inducing the mass transfer at the interface is the oversaturation of free ammonia compared with the equilibrium and the fraction of free ammonia molecules depends on the ph the molecular diffusion of ammonia controls the rate of mass transfer at the interface the kinetic energy associated with the rotational vibrational and translational motions of molecules dominates the molecular diffusion in the aqueous solution evans and evans 1984 murad 2011 luca et al 2013 sowlati hashjin and matta 2013 heat increases the kinetic energy to promote molecular diffusion oelkers 1991 in control without an electric field the ammonia removal in the stripping process was very slow at ph of 10 5 temperature of 22 c and air supply of 1 l min at only 14 6 for 180 minutes fig 2 a during the stripping process the ph change was very small at only 0 17 fig 2b this indicates that during the stripping process the free ammonia fraction in control was theoretically maintained above 90 based on the estimation using eqs 1 and 2 the thermodynamic potential for the mass transfer of free ammonia molecules appears to have been too small in control due to the low temperature or air supply the ammonia stripping process is generally operated under conditions in which the ph temperature and air supply are combined at ph 10 5 60 c and 5 l min or more respectively jia et al 2017 lin et al 2009 yoon et al 2008 increasing the ph temperature and air supply at the same time can improve the ammonia removal in the stripping process however ammonia air stripping under the above conditions is not cost effective because it requires significant alkaline chemicals and energy consumption kidini et al 2018 lin et al 2009 it was observed that an electrostatic field of 10 v cm improves the ammonia removal to 26 6 which was higher than the control in the stripping process fig 2a the electrostatic field rotates polar molecules and the molecular rotation is coupled to the translational motion english and waldron 2015 evans and evans 1984 luca et al 2013 the coupled molecular motion under the electrostatic field enhances the diffusion which accelerates the ammonia stripping however the alternating electric field at a frequency of 0 2 mhz slightly improved the ammonia stripping over the electrostatic field as the field frequency increased to 50 mhz the ammonia removal in the stripping process further increased to 66 1 according to the frequency the electromagnetic field oscillates the polarity english and waldron 2015 lemeshko et al 2013 the polarity oscillations rotate polar molecules destroying or weakening the hydrogen bonds ata et al 2017 lin et al 2009 also the rotational motion can be coupled with the translational motion to promote the diffusion of polar molecules however ultra high frequency electric fields such as a microwave of 2 45 ghz induce dielectric heating ata et al 2017 díaz ortiz et al 2019 horikoshi et al 2018 kinidi et al 2018 the dielectric heating rapidly raises the water temperature dramatically improving the ammonia removal in the ammonia stripping process kinidi et al 2018 lin et al 2009 then the energy consumption for dielectric heating is proportional to the increase in water temperature fortunately until the electric field frequency increased to 50 mhz the water temperature increase was negligible fig 2b at low strength of around 10 v cm the high frequency electric field of 300 mhz or less do not appear to heat the aqueous solution dielectrically the electric energy required to establish the electric field in the aqueous solution was only 24 wh including the 22 wh of standby energy for the pulse generator this indicates that the high frequency electric field of low strength can be a breakthrough to overcome the limitations in ammonia stripping such as the excess consumption of energy and alkaline chemicals 3 2 ph on ammonia stripping under the electric field the electric field greatly improved the ammonia stripping at low ph but depended on the electric field frequency in an aqueous solution the ammonia stripping performance is influenced by the fraction of free ammonia depending on the ph the theoretical fractions of free ammonia estimated with eqs 1 and 2 at ph 9 5 10 5 and 11 are 59 8 93 6 and 97 9 respectively at 22 c ammonia can be easily removed from aqueous solutions above ph 10 5 in the stripping process folino et al 2020 kinidi et al 2018 however wastewater with high acidity requires too much alkaline chemical to increase the ph to 10 5 or higher junjie et al 2020 as the ph increased from ph 9 5 to 11 ammonia removal in the stripping process significantly increased from 39 2 to 60 7 at a frequency of 1 mhz fig 3 a this indicates that the ammonia stripping under electric fields was also highly dependent on the ph however while at ph 9 5 where the free ammonia fraction is low the ammonia removal was improved at a frequency of 1 mhz interestingly below 1 mhz no improvement in the ammonia removal in the stripping process was observed fig 3b this means that the thermodynamic potential to induce ammonia removal is dependent on the electric field frequency the electromagnetic wave energy is a function of the planck constant and frequency described in the planck relation this implies that the high frequency electric field above 1 mhz reduces the alkaline chemical requirement for ammonia stripping at ph 11 the electric field improved the ammonia removal in the stripping process regardless of the frequency fig 3c this suggests that when the molecular ammonia fraction is high the electric field improves ammonia removal during the stripping process until the mass transfer is limited by other factors such as air supply or water temperature 3 3 the effects of temperature air supply and field strength on ammonia stripping under electric fields the electric field significantly improved ammonia stripping at low temperature the boltzmann distribution shows that the kinetic energy of molecules increases with increasing temperature the kinetic energy promotes molecular diffusion by enhancing the rotational and translational motions so increasing the temperature can improve the ammonia removal in the stripping process however ammonia stripping at a high temperature requires considerable heating energy as the temperature increased from 22 to 59 c the electric field of 1 mhz and 10 v cm increased the ammonia removal from 52 5 to 88 9 fig 4 a the electric field improves the diffusion of polar molecules by increasing the kinetic energy like temperature the electric field may have a synergy with temperature to further enhance the diffusion of molecules for ammonia removal in the stripping process however it is worth noting that at the low temperature of 22 c the electric field significantly improved ammonia removal in the stripping process fig 2a this indicates that the electric field reduces the heating energy required for ammonia stripping especially from low temperature wastewater as the air supply increased the electric field further improved ammonia stripping the bubble type air supplied to the ammonia stripping process provides a wide gas liquid interface for the mass transfer and increases the turbulence in the aqueous solution ata et al 2017 yoon et al 2008 thus increasing the air supply can improve the ammonia removal in the stripping process quan et al 2009 in the conventional ammonia stripping process an economically feasible air supply was 5 l min for anaerobic digestion effluent lei et al 2007 however as the air supply increases the energy consumption for the air blower increases at a low air supply of 1 l min the electric field of 1 mhz and 10 v cm significantly improved the ammonia removal to 47 5 in the stripping process compared to 14 6 of the control fig 4b at low air supply the electric field appears to have enhanced the diffusion of ammonia molecules at the interface improving the mass transfer this indicates that the electric field can reduce the amount of air supply required for ammonia stripping increasing the air supply from 0 5 to 4 0 l min significantly improved the ammonia removal from 26 7 to 79 5 in the stripping process the air supply appears to be a limiting factor for mass transfer in the ammonia stripping process under an electric field as the strength increased the electric field further improved the ammonia removal from 46 4 to 56 8 fig 4c an electric field confines polar molecules and the field polarity oscillating with the frequency rotates polar molecules kholmetskii et al 2014 lin et al 2009 it is well known that the electromagnetic wave energy carried is proportional to its strength squared in dielectric materials such as aqueous solutions the strength of the electric field attenuates with distance hence the molecular motion in a solution can vary depending on the electric field strength murad 2011 under the low temperature of 22 c and an air supply of 1 l min at a frequency of 1 mhz an electric field of 10 v cm significantly improved the ammonia removal in the stripping process compared to the control fig 4c notably the ammonia removal at 15 v cm was higher than that at 5 or 10 v cm the increase of ammonia removal with field strength appears to reflect an increase in the field range that forces the polar molecular movement in the aqueous solution 3 4 electric field improved mass transfer an electric field that oscillates polarity with the frequency increases the polar molecular kinetic energy evans and evans 1984 kholmetskii et al 2014 lin et al 2009 the kinetic energy of molecules accelerates molecular diffusion evans and evans 1984 mcmanamey et al 1973 murad 2011 as the electric field frequency increased in ammonia stripping the overall mass transfer coefficient kga significantly increased fig 5 a this indicates that as the electric field frequency increases the diffusion of ammonia molecules increases however the overall mass transfer coefficient was gradually saturated from over 10 mhz of electric field frequency in the stripping process the ammonia removal was correlated with the overall mass transfer coefficient fig 5b this indicates that ammonia removal in the stripping process depends on molecular diffusion the overall mass transfer coefficients under the electrostatic field were less than 0 004 min 1 higher than the control as the electric field frequency increased the overall mass transfer coefficient significantly increased to 0 01 min 1 however above 0 003 min 1 the dependence of the ammonia removal on the mass transfer coefficient decreased slightly in the stripping process with high mass transfer rates ph temperature and air supply conditions appear to become slightly more important for ammonia removal 3 5 electric field coupled ammonia stripping under sub optimal conditions the experimental conditions including ph 9 5 the temperature of 22 c and the air supply of 1 l min are sub optimal for ammonia stripping the deep learning prediction shows the electric field promoted ammonia removals in the stripping process at suboptimal ph temperature and air supply fig 6 the ammonia removal in stripping without an electric field varied from 17 7 to 90 6 depending on ph temperature and air supply conditions in the ammonia stripping without an electric field the ammonia removal efficiency decreased up to 80 1 by a single sub optimal condition the effect of a single sub optimal condition on the ammonia removal was in the order of air temperature and ph condition fig 6a c the ammonia removal further decreased up to 26 3 by simultaneous two sub optimal conditions for the stripping fig 6d f the simultaneous sub optimal temperature and air supply affected the ammonia stripping more than the sub optimal ph and temperature or the sub optimal ph and air supply the electric field of 15 v cm and 50 mhz increased the ammonia removal to 92 6 at a single sub optimal condition and 87 7 at two sub optimal conditions at the near optimal conditions of ph 10 5 60 c and 5 l min for the stripping the ammonia removal was very high at more than 94 3 under the electric field of 10 mhz and 15 v cm 3 6 implications of electric field coupled ammonia stripping the low intensity alternating electric field economically improves the operating cost and ammonia removal of the ammonia stripping process in the ammonia stripping process the migration of ammonia molecules from the liquid phase to the gas phase depends on the fraction of free ammonia in water the area of the gas liquid interface and the diffusion of ammonia molecules quan et al 2009 the free ammonia fraction and the gas liquid interface area can be increased as ph and air bubble supply increase respectively jia et al 2017 kinidi et al 2018 yoon et al 2008 the diffusion of ammonia molecules is controlled by molecular kinetic energy increasing with temperature oelkers 1991 thus in general the recommended conditions of ph temperature and air supply are 10 5 60 c and 5 l min or more in ammonia stripping jia et al 2017 lin et al 2009 yoon et al 2008 however the alkaline chemicals required to raise the ph and the energy required for high temperatures and sufficient air supply increase the operating cost of the stripping process it is worth noting that the external electric field induces the dipole moment of polar molecules accelerating the rotation vibration and translational motion increasing the kinetic energy kholmetskii et al 2014 sowlati hashjin and matta 2013 evans and evans 1984 luca et al 2013 it implies that the kinetic energy of polar molecules including ammonia can be increased by external electric fields as well as temperature in previous studies on molecular dynamics an electric field induced motion depended on the type and composition of ionic or polar molecules in an aqueous solution zhu and han 2018 as shown in fig 2 4 the ammonia removal efficiency was not high enough in the stripping process without an electric field even under the near optimal conditions however the electric fields below 15 v cm and 50 mhz significantly improved the ammonia removal even under the sub optimal conditions with the field strength and frequency increased in ammonia stripping the overall mass transfer coefficient depends on the electric field frequency and the ammonia removal is closely related to the overall mass transfer coefficient fig 5 it implies that the electric field promotes the diffusion of ammonia molecules and thus improves the ammonia removal during the stripping process however very intense molecular motion increases the solution temperature by intermolecular friction induced dielectric heating and the increase in temperature increases the energy consumption english and waldron 2015 lin et al 2009 fortunately the temperature increase was not significant under the electric field below 15 v cm and 50 mhz fig 2 moreover the standby energy of the pulse generator establishing the electric fields was only 22 w while the electric energy dissipated through the electrodes is as small as 2 w at 15 v cm and 50 mhz the electrode for the electric field can dissipate more electrical energy depending on the size but the standby energy does not increase proportionally with the size of the system there are several advantages of electric field coupled ammonia stripping deduced from the ammonia removal under sub optimal conditions as shown in fig 6 the ammonia removal in control was 82 6 at a single sub optimal ph of 10 7 however under the electric field of 15 v cm and 50 mhz the ammonia removal of 82 6 can be obtained at a low ph of 9 5 this indicates that the electric field in the stripping improves the ammonia removal at low ph and thus reduces the alkaline chemicals required to raise the ph in addition the ammonia removal in the stripping under the electric field was 87 5 at a single sub optimal temperature of 22 c however the ammonia removal of 87 5 was observed at 36 8 c in control without the electric field this means that the electric field promotes the molecular diffusion of ammonia to improve the ammonia removal from wastewater at low temperatures the air supply is also an essential factor that significantly affects the energy consumption of the ammonia stripping process at the single sub optimal air supply of 0 5 l min the ammonia removal in the stripping was 87 7 under the electric field saved the air supply of about 3 23 l min than the control without the electric field in conventional ammonia stripping packing materials are often used to increase the turbulence of the aqueous solution kinidi et al 2018 quan et al 2009 however some cations including calcium and magnesium react with carbonate ions which often causes scaling problems the scale accumulated on the packing material can deteriorate the ammonia stripping performance kinidi et al 2018 in the ammonia stripping with electric fields there is also a concern that scale may be formed on the electrode surface however electric fields with high frequency are currently applied as an anti scaling technology zhao et al 2021 zhu and han 2018 cho and choi 1998 although it is necessary to confirm from real wastewater studies ammonia stripping assisted with electric fields is expected to be somewhat free from scale problems the electric field coupled ammonia stripping improves the ammonia removal from wastewater in particular in non optimal conditions for ammonia stripping the electric field reduces the use of alkaline chemicals to raise the ph thermal energy to heat wastewater and electrical energy to supply air however the small electric energy consumption required to establish the electric field does not burden the operation of the ammonia stripping process the electric field coupled ammonia stripping is a new platform that can economically improve ammonia removal from wastewater 4 conclusion the electric field is a new veiled parameter that can significantly improve ammonia stripping from an aqueous solution as the frequency and strength increase to 50 mhz and 15 v cm the electric field increases ammonia removal in the stripping process the electric field does not heat the aqueous solution dielectrically hence the energy consumption is negligible the electric field improves ammonia stripping by rotating and translating the molecules promoting diffusion the electric field saves the alkaline chemicals and

to enhance the nitrogen removal and reduce sludge production in wastewater treatment this strategy introduced an external unit where a certain portion of sludge from a mainstream bioreactor is periodically transferred into in the sidestream reactor free nitrous acid fna wang et al 2014 2016 duan et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 free ammonia fa wang et al 2017 sulfide seuntjens et al 2018 or ultrasound zheng et al 2019a was used to treat the sludge regularly designed conditions introduced into the sidestream reactors selectively suppressed nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob to achieve shortcut nitrogen removal process nh4 no2 n2 the shortcut nitrogen removal process represents the most attractive option for future wastewater treatment because this process has significantly less carbon and oxygen demand compared with conventional nitrification denitrification process antileo et al 2013 moreover the harsh conditions created in sidestream sludge treatment resulted in cell lysis and cryptic growth i e the utilization of intracellular microbial compounds released from a cell lysis step and thereby leading to a lower biomass yield wang et al 2013 wu et al 2018 in this work we aimed to expand the benefits of iron dosing by adopting the sidestream sludge treatment to bring multifaceted benefits to wastewater management including not only enhanced phosphorus removal sludge settling dewatering but also shortcut nitrogen removal and less biomass production in fact more than being a coagulant fecl3 is a strong lewis acid e g ph 1 5 at 38 wt with fe iii hydrolysis fe3 3h2o fe oh 3 3h the normal dosage of fecl3 e g 10 40 mg fe l used for mainstream iron dosing purpose is far from enough to acidify the wastewater due to the presence of alkalinity however fecl3 dosing in the sidestream unit could acidify sludge considering that the volume of thickened sludge is substantially less than the mainstream treatment volume for example given the same amount of total fecl3 dosed the iron concentration in the sidestream unit can reach over 1 g fe l sludge which is two orders of magnitude higher than the iron concentration induced by common mainstream iron dosing e g 10 40 mg fe l wastewater we hypothesized that the fecl3 acidified sludge treatment could suppress nob activity as nob are known acid sensitive except for a nitrobacter isolate that optimally grows at ph 5 5 hankinson and schmidt 1988 in contrast some ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob can tolerant acidic condition where ph can be as low as 2 fumasoli et al 2017 hayatsu et al 2017 picone et al 2020 wang et al 2021b wang et al 2021c this suggests that acidic tolerant aob community can be selected during long term reactor operation moreover fna hno2 no2 h pka 3 25 above one part per million ppm may be formed at the low ph in the presence of only a few milligrams of nitrite it has been shown that ppm level fna suppress nob more than aob wang et al 2014 zheng et al 2021 as such fna formed from accumulated nitrite in the fecl3 acidified sludge may also be beneficial to nob control to test the proposed novel fecl3 dosing approach a laboratory sequencing batch reactor sbr connected with an external unit where fecl3 is dosed into was set up and fed with real domestic wastewater throughout 400 days of operation stability of nob control was evaluated through regularly monitoring nitrification performance including nitrite accumulation ammonium removal and in situ aob and nob activities as well as microbial community succession after that another three sbrs were set up two were operated with dosing fecl3 in the sidestream and mainstream and another served as a control reactor without the addition of fecl3 the operation of three reactors enabled comprehensive evaluation of the effects of sidestream fecl3 dosing to the reactor performances including effluent quality microbial activities sludge properties and observed biomass yield 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental design this study composed of two long term experiments was designed to investigate the impacts of sidestream iron dosing on i nitrifying community days 0 400 and ii overall wastewater treatment performances days 401 475 fig 1 in the first experiment one aerobic sbr r1 was operated with baseline phase and experimental phase to evaluate the effects of sidestream iron dosing on selective suppression of nob over aob r1 was operated without iron dosing during baseline phase days 0 77 in the following experimental phase days 78 400 fecl3 was dosed into the sidestream unit of the sbr to acidify the sludge to ph of 2 1 iron was dosed daily between day 78 and day 301 and then every two and three days in days 302 337 and days 338 400 respectively in situ tests were conducted in days 226 to 301 to identify the role of fna in nob suppression a comprehensive ex situ batch test was also performed on day 282 to evaluate the role of acid nitrite and iron in nob suppression text s2 and table s1 to evaluate the overall impacts of sidestream fecl3 dosing on nitrogen removal and sludge reduction three anoxic aerobic sbrs r2 r3 r4 were set up from day 401 and operated for 75 days the feeding and operational regime of the three sbrs were designed to enable anoxic denitrification to mimic the conventional activated sludge process of full scale wwtps sidestream fecl3 dosing was performed in r2 every three days which is the same as that in operational days 338 400 of r1 to enable direct comparisons between sidestream iron dosing strategy with mainstream iron dosing strategy and conventional operation r3 was operated with mainstream fecl3 dosing at the same dosage as r2 and r4 severed as a control without iron dosing effluent quality microbial activities sludge properties and observed sludge yield were measured and compared from the three reactors 2 2 reactor operation r1 with a working volume of 1 2 l was set up and operated at room temperature 22 24 c the reactor had four operational cycles each day and each cycle 6 h consists of the following steps in order 5 min feeding 305 min aeration 40 min settling 5 min decanting and 5 min idling during the aeration step dissolved oxygen do concentration was controlled above 2 mg o2 l through a laboratory scale air blower and monitored by a do probe optical do sensor inpro 6960i mettler toledo and a transmitter multiparameter transmitter m800 mettler toledo mixing was provided by a magnetic stirrer at 250 rpm in the feeding and aeration steps at the end of the aeration period 80 ml of mixed liquor from the sbr was discharged in 5 min on a daily basis as such sludge retention time srt was controlled at 15 d after settling 800 ml supernatant was discharged resulting in a hydraulic retention time hrt of 9 h ph of the mixed liquor was not controlled but measured between 7 2 7 8 by using a ph probe minichem labtek the inoculum used was a 0 8 l conventional nitrification sludge sample collected from a local wwtp in brisbane australia feeding was real domestic wastewater pretreated by a pilot scale high rate activated sludge hras process located in the same plant the pretreated wastewater was collected weekly transported to the laboratory and then stored at 4 c prior to usage average ammonium nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations in the feeding of r2 r4 were 43 2 3 3 mg l and 111 22 mg l respectively other main characteristics of the feed wastewater can be found in table 1 the operation of r1 included a baseline phase and an experimental phase in the baseline phase day 0 77 the reactor was operated until effluent nitrogenous compounds concentrations and in situ aob and nob activities were relatively stable after that an external unit with a working volume of 160 ml was added to perform sidestream fecl3 dosing fig 2 simultaneously a sludge collection period 25 mins was added into the sbr operational regime approximately 450 ml of mixed liquor was collected at the end of the aeration period of each cycle given by four operational cycles per day 1800 ml in total was daily collected and then thickened to 160 ml through gravity settling the thickened sludge was transferred into the external unit and the ph was adjusted to 2 1 by dosing high concentration fecl3 solution i e 60 g fe l the sludge was subjected to the acidic environment for 24 h under mixing at 150 rpm using a magnetic stirrer after that the treated sludge was returned to the r1 equally over the four cycles at the beginning of each cycle by using a peristaltic pump to optimize the sidestream dosing scheme the frequency of sidestream iron dosing was reduced from daily during the operation of day from 78 to 301 to every two days day 302 to 337 and then to every three days till the end of the operation a visualised representation of sidestream iron dosing scheme can be found in fig s1 it is also to be noted that from day 226 to day 301 an in situ test was conducted to identify the effect of fna in nob suppression the effect of fna was artificially removed in days 226 to 301 except for day 262 and day 283 to be specific for fna effect elimination the mixed liquor was thickened by centrifuge 4000 rpm v 5 min and washed three times using deionized water before dosing iron fna cannot be generated without nitrite three identical sbrs i e r2 r3 and r4 were set up with a working volume of 1 2 l and operated under room temperature 22 24 c a synchronous operation of three sbrs was applied to comprehensively assess the effect of different fe dosing strategies on n conversion p removal activities of aob nob and denitrifiers sludge settling and dewatering properties and observed sludge yield three sbrs had a new operational regime including an anoxic denitrification period enabling tn removal each 8 h cycle time consisted of 10 min feeding 110 min anoxic 305 min aeration 45 min settling 5 min decanting and 5 min idling the hrt was prolonged to 16 h by feeding 0 6 l wastewater in each cycle with re inoculation of the nitrification sludge that was collected at the same wwtp as r1 the three reactors were fed with raw domestic wastewater which contained adequate organic matters i e cod 411 29 mg l table 1 other sbr operational parameters such as srt i e 15 d were unchanged as mentioned above in brief r2 was operated with the same sidestream fe dosing strategy as applied in r1 from day 338 to day 400 see details above with the same amount of fecl3 dosed r3 operation commenced using the mainstream dosing strategy i e in reactor fe dosing in the feeding period of each cycle r4 served as a conventional control without the addition of fecl3 these reactors were continuously operated for 75 days i e 5 srts to reach a steady state 2 3 monitoring procedure throughout the 400 day operation of r1 the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in the influent and effluent were measured 2 3 times per week the concentrations of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and volatile suspended solids vss were assessed fortnightly the in situ activities of aob and nob were regularly estimated biomass samples were collected on days 58 175 205 240 260 320 and 370 and then stored at 80 c for further community analysis analytical details of the dna extraction 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and data analysis are provided in supplementary material section text s1 for r2 r3 and r4 the nh4 n no2 n no3 n and po4 3 p concentrations in the influent and effluent of the three sbrs were measured 1 2 times a week cycle studies in each sbr were performed weekly by analysing the nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations every 30 min in a typical cycle the aob nob and denitrifier activities in each sbr were analyzed once a week cod mlss mlvss and sludge volume index svi and ss in effluent were measured 1 2 times a week and the sludge dewaterability in each sbr was analyzed for three times in last three weeks once per week all these analytical procedures are presented in details in supplementary material sections text s1 3 results 3 1 effects of sidestream fecl3 dosing on nitrifying bacteria 3 1 1 stable nob suppression fig 3 presents the effluent no2 n no3 n concentrations nar and in situ nob activities during the continuous operation of r1 after the inoculation nh4 was converted to no3 and almost no no2 accumulated in the effluent suggesting the occurrence of full nitrification in the baseline phase the specific nob activity stabilized at 5 6 mg no3 n g vss h which is comparable to that in the conventional activated sludge process e g 3 7 mg no3 n g vss h yao and peng 2017 the sable performances of nitrifying bacteria activity and mlss and mlvss concentrations indicate that the steady state has been achieved in baseline phase figs 3 and s2 following that the experimental phase commenced from day 78 a high concentration fecl3 stock solution was dosed daily into the sidestream sludge treatment unit decreasing the ph of sludge to 2 1 immediately the effluent no2 n concentration increased up to 10 mg l the effluent no3 n concentration decreased rapidly became almost undetectable in a month and then stably maintained at less than 2 mg n l as a result the nar gradually increased and reached over 90 on day 170 the nob activity substantially decreased to around 0 4 mg no3 n g vss h collectively the results demonstrated the achievement of nob suppression by sidestream fecl3 dosing the nob suppression was initiated with acidification while sustained with the formation of fna within the sidestream unit thereafter attributed to the accumulation of nitrite due to nob suppression fna above one ppm immediately formed after decreasing ph to 2 1 in the sidestream unit fig s3 the ppm level fna can cause the lysis of many microorganisms including nob according to the literature pijuan et al 2012 wang et al 2014 zheng et al 2021 to examine the role of fna played in eliminating nob from day 226 the nitrite in the sludge was intentionally removed by centrifuge thickening and wash prior to dosing fecl3 without the effect of fna during 24 h sludge treatment the nar significantly decreased down to 50 in a month the high nar immediately recovered after dosing fecl3 in the sidestream unit in the presence of nitrite see arrows in fig 3a the same nitrite removed operation was repeatedly conducted and the results confirmed the significant decrease in the nar after that meanwhile the specific nob activity increased to 2 5 2 8 mg no3 n g vss h moreover the nob activity was hardly detectable after fna and acid treatment in short term ex situ batch tests fig s4 therefore it can be concluded that the sludge acidification was critical to initiate nitrite accumulation and then the formed fna played an essential role in maintaining nob suppression to improve aob activity see section 3 1 2 the frequency of daily sludge treatment was reduced to every two days on day 302 and then to three days on day 338 within the followed 100 days the effluent no3 concentration and the specific nob activity were 6 2 0 2 mg l and 0 6 0 1 mg no3 n g vss h respectively the average nar was still maintained at 89 8 0 7 indicating stable nob control although many previous studies have reported the suppression of nob activity in low strength wastewater treatment the stability of nob control remains a significant challenge xu et al 2015 cao et al 2017 agrawal et al 2018 in this study r1 was fed with real domestic wastewater average nh4 n concentration slightly over 40 mg l table 1 and operated for over one year to demonstrate the stable nob suppression by the sidestream fecl3 dosing 3 1 2 impacts on aob activity in the baseline phase r1 performed complete ammonia oxidation with residual nh4 n concentration of less than 0 5 mg l with the fecl3 dosing a considerable amount of nh4 remained in the effluent the nh4 n removal efficiency are sharply decreased to 10 on day 115 38 days after fecl3 dosing this result indicates that the aob community in the conventional nitrification sludge is sensitive to the fecl3 based sludge treatment nevertheless the are recovered to about 30 40 of its baseline level 80 days after the sidestream iron dosing likely due to microbial community adaptation to be elaborated in next section to reduce the inhibition on aob activities the frequency of sidestream dosing was reduced to every two days and three days in days 302 337 and days 338 400 respectively as shown in fig 4 b the are of r1 increased to 50 60 and then to 60 70 with the frequency reduced to every two days and three days respectively the reduced frequency did not affect the effective nob suppression this indicates that nh4 n removal performance can be maintained with optimized sidestream dosing strategy to achieve effective nob suppression similarly the specific aob activity decreased substantially from 5 1 0 1 mg nh4 n g vss h to 0 3 0 1 mg nh4 n g vss h on day 120 but gradually increased up to about 3 3 0 1 mg nh4 n g vss h along with continuous operation collectively the results suggest that aob are more tolerant to the sidestream iron dosing than nob and aob activities can be largely maintained with the novel sidestream iron dosing strategy 3 1 3 microbial community analysis throughout the 400 day operation of the r1 seven biomass samples in total were collected and microbial communities of these samples were analyzed by using 16 rrna gene targeted amplicon sequencing analysis of good s coverage index showed that the tests captured 99 9 of the sample species the sequencing results revealed that at the phylum level proteobacteria was the most dominant bacteria in the total community fig 5 a which is consistent with the previous analyzes of conventional activated sludge wu et al 2019 in the baseline phase three nitrifying genera nitrosomonas nitrospira and nitrobacter were detected in the biomass with relative abundances of 1 6 0 8 and 0 2 respectively after the fecl3 dosing nitrospira and nitrobacter became almost undetectable 0 03 additionally a new nob genus candidatus ca nitrotoga presented with a relative abundance of up to 0 3 in the biomass during the nitrite removed operation fig 5b the nob ca nitrotoga was first discovered from a siberian arctic soil sample in 2007 alawi et al 2007 nitrotoga like bacteria were detected in activated sludge of some full scale wwtps and previously thought to be of importance for nitrite oxidation at low temperatures lücker et al 2015 saunders et al 2016 indeed many members of this nob genus are cold adapted liu et al 2021 zheng et al 2020 hüpeden et al 2016 ishii et al 2017 except for an isolate ca nitrotoga fabula from an activated sludge sample kitzinger et al 2018 in a recent report zheng et al showed that nitrotoga like bacteria in activated sludge can tolerate extreme environmental conditions such as acidic alkali ph 5 5 9 0 fna and free ammonium fa than nitrospira zheng et al 2020 here this study further revealed the potential tolerance of ca nitrotoga to extremely acid i e ph 2 1 and a high level fna of 10 mg hno2 n l fig s3 which requires a further investigation through microbial enrichment the introduction of sidestream iron dosing also reduced the abundance of aob nitrosomonas to as low as 0 2 nevertheless the abundance recovered gradually to 0 9 on day 260 fig 5b ten otu sequences in total were obtained in the nitrosomonas genus on day 58 two of them had relatively high abundances of 1 38 and 0 37 respectively however both were undetectable in the six samples collected during the experimental phase instead another single otu sequence became predominance with relative abundance gradually increasing from 0 on day 58 up to 1 06 on day 240 the community shift trend matched the increase of aob microbial abundance as well as the activities measured in the reactor the microbial results confirmed the adaptation of nitrosomonas to the sidestream iron dosing occurred on a species level 3 2 overall performance improvement through sidestream fecl3 dosing 3 2 1 nitrogen removal to assess the effects of sidestream fecl3 dosing on overall wastewater treatment performance r2 r3 and r4 were operated in parallel for 75 days 5 srts with stable performance reached the dynamic nitrogen conversion performances are presented in fig 6 and the steady state results are summarized in table 2 the implementation of sidestream iron dosing achieved mainstream short cut nitrogen removal in r2 with nar over 80 which imply improved tn removal for low cod n ratio wastewater despite the same amount of fecl3 dosed in the mainstream line of r3 the nar remained zero as well as in the control r4 the specific nob activity in r2 was 0 5 0 1 mg no3 n g vss h and maintained 5 of that 9 2 0 5 mg no3 n g vss h in r3 and r4 due to the sidestream iron dosing the aob activity in r2 3 5 0 2 mg nh4 n g vss h was around half of that 6 9 0 1 mg nh4 n g vss h in r3 and r4 consequently the effluent nh4 n concentration of 5 1 1 2 mg l in r2 is higher than that i e 0 1 mg n l in other two sbrs the residual nh4 could further decrease by optimizing the sbr operational condition furthermore the molar ratio of no2 nh4 in r2 effluent was about 3 which is higher than the theoretical demand of anammox bacteria i e no2 nh4 1 32 strous et al 1999 thus mainstream anammox can potentially be achieved in this scenario by mixing the effluent with the influent at a certain ratio 3 2 2 biomass production in addition to nitrogen removal performances the sidestream fecl3 dosing significantly reduced the amount of excess sludge in the activated sludge process the observed sludge yield yobs was calculated according to the average inflow rate influent and effluent cod concentrations effluent and in reactor biomass concentrations eq 1 the mlss and mlvss concentrations were stable in the experimental phase of three reactors fig s5 yobs values were 0 18 0 01 0 26 0 02 and 0 26 0 02 g vss g cod in r2 r3 and r4 respectively which suggests that about 30 less biomass was generated with the application of sidestream fecl3 dosing this result is comparable to the reduction level i e 20 30 reported using ultrasonication ozonation fna or fa treatment of excess sludge neis et al 2008 dytczak et al 2007 wang et al 2013 yang et al 2018 wu et al 2018 while the sludge reduction efficiency reported in this study is not the highest it is highly competitive and feasible amongst other technologies for sludge reduction for examples using ozone treatment induces significant costs sakai et al 1997 chlorinated treatment may result in poor sludge settling performance saby et al 2002 and high level fa treatment would lead to high effluent ammonium concentration zheng et al 2019b 3 2 3 other performances apart from nob suppression and sludge reduction the novel sidestream fecl3 dosing strategy also attained the same benefits as the mainstream fecl3 dosing i e the removal of p ss and improvements of sludge settleability and dewaterability as summarised in table 2 taking p removal as an example only 45 of total p was removed in r4 this indicates that iron dosing can be used to meet the effluent p control criteria in wwtps according to optimal dose tests text s3 and fig s6 20 mg fe l dosed into the wastewater used in this study was required with the amount of fecl3 dosed 35 mg fe per litre influent in either mainstream or sidestream the effluent po4 3 p concentrations in both r2 and r3 were 0 1 0 1 mg l showing highly efficient p removal 98 4 discussion iron salts i e fecl3 have been commonly used in urban water management to improve the performance of water treatment facilities wilfert et al 2015 many previous reports have been primarily focusing on suspended solids removal in drinking water treatment plants gitis and hankins 2018 sulfide or h2s control in sewer pipeline nielsen et al 2005 gutierrez et al 2010 enhanced phosphorus removal rasmussen and nielsen 1996 wilfert et al 2015 anaerobic digestion ge et al 2013 calderon et al 2021 and sludge settleability and dewatering in wwtps yu et al 2016 asensi et al 2019 here by developing a novel sidestream dosing strategy this study first demonstrates the achievement of stable nob suppression and excess sludge reduction in the activated sludge system with the addition of fecl3 in sidestream the outcome thus adds a new option to the technological toolkit for achieving more efficient nitrogen removal with less biomass production in future wastewater treatment the success of the sidestream iron dosing was attributed to the strong acidity of fecl3 via hydrolysis reactions mulay and selwood 1954 as demonstrated in this study the nob activity substantially decreased in the acidic environment created by fecl3 fig s4 fecl3 hydrolysis was previously overlooked in the field of wastewater treatment as sewage and sludge have a relatively high buffering capacity however the buffer can be overcome by centralized dosing fecl3 to sludge in an external unit according to the experimental design in this work the working volume of the external tank 160 ml was only 13 3 of that of the sbr this size is comparable to the anaerobic tank e g hrt 1 2 h installed in the conventional enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr process at the same time this study demonstrates that the total amount of sidestream dosed fecl3 35 mg fe l is comparable with that i e 10 20 mg fe l treated sewage currently used in some wwtps kazadi mbamba et al 2019 kulandaivelu et al 2020 prot et al 2020 more importantly the sidestream iron dosing reduced 30 biomass yield sludge disposal is costly accounting for up to 60 of the total expenditure in a wwtp yang et al 2018 regarding the capital investment and operating cost the sidestream fecl3 dosing strategy is likely economically viable the fna effect was identified to be critical in the stability of nob control through the reactor experiment fig 3 and the short term batch investigations fig s4 wang et al 2014 previously found that sidestream sludge treatment using fna was effective in nob elimination however many more recent studies have revealed that some novel nob such as ca nitrotoga can adapt to fna along with long term reactor operation challenging that the sole fna effect cannot repress nob stably ma et al 2017 duan et al 2019a zheng et al 2020 duan et al 2019a proposed sludge treatment using alternated fna and fa to overcome nob adaptation however this strategy remains unstable given that ca nitrotoga can also adapt to fa li et al 2020a zheng et al 2020 wang et al 2021a the failure of the shortcut process was likely related to nob contained in real domestic wastewater duan et al 2019b here nob was stably suppressed during the long term operation of the mainstream reactor fed with real wastewater the sidestream fecl3 dosing strategy proposed in this study likely played a role in causing a combined effect of fna and acid that is because with fna at a similar ppm level the ph 2 1 obtained in this work is much lower than ph 5 5 6 0 used in the previous studies indeed batch investigations revealed that the nob activity of the sludge significantly decreased after treatment under only low ph fig s4 as a result to the best of our knowledge a feasible strategy was first demonstrated in eliminating nitrotoga like nob in activated sludge fig 5 attributed to the strong acid environment i e ph 2 1 this study generated the ppm level fna without the external addition of nitrite this is different from previous studies on sidestream sludge treatment using fna that required adding a high concentration of nitrite over 250 mg n l wang et al 2014 wang et al 2016 duan et al 2019b jiang et al 2019 as assumed that the nitrite could be biologically produced from some high strength nitrogen streams such as anaerobic digestion liquor in wwtps zheng et al 2017 de graaff et al 2010 in contrast the strategy developed in this study should be more applicable in many small scale wwtps where there is no anaerobic digester installed cao et al 2020 further these previous approaches need to concentrate the sludge by a centrifuge prior to the treatment because the fe dosed sludge had better settleability a gravity settling process was demonstrated technically feasible in this study these indicate a wider range of applications of the sidestream fecl3 dosing strategy it should be noted that in the second experiment the effluent cod concentration of r2 was higher than those of r3 and r4 see table 2 the reason was likely related to the lower biomass concentration in r2 fig s5 and the potential release of organics due to cell lysis nonetheless the effluent cod concentration remained below 30 mg l in the first experiment when the influent had less organic carbon 110 mg cod l herein the new iron dosing strategy proposed in this study should be more suitable for treating carbon insufficient wastewater where short cut nitrogen removal is needed in this proof of concept study technology optimization e g fe dosing frequency was only partly conducted it is expected that sludge treatment time i e 24 h can be further optimized in future studies as a high fna concentration was only maintained for 6 h during the 24 h sludge treatment fig s3 fna is chemically unstable at low ph particularly when ph is below 4 udert et al 2005 fna can break down and form toxic nitrogenous compounds such as nitric oxide no udert et al 2005 li et al 2020b wang et al 2021c as such a closed external unit is needed to treat sludge at low ph it should also be noted that fecl3 dosage is not linearly correlated to ph decrease for example if ph sets as 2 4 during sludge treatment half of the amount of iron dosed can be saved compared with ph setting as 2 1 further optimization studies will be required to reveal its full potential and feasibility 5 conclusion a novel sidestream iron dosing approach was demonstrated in this work which achieves two additional benefits than traditional mainstream iron dosing by adding fe 35 mg fe per litre influent into a sidestream unit where a portion of gravity settled sludge was transferred to regularly the acidic condition led to nitrite accumulation and subsequently the formation of fna the periodic exposure to fna resulted in stable nob suppression whereas the ammonia oxidizing community can adapt and retain about half of the specific activity moreover the high level of fna formation due to the novel iron dosing strategy resulted in sludge disintegration observed sludge yield was reduced by approximately 30 proposed sidestream iron dosing strategy brings significant benefits to wastewater treatment nitrogen removal performance could be greatly improved in the mainstream bioreactor by the established nitrite pathway using sidestream iron dosing reduced excess sludge production due to the sidestream iron dosing can be translated into significantly less sludge disposal accompanied by economic savings and environmental benefits in addition sidestream dosing of fecl3 still provided benefits such as improved settleability and dewaterability of sludge and enhanced phosphorus removal upscaling studies need to be conducted to fully verify the practical and economic feasibility of

16719,iron salts i e fecl3 are the most used chemicals in the urban wastewater system iron is commonly dosed into sewage or the mainstream system which provides multiple benefits such as enhanced phosphorus removal and improved sludge settleability dewaterability this study reported and demonstrated a new approach that dosed fecl3 into returned sludge in order to bring two more benefits to wastewater management short cut nitrogen removal via the nitrite pathway and less biomass production this approach is achieved based on our findings that with similar amount of fecl3 centralized iron

ultrasound zheng et al 2019a was used to treat the sludge regularly designed conditions introduced into the sidestream reactors selectively suppressed nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob to achieve shortcut nitrogen removal process nh4 no2 n2 the shortcut nitrogen removal process represents the most attractive option for future wastewater treatment because this process has significantly less carbon and oxygen demand compared with conventional nitrification denitrification process antileo et al 2013 moreover the harsh conditions created in sidestream sludge treatment resulted in cell lysis and cryptic growth i e the utilization of intracellular microbial compounds released from a cell lysis step and thereby leading to a lower biomass yield wang et al 2013 wu et al 2018 in this work we aimed to expand the benefits of iron dosing by adopting the sidestream sludge treatment to bring multifaceted benefits to wastewater management including not only enhanced phosphorus removal sludge settling dewatering but also shortcut nitrogen removal and less biomass production in fact more than being a coagulant fecl3 is a strong lewis acid e g ph 1 5 at 38 wt with fe iii hydrolysis fe3 3h2o fe oh 3 3h the normal dosage of fecl3 e g 10 40 mg fe l used for mainstream iron dosing purpose is far from enough to acidify the wastewater due to the presence of alkalinity however fecl3 dosing in the sidestream unit could acidify sludge considering that the volume of thickened sludge is substantially less than the mainstream treatment volume for example given the same amount of total fecl3 dosed the iron concentration in the sidestream unit can reach over 1 g fe l sludge which is two orders of magnitude higher than the iron concentration induced by common mainstream iron dosing e g 10 40 mg fe l wastewater we hypothesized that the fecl3 acidified sludge treatment could suppress nob activity as nob are known acid sensitive except for a nitrobacter isolate that optimally grows at ph 5 5 hankinson and schmidt 1988 in contrast some ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob can tolerant acidic condition where ph can be as low as 2 fumasoli et al 2017 hayatsu et al 2017 picone et al 2020 wang et al 2021b wang et al 2021c this suggests that acidic tolerant aob community can be selected during long term reactor operation moreover fna hno2 no2 h pka 3 25 above one part per million ppm may be formed at the low ph in the presence of only a few milligrams of nitrite it has been shown that ppm level fna suppress nob more than aob wang et al 2014 zheng et al 2021 as such fna formed from accumulated nitrite in the fecl3 acidified sludge may also be beneficial to nob control to test the proposed novel fecl3 dosing approach a laboratory sequencing batch reactor sbr connected with an external unit where fecl3 is dosed into was set up and fed with real domestic wastewater throughout 400 days of operation stability of nob control was evaluated through regularly monitoring nitrification performance including nitrite accumulation ammonium removal and in situ aob and nob activities as well as microbial community succession after that another three sbrs were set up two were operated with dosing fecl3 in the sidestream and mainstream and another served as a control reactor without the addition of fecl3 the operation of three reactors enabled comprehensive evaluation of the effects of sidestream fecl3 dosing to the reactor performances including effluent quality microbial activities sludge properties and observed biomass yield 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental design this study composed of two long term experiments was designed to investigate the impacts of sidestream iron dosing on i nitrifying community days 0 400 and ii overall wastewater treatment performances days 401 475 fig 1 in the first experiment one aerobic sbr r1 was operated with baseline phase and experimental phase to evaluate the effects of sidestream iron dosing on selective suppression of nob over aob r1 was operated without iron dosing during baseline phase days 0 77 in the following experimental phase days 78 400 fecl3 was dosed into the sidestream unit of the sbr to acidify the sludge to ph of 2 1 iron was dosed daily between day 78 and day 301 and then every two and three days in days 302 337 and days 338 400 respectively in situ tests were conducted in days 226 to 301 to identify the role of fna in nob suppression a comprehensive ex situ batch test was also performed on day 282 to evaluate the role of acid nitrite and iron in nob suppression text s2 and table s1 to evaluate the overall impacts of sidestream fecl3 dosing on nitrogen removal and sludge reduction three anoxic aerobic sbrs r2 r3 r4 were set up from day 401 and operated for 75 days the feeding and operational regime of the three sbrs were designed to enable anoxic denitrification to mimic the conventional activated sludge process of full scale wwtps sidestream fecl3 dosing was performed in r2 every three days which is the same as that in operational days 338 400 of r1 to enable direct comparisons between sidestream iron dosing strategy with mainstream iron dosing strategy and conventional operation r3 was operated with mainstream fecl3 dosing at the same dosage as r2 and r4 severed as a control without iron dosing effluent quality microbial activities sludge properties and observed sludge yield were measured and compared from the three reactors 2 2 reactor operation r1 with a working volume of 1 2 l was set up and operated at room temperature 22 24 c the reactor had four operational cycles each day and each cycle 6 h consists of the following steps in order 5 min feeding 305 min aeration 40 min settling 5 min decanting and 5 min idling during the aeration step dissolved oxygen do concentration was controlled above 2 mg o2 l through a laboratory scale air blower and monitored by a do probe optical do sensor inpro 6960i mettler toledo and a transmitter multiparameter transmitter m800 mettler toledo mixing was provided by a magnetic stirrer at 250 rpm in the feeding and aeration steps at the end of the aeration period 80 ml of mixed liquor from the sbr was discharged in 5 min on a daily basis as such sludge retention time srt was controlled at 15 d after settling 800 ml supernatant was discharged resulting in a hydraulic retention time hrt of 9 h ph of the mixed liquor was not controlled but measured between 7 2 7 8 by using a ph probe minichem labtek the inoculum used was a 0 8 l conventional nitrification sludge sample collected from a local wwtp in brisbane australia feeding was real domestic wastewater pretreated by a pilot scale high rate activated sludge hras process located in the same plant the pretreated wastewater was collected weekly transported to the laboratory and then stored at 4 c prior to usage average ammonium nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations in the feeding of r2 r4 were 43 2 3 3 mg l and 111 22 mg l respectively other main characteristics of the feed wastewater can be found in table 1 the operation of r1 included a baseline phase and an experimental phase in the baseline phase day 0 77 the reactor was operated until effluent nitrogenous compounds concentrations and in situ aob and nob activities were relatively stable after that an external unit with a working volume of 160 ml was added to perform sidestream fecl3 dosing fig 2 simultaneously a sludge collection period 25 mins was added into the sbr operational regime approximately 450 ml of mixed liquor was collected at the end of the aeration period of each cycle given by four operational cycles per day 1800 ml in total was daily collected and then thickened to 160 ml through gravity settling the thickened sludge was transferred into the external unit and the ph was adjusted to 2 1 by dosing high concentration fecl3 solution i e 60 g fe l the sludge was subjected to the acidic environment for 24 h under mixing at 150 rpm using a magnetic stirrer after that the treated sludge was returned to the r1 equally over the four cycles at the beginning of each cycle by using a peristaltic pump to optimize the sidestream dosing scheme the frequency of sidestream iron dosing was reduced from daily during the operation of day from 78 to 301 to every two days day 302 to 337 and then to every three days till the end of the operation a visualised representation of sidestream iron dosing scheme can be found in fig s1 it is also to be noted that from day 226 to day 301 an in situ test was conducted to identify the effect of fna in nob suppression the effect of fna was artificially removed in days 226 to 301 except for day 262 and day 283 to be specific for fna effect elimination the mixed liquor was thickened by centrifuge 4000 rpm v 5 min and washed three times using deionized water before dosing iron fna cannot be generated without nitrite three identical sbrs i e r2 r3 and r4 were set up with a working volume of 1 2 l and operated under room temperature 22 24 c a synchronous operation of three sbrs was applied to comprehensively assess the effect of different fe dosing strategies on n conversion p removal activities of aob nob and denitrifiers sludge settling and dewatering properties and observed sludge yield three sbrs had a new operational regime including an anoxic denitrification period enabling tn removal each 8 h cycle time consisted of 10 min feeding 110 min anoxic 305 min aeration 45 min settling 5 min decanting and 5 min idling the hrt was prolonged to 16 h by feeding 0 6 l wastewater in each cycle with re inoculation of the nitrification sludge that was collected at the same wwtp as r1 the three reactors were fed with raw domestic wastewater which contained adequate organic matters i e cod 411 29 mg l table 1 other sbr operational parameters such as srt i e 15 d were unchanged as mentioned above in brief r2 was operated with the same sidestream fe dosing strategy as applied in r1 from day 338 to day 400 see details above with the same amount of fecl3 dosed r3 operation commenced using the mainstream dosing strategy i e in reactor fe dosing in the feeding period of each cycle r4 served as a conventional control without the addition of fecl3 these reactors were continuously operated for 75 days i e 5 srts to reach a steady state 2 3 monitoring procedure throughout the 400 day operation of r1 the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in the influent and effluent were measured 2 3 times per week the concentrations of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and volatile suspended solids vss were assessed fortnightly the in situ activities of aob and nob were regularly estimated biomass samples were collected on days 58 175 205 240 260 320 and 370 and then stored at 80 c for further community analysis analytical details of the dna extraction 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and data analysis are provided in supplementary material section text s1 for r2 r3 and r4 the nh4 n no2 n no3 n and po4 3 p concentrations in the influent and effluent of the three sbrs were measured 1 2 times a week cycle studies in each sbr were performed weekly by analysing the nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations every 30 min in a typical cycle the aob nob and denitrifier activities in each sbr were analyzed once a week cod mlss mlvss and sludge volume index svi and ss in effluent were measured 1 2 times a week and the sludge dewaterability in each sbr was analyzed for three times in last three weeks once per week all these analytical procedures are presented in details in supplementary material sections text s1 3 results 3 1 effects of sidestream fecl3 dosing on nitrifying bacteria 3 1 1 stable nob suppression fig 3 presents the effluent no2 n no3 n concentrations nar and in situ nob activities during the continuous operation of r1 after the inoculation nh4 was converted to no3 and almost no no2 accumulated in the effluent suggesting the occurrence of full nitrification in the baseline phase the specific nob activity stabilized at 5 6 mg no3 n g vss h which is comparable to that in the conventional activated sludge process e g 3 7 mg no3 n g vss h yao and peng 2017 the sable performances of nitrifying bacteria activity and mlss and mlvss concentrations indicate that the steady state has been achieved in baseline phase figs 3 and s2 following that the experimental phase commenced from day 78 a high concentration fecl3 stock solution was dosed daily into the sidestream sludge treatment unit decreasing the ph of sludge to 2 1 immediately the effluent no2 n concentration increased up to 10 mg l the effluent no3 n concentration decreased rapidly became almost undetectable in a month and then stably maintained at less than 2 mg n l as a result the nar gradually increased and reached over 90 on day 170 the nob activity substantially decreased to around 0 4 mg no3 n g vss h collectively the results demonstrated the achievement of nob suppression by sidestream fecl3 dosing the nob suppression was initiated with acidification while sustained with the formation of fna within the sidestream unit thereafter attributed to the accumulation of nitrite due to nob suppression fna above one ppm immediately formed after decreasing ph to 2 1 in the sidestream unit fig s3 the ppm level fna can cause the lysis of many microorganisms including nob according to the literature pijuan et al 2012 wang et al 2014 zheng et al 2021 to examine the role of fna played in eliminating nob from day 226 the nitrite in the sludge was intentionally removed by centrifuge thickening and wash prior to dosing fecl3 without the effect of fna during 24 h sludge treatment the nar significantly decreased down to 50 in a month the high nar immediately recovered after dosing fecl3 in the sidestream unit in the presence of nitrite see arrows in fig 3a the same nitrite removed operation was repeatedly conducted and the results confirmed the significant decrease in the nar after that meanwhile the specific nob activity increased to 2 5 2 8 mg no3 n g vss h moreover the nob activity was hardly detectable after fna and acid treatment in short term ex situ batch tests fig s4 therefore it can be concluded that the sludge acidification was critical to initiate nitrite accumulation and then the formed fna played an essential role in maintaining nob suppression to improve aob activity see section 3 1 2 the frequency of daily sludge treatment was reduced to every two days on day 302 and then to three days on day 338 within the followed 100 days the effluent no3 concentration and the specific nob activity were 6 2 0 2 mg l and 0 6 0 1 mg no3 n g vss h respectively the average nar was still maintained at 89 8 0 7 indicating stable nob control although many previous studies have reported the suppression of nob activity in low strength wastewater treatment the stability of nob control remains a significant challenge xu et al 2015 cao et al 2017 agrawal et al 2018 in this study r1 was fed with real domestic wastewater average nh4 n concentration slightly over 40 mg l table 1 and operated for over one year to demonstrate the stable nob suppression by the sidestream fecl3 dosing 3 1 2 impacts on aob activity in the baseline phase r1 performed complete ammonia oxidation with residual nh4 n concentration of less than 0 5 mg l with the fecl3 dosing a considerable amount of nh4 remained in the effluent the nh4 n removal efficiency are sharply decreased to 10 on day 115 38 days after fecl3 dosing this result indicates that the aob community in the conventional nitrification sludge is sensitive to the fecl3 based sludge treatment nevertheless the are recovered to about 30 40 of its baseline level 80 days after the sidestream iron dosing likely due to microbial community adaptation to be elaborated in next section to reduce the inhibition on aob activities the frequency of sidestream dosing was reduced to every two days and three days in days 302 337 and days 338 400 respectively as shown in fig 4 b the are of r1 increased to 50 60 and then to 60 70 with the frequency reduced to every two days and three days respectively the reduced frequency did not affect the effective nob suppression this indicates that nh4 n removal performance can be maintained with optimized sidestream dosing strategy to achieve effective nob suppression similarly the specific aob activity decreased substantially from 5 1 0 1 mg nh4 n g vss h to 0 3 0 1 mg nh4 n g vss h on day 120 but gradually increased up to about 3 3 0 1 mg nh4 n g vss h along with continuous operation collectively the results suggest that aob are more tolerant to the sidestream iron dosing than nob and aob activities can be largely maintained with the novel sidestream iron dosing strategy 3 1 3 microbial community analysis throughout the 400 day operation of the r1 seven biomass samples in total were collected and microbial communities of these samples were analyzed by using 16 rrna gene targeted amplicon sequencing analysis of good s coverage index showed that the tests captured 99 9 of the sample species the sequencing results revealed that at the phylum level proteobacteria was the most dominant bacteria in the total community fig 5 a which is consistent with the previous analyzes of conventional activated sludge wu et al 2019 in the baseline phase three nitrifying genera nitrosomonas nitrospira and nitrobacter were detected in the biomass with relative abundances of 1 6 0 8 and 0 2 respectively after the fecl3 dosing nitrospira and nitrobacter became almost undetectable 0 03 additionally a new nob genus candidatus ca nitrotoga presented with a relative abundance of up to 0 3 in the biomass during the nitrite removed operation fig 5b the nob ca nitrotoga was first discovered from a siberian arctic soil sample in 2007 alawi et al 2007 nitrotoga like bacteria were detected in activated sludge of some full scale wwtps and previously thought to be of importance for nitrite oxidation at low temperatures lücker et al 2015 saunders et al 2016 indeed many members of this nob genus are cold adapted liu et al 2021 zheng et al 2020 hüpeden et al 2016 ishii et al 2017 except for an isolate ca nitrotoga fabula from an activated sludge sample kitzinger et al 2018 in a recent report zheng et al showed that nitrotoga like bacteria in activated sludge can tolerate extreme environmental conditions such as acidic alkali ph 5 5 9 0 fna and free ammonium fa than nitrospira zheng et al 2020 here this study further revealed the potential tolerance of ca nitrotoga to extremely acid i e ph 2 1 and a high level fna of 10 mg hno2 n l fig s3 which requires a further investigation through microbial enrichment the introduction of sidestream iron dosing also reduced the abundance of aob nitrosomonas to as low as 0 2 nevertheless the abundance recovered gradually to 0 9 on day 260 fig 5b ten otu sequences in total were obtained in the nitrosomonas genus on day 58 two of them had relatively high abundances of 1 38 and 0 37 respectively however both were undetectable in the six samples collected during the experimental phase instead another single otu sequence became predominance with relative abundance gradually increasing from 0 on day 58 up to 1 06 on day 240 the community shift trend matched the increase of aob microbial abundance as well as the activities measured in the reactor the microbial results confirmed the adaptation of nitrosomonas to the sidestream iron dosing occurred on a species level 3 2 overall performance improvement through sidestream fecl3 dosing 3 2 1 nitrogen removal to assess the effects of sidestream fecl3 dosing on overall wastewater treatment performance r2 r3 and r4 were operated in parallel for 75 days 5 srts with stable performance reached the dynamic nitrogen conversion performances are presented in fig 6 and the steady state results are summarized in table 2 the implementation of sidestream iron dosing achieved mainstream short cut nitrogen removal in r2 with nar over 80 which imply improved tn removal for low cod n ratio wastewater despite the same amount of fecl3 dosed in the mainstream line of r3 the nar remained zero as well as in the control r4 the specific nob activity in r2 was 0 5 0 1 mg no3 n g vss h and maintained 5 of that 9 2 0 5 mg no3 n g vss h in r3 and r4 due to the sidestream iron dosing the aob activity in r2 3 5 0 2 mg nh4 n g vss h was around half of that 6 9 0 1 mg nh4 n g vss h in r3 and r4 consequently the effluent nh4 n concentration of 5 1 1 2 mg l in r2 is higher than that i e 0 1 mg n l in other two sbrs the residual nh4 could further decrease by optimizing the sbr operational condition furthermore the molar ratio of no2 nh4 in r2 effluent was about 3 which is higher than the theoretical demand of anammox bacteria i e no2 nh4 1 32 strous et al 1999 thus mainstream anammox can potentially be achieved in this scenario by mixing the effluent with the influent at a certain ratio 3 2 2 biomass production in addition to nitrogen removal performances the sidestream fecl3 dosing significantly reduced the amount of excess sludge in the activated sludge process the observed sludge yield yobs was calculated according to the average inflow rate influent and effluent cod concentrations effluent and in reactor biomass concentrations eq 1 the mlss and mlvss concentrations were stable in the experimental phase of three reactors fig s5 yobs values were 0 18 0 01 0 26 0 02 and 0 26 0 02 g vss g cod in r2 r3 and r4 respectively which suggests that about 30 less biomass was generated with the application of sidestream fecl3 dosing this result is comparable to the reduction level i e 20 30 reported using ultrasonication ozonation fna or fa treatment of excess sludge neis et al 2008 dytczak et al 2007 wang et al 2013 yang et al 2018 wu et al 2018 while the sludge reduction efficiency reported in this study is not the highest it is highly competitive and feasible amongst other technologies for sludge reduction for examples using ozone treatment induces significant costs sakai et al 1997 chlorinated treatment may result in poor sludge settling performance saby et al 2002 and high level fa treatment would lead to high effluent ammonium concentration zheng et al 2019b 3 2 3 other performances apart from nob suppression and sludge reduction the novel sidestream fecl3 dosing strategy also attained the same benefits as the mainstream fecl3 dosing i e the removal of p ss and improvements of sludge settleability and dewaterability as summarised in table 2 taking p removal as an example only 45 of total p was removed in r4 this indicates that iron dosing can be used to meet the effluent p control criteria in wwtps according to optimal dose tests text s3 and fig s6 20 mg fe l dosed into the wastewater used in this study was required with the amount of fecl3 dosed 35 mg fe per litre influent in either mainstream or sidestream the effluent po4 3 p concentrations in both r2 and r3 were 0 1 0 1 mg l showing highly efficient p removal 98 4 discussion iron salts i e fecl3 have been commonly used in urban water management to improve the performance of water treatment facilities wilfert et al 2015 many previous reports have been primarily focusing on suspended solids removal in drinking water treatment plants gitis and hankins 2018 sulfide or h2s control in sewer pipeline nielsen et al 2005 gutierrez et al 2010 enhanced phosphorus removal rasmussen and nielsen 1996 wilfert et al 2015 anaerobic digestion ge et al 2013 calderon et al 2021 and sludge settleability and dewatering in wwtps yu et al 2016 asensi et al 2019 here by developing a novel sidestream dosing strategy this study first demonstrates the achievement of stable nob suppression and excess sludge reduction in the activated sludge system with the addition of fecl3 in sidestream the outcome thus adds a new option to the technological toolkit for achieving more efficient nitrogen removal with less biomass production in future wastewater treatment the success of the sidestream iron dosing was attributed to the strong acidity of fecl3 via hydrolysis reactions mulay and selwood 1954 as demonstrated in this study the nob activity substantially decreased in the acidic environment created by fecl3 fig s4 fecl3 hydrolysis was previously overlooked in the field of wastewater treatment as sewage and sludge have a relatively high buffering capacity however the buffer can be overcome by centralized dosing fecl3 to sludge in an external unit according to the experimental design in this work the working volume of the external tank 160 ml was only 13 3 of that of the sbr this size is comparable to the anaerobic tank e g hrt 1 2 h installed in the conventional enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr process at the same time this study demonstrates that the total amount of sidestream dosed fecl3 35 mg fe l is comparable with that i e 10 20 mg fe l treated sewage currently used in some wwtps kazadi mbamba et al 2019 kulandaivelu et al 2020 prot et al 2020 more importantly the sidestream iron dosing reduced 30 biomass yield sludge disposal is costly accounting for up to 60 of the total expenditure in a wwtp yang et al 2018 regarding the capital investment and operating cost the sidestream fecl3 dosing strategy is likely economically viable the fna effect was identified to be critical in the stability of nob control through the reactor experiment fig 3 and the short term batch investigations fig s4 wang et al 2014 previously found that sidestream sludge treatment using fna was effective in nob elimination however many more recent studies have revealed that some novel nob such as ca nitrotoga can adapt to fna along with long term reactor operation challenging that the sole fna effect cannot repress nob stably ma et al 2017 duan et al 2019a zheng et al 2020 duan et al 2019a proposed sludge treatment using alternated fna and fa to overcome nob adaptation however this strategy remains unstable given that ca nitrotoga can also adapt to fa li et al 2020a zheng et al 2020 wang et al 2021a the failure of the shortcut process was likely related to nob contained in real domestic wastewater duan et al 2019b here nob was stably suppressed during the long term operation of the mainstream reactor fed with real wastewater the sidestream fecl3 dosing strategy proposed in this study likely played a role in causing a combined effect of fna and acid that is because with fna at a similar ppm level the ph 2 1 obtained in this work is much lower than ph 5 5 6 0 used in the previous studies indeed batch investigations revealed that the nob activity of the sludge significantly decreased after treatment under only low ph fig s4 as a result to the best of our knowledge a feasible strategy was first demonstrated in eliminating nitrotoga like nob in activated sludge fig 5 attributed to the strong acid environment i e ph 2 1 this study generated the ppm level fna without the external addition of nitrite this is different from previous studies on sidestream sludge treatment using fna that required adding a high concentration of nitrite over 250 mg n l wang et al 2014 wang et al 2016 duan et al 2019b jiang et al 2019 as assumed that the nitrite could be biologically produced from some high strength nitrogen streams such as anaerobic digestion liquor in wwtps zheng et al 2017 de graaff et al 2010 in contrast the strategy developed in this study should be more applicable in many small scale wwtps where there is no anaerobic digester installed cao et al 2020 further these previous approaches need to concentrate the sludge by a centrifuge prior to the treatment because the fe dosed sludge had better settleability a gravity settling process was demonstrated technically feasible in this study these indicate a wider range of applications of the sidestream fecl3 dosing strategy it should be noted that in the second experiment the effluent cod concentration of r2 was higher than those of r3 and r4 see table 2 the reason was likely related to the lower biomass concentration in r2 fig s5 and the potential release of organics due to cell lysis nonetheless the effluent cod concentration remained below 30 mg l in the first experiment when the influent had less organic carbon 110 mg cod l herein the new iron dosing strategy proposed in this study should be more suitable for treating carbon insufficient wastewater where short cut nitrogen removal is needed in this proof of concept study technology optimization e g fe dosing frequency was only partly conducted it is expected that sludge treatment time i e 24 h can be further optimized in future studies as a high fna concentration was only maintained for 6 h during the 24 h sludge treatment fig s3 fna is chemically unstable at low ph particularly when ph is below 4 udert et al 2005 fna can break down and form toxic nitrogenous compounds such as nitric oxide no udert et al 2005 li et al 2020b wang et al 2021c as such a closed external unit is needed to treat sludge at low ph it should also be noted that fecl3 dosage is not linearly correlated to ph decrease for example if ph sets as 2 4 during sludge treatment half of the amount of iron dosed can be saved compared with ph setting as 2 1 further optimization studies will be required to reveal its full potential and feasibility 5 conclusion a novel sidestream iron dosing approach was demonstrated in this work which achieves two additional benefits than traditional mainstream iron dosing by adding fe 35 mg fe per litre influent into a sidestream unit where a portion of gravity settled sludge was transferred to regularly the acidic condition led to nitrite accumulation and subsequently the formation of fna the periodic exposure to fna resulted in stable nob suppression whereas the ammonia oxidizing community can adapt and retain about half of the specific activity moreover the high level of fna formation due to the novel iron dosing strategy resulted in sludge disintegration observed sludge yield was reduced by approximately 30 proposed sidestream iron dosing strategy brings significant benefits to wastewater treatment nitrogen removal performance could be greatly improved in the mainstream bioreactor by the established nitrite pathway using sidestream iron dosing reduced excess sludge production due to the sidestream iron dosing can be translated into significantly less sludge disposal accompanied by economic savings and environmental benefits in addition sidestream dosing of fecl3 still provided benefits such as improved settleability and dewaterability of sludge and enhanced phosphorus removal upscaling studies need to be conducted to fully verify the practical and economic feasibility of
