17075,ozonation is an important process to further reduce the trace organic chemicals trocs in treated municipal wastewater before discharge into surface waters and is expected to form products that are more oxidized and more polar than their parent compounds many of these ozonation products ops are biodegradable and thus removed by post treatment e g aldehydes most studies on ops of trocs in wastewater rely on reversed phase liquid chromatography mass spectrometry rplc ms which is not suited for highly polar analytes in this study supercritical fluid chromatography combined with high resolution ms sfc hrms was applied in comparison to the generic rplc hrms to search for ops in ozonated wastewater treatment plant effluent at pilot scale while comparable results were obtained from these two techniques during suspect screenings for known ops a total of 23 ops were only observed by sfc hrms via non targeted screening several sfc only ops were proposed as the derivatives of methoxymethylmelamines phenolic sulfates sulfonates and metformin the latter was confirmed by laboratory scale ozonation experiments a complete ozonation pathway of metformin a widespread and extremely hydrophilic troc in aquatic environment was elaborated based on sfc hrms analysis five of the 10 metformin ops are reported for the first time in this study three different dual media filters were compared as post treatments and a combination of sand anthracite and fresh post granular activated carbon proved most effective in ops removal due to the additional adsorption capacity however six sfc only ops two of which originating from metformin appeared to be persistent during all post treatments raising concerns on their occurrence in drinking water sources impacted by

trace organic chemicals trocs such as pharmaceuticals personal care products and industrial compounds in effluents of wastewater treatment plants wwtp pose threats to receiving aquatic ecosystems and impact downstream water quality which is of particular concern if the wastewater impacted water bodies are used as drinking water sources via indirect potable reuse reemtsma et al 2006 loos et al 2013 luo et al 2014 ozonation and subsequent post treatments are increasingly implemented as additional wastewater treatment steps to improve the abatement of trocs huber et al 2005 hollender et al 2009 zimmermann et al 2011 ozone is also a common disinfectant and oxidant e g removal of odour and taste applied in drinking water production hoigné 1998 von gunten 2003 trocs are generally not completely mineralized during ozonation but transformed to smaller and more polar ozonation products ops via reactions with ozone and hydroxyl radicals oh formed from ozone decomposition von sonntag and von gunten 2012 prasse et al 2015 if released into the environment ops might exhibit an elevated persistence and mobility in water cycle due to their high polarity reemtsma et al 2016 moreover several studies have reported the increased toxicity of wwtp effluent after ozone treatment völker et al 2019 schneider et al 2020 indicating that ozonation can result in the generation of toxic compounds such as the carcinogenic n nitrosodimethylamine an op of a nontoxic metabolite of the fungicide tolylfluanid schmidt and brauch 2008 von gunten et al 2010 also ozone treatment leads to the formation of bioavailable organic matter e g assimilable organic carbon which promotes bacterial regrowth and is especially critical in drinking water applications wert et al 2007 the ozone treatment therefore should only be implemented combining with subsequent post treatments to eliminate ops völker et al 2019 many ops are oxygen rich e g aldehydes ketones carboxylic acids and readily biodegradable by the subsequent biofiltration steps hammes et al 2006 hübner et al 2014 leading to the reduction in overall toxicity of ozonated water mišík et al 2011 stalter et al 2011 nevertheless there is also evidence that some ops can be persistent during biological post treatment such as hydroxylamines and n oxides hübner et al 2015 knopp et al 2016 as a result the characterization and persistence assessment of ops during post treatment of ozonated water have received considerable attention target and suspect screening by liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms can be applied to monitor the removal of trocs and their known ops during wastewater ozonation deeb et al 2017 bourgin et al 2018 however the monitoring lists of chemicals in these approaches are very limited due to the lack of corresponding reference standards or mass spectral database schymanski et al 2014 in particular the targeted or suspect analysis of ops requires the pre selection of ops either by laboratory ozonation experiments or by in silico prediction based on ozonation mechanisms which are not available for many trocs parry and young 2016 von gunten 2018 non target screening by means of hrms can provide another possibility to comprehensively characterize a wide range of substances in complex water matrix and to prioritize the compounds of interest the high accuracy and high mass resolution enable the tentative identification of previously unknown compounds schymanski et al 2014 hollender et al 2017 non target screening with reversed phase liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry rplc ms has been successfully applied to analyze trocs in different water compartments e g surface water riverbank filtrate wastewater gago ferrero et al 2015 albergamo et al 2019 carpenter et al 2019 and examine their abatement during water treatment e g advanced oxidation biodegradation parry and young 2016 nürenberg et al 2019 however studies on non targeted analysis of transformation products are still rare schollée et al 2018 recently performed the rplc hrms based non target screening to trace ops during wastewater ozonation and subsequent post treatments an important aspect to be considered is that the scope of substances captured by non target screening is limited by sample enrichment and chromatographic separation steps hollender et al 2017 particularly the analysis of highly polar compounds by generic rplc ms remains challenging because of their low retention on classical rplc stationary phases e g c18 reemtsma et al 2016 many ops thereby might have been overlooked during the generic rplc hrms based non targeted analysis requiring the application of complementary alternative chromatography such as hydrophilic interaction chromatography hilic gago ferrero et al 2015 or supercritical fluid chromatography sfc sfc has a unique mobile phase comprising the supercritical co2 non polar and polar modifiers e g methanol and is compatible with both polar and non polar stationary phases these features allow sfc to simultaneously separate a large number of analytes with varied polarity making it a potential alternative to rplc and hilic west 2018 sfc has been increasingly applied in pharmaceutical industry desfontaine et al 2015 and metabolomics analysis shulaev and isaac 2018 promising results on the detection of highly polar trocs in environmental waters using sfc ms were recently documented bieber et al 2017 schulze et al 2019 sfc was reported to be clearly superior to rplc in terms of peak shapes and retention which considerably facilitates signal detection and integration of polar substances schulze et al 2020 the aim of this study was to explore the potential of sfc hrms to characterize ops and to better understand their formation during ozonation and removal by post treatments the ozonation and post treatment of wastewater were conducted using a pilot plant located at a full scale wwtp wastewater samples were analyzed using sfc hrms in comparison to rplc hrms suspect screening for previously known ops was performed to examine the consistence of sfc hrms results with rplc hrms output ops only detectable by sfc hrms and persistent during post treatments were prioritized through non target screening and their structures and origins were tentatively proposed sfc hrms was also employed to study the transformation mechanism of metformin during laboratory lab scale ozonation and to confirm the presence of metformin ops during ozonation and subsequent post treatments of real wwtp effluent

indigotrisulfonate 55 was purchased from abcr karlsruhe germany the analytical standards of metformin methane sulfonic acid and ammeline were purchased from th geyer höxter germany ultrapure water was obtained from a merck milli q integral 5 system merck darmstadt germany 2 2 pilot scale ozonation and post treatments of wastewater effluent the municipal wwtp schönerlinde berliner wasserbetriebe berlin germany is designed for approx 750 000 population equivalents and receives municipal as well as industrial wastewater a detailed description on the pilot plant was published elsewhere sauter et al 2021 the pilot scale treatment of secondary effluent consists of an ozonation unit followed by three different deep bed filtration steps that are operated in parallel the ozonation unit was operated with a specific ozone dose of 0 8 mg o3 mg doc during sampling events three different filtration systems were applied as post treatments a dual media filter with sand and biological activated carbon s bac a dual media filter with sand and anthracite s a and the dual media sand anthracite filter connected to a post granular activated carbon filter s a post gac the influent and effluent of ozonation unit as well as the effluents of three post treatments were collected as 24 hour composite samples the sampling campaign took place at two different times 06 2019 and 07 2019 one month in between the treated bed volumes bvs of the filters were 63373 s bac 59363 s a and 13019 post gac in 06 2019 and 66310 s bac 62613 s a and 13912 post gac in 07 2019 the filters were operated with the following target empty bed contact time ebct for the dual media filters ebct relates to the upper filter layer only s bac 15 min s a 15 min post gac 30 min s bac and s a filters are operated as coagulation filtration steps by dosing fecl3 solution in filter influent 2 3 lab scale ozonation of metformin the stock solution of ozone was prepared by sparging the ice cooled ultrapure water with ozone containing oxygen which was produced using an ozone generator cmg 10 5 innovatec gerätetechnik the ozone stock solution was standardized by its uv absorption at 258 nm ε 3000 m 1 cm 1 elovitz and von gunten 1999 experiments were performed in amber glass vials at room temperature 23 2 c ozonation was initiated by spiking the pre determined volume of ozone stock solution into 10 mm phosphate buffer solution ph 7 and 8 5 containing 20 µm of metformin two different initial ozone doses 0 5 and 5 mg l were chosen to maximize the formation of the primary and secondary ops of metformin for better identification the residual ozone concentration in reaction solution was determined following the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 samples were directly analyzed using sfc hrms and rplc hrms after complete depletion of ozone approx 2 hours 2 4 sample preparation two ml of wastewater samples were filtered using syringe filters 0 45 µm rc membrane minisart rc4 sartorius and filled into 2 ml glass vials and used for direct injection to rplc hrms azeotrope evaporation was used as enrichment procedure prior to sfc hrms analysis an aliquot of 4 ml of the filtered wastewater sample was mixed with 21 ml acetonitrile a ratio for the minimum azeotrope mixture in a falcon tube this mixture was then evaporated to dryness at 40 c under a stream of nitrogen the residue was reconstituted in 200 μl acetonitrile ultrapure water 90 10 resulting in a sample to extract enrichment factor of 20 the solution was centrifuged in an eppendorf tube at 14000 min 1 for 30 min and only the supernatant was transferred to a glass vial to ensure that any precipitate was removed before injection control samples were prepared by enriching the ultrapure water under the same conditions 2 5 mass spectrometric analysis for sfc analysis a method previously developed for highly polar compounds was used schulze et al 2020 for rplc a column normally employed for polar compounds was selected with 0 1 formic acid in mobile phase a common organic modifier applied in many screening studies schymanski et al 2015 the analysis was performed on two different systems as follows rplc hrms for the reversed phase analysis an acquity ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc connected to a xevo g2 xs quadrupole time of flight qtof mass spectrometry waters eschborn germany was used the injection volume was 100 µl the uplc separation was achieved using an acquity uplc hss t3 column 100 2 1 1 7 µm at a flow rate of 0 45 ml min 1 the column temperature was set to 45 c the mobile phase consisted of a water 0 1 formic acid and b methanol 0 1 formic acid the following gradient was applied 0 0 25 min 2 b 12 25 15 min 99 b 15 1 17 min 2 b sfc hrms the sfc separation was performed by coupling an acquity upc2 system to synapt gs2 qtof waters eschborn germany the chromatographic separation was performed on a beh column coupled at 55 c with flow rate of 1 5 ml min 1 and injection volume of 8 μl the a co2 and b methanol water gradient containing 10 mm ammonium formate in methanol water co solvent was applied as follows 0 0 5 min 1 b 9 12 5 min 50 b 12 6 15 min 1 b a methanol water make up flow containing 0 1 formic acid was used at 0 3 ml min 1 to transfer the column effluent into mass spectrometry samples were analysed using above instruments in positive and negative electrospray ionization modes separate runs following the same hrms parameters a lock spray containing leucine enkephalin was continuously infused during measurement the source settings include capillary voltage of 0 7 kv in positive and 2 kv in negative ionization modes source temperature at 140 c and desolvation temperature at 550 c the sampling cone voltage and source offset were set as 20 v and 50 v respectively nitrogen and argon were used as cone and collision gases respectively the desolvation gas flow was 950 l h 1 the data was recorded in sensitivity mode resolution approx 20000 as centroid data with a 0 15 s scan time over the mass range m z 50 to m z 1200 the mse acquisition was performed to simultaneously collect two data sets a low collision energy scan 4 ev to obtain parent ion information and an elevated collision energy scan 15 35 ev to get all fragment ions all samples were analysed in triplicate by a random sorting 2 6 data processing and analysis non target screening was done by evaluating the sfc hrms and rplc hrms data in retention time 1 to 10 min and mass range m z 50 to 1200 markerlynx was used to perform the peak picking for the molecular ion trace function 1 with 0 1 min deviation in retention time and 0 01 da deviation in exact mass the marker table with relative intensities to the total marker intensity was exported to excel and all further evaluations were performed there all markers that had a relative intensity 1 in control samples were excluded further reduction was done by removing the markers with 50 standard deviation in three injection replicates the remaining mass retention time m z rt pairs were further sorted to keep those with relative intensity 2 and with intensity increase by three times in ozonation effluent compared to influent these values were tested beforehand to ensure that the known ops were included in final data set and the reported m z rt pairs fulfil the signal to noise s n 10 criteria the marker tables from the same ionization modes of sfc hrms and rplc hrms measurements were grouped together and ordered according to ascending exact mass exact mass pairs were determined with a mass accuracy of 0 1 da and sorted out to a new table as common ops while the remaining m z rt pairs were treated as sfc only and rplc only ops a further manual evaluation in masslynx was performed to ensure the finally extracted ops strictly comply with the criteria stated above to be assigned as a sfc only op each peak was checked for its absence in control samples and rplc measurements for proper integration with s n ratio 10 its intensity was enhanced by at least 3 times in ozonation effluent compared to influent and it was not a fragment ion sum formulas were assigned by using a mass tolerance of 5 ppm and an elemental composition of c0 100 h0 100 n0 20 o0 20 p0 2 s0 2 i0 3 br0 3 cl0 3 and na0 2 by checking the isotopic pattern for the absence of cl and br and by taking into account the fragment ions detected by mse suspect screenings for sfc hrms and rplc hrms data were done by using unifi 3 results and discussions 3 1 suspect screenings of literature known ops a suspect screening for 70 known ops that were previously found during rplc ms analysis of ozonated wwtp effluent merel et al 2017 bourgin et al 2018 schollée et al 2018 table s1 supporting information was firstly performed using sfc hrms and rplc hrms to assess the comparability of these two techniques at least 13 of these 70 known ops were detected by both sfc hrms and rplc hrms in the ozonated wwtp effluent table 1 this low number may partially be due to the limitation in sensitivity of the employed sfc hrms following azeotropic enrichment and rplc hrms direct injection approaches compared to the analytical methods applied in literature i e solid phase extraction followed by rplc ms nine of the known ops detected in this study were n oxides table 1 interestingly n oxides behaved similarly during sfc and rplc separations by eluting later than their parent compounds with one exception of clarithromycin n oxide this supports the notion that the elution order in sfc is not simply governed by increasing polarity schulze et al 2020 notably all known ops detected by rplc hrms in this study were also detectable by sfc hrms indicating that sfc hrms could produce comparable results to the generic rplc hrms while screening the known substances 3 2 non target screenings by sfc hrms and rplc hrms non target screening was applied to wwtp effluent before and after ozonation using sfc hrms and rplc hrms to explore whether sfc hrms could provide additional information on ops of trocs one may expect that highly oxidized and consequently very polar ops may be overlooked by rplc hrms screening the comparison of m z rt pairs hereafter named features before and after ozonation was done without any attempt to identify for both setups of sfc and rplc the features present in instrumental blanks were firstly subtracted and only those picked in all three injection replicates from one sampling were used for following data processing it should be noted that ops are not necessarily new compounds that are absent before ozonation rather some ops are also formed as human metabolites or by microorganisms in wastewater treatment such as 5 hydroxydiclofenac chlorothiazide tramadol n oxide and clarithromycin n oxide bourgin et al 2018 for this reason a signal increase by a factor of 3 after ozonation was used to select ops from sfc hrms and rplc hrms data separately which were then subsequently compared chromatographic rt could obviously not be used to decide on the similarity of features from both data sets thus the comparison of ops detected by sfc hrms and rplc hrms was based on exact masses of molecular ions and verification by comparing the presence or absence of fragment ions the sfc only m z rt pairs were found to be 77 in positive and 42 in negative ionization modes manual correction of features was done to comply with the intensity and blank criteria i e s n 10 which resulted in many false positives and 23 sfc only ops in total the same was done for rplc only ops as well as for the common ops comparable numbers of rplc only 26 sfc only 23 and common 20 ops were found figure 1 venn diagram it is important to note that a higher number of detected peaks does not necessarily reflect a better performance of an instrument here the applied criteria on peak picking and intensity comparison were quite strict to exclude many uncertain peaks the final ops cover the whole mass range m z 100 700 but the maximum numbers of sfc only and common ops are located in m z range of 180 220 whereas the rplc only ops are mainly found in the range of m z 280 320 figure 1 these results suggested that sfc is advantageous for ops of lower molecular weight which are possibly highly polar and thus not retained during rplc separation rplc retention is not only due to hydrophobic interaction which one may describe by logd but also by van der waals interaction the van der waals interaction becomes more important when the stronger hydrophobic interaction decreases i e with decreasing or negative logd thus especially the small polar compounds are not retained by rplc four of the 20 common ops table s2 i e chlorothiazide originating from the ozonation of hydrochlorothiazide bqm from carbamazepine tramadol n oxide from tramadol and lidocaine n oxide from lidocaine were already known from the suspect screening as shown in table 1 the 9 additional ops found during suspect screening table 1 were not extracted by the non targeted data processing here likely due to their too low intensity to meet the peak picking requirement relative intensity 2 one of the common ops m h c7h5o3s m z 184 9906 table s2 was proposed to be the hydroxylated thiosalicylic acid which may originate either from thiomersal or thioindigo or related dyes no literature data was available to confirm this assumption the other 15 common ops table s2 could not be identified either due to the missing fragment ions for proposing the basic structures or no assignment of elemental composition within the selected criteria they elute in the whole rt range in rplc and sfc chromatograms with m z ranging from 146 to 567 a total of 26 ops were detected only by rplc with rt in the range of 2 4 9 5 min and m z 201 688 respectively table s3 the assigned sum formulas of these compounds allow for many different structures thus preventing their tentative identification interestingly one of the rplc only ops i e m h c13h13n3o6i3 m z 687 7953 table s3 was probably derived from the iodinated contrast agents e g iohexol one possible explanation for the non detection of these ops by sfc could be a stronger matrix effect which may have prevented the automatic extraction of these signals the sfc only ops 23 in total table 2 cover the whole sfc chromatogram 2 5 11 min and no clear trend was observed by comparing the rt and molecular mass furthermore the h c vs o c shows no significant difference within the proposed formulas of sfc only rplc only and common ops figure s1 thus the retention behaviour of compounds in sfc is a result of rather complex relationships between molecular mass formula and polarity the possible parent compounds of the sfc only ops table 2 may be found by taking into account the well known ozonation reactions such as the addition of an oxygen atom which leads to hydroxylation or n oxides schollée et al 2018 for example one possible parent compound of op 1 i e m h c11h18no2 m z 196 134 formula difference to op 1 o was present in both data sets of rplc 3 18 min and sfc 3 16 min figure s2 before ozonation and absent in ozonated wastewater its formula c11h17no2 hits total 10 243 possible molecules on chemspider https www chemspider com 07 2020 the substance with the highest reference number was 2 2 4 methylphenyl imino bisethanol 4 tolyldiethanolamine a high production volume 10 100 t year echa and environmentally persistent chemical according to the oecd criteria https echa europa eu de registration dossier registered dossier 27362 5 3 2 however the reference standard did neither fit the rt nor the fragment ions of the proposed parent of op 1 figure s3 one possible parent formula of op 22 i e m h c7h18no2 m z 148 132 formula difference to op 22 o h2 was present in wwtp effluent rt 5 14 min in sfc and 0 96 min in rplc and completely removed after ozonation figure s4 the 3 top candidates on chemspider were tert butylaminopropane 1 2 diol n propyldiethanolamine and diethanolisopropylamine however all 3 compounds are neither high production volume chemicals according to echa nor was the loss of co during fragmentation of op 22 i e fragment ion m h c6h16no2 m z 134 117 figure s4 indicative enough to support any of these structures several sfc only ops are nitrogen rich compounds including op 4 m h c4h7n5 m z 126 080 figure s5 and op 5 m h c3h6n5 m z 112 060 figure s6 with 5 nitrogen atoms they were proposed to be derived from metformin c4h11n5 lab scale ozonation of metformin was conducted in this study and confirmed that metformin is likely a precursor of op 4 and op 5 see section 3 4 op 9 m h c6h11n6o2 m z 199 094 figure s7 comprises 6 nitrogen atoms and seems to be an n oxide due to the facile loss of an o during in source fragmentation however the corresponding parent compound i e m h c6h11n6o m z 183 098 did not exist in wwtp effluent before ozonation therefore op 9 is possibly a secondary op formed from an intermediate during ozonation such as the methoxymethylmelamine derivatives similarly op 8 m h c4h7n6o figure s8 10 m h c9h17n6o2 figure s9 and 15 m h c5h11n6o figure s10 also contain 6 nitrogen atoms and might share the same origin e g methoxymethylmelamines however there are no characteristic fragment ions to verify the melamine structure for op 10 and 15 notably op 8 m h c4h7n6o m z 155 068 figure s8 is likely to be one of the transformation products of hexamethoxymethylmelamine as its fragmentation pattern is comparable to literature results alhelou et al 2019 op 8 was already present in wwtp effluent before ozonation probably formed by biotransformation but its intensity significantly increased upon ozonation in negative ionisation mode op 14 m h ch3o3s m z 94 980 figure s11 was confirmed to be methane sulfonic acid msa using analytical standard it was a prominent op significantly enhanced during ozonation however its origin remains unclear previous studies suggested that the reduced sulfur containing compounds such as dimethyl sulfide present in cooked vegetables or seafood can be oxidized to msa by ozonation devulapelli and sahle demessie 2008 furthermore msa was reported to be formed by ozonation of dimethyl sulfoxide wu et al 2007 op 16 m h c6h5o6s figure s12 and op 17 m h c6h6o6scl figure s13 might be the substituted phenyl or alkyl sulfates sulfonates based on their exact masses and molecular formulas but this could not be substantiated as the fragment ions were missing possibly due to the already too low intensity of molecular ions 3 3 behaviour of ops during post treatments the post treatment subsequent to ozonation is necessary to eliminate ops with the goal of minimizing the ecotoxicological effects of ozonated wastewater hollender et al 2009 prasse et al 2015 the removal of ops that were detected by suspect and non target screenings of ozonated wwtp effluent in this study was investigated during 3 different post treatments based on dual media filters s bac s a and s a post gac the removal efficiency for each op was evaluated based on the evolution of its peak intensity the behaviour of known ops as well as of the sfc only ops during post treatments are presented in table 1 and 2 respectively generally medium 20 70 to no removal 20 was observed for most ops during s bac and s a treatments whereas s a post gac showed far better removal 70 the treated bvs of s bac and s a here were about 60 000 see section 2 2 where the abatement of most micropollutants had already reached a steady state on these filters sauter et al 2021 this indicates that biodegradation is of limited efficacy for the ops detected in this study the s a filter was less effective in op removal than s bac which was related to the non adsorptive characteristic of anthracite sauter et al 2021 the third post treatment s a post gac refers to s a and post gac filters that were connected in series the post gac applied here was relatively fresh 13 000 bv compared to the other filters 60 000 bv thus the better performance of s a post gac than s bac and s a can be attributed to its higher remaining adsorption capacity n oxides are known to be non biodegradable merel et al 2017 schollée et al 2018 bourgin et al 2018 reported that the biological post treatments are often better for the abatement of parent compounds than their n oxides this was further confirmed by our results all known n oxides were not completely removed by s bac and s a but successfully eliminated by s a post gac with predominant adsorption table 1 and table s4 particularly the n oxides of citalopram sulpiride tramadol and tiapride were less eliminated compared to their parent compounds within s bac and s a filters the carbamazepine ops baqm and baqd were found to be the most persistent substances within all known ops in table 1 a partial removal of baqm 30 to 50 by s a post gac was observed whereas baqd appeared to remain stable or even form during all post treatments hübner et al 2014 also reported that a sand column failed to eliminate baqd although a complete abatement of baqm was achieved only 8 and 5 out of 23 sfc only ops were removed 70 removal by s bac and s a respectively table 2 and table s5 thereby 10 and 14 of the sfc only ops were classified as persistent 20 removal during s bac and s a respectively revealing that the specific biodegradation conditions in this study were not sufficient to remove all sfc only ops bac was known to perform better than sand in eliminating biodegradable organic matter reungoat et al 2011 sauter et al 2021 thus the sfc only ops persistent to s bac here are expected to remain stable during sand filtrations following the ozonation of wastewater or drinking water under comparable operating conditions the majority of sfc only ops 17 out of 23 including the methoxymetheylmelamine related ops i e op 8 9 10 and 15 were completely removed or remained to less than 30 during s a post gac the adsorption therefore can be an option for the elimination of most sfc only ops however approximately 50 of op 4 i e op of metformin and op 18 were still present even after the s a post gac treatment while another op of metformin i e op 5 the tentatively proposed phenolic and alkyl sulfates or sulfonates i e op 16 and 17 as well as op 7 appeared to persist or tend to increase during s a post gac the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions play important role in the adsorption process of activated carbon margot et al 2013 these results suggested that some sfc only ops were extremely hydrophilic or negatively charged e g in the case of op 16 which prevented their adsorption even by fresh gac 3 4 ozonation of metformin as mentioned in section 3 2 two of the sfc only ops i e op 4 and 5 table 2 were proposed to be metformin products moreover about 0 94 µg l of metformin was present in wwtp effluent in this study which was reduced to 0 57 µg l after ozonation 40 removal suggesting that metformin was degraded to ops thus lab scale ozonation was conducted to confirm the identification of metformin ops in real wastewater ozonation the antidiabetic drug metformin is one of the most prescribed pharmaceuticals worldwide with an average oral dose of 2 g per day straub et al 2019 there is no significant metabolism of metformin in human body therefore the majority is excreted as unchanged in urine and feces straub et al 2019 considerable amount of metformin up to several tens µg per l can be still present in wastewater effluent due to its high influent concentration even though a significant removal could be achieved by conventional treatments scheurer et al 2009 scheurer et al 2012 metformin is an extremely hydrophilic compound logd 5 62 at ph 7 4 and thus mobile in aquatic environment previous screening studies reported the widespread presence of metformin in surface water ground water and drinking water caldwell et al 2019 and references therein despite the frequent occurrence of metformin in the environment studies on its fate during wastewater and drinking water treatment processes are challenging due to the lack of suitable enrichment and analytical approaches for metformin as a highly polar compound scheurer et al 2009 thus sfc hrms was expected to provide a complete picture of metformin transformation pathway during ozonation ozonation of metformin was conducted in buffered pure water and samples were analyzed with sfc hrms in comparison to rplc hrms metformin was eluted in void volume of rplc rt 0 71 min table 3 but well retained in sfc rt 7 72 min table 3 metformin with its amine substituents is protonated at neutral ph pka 10 3 and 12 3 scheurer et al 2009 showing low reactivity towards ozone 1 2 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 jin et al 2012 it was partly removed 50 figure s14 by 5 mg l of ozone at ph 7 and almost completely degraded while ph was increased to 8 5 these results suggested that oh also contributed to the transformation of metformin k oh metformin 1 4 109 m 1 s 1 wols et al 2013 as alkaline ph conditions promote the formation of oh during ozonation von gunten 2003 this was further supported by additional experiments conducted in the presence of oh scavenger where 1 mol l of tert butanol reduced the removal of metformin e g by a factor of 100 at ph 8 5 by largely consuming oh in the solution figure s14 ten ops of metformin were detected by sfc hrms in positive ionization mode they were well distributed in the chromatogram with sharp gaussian peak shapes and rts ranging from 3 54 min to 8 35 min table 3 nine of these compounds were observable in the void volume of rplc hrms 0 51 0 91 min but with tailed peak shapes figure s15 as m z 126 0780 an example and overlapping so that the structure elucidation of these ops based on fragment ions in rplc hrms would not have been possible furthermore this lack of retention in rplc would likely lead to strong signal suppression in real wastewater matrix in addition one isomer of m z 142 0729 was not detected by rplc the molecular structures of ops which were tentatively identified based on their fragmentation patterns mass spectra figures s16 s26 in sfc hrms supported that the n dimethyl moiety of metformin was the main reaction site during ozonation figure 2 a a carbon centered radical is assumed to be initially formed following the electron transfer and h abstraction which either undergoes demethylation to form op 116 or intramolecular cyclization to produce op 126b subsequent demethylation can transfer op 116 to op 102 whereas op 126b can be isomerized to op 126a via intramolecular rearrangement methyl transfer the cyclization products i e op 126a and b were more abundant in total ion chromatogram than the demethylation products i e op 116 and op 102 the oh induced cyclization of metformin to op 126 isomers was studied in detail previously collin et al 2004 trouillas et al 2013 it was reported that the isomerization process methyl transfer favors high ph conditions ph 7 trouillas et al 2013 the ms ms spectra of op 126 isomers in this study exhibited m z 82 0398 and m z 84 0553 as dominant fragment ions however the isomer at rt 8 35 min had a unique fragment ion m z 99 0648 corresponding to the loss of cnh and tended to be more abundant at ph 7 in contrast the isomer at rt 3 71 min showed 4 fold higher formation yield at ph 8 5 than that at ph 7 therefore the structures of op 126 isomers at rt 8 35 and 3 71 min were assigned to be before i e op 126b and after methyl transfer i e op 126a respectively the further demethylation of op 126a could lead to the formation of op 112 five further oxidation products i e op 127 128 140 142 a and b are reported for the first time in this study among them op 128 was confirmed to be ammeline 4 6 diamino 2 hydroxy 1 3 5 triazine based on its analytical standard figure s23 importantly the sfc only ops op 4 and 5 table 2 found during non target analysis of ozonated wastewater were confirmed to be op 126a and op 112 of metformin respectively based on the similarity of their rt exact masses and fragment ions op 126a and op 112 were already present in wwtp effluent before ozonation and thus likely formed by biotransformation of metformin or other precursors during wastewater treatment nevertheless a significant increase in their intensities 4 5 fold was observed upon ozonation figure 2b it should be noted that lab scale ozonation has confirmed metformin as precursor of these ops in buffered pure water however current study cannot rule out the possibility of other precursors in complex wastewater matrix as mentioned in section 3 3 both op 126a and op 112 persisted to post treatments op 112 even appeared to increase in s bac and s a post gac revealing that it can be continuously formed during post treatment via biotransformation of op 126a in the case of s a post gac or other intermediates figure 2b another metformin product op 142b was also detected from wastewater effluent a slightly low intensity increase 1 2 fold of op 142b was observed by ozonation figure 2b a reason why it was not extracted during non targeted analysis mentioned in section 3 2 however post treatment also failed to eliminate this product but continuously elevated its intensity 4 conclusions sfc hrms and rplc hrms were applied in parallel to comparatively characterize the ops generated during pilot scale ozonation of real wwtp effluent in the ozonated wwtp effluent non target screening by sfc hrms detected a total of 23 ops that were not found by rplc hrms these ops were on average lower in molecular weight and thus difficult to retain in rplc several sfc only ops were proposed to originate from methoxymethylmelamine metformin phenolic and alkyl sulfates sulfonates in general only 20 of the sfc only ops were removed by more than 70 by subsequent dual media filters s bac and s a both 60 000 bv revealing that the majority of sfc only ops were persistent to biodegradation in these systems an additional filter employing relatively fresh gac s a post gac 13 000 bv showed far better removal efficiency due to the additional adsorption capacity nevertheless six out of 23 of the sfc only ops still escaped through s a post gac ten ops generated from metformin were detected from a lab scale experiment using sfc hrms five of which are reported for the first time three metformin ops were found in ozonated wwtp effluent and appeared to persist to all post treatments applied in this study this study shows that rplc hrms screening can overlook a certain fraction of ops generated during ozonation of municipal wwtp effluent chromatographic methods such as sfc if combined with hrms can extend our view and add considerably to the picture of ops specifically to those that appear to be biologically stable and hydrophilic and thus are not completely removed by post treatments due to their persistence and mobility these ops may eventually reach the drinking water sources after the discharge of ozonated wwtp effluent declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

17075,ozonation is an important process to further reduce the trace organic chemicals trocs in treated municipal wastewater before discharge into surface waters and is expected to form products that are more oxidized and more polar than their parent compounds many of these ozonation products ops are biodegradable and thus removed by post treatment e g aldehydes most studies on ops of trocs in wastewater rely on reversed phase liquid chromatography mass spectrometry rplc ms which is not suited for highly polar analytes in this study supercritical fluid chromatography combined with high resolution ms sfc hrms was applied in comparison to the generic rplc hrms to search for ops in ozonated wastewater treatment plant effluent at pilot scale while comparable results were obtained from these two techniques during suspect screenings for known ops a total of 23 ops were only observed by sfc hrms via non targeted screening several sfc only ops were proposed as the derivatives of methoxymethylmelamines phenolic sulfates sulfonates and metformin the latter was confirmed by laboratory scale ozonation experiments a complete ozonation pathway of metformin a widespread and extremely hydrophilic troc in aquatic environment was elaborated based on sfc hrms analysis five of the 10 metformin ops are reported for the first time in this study three different dual media filters were compared as post treatments and a combination of sand anthracite and fresh post granular activated carbon proved most effective in ops removal due to the additional adsorption capacity

evidence that some ops can be persistent during biological post treatment such as hydroxylamines and n oxides hübner et al 2015 knopp et al 2016 as a result the characterization and persistence assessment of ops during post treatment of ozonated water have received considerable attention target and suspect screening by liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms can be applied to monitor the removal of trocs and their known ops during wastewater ozonation deeb et al 2017 bourgin et al 2018 however the monitoring lists of chemicals in these approaches are very limited due to the lack of corresponding reference standards or mass spectral database schymanski et al 2014 in particular the targeted or suspect analysis of ops requires the pre selection of ops either by laboratory ozonation experiments or by in silico prediction based on ozonation mechanisms which are not available for many trocs parry and young 2016 von gunten 2018 non target screening by means of hrms can provide another possibility to comprehensively characterize a wide range of substances in complex water matrix and to prioritize the compounds of interest the high accuracy and high

important aspect to be considered is that the scope of substances captured by non target screening is limited by sample enrichment and chromatographic separation steps hollender et al 2017 particularly the analysis of highly polar compounds by generic rplc ms remains challenging because of their low retention on classical rplc stationary phases e g c18 reemtsma et al 2016 many ops

polar trocs in environmental waters using sfc ms were recently documented bieber et al 2017 schulze et al 2019 sfc was reported to be clearly superior to rplc in terms of peak shapes and retention which considerably facilitates signal detection and integration of polar substances schulze et al 2020 the aim of this study was to explore the potential of sfc hrms to characterize ops and to better understand their formation during ozonation and removal by post treatments the ozonation and post treatment of wastewater were conducted using a pilot plant located at a full scale wwtp wastewater samples were analyzed using sfc hrms in comparison to rplc hrms suspect screening for previously known ops was performed to examine the consistence of sfc hrms results with rplc hrms output ops only detectable by sfc hrms and persistent during post treatments were prioritized through non target screening and their structures and origins were tentatively proposed sfc hrms was also employed to study the transformation mechanism of metformin during laboratory lab scale ozonation and to confirm the presence of metformin ops during ozonation and subsequent post treatments of real wwtp effluent

berlin germany is designed for approx 750 000 population equivalents and receives municipal as well as industrial wastewater a detailed description on the pilot plant was published elsewhere sauter et al 2021 the pilot scale treatment of secondary effluent consists of an ozonation unit followed by three different deep bed filtration steps that are operated in parallel the ozonation unit was operated with a specific ozone dose of 0 8 mg o3 mg doc during sampling events three different filtration systems were applied as post treatments a dual media filter with sand and biological activated carbon s bac a dual media filter with sand and anthracite s a and the dual media sand anthracite filter connected to a post granular activated carbon filter s a post gac the influent and effluent of ozonation unit as well as the effluents of three post treatments were collected as 24 hour composite samples the sampling campaign took place at two different times 06 2019 and 07 2019 one month in

coagulation filtration steps by dosing fecl3 solution in filter influent 2 3 lab scale ozonation of metformin the stock solution of ozone was prepared by sparging the ice cooled ultrapure water with ozone containing oxygen which was produced using an ozone generator cmg 10 5 innovatec gerätetechnik the ozone stock solution was standardized by its uv absorption at 258 nm ε 3000 m 1 cm 1 elovitz and von gunten 1999 experiments were performed in amber glass vials at room temperature 23 2 c ozonation was initiated by spiking the pre determined volume of ozone stock solution into 10 mm phosphate buffer solution ph 7 and 8 5 containing 20 µm of metformin two different initial ozone doses 0 5 and 5 mg l were chosen to maximize the formation of the primary and secondary ops of metformin for better identification the residual ozone concentration in reaction solution was determined following the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 samples were directly analyzed using sfc hrms and rplc hrms after complete depletion of ozone approx 2 hours 2 4 sample preparation two ml of wastewater samples were filtered using syringe filters 0 45 µm rc membrane minisart rc4 sartorius and filled into 2 ml glass vials and used for direct injection to rplc hrms azeotrope evaporation was used as enrichment procedure prior to sfc hrms analysis an aliquot of 4 ml of the filtered wastewater sample was mixed with 21 ml acetonitrile a ratio for the minimum azeotrope mixture in a falcon tube this mixture was then evaporated to dryness at 40 c under a stream of nitrogen the residue was reconstituted in 200 μl acetonitrile ultrapure water 90 10 resulting in a sample to extract enrichment factor of 20 the solution was centrifuged in an eppendorf tube at 14000 min 1 for 30 min and only the supernatant was transferred to a glass vial to ensure that any precipitate was removed before injection control samples were prepared by enriching the ultrapure water under the same conditions 2 5 mass spectrometric analysis for sfc analysis a method previously developed for highly polar compounds was used schulze et al 2020 for rplc a column normally employed for polar compounds was selected with 0 1 formic acid in mobile phase a common organic modifier applied in many screening studies schymanski et al 2015 the analysis was performed on two different systems as follows rplc hrms for the reversed phase analysis an acquity ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc connected to a xevo g2 xs quadrupole time of flight qtof mass spectrometry waters eschborn germany was used the injection volume was 100 µl the uplc separation was achieved using an acquity uplc hss t3 column 100 2 1 1 7 µm at a flow rate of 0 45 ml min 1 the column temperature was set to 45 c the mobile phase consisted of a water

system to synapt gs2 qtof waters eschborn germany the chromatographic separation was performed on a beh column coupled at 55 c with flow rate of 1 5 ml min 1 and injection volume of 8 μl the a co2 and b methanol water gradient containing 10 mm ammonium formate in methanol water co solvent was applied as follows 0 0 5 min 1 b 9 12 5 min 50 b 12 6 15 min 1 b a methanol water make up flow containing 0 1 formic acid was used at 0 3 ml min 1 to transfer the column effluent into mass spectrometry samples were analysed using above instruments in positive and negative electrospray ionization modes separate runs following the same hrms parameters a lock spray containing leucine enkephalin was continuously infused during measurement the source settings include capillary voltage of 0 7 kv in positive and 2 kv in negative ionization modes source temperature at 140 c and desolvation temperature at 550 c the sampling cone voltage and source offset were set as 20 v and 50 v respectively nitrogen and argon were used as cone and collision gases respectively the desolvation gas flow was 950 l h 1 the data was recorded in sensitivity mode resolution approx 20000 as centroid data with a 0 15 s scan time over the mass range m z 50 to m z 1200 the mse acquisition was performed to simultaneously collect two data sets a low collision energy scan 4 ev to obtain parent ion information and an elevated collision energy scan 15 35 ev to get all fragment ions all samples were analysed in triplicate by a random sorting 2 6 data processing and analysis non target screening was done by evaluating the sfc hrms and rplc hrms data in retention time 1 to 10 min and mass range m z 50 to 1200 markerlynx was used to perform the peak picking for the molecular ion trace function 1 with 0 1 min deviation in retention time and 0 01 da deviation in exact mass the marker table with relative intensities to the total marker intensity was exported to excel and all further evaluations were performed there all markers that had a relative intensity 1 in control samples were excluded further reduction was done by removing the markers with 50 standard deviation in three injection replicates the remaining mass retention time m z rt pairs were further sorted to keep those with relative intensity 2 and with intensity increase by three times in ozonation effluent compared to influent these values were tested beforehand to ensure that the known ops were included in final data set and the reported m z rt pairs fulfil the signal to noise s n 10 criteria the marker tables from the same ionization modes of sfc hrms and rplc hrms measurements were grouped together and ordered according to ascending exact mass exact mass pairs were determined with a mass accuracy of 0 1 da and sorted out to a new table as common ops while the remaining m z rt pairs were treated as sfc only and rplc only ops a further manual evaluation in masslynx was performed to ensure the finally extracted ops strictly comply with the criteria stated above to be assigned as a sfc only op each peak was checked for its absence in control samples and rplc measurements for proper integration with s n ratio 10 its intensity was enhanced by at least 3 times in ozonation effluent compared to influent and it was not a fragment ion sum formulas were assigned by using a mass tolerance of 5 ppm and an elemental composition of c0 100 h0 100 n0 20 o0 20 p0 2 s0 2 i0 3 br0 3 cl0 3 and na0 2 by checking the isotopic pattern for the absence of cl and br and by taking into account the fragment ions detected by mse suspect screenings for sfc hrms and rplc hrms data were done by using unifi 3 results and discussions 3 1 suspect screenings of literature known ops a suspect screening for 70 known ops that were previously found during rplc ms analysis of ozonated wwtp effluent merel et al 2017 bourgin et al 2018 schollée et al 2018 table s1 supporting information was firstly performed using sfc hrms and rplc hrms to assess the comparability of these two techniques at least 13 of these 70 known ops were detected by both sfc hrms and rplc hrms in the ozonated wwtp effluent table 1 this low number may partially be due to the limitation in sensitivity of the employed sfc hrms following azeotropic enrichment and rplc hrms direct injection approaches compared to the analytical methods applied in literature i e solid phase extraction followed by rplc ms nine of the known ops detected in this study were n oxides table 1 interestingly n oxides behaved similarly during sfc and rplc separations by eluting later than their parent compounds with one exception of clarithromycin n oxide this supports the notion that the elution order in sfc is not simply governed by increasing polarity schulze et al 2020 notably all known ops detected by rplc hrms in this study were also detectable by sfc hrms indicating that sfc hrms could produce comparable results to the generic rplc hrms while screening the known substances 3 2 non target screenings by sfc hrms and rplc hrms non target screening was applied to wwtp effluent before and after ozonation using sfc hrms and rplc hrms to explore whether sfc hrms could provide additional information on ops of trocs one may expect that highly oxidized and consequently very polar ops may be overlooked by rplc hrms screening the comparison of m z rt pairs hereafter named features before and after ozonation was done without any attempt to identify for both setups of sfc and rplc the features present in instrumental blanks were firstly subtracted and only those picked in all three injection replicates from one sampling were used for following data processing it should be noted that ops are not necessarily new compounds that are absent before ozonation rather some ops are also formed as human metabolites or by microorganisms in wastewater treatment such as 5 hydroxydiclofenac chlorothiazide tramadol n oxide and clarithromycin n oxide bourgin et al 2018 for this reason a signal increase by a factor of 3 after ozonation was used to select ops from sfc hrms and rplc hrms data separately which were then subsequently compared chromatographic rt could obviously not be used to decide on the similarity of features from both data sets thus the comparison of ops detected by sfc hrms and rplc hrms was based on exact masses of molecular ions and verification by comparing the presence or absence of fragment ions the sfc only m z rt pairs were found to be 77 in positive and 42 in negative ionization modes manual correction of features was done to comply with the intensity and blank criteria i e s n 10 which resulted in many false positives and 23 sfc only ops in total the same was done for rplc only ops as well as for the common ops comparable numbers of rplc only 26 sfc only 23 and common 20 ops were found figure 1 venn diagram it is important to note that a higher number of detected peaks does not necessarily reflect a better performance of an instrument here the applied criteria on peak picking and intensity comparison were quite strict to exclude many uncertain peaks the final ops cover the whole mass range m z 100 700 but the maximum numbers of sfc only and common ops are located in m z range of 180 220 whereas the rplc only ops are mainly found in the range of m z 280 320 figure 1 these results suggested that sfc is advantageous for ops of lower molecular weight which are possibly highly polar and thus not retained during rplc separation rplc retention is not only due to hydrophobic interaction which one may describe by logd but also by van der waals interaction the van der waals interaction becomes more important when the stronger hydrophobic interaction decreases i e with decreasing or negative logd thus especially the small polar compounds are not retained by rplc four of the 20 common ops table s2 i e chlorothiazide originating from the ozonation of hydrochlorothiazide bqm from carbamazepine tramadol n oxide from tramadol and lidocaine n oxide from lidocaine were already known from the suspect screening as shown in table 1 the 9 additional ops found during suspect screening table 1 were not extracted by the non targeted data processing here likely due to their too low intensity to meet the peak picking requirement relative intensity 2 one of the common ops m h c7h5o3s m z 184 9906 table s2 was proposed to be the hydroxylated thiosalicylic acid which may originate either from thiomersal or thioindigo or related dyes no literature data was available to confirm this assumption the other 15 common ops table s2 could not be identified either due to the missing fragment ions for proposing the basic structures or no assignment of elemental composition within the selected criteria they elute in the whole rt range in rplc and sfc chromatograms with m z ranging from 146 to 567 a total of 26 ops were detected only by rplc with rt in the range of 2 4 9 5 min and m z 201 688 respectively table s3 the assigned sum formulas of these compounds allow for many different structures thus preventing their tentative identification interestingly one of the rplc only ops i e m h c13h13n3o6i3 m z 687 7953 table s3 was probably derived from the iodinated contrast agents e g iohexol one possible explanation for the non detection of these ops by sfc could be a stronger matrix effect which may have prevented the automatic extraction of these signals the sfc only ops 23 in total table 2 cover the whole sfc chromatogram 2 5 11 min and no clear trend was observed by comparing the rt and molecular mass furthermore the h c vs o c shows no significant difference within the proposed formulas of sfc only rplc only and common ops figure s1 thus the retention behaviour of compounds in sfc is a result of rather complex relationships between molecular mass formula and polarity the possible parent compounds of the sfc only ops table 2 may be found by taking into account the well known ozonation reactions such as the addition of an oxygen atom which leads to hydroxylation or n oxides schollée et al 2018 for example one possible parent compound of op 1 i e m h c11h18no2 m z 196 134 formula difference to op 1 o was present in both data sets of rplc 3 18 min and sfc 3 16 min figure s2 before ozonation and absent in ozonated wastewater its formula c11h17no2 hits total 10 243 possible molecules on chemspider https www chemspider com 07 2020 the substance with the highest reference number was 2 2 4 methylphenyl imino bisethanol 4 tolyldiethanolamine a high production volume 10 100 t year echa and environmentally persistent chemical according to the oecd criteria https echa europa eu de registration dossier registered dossier 27362 5 3 2 however the reference standard did neither fit the rt nor the fragment ions of the proposed parent of op 1 figure s3 one possible parent formula of op 22 i e m h c7h18no2 m z 148 132 formula difference to op 22 o h2 was present in wwtp effluent rt 5 14 min in sfc and 0 96 min in rplc and completely removed after ozonation figure s4 the 3 top candidates on chemspider were tert butylaminopropane 1 2 diol n propyldiethanolamine and diethanolisopropylamine however all 3 compounds are neither high production volume chemicals according to echa nor was the loss of co during fragmentation of op 22 i e fragment ion m h c6h16no2 m z 134 117 figure s4 indicative enough to support any of these structures several sfc only ops are nitrogen rich compounds including op 4 m h c4h7n5 m z 126 080 figure s5 and op 5 m h c3h6n5 m z 112 060 figure s6 with 5 nitrogen atoms they were proposed to be derived from metformin c4h11n5 lab scale ozonation of metformin was conducted in this study and confirmed that metformin is likely a precursor of op 4 and op 5 see section 3 4 op 9 m h c6h11n6o2 m z 199 094 figure s7 comprises 6 nitrogen atoms and seems to be an n oxide due to the facile loss of an o during in source fragmentation however the corresponding parent compound i e m h c6h11n6o m z 183 098 did not exist in wwtp effluent before ozonation therefore op 9 is possibly a secondary op formed from an intermediate during ozonation such as the methoxymethylmelamine derivatives similarly op 8 m h c4h7n6o figure s8 10 m h c9h17n6o2 figure s9 and 15 m h c5h11n6o figure s10 also contain 6 nitrogen atoms and might share the same origin e g methoxymethylmelamines however there are no characteristic fragment ions to verify the melamine structure for op 10 and 15 notably op 8 m h c4h7n6o m z 155 068 figure s8 is likely to be one of the transformation products of hexamethoxymethylmelamine as its fragmentation pattern is comparable to literature results alhelou et al 2019 op 8 was already present in wwtp effluent before ozonation probably formed by biotransformation but its intensity significantly increased upon ozonation in negative ionisation mode op 14 m h ch3o3s m z 94 980 figure s11 was confirmed to be methane sulfonic acid msa using analytical standard it was a prominent op significantly enhanced during ozonation however its origin remains unclear previous studies suggested that the reduced sulfur containing compounds such as dimethyl sulfide present in cooked vegetables or seafood can be oxidized to msa by ozonation devulapelli and sahle demessie 2008 furthermore msa was reported to be formed by ozonation of dimethyl sulfoxide wu et al 2007 op 16 m h c6h5o6s figure s12 and op 17 m h c6h6o6scl figure s13 might be the substituted phenyl or alkyl sulfates sulfonates based on their exact masses and molecular formulas but this could not be substantiated as the fragment ions were missing possibly due to the already too low intensity of molecular ions 3 3 behaviour of ops during post treatments the post treatment subsequent to ozonation is necessary to eliminate ops with the goal of minimizing the ecotoxicological effects of ozonated wastewater hollender et al 2009 prasse et al 2015 the removal of ops that were detected by suspect and non target screenings of ozonated wwtp effluent in this study was investigated during 3 different post treatments based on dual media filters s bac s a and s a post gac the removal efficiency for each op was evaluated based on the evolution of its peak intensity the behaviour of known ops as well as of the sfc only ops during post treatments are presented in table 1 and 2 respectively generally medium 20 70 to no removal 20 was observed for most ops during s bac and s a treatments whereas s a post gac showed far better removal 70 the treated bvs of s bac and s a here were about 60 000 see section 2 2 where the abatement of most micropollutants had already reached a steady state on these filters sauter et al 2021 this indicates that biodegradation is of limited efficacy for the ops detected in this study the s a filter was less effective in op removal than s bac which was related to the non adsorptive characteristic of anthracite sauter et al 2021 the third post treatment s a post gac refers to s a and post gac filters that were connected in series the post gac applied here was relatively fresh 13 000 bv compared to the other filters 60 000 bv thus the better performance of s a post gac than s bac and s a can be attributed to its higher remaining adsorption capacity n oxides are known to be non biodegradable merel et al 2017 schollée et al 2018 bourgin et al 2018 reported that the biological post treatments are often better for the abatement of parent compounds than their n oxides this was further confirmed by our results all known n oxides were not completely removed by s bac and s a but successfully eliminated by s a post gac with predominant adsorption table 1 and table s4 particularly the n oxides of citalopram sulpiride tramadol and tiapride were less eliminated compared to their parent compounds within s bac and s a filters the carbamazepine ops baqm and baqd were found to be the most persistent substances within all known ops in table 1 a partial removal of baqm 30 to 50 by s a post gac was observed whereas baqd appeared to remain stable or even form during all post treatments hübner et al 2014 also reported that a sand column failed to eliminate baqd although a complete abatement of baqm was achieved only 8 and 5 out of 23 sfc only ops were removed 70 removal by s bac and s a respectively table 2 and table s5 thereby 10 and 14 of the sfc only ops were classified as persistent 20 removal during s bac and s a respectively revealing that the specific biodegradation conditions in this study were not sufficient to remove all sfc only ops bac was known to perform better than sand in eliminating biodegradable organic matter reungoat et al 2011 sauter et al 2021 thus the sfc only ops persistent to s bac here are expected to remain stable during sand filtrations following the ozonation of wastewater or drinking water under comparable operating conditions the majority of sfc only ops 17 out of 23 including the methoxymetheylmelamine related ops i e op 8 9 10 and 15 were completely removed or remained to less than 30 during s a post gac the adsorption therefore can be an option for the elimination of most sfc only ops however approximately 50 of op 4 i e op of metformin and op 18 were still present even after the s a post gac treatment while another op of metformin i e op 5 the tentatively proposed phenolic and alkyl sulfates or sulfonates i e op 16 and 17 as well as op 7 appeared to persist or tend to increase during s a post gac the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions play important role in the adsorption process of activated carbon margot et al 2013 these results suggested that some sfc only ops were extremely hydrophilic or negatively charged e g in the case of op 16 which prevented their adsorption even by fresh gac 3 4 ozonation of metformin as mentioned in section 3 2 two of the sfc only ops i e op 4 and 5 table 2 were proposed to be metformin products moreover about 0 94 µg l of metformin was present in wwtp effluent in this study which was reduced to 0 57 µg l after ozonation 40 removal suggesting that metformin was degraded to ops thus lab scale ozonation was conducted to confirm the identification of metformin ops in real wastewater ozonation the antidiabetic drug metformin is one of the most prescribed pharmaceuticals worldwide with an average oral dose of 2 g per day straub et al 2019 there is no significant metabolism of metformin in human body therefore the majority is excreted as unchanged in urine and feces straub et al 2019 considerable amount of metformin up to several tens µg per l can be still present in wastewater effluent due to its high influent concentration even though a significant removal could be achieved by conventional treatments scheurer et al 2009 scheurer et al 2012 metformin is an extremely hydrophilic compound logd 5 62 at ph 7 4 and thus mobile in aquatic environment previous screening studies reported the widespread presence of metformin in surface water ground water and drinking water caldwell et al 2019 and references therein despite the frequent occurrence of metformin in the environment studies on its fate during wastewater and drinking water treatment processes are challenging due to the lack of suitable enrichment and analytical approaches for metformin as a highly polar compound scheurer et al 2009 thus sfc hrms was expected to provide a complete picture of metformin transformation pathway during ozonation ozonation of metformin was conducted in buffered pure water and samples were analyzed with sfc hrms in comparison to rplc hrms metformin was eluted in void volume of rplc rt 0 71 min table 3 but well retained in sfc rt 7 72 min table 3 metformin with its amine substituents is protonated at neutral ph pka 10 3 and 12 3 scheurer et al 2009 showing low reactivity towards ozone 1 2 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 jin et al 2012 it was partly removed 50 figure s14 by 5 mg l of ozone at ph 7 and almost completely degraded while ph was increased to 8 5 these results suggested that oh also contributed to the transformation of metformin k oh metformin 1 4 109 m 1 s 1 wols et al 2013 as alkaline ph conditions promote the formation of oh during ozonation von gunten 2003 this was further supported by additional experiments conducted in the presence of oh scavenger where 1 mol l of tert butanol reduced the removal of metformin e g by a factor of 100 at ph 8 5 by largely consuming oh in the solution figure s14 ten ops of metformin were detected by sfc hrms in positive ionization mode they were well distributed in the chromatogram with sharp gaussian peak shapes and rts ranging from 3 54 min to 8 35 min table 3 nine of these compounds were observable in the void volume of rplc hrms 0 51 0 91 min but with tailed peak shapes figure s15 as m z 126 0780 an example and overlapping so that the structure elucidation of these ops based on fragment ions in rplc hrms would not have been possible furthermore this lack of retention in rplc would likely lead to strong signal suppression in real wastewater matrix in addition one isomer of m z 142 0729 was not detected by rplc the molecular structures of ops which were tentatively identified based on their fragmentation patterns mass spectra figures s16 s26 in sfc hrms supported that the n dimethyl moiety of metformin was the main reaction site during ozonation figure 2 a a carbon centered radical is assumed to be initially formed following the electron transfer and h abstraction which either undergoes demethylation to form op 116 or intramolecular cyclization to produce op 126b subsequent demethylation can transfer op 116 to op 102 whereas op 126b can be isomerized to op 126a via intramolecular rearrangement methyl transfer the cyclization products i e op 126a and b were more abundant in total ion chromatogram than the demethylation products i e op 116 and op 102 the oh induced cyclization of metformin to op 126 isomers was studied in detail previously collin et al 2004 trouillas et al 2013 it was reported that the isomerization process methyl transfer favors high ph conditions ph 7 trouillas et al 2013 the ms ms spectra of op 126 isomers in this study exhibited m z 82 0398 and m z 84 0553 as dominant fragment ions however the isomer at rt 8 35 min had a unique fragment ion m z 99 0648 corresponding to the loss of cnh and tended to be more abundant at ph 7 in contrast the isomer at rt 3 71 min showed 4 fold higher formation yield at ph 8 5 than that at ph 7 therefore the structures of op 126 isomers at rt 8 35 and 3 71 min were assigned to be before i e op 126b and after methyl transfer i e op 126a respectively the further demethylation of op 126a could lead to the formation of op 112 five further oxidation products i e op 127 128 140 142 a and b are reported for the first time in this study among them op 128 was confirmed to be ammeline 4 6 diamino 2 hydroxy 1 3 5 triazine based on its analytical standard figure s23 importantly the sfc only ops op 4 and 5 table 2 found during non target analysis of ozonated wastewater were confirmed to be op 126a and op 112 of metformin respectively based on the similarity of their rt exact masses and fragment ions op 126a and op 112 were already present in wwtp effluent before ozonation and thus likely formed by biotransformation of metformin or other precursors during wastewater treatment nevertheless a significant increase in their intensities 4 5 fold was observed upon ozonation figure 2b it should be noted that lab scale ozonation has confirmed metformin as precursor of these ops in buffered pure water however current study cannot rule out the possibility of other precursors in complex wastewater matrix as mentioned in section 3 3 both op 126a and op 112 persisted to post treatments op 112 even appeared to increase in s bac and s a post gac revealing that it can be continuously formed during post treatment via biotransformation of op 126a in the case of s a post gac or other intermediates figure 2b another metformin product op 142b was also detected from wastewater effluent a slightly low intensity increase 1 2 fold of op 142b was observed by ozonation figure 2b a reason why it was not extracted during non targeted analysis mentioned in section 3 2 however post treatment also failed to eliminate this product but continuously elevated its intensity 4 conclusions sfc hrms and rplc hrms were applied in parallel to comparatively characterize the ops generated during pilot scale ozonation of real wwtp effluent in the ozonated wwtp effluent non target screening by sfc hrms detected a total of 23 ops that were not found by rplc hrms these ops were on average lower in molecular weight and thus difficult to retain in rplc several sfc only ops were proposed to originate from methoxymethylmelamine metformin phenolic and alkyl sulfates sulfonates in general only 20 of the sfc only ops were removed by more than 70 by subsequent dual media filters s bac and s a both 60 000 bv revealing that the majority of sfc only ops were persistent to biodegradation in these systems an additional filter employing relatively fresh gac s a post gac 13 000 bv showed far better removal efficiency due to the additional adsorption capacity nevertheless six out of 23 of the sfc only ops still escaped through s a post gac ten ops generated from metformin were detected from a lab scale experiment using sfc hrms five of which are reported for the first time three metformin ops were found in ozonated wwtp effluent and appeared to persist to all post treatments applied in this study this study shows that rplc hrms screening can overlook a certain fraction of ops generated during ozonation of municipal wwtp effluent chromatographic methods such as sfc if combined with hrms can extend our view and add considerably to the picture of ops specifically to those that appear to be biologically stable and hydrophilic and thus are not completely removed by post treatments due to their persistence and mobility these ops may eventually reach the drinking water sources after the discharge of ozonated wwtp effluent declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

17076,the production of disposable plastic face masks dpfs in china alone has reached to approximately 200 million a day in a global effort to tackle the spread of the new sars cov 2 virus however improper and unregulated disposals of these dpfs has been and will continue to intensify the plastic pollution problem we are already facing this study focuses on the emission of pollutants from 7 dpf brands that were submerged in water to simulate environmental conditions if these dpfs were littered the dpf leachates were filtered by inorganic membranes and both particle deposited organic membranes and the filtrates were characterized using techniques such as ftir sem edx light microscopy icp ms and lc ms micro and nano scale polymeric fibres particles siliceous fragments and leachable inorganic and organic chemicals were observed from all of the tested dpfs traces of concerning heavy metals i e lead up to 6 79 µg l were detected in association with silicon containing fragments icp ms also confirmed the presence of other leachable metals like cadmium up to 1 92 µg l antimony up to 393 µg l and copper up to 4 17 µg l lc ms analysis identified polar leachable organic species related to plastic additives and contaminants polyamide 66 monomer and oligomers nylon 66 synthesis surfactant molecules dye like molecules and polyethylene glycol were all tentatively identified in the leachate the toxicity of some of the chemicals found and the postulated risks of the rest of the present particles and molecules raises the question of whether dpfs are safe to be used on a daily basis and what consequences are to be expected after their disposal into the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction the sars cov 2 pandemic has caused an unprecedented rise of face mask wearing in order to mitigate the spread of this airborne viral disease wilson et al 2020 as recommended by the world health organisation who adyel 2020 aragaw 2020 fadare and okoffo 2020 this has seen an increase in mass production of face coverings to keep up with global demand the who has estimated an additional 89 million disposable plastic face masks dpfs are required a month in order to protect health care workers alone aragaw 2020 fadare and okoffo 2020 presently china is the main manufacturer and distributer of dpfs with an estimated production of 200 million dpfs per day aragaw 2020 with up to a 1 billion dpfs being used globally on a monthly basis adyel 2020 this has seen a notable increase in dpf and clinical waste irresponsibly discarded and disposed at landfill sites with a large proportion inevitably ending up in the water course and the ocean fadare and okoffo 2020 the rise in dpfs waste is regarded as a new cause of pollution directly linked covid 19 pandemic however there is still very little data on the effect of the pollution caused by dpfs on the wider environment adyel 2020 most dpfs are made entirely from plastic fibres aragaw 2020 jung et al 2021 containing high percentages of polypropylene pp and polyethylene pe and other polymeric materials such as nylon and polystyrene aragaw 2020 fadare and okoffo 2020 jung et al 2021 with novelty face masks often coloured with dyes for customer appeal the manufacturing of dpfs often involves electrospinning micro and nanofibres of plastic into three layers aragaw 2020 fadare and okoffo 2020 in some manufacturing processes silica nano particles maybe added as filler to enhance plastic properties such increasing mechanical strength and toughness of the material wu et al 2005 there is a growing concern around the environmental fate of dpfs and whether they emit pollutants such as microscopic polymeric fibres aragaw 2020 fadare and okoffo 2020 micro crystalline silica and other secondary pollutants such as leachable chemicals dyes surfactants and glues there is little information on the environment impacts of these pollutants and whether they may enter the food chain many of these chemical dyes are associated with heavy inorganic metals sungur and gülmez 2015 and are known to have an adverse impact on the environmental and potentially human health metals such as antinomy sb copper cu and chromium cr are used as catalysts in dye manufacture and sometime residues are found in textiles materials as plastic additives hahladakis et al 2018 sungur and gülmez 2015 some reactive dyes also form complexes with heavy metals such as nickel ni cu and cr these chemicals may be associated with particles that can be transmitted from the face masks and enter the respiratory track via inhalation or absorbed through skin contact these chemicals may dissolve in moisture droplets of sweat and saliva which may act as a medium for transport into the body there are known hazards associated with these chemicals especially heavy metals ranging from mild allergic reactions often from limited exposure to more serious health issues from repeated exposure such as renal disease emphysema cancer and often may be harmful to unborn children in pregnancy sungur and gülmez 2015 tchounwou et al 2012 dye compounds themselves pose risk to environmental and public health lellis et al 2019 as many of them are water soluble organic molecules and leachable they can therefore enter the water course and food chain most dyes are also chromophores competing for light in the environment and reducing the photosynthesis of aquatic plants and thus disrupting the ecosystem lellis et al 2019 due to the polarity of these molecules they are often difficult to remove by conventional water treatment methods ending up in drinking water lellis et al 2019 most of these compounds have carcinogenic and mutagenic properties as they are generally highly aromatic furthermore these dye molecules have the ability to enter cells and intercalate with the cell s dna disrupting transcription processes of the cell lellis et al 2019 most dye compounds are deemed as persistent organic pollutants and have the potential to bioaccumulate in many species including humans lellis et al 2019 not only chemical species but also the release of submicron particles from dpfs are cause of concerns recent studies of micro plastic mps 5 mm and nano plastics np 1 µm bianco and passananti 2020 paul et al 2020 toussaint et al 2019 which included polymeric fibres showed that they have detrimental effects in animal models mps and nps exhibit cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in terrestrial including humans and aquatic organisms bouwmeester et al 2015 in recent articles researchers have shown that some mps and nps can be adsorbed by the gut and then passed through the blood brain barrier kögel et al 2020 lusher et al 2017 resulting in neurotoxic damage prüst et al 2020 these particles often produce cellular damage by causing increased oxidative stress as the particles are recognised by the organism as being foreign bhagat et al 2020 prüst et al 2020 in one report fibres were found to embed themselves easier in tissues rather than spherical particles the result of which caused increased superoxide dismutase levels in gut tissue of zebra fish an indication of oxidative stress and inflammation bhagat et al 2020 further to this there is also evidence to suggest that nps may be small enough to penetrate the cell wall releasing persistent organic pollutants into tissues bhagat et al 2020 bouwmeester et al 2015 or they can be activated np particles containing reactive sites on chain ends which can inflict dna damage these effects can cause cell death genotoxicity or cancer formation additional to this there is a potential human health concern around the presence of micro silica particles simp between 1 and 10 µm and nano silica particles sinp 1 µm which is often used in manufacturing process of plastics masuki et al 2020 murugadoss et al 2017 there is strong evidence to support the human health implications of crystalline and amorphous silica if inhaled this silica nano particles can cause lung irritation and silicosis fibrosis of the lung which can develop into emphysema and lung cancer lin et al 2006 masuki et al 2020 murugadoss et al 2017 simp and sinp cause cell damage through oxidative stress that leads to dna damage genotoxicity and cell death murugadoss et al 2017 simp and sinp toxicity is also evident in other tissues causing cancers in blood and bone tissue and causing neurotoxicity in brain tissues masuki et al 2020 murugadoss et al 2017 you et al 2018 however simp and sinp have lower environmental impact with mild toxic effects seen in aquatic organisms and terrestrial animals if ingested fruijtier pölloth 2012 nevertheless the presence of these particles in dpfs water leachates may be indicative of the ease of their discharge this could raise further concerns regarding their potential release when wearing face coverings could they be easily inhaled the aim of this investigation is to identify the environmental impact of dpfs when disposed improperly via formalizing a workflow procedure to characterize various pollutants emitted leached from dpfs song et al 2015 sullivan et al 2020 during simulated environmental conditions face mask gently agitated in deionised water 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and instrumentation the following lists the consumables and instrumentation used in the present investigation dpfs

5 µm x 2 1 mm x 150 mm and guard column xbridge c18 3 5 µm x 2 1 mm x 10 mm was used 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 leaching and filtration of particles for particle analysis 10 face masks for each batch were submerged in 1 5 l deionised water for 4 h and gently agitated by stirring every hour to ensure complete coverage and contact of dpfs with water post submersion the eluent leachate was then filtered under vacuum through a 0 1 µm al2o3 membrane filter once complete the membranes were then transferred to glass petri dishes for drying in a drying cabinet for 2 h at 50 c procedural blanks were also run with each batch this involved filtering 1 5 l of deionised water only through the membranes and then drying for 2 h at 50 c the filtration process was carried out using a glass vacuum filtration funnel and receiving flask with samples drawn through under negative pressure sullivan et al 2020 2 2 2 microscopy light microscopy of the membranes was used to determine coverage of particle

down using the gage with a force of 30 arbitrary units scan was between 650 and 4000 cm3 with 4 accumulations per second to get an average spectrum 2 2 4 icp ms elemental analysis selected dpfs were placed in 250 ml deionised water and left submerged for 24 h typical of leachate analysis in environmental laboratories the leachate was then subsampled and acidified using 1 ml of 1 m nitric acid and run on perkin elmer icp ms nexion 2000 a standard procedure for elemental analysis a procedural blank deionised water passed through membrane and reagent blank deionised water only was run with samples to check for background interference blanks were run after highest calibration and after every sample to check for carryover multielement calibration standards representing all the analytes in the sample were made up from perkinelmer pure single and multielement standards and diluted into 10 hno3 calibration range of 1 µg l to 100 µg l was preformed and standard curve required regression statistics above 0 9990 to be deemed acceptable samples exceeding 100 µg l were diluted accordingly to bring into dynamic range quality control samples prepared from separate batch of multielement standards and prepared at 50 of calibration range acceptance criteria for accuracy and precision was deemed acceptable below 15 instrument parameters as follows plasma gas flow set at 18 l minute of argon auxiliary gas flow set at 1 8 l minute and nebuliser flow rate of set at 0 98 l minute sample uptake was set at 300 µl minute with 3 replicates per sample the rf voltage was applied at 1600 w as determined by method optimization during method development hineman and purcell joiner 2010 2 2 5 lc uv and lc ms accurate mass of leachate a subsample of the leachate described in 2 1 4 was analysed

blanks lc grade water and procedural blanks deionised water used in sample preparation were run before and after sample runs to check the background ions and potential carryover a coumarin standard

procedural blanks were also run prior and post sample analysis to establish background of the system 3 results and discussion 3 1 face mask and filtrate characterization microscopy and ftir analysis 9 separate batches of dpfs from 7 brands fig 1 were tested for their leaching potential of dispersive pollutants in water the membranes from the filtration process were then subjected to microscopy sem edx and light microscopy and ftir for characterization light microscopy was used for an initial indication of particle contamination fig 2 all 9 batches of dpfs face mask 1 to 7c emitted fibres believed to be pp and angular fragments that seemed to have crystalline appearance suspected to be of siliceous composition it appears that novelty children face mask 4 and novelty festive face masks 7a c have significant fiber and particle contaminations light microscopy images of 7 a c show many different coloured fibres suggesting that some are stained with a dying agent and looks as though the membrane filters are also slightly tarnished this is true for face mask 2 although in less abundance than 4 7 a c the fibres are predominantly black in line with appearance of original face mask face masks 1 3 5 and 6 appear to generate lower number of fibres in comparison with 4 7a c and generate a mixture of clear and blue fibres similar appearance of the original face masks ftir analysis of the physical face masks confirms the manufacture of these masks are primarily out of pp with some additional functionalisation seen of in the novelty face masks 4 7 a b c particularly on coloured sides the white side presented spectrum indicative of pp absorbance peaks 2950 cm 1 2917 cm 1are asymmetrical stretching of ch3 and ch2 respectively 2838 cm 1 stretching ch3 1457 cm 1 and 1375 cm 1 are symmetrical stretching of ch3 the coloured side showed primarily an absorption band at 1712 cm 1 indicative of carboxylic acid or ketone functional see table 2 this could possibly arise from the side group of an acidic dye compound polyamide used in synthesis of nylon 66 and sometimes found in oxidised pp charles et al 2009 coates 2006 jung et al 2018 for plain face masks both blue and white side possessed peaks indicative of pp for the membrane supports post filtration ftir was performed on all 9 batches absorbance spectrum in line with main peaks of pp were identified on membrane supports from face mask 2 3 and 7 a b c further supporting that membrane fibres derived from masks are pp in composition for some face masks less fibrous material was likely transferred to the support i e face masks 1 5 and 6 were plain typical medical type face masks as the detection of pp peaks where below the capabilities of the atr ftir additional peaks were identified in novelty face masks coloured side 4 7 a b c peaks 1711 cm 1 carboxylic acid stretching 1242 cm 1 oxirane or sulfonic acid group and 1095 cm 1 secondary alcohol stretch bartošová et al 2017 coates 2006 they were also often seen as the primary peaks on the membranes post filtration and are often common groups in dyes such as eriochrome black and congo red bartošová et al 2017 these membranes were often tarnished suggesting that these peaks are more than likely derived from the inks or dyes used in the printing of the novelty graphics more in depth analysis of the membrane filters was preformed using sem edx it was confirmed that particle sized trapped on the support can be classified in micro particle 1 mm and nano submicron particle size 0 1 1 µm range with all face masks emitting significant amount of grain sized particles measured between 360 nm 500 µm on sem fig 3 but likely to be even finer limited by resolution of tm3000 fibrous particles appeared to be in greater size range often ranging from as little as 25 µm to several millimetres 2 5 mm fibres were found to be emitted from all face masks in this study masks 1 7c further to this edx analysis using back scattered electrons suggested the elemental composition of particles it was noted that fibrous particles had high percentage of carbon most likely derived from polypropylene spun fibres the majority of the grains contained high percentages of si and oxygen and likely to be compositions of silica fig 4 however some grains analysed thought to be silica were often high in carbon and likely even finer fragments of plastics fig 4 additional to this there was often presence of heavy metals associated with these particles especially in the novelty face masks such as masks 2 4 7a b c some heavy metals were located on grain particles as seen in masks child s novelty face mask 4 shown in fig 5 and the festive face masks 7 a b c and likely additives used in plastic manufacture heavy metals associated fibres are common chemical additives added during plastic manufacture such as pb cd sb and cu hahladakis et al 2018 3 2 leachable metals and organic compounds icp ms and lc ms analysis it was apparent from edx analysis that heavy metals were associated mainly with coloured novelty face masks it was therefore decided to analyze the coloured masks face masks 2 4 7a b c for heavy metal and organic compound leaching suspected organic dyes for comparative studies a blank control using deionised water was run same used in the leaching procedure along with two plain standard face masks type i and ii mask 5 6 to see if there was significance from novelty and plain face masks in total 8 dpfs were selected and placed in 250 ml deionised water and left submerged for 24 h a procedural blank deionised water taken through procedure and reagent blank deionised only was also sampled to ascertain the quality of the background interference derived from the deioniser and glassware a subsample of the leachate was analysed on icp ms and lc ms using parameters mentioned in section 2 1 4 for icp ms analysis of samples a full external calibration was preformed to determine analyte concentration and reagent and procedural blanks were used prior and post analysis of samples to assess potential carry over all qc determinants for cd co cu pb sb and ti passed acceptance criteria and blank samples possessing concentration values below the

typical contaminates associated with membrane filters and is often seen in lcms as multiple species on the chromatogram however due to limited peg speciation in the leachate samples and peg was not

optimization further exploratory tests are required for more accurate identification of components emitted from dpfs such as gcms for volatiles analysis lcms ms and nmr for structural elucidation of unknowns but it is striking from preliminary data that these face masks are emitting organic compounds that may have adverse environmental fate and possibly have bioaccumulation properties hahladakis et al 2018 4 conclusion there is a concerning amount of evidence that suggests that dpfs waste can potentially have a substantial environmental impact by releasing pollutants simply by exposing them to water dpfs release small physical pollutants such as micro and nano size particles mainly consistent with plastic fibres and silicate grains which are well documented to have adverse effects on the environment and public health in addition to the physical particles harmful chemicals such as heavy metals pb cd and sb and organic pollutants are also readily released from the dpfs when submerged in water many of these toxic pollutants have bio accumulative properties when released into the environment and this research shows that dpfs could be one of the main sources of these environmental contaminants during and after the covid 19 pandemic it is therefore imperative that stricter regulations need to be enforced during manufacturing and disposal recycling of dpfs to minimize the environmental impact of dpfs secondary to environmental concerns there is a need to understand the impact of such particle leaching on public health as all dpfs released micro nano particles and heavy metals to the water during our investigation one of the main concerns with these particles is that they were easily detached from face masks and leached into the water with no agitation which suggests that these particles are mechanically unstable and readily available to be detached therefore a full investigation is necessary to determine the quantities and potential impacts of these particles

17076,the production of disposable plastic face masks dpfs in china alone has reached to approximately 200 million a day in a global effort to tackle the spread of the new sars cov 2 virus however improper and unregulated disposals of these dpfs has been and will continue to intensify the plastic pollution problem we are already facing this study focuses on the emission of pollutants from 7 dpf brands that were submerged in water to simulate environmental conditions if these dpfs were littered the dpf leachates were filtered by inorganic membranes and both particle deposited organic membranes and the filtrates were characterized using techniques such as ftir sem edx light microscopy icp ms and lc ms micro and nano scale polymeric fibres particles siliceous fragments and leachable inorganic and organic chemicals were observed from all of the tested dpfs traces of concerning heavy metals i e lead up to 6 79 µg l were detected in association with silicon containing fragments icp ms also confirmed the presence of other leachable metals like cadmium up to 1 92 µg l antimony up to 393 µg l and copper up to 4 17 µg l lc ms analysis identified polar leachable organic species related to plastic additives and contaminants polyamide 66 monomer and oligomers nylon 66 synthesis surfactant molecules dye like molecules and polyethylene glycol were all tentatively identified in the leachate the toxicity of some of the chemicals found and the postulated risks of the rest of the present particles and molecules raises the question of whether dpfs are safe to be used on a daily basis and what consequences are to be expected after their disposal into the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction the sars cov 2 pandemic has caused an unprecedented rise of face mask wearing in order to mitigate the spread of this airborne viral disease wilson et al 2020 as recommended by the world health organisation who adyel 2020 aragaw 2020 fadare and okoffo 2020 this has seen an increase in mass production of face coverings to keep up with global demand the who has estimated an additional 89 million disposable plastic face masks dpfs are required a month in order to protect health care workers alone aragaw 2020 fadare and okoffo 2020 presently china is the main manufacturer and distributer of dpfs with an estimated production of 200 million dpfs per day aragaw 2020 with up to a 1 billion dpfs being used globally on a monthly basis adyel 2020 this has seen a notable increase in dpf and clinical waste irresponsibly discarded and disposed at landfill sites with a large proportion inevitably ending up in the water course and the ocean fadare and okoffo 2020 the rise in dpfs waste is regarded as a new cause of pollution directly linked covid 19 pandemic however there is still very little data on the effect of the pollution caused by dpfs on the wider environment adyel 2020 most dpfs are made entirely from plastic fibres aragaw 2020 jung et al 2021 containing high percentages of polypropylene pp and polyethylene pe and other polymeric materials such as nylon and polystyrene aragaw 2020 fadare and okoffo 2020 jung et al 2021 with novelty face masks often coloured with dyes for customer appeal the manufacturing of dpfs often involves electrospinning micro and nanofibres of plastic into three layers aragaw 2020 fadare and okoffo 2020 in some manufacturing processes silica nano particles maybe added as filler to enhance plastic properties such increasing mechanical strength and toughness of the material wu et al 2005 there is a growing concern around the environmental fate of dpfs and whether they emit pollutants such as microscopic polymeric fibres aragaw 2020 fadare and okoffo 2020 micro crystalline silica and other secondary pollutants such as leachable chemicals dyes surfactants and glues there is little information on the environment impacts of these pollutants and whether they may enter the food chain many of these chemical dyes are associated with heavy inorganic metals sungur and gülmez 2015 and are known to have an adverse impact on the environmental and potentially human health metals such as antinomy sb copper cu and chromium cr are used as catalysts in dye manufacture and sometime residues are found in textiles materials as plastic additives hahladakis et al 2018 sungur and gülmez 2015 some reactive dyes also form complexes with heavy metals such as nickel ni cu and cr these chemicals may be associated with particles that can be transmitted from the face masks and enter the respiratory track via inhalation or absorbed through skin contact these chemicals may dissolve in moisture droplets of sweat and saliva which may act as a medium for transport into the body there are known hazards associated with these chemicals especially heavy metals ranging from mild allergic reactions often from limited exposure to more serious health issues from repeated exposure such as renal disease emphysema cancer and often may be harmful to unborn children in pregnancy sungur and gülmez 2015 tchounwou et al 2012 dye compounds themselves pose risk to environmental and public health lellis et al 2019 as many of them are water soluble organic molecules and leachable they can therefore enter the water course and food chain most dyes are also chromophores competing for light in the environment and reducing the photosynthesis of aquatic plants and thus disrupting the ecosystem lellis et al 2019 due to the polarity of these molecules they are often difficult to remove by conventional water treatment methods ending up in drinking water lellis et al 2019 most of these compounds have carcinogenic and mutagenic properties as they are generally highly aromatic furthermore these dye molecules have the ability to enter cells and intercalate with the cell s dna disrupting transcription processes of the cell lellis et al 2019 most dye compounds are deemed as persistent organic pollutants and have the potential to bioaccumulate in many species including humans lellis et al 2019 not only chemical species but also the release of submicron particles from dpfs are cause of concerns recent studies of micro plastic mps 5 mm and nano plastics np 1 µm bianco and passananti 2020 paul et al 2020 toussaint et al 2019 which included polymeric fibres showed that they have detrimental effects in animal models mps and nps exhibit cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in terrestrial including humans and aquatic organisms bouwmeester et al 2015 in recent articles researchers have shown that some mps and nps can be adsorbed by the gut and then passed through the blood brain barrier kögel et al 2020 lusher et al 2017 resulting in neurotoxic damage prüst et al 2020 these particles often produce cellular damage by causing increased oxidative stress as the particles are recognised by the organism as being foreign bhagat et al 2020 prüst et al 2020 in one report fibres were found to embed themselves easier in tissues rather than spherical particles the result of which caused increased superoxide dismutase levels in gut tissue of zebra fish an indication of oxidative stress and inflammation bhagat et al 2020 further to this there is also evidence to suggest that nps may be small enough to penetrate the cell wall releasing persistent organic pollutants into tissues bhagat et al 2020 bouwmeester et al 2015 or they can be activated np particles containing reactive sites on chain ends which can inflict dna damage these effects can cause cell death genotoxicity or cancer formation additional to this there is a potential human health concern around the presence of micro silica particles simp between 1 and 10 µm and nano silica particles sinp 1 µm which is often used in manufacturing process of plastics masuki et al 2020 murugadoss et al 2017 there is strong evidence to support the human health implications of crystalline and amorphous silica if inhaled this silica nano particles can cause lung irritation and silicosis fibrosis of the lung which can develop into emphysema and lung cancer lin et al 2006 masuki et al 2020 murugadoss et al 2017 simp and sinp cause cell damage through oxidative stress that leads to dna damage genotoxicity and cell death murugadoss et al 2017 simp and sinp toxicity is also evident in other tissues causing cancers in blood and bone tissue and causing neurotoxicity in brain tissues masuki et al 2020 murugadoss et al 2017 you et al 2018 however simp and sinp have lower environmental impact with mild toxic effects seen in aquatic organisms and terrestrial animals if ingested fruijtier pölloth 2012 nevertheless the presence of these particles in dpfs water leachates may be indicative of the ease of their discharge this could raise further concerns regarding their potential release when wearing face coverings could they be easily inhaled the aim of this investigation is to identify the environmental impact of dpfs when disposed improperly via formalizing a workflow procedure to characterize various pollutants emitted leached from dpfs song et al 2015 sullivan et al 2020 during simulated environmental conditions face mask gently agitated in deionised water 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and instrumentation the following lists the consumables and instrumentation used in the present investigation dpfs

5 µm x 2 1 mm x 150 mm and guard column xbridge c18 3 5 µm x 2 1 mm x 10 mm was used 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 leaching and filtration of particles for particle analysis 10 face masks for each batch were submerged in 1 5 l deionised water for 4 h and gently agitated by stirring every hour to ensure complete coverage and contact of dpfs with water post submersion the eluent leachate was then filtered under vacuum through a 0 1 µm al2o3 membrane filter once complete the membranes were then transferred to glass petri dishes for drying in a drying cabinet for 2 h at 50 c procedural blanks were also run with each batch this involved filtering 1 5 l of deionised water only through the membranes and then drying for 2 h at 50 c the filtration process was carried out using a glass vacuum filtration funnel and receiving flask with samples drawn through under negative pressure sullivan et al 2020 2 2 2 microscopy light microscopy of the membranes was used to determine coverage of particle

down using the gage with a force of 30 arbitrary units scan was between 650 and 4000 cm3 with 4 accumulations per second to get an average spectrum 2 2 4 icp ms elemental analysis selected dpfs were placed in 250 ml deionised water and left submerged for 24 h typical of leachate analysis in environmental laboratories the leachate was then subsampled and acidified using 1 ml of 1 m nitric acid and run on perkin elmer icp ms nexion 2000 a standard procedure for elemental analysis a procedural blank deionised water passed through membrane and reagent blank deionised water only was run with samples to check for background interference blanks were run after highest calibration and after every sample to check for carryover multielement calibration standards representing all the analytes in the sample were made up from perkinelmer pure single and multielement standards and diluted into 10 hno3 calibration range of 1 µg l to 100 µg l was preformed and standard curve required regression statistics above 0 9990 to be deemed acceptable samples exceeding 100 µg l were diluted accordingly to bring into dynamic range quality control samples prepared from separate batch of multielement standards and prepared at 50 of calibration range acceptance criteria for accuracy and precision was deemed acceptable below 15 instrument parameters as follows plasma gas flow set at 18 l minute of argon auxiliary gas flow set at 1 8 l minute and nebuliser flow rate of set at 0 98 l minute sample uptake was set at 300 µl minute with 3 replicates per sample the rf voltage was applied at 1600 w as determined by method optimization during method development hineman and purcell joiner 2010 2 2 5 lc uv and lc ms accurate mass of leachate a subsample of the leachate described in 2 1 4 was analysed for polar organic compounds by direct injection 5 µl on lc uv for initial sample contamination screening and lc ms for compound identification lc uv was run using agilent 1100 and a dionex ultimate 3000 for lcms a waters xbridge c18 column 3 5 µm x 2 1 mm x 150 mm and guard column xbridge c18 3 5 µm x 2 1 mm x 10 mm was used for analyte separation for both systems and used a flow rate 200 µl min

procedural blanks were also run prior and post sample analysis to establish background of the system 3 results and discussion 3 1 face mask and filtrate characterization microscopy and ftir analysis 9 separate batches of dpfs from 7 brands fig 1 were tested for their leaching potential of dispersive pollutants in water the membranes from the filtration process were then subjected to microscopy sem edx and light microscopy and ftir for characterization light microscopy was used for an initial indication of particle contamination fig 2 all 9 batches of dpfs face mask 1 to 7c emitted fibres believed to be pp and angular fragments that seemed to have crystalline appearance suspected to be of siliceous composition it appears that novelty children face mask 4 and novelty festive face masks 7a c have significant fiber and particle contaminations light microscopy images of 7 a c show many different coloured fibres suggesting that some are stained with a dying agent and looks as though the membrane filters are also slightly tarnished this is true for face mask 2 although in less abundance than 4 7 a c the fibres are predominantly black in line with appearance of original face mask face masks 1 3 5 and 6 appear to generate lower number of fibres in comparison with 4 7a c and generate a mixture of clear and blue fibres similar appearance of the original face masks ftir analysis of the physical face masks confirms the manufacture of these masks are primarily out of pp with some additional functionalisation seen of in the novelty face masks 4 7 a b c particularly on coloured sides the white side presented spectrum indicative of pp absorbance peaks 2950 cm 1 2917 cm 1are asymmetrical stretching of ch3 and ch2 respectively 2838 cm 1 stretching ch3 1457 cm 1 and 1375 cm 1 are symmetrical stretching of ch3 the coloured side showed primarily an absorption band at 1712 cm 1 indicative of carboxylic acid or ketone functional see table 2 this could possibly arise from the side group of an acidic dye compound polyamide used in synthesis of nylon 66 and sometimes found in oxidised pp charles et al 2009 coates 2006 jung et al 2018 for plain face masks both blue and white side possessed peaks indicative of pp for the membrane supports post filtration ftir was performed on all 9 batches absorbance spectrum in line with main peaks of pp were identified on membrane supports from face mask 2 3 and 7 a b c further supporting that membrane fibres derived from masks are pp in composition for some face masks less fibrous material was likely transferred to the support i e face masks 1 5 and 6 were plain typical medical type face masks as the detection of pp peaks where below the capabilities of the atr ftir additional peaks were identified in novelty face masks coloured side 4 7 a b c peaks 1711 cm 1 carboxylic acid stretching 1242 cm 1 oxirane or sulfonic acid group and 1095 cm 1 secondary alcohol stretch bartošová et al 2017 coates 2006 they were also often seen as the primary peaks on the membranes post filtration and are often common groups in dyes such as eriochrome black and congo red bartošová et al 2017 these membranes were often tarnished suggesting that these peaks are more than likely derived from the inks or dyes used in the printing of the novelty graphics more in depth analysis of the membrane filters was preformed using sem edx it was confirmed that particle sized trapped on the support can be classified in micro particle 1 mm and nano submicron particle size 0 1 1 µm range with all face masks emitting significant amount of grain sized particles measured between 360 nm 500 µm on sem fig 3 but likely to be even finer limited by resolution of tm3000 fibrous particles appeared to be in greater size range often ranging from as little as 25 µm to several millimetres 2 5 mm fibres were found to be emitted from all face masks in this study masks 1 7c further to this edx analysis using back scattered electrons suggested the elemental composition of particles it was noted that fibrous particles had high percentage of carbon most likely derived from polypropylene spun fibres the majority of the grains contained high percentages of si and oxygen and likely to be compositions of silica fig 4 however some grains analysed thought to be silica were often high in carbon and likely even finer fragments of plastics fig 4 additional to this there was often presence of heavy metals associated with these particles especially in the novelty face masks such as masks 2 4 7a b c some heavy metals were located on grain particles as seen in masks child s novelty face mask 4 shown in fig 5 and the festive face masks 7 a b c and likely additives used in plastic manufacture heavy metals associated fibres are common chemical additives added during plastic manufacture such as pb cd sb and cu hahladakis et al 2018 3 2 leachable metals and organic compounds icp ms and lc ms analysis it was apparent from edx analysis that heavy metals were associated mainly with coloured novelty face masks it was therefore decided to analyze the coloured masks face masks 2 4 7a b c for heavy metal and organic compound leaching suspected organic dyes for comparative studies a blank control using deionised water was run same used in the leaching procedure along with two plain standard face masks type i and ii mask 5 6 to see if there was significance from novelty and plain face masks in total 8 dpfs were selected and placed in 250 ml deionised water and left submerged for 24 h a procedural blank deionised water taken through procedure and reagent blank deionised only was also sampled to ascertain the quality of the background interference derived from the deioniser and glassware a subsample of the leachate was analysed on icp ms and lc ms using parameters mentioned in section 2 1 4 for icp ms analysis of samples a full external calibration was preformed to determine analyte concentration and reagent and procedural blanks were used prior and post analysis of samples to assess potential carry over all qc determinants for cd co cu pb sb and ti passed acceptance criteria and blank samples possessing concentration values below the analytical detection limits see supportive evidence table 3 shows the leachable heavy metals from the dpfs determined by icp ms analysis of the sub sampled water with concerning levels of sb released from festive novelty face masks 7a b c and ranging from 111 393 µg l additional to this all face masks appeared to release cu with levels ranging from 0 85 µg l mask 5 to highest levels of 4 17 µg l

detrimental to foetal development freedman et al 1990 gundacker and hengstschläger 2012 tchounwou et al 2012 looking at the wider picture the vast amount of dpfs generated due to the covid 19 pandemic could easily see the cumulative release of these elements breaching current guideline limits in addition to this there is a potential worry for the face mask wearers who are potentially being exposed

17077,it is necessary to develop sustainable technologies for centrate wastewater cw and biogas treatment from sludge anaerobic digestion ad systems in an environmentally friendly and economical manner the microalgae based bioremediation approach presents a competitive alternative due to its capacity for nutrient recovery and carbon sequestration however process instabilities and operating challenges limit its development and implementation largely due to the complexities in the cw and biogas in this study the evolved native microalgal consortium enmc was firstly developed using the gradual stress increase method to enhance their adaptation in high ammonium condition the supplementation of local snow with ca2 and mg2 and biogas into cw significantly enhanced enmc growth through batch tests subsequently an integrated enmc snow enmcs system was proposed consisting of a hydrolysis acidification reactor har biogas upgrade reactor and photobioreactor pbr the enmcs system was systematically investigated under both batch and semi continuous operations by adjusting primary process parameters including the fill ratio feeding time hydraulic retention time hrt wastewater pretreatment and pbr type it was eventually optimized as a 24 h 70 fermented cw diluted with 30 snow water semi continuous feeding system with a fill ratio of 50 and hrt of 6 d in an open pbr long term operation 310 days showed superior biomass yield 0 3059 0 0039 g l d and nutrient removal efficiencies 95 6 0 13 and 90 8 0 44 for nh4 n and po4 3 p removal meanwhile biogas was upgraded with an 82 2 co2 reduction the economic and environmental analysis further demonstrated the enmcs system as an effective alternative for the bioremediation of ad effluents while simultaneously producing value added biomass especially applicable to snowy regions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords centrate wastewater microalgal consortium biogas gradual stress increase snow 1 introduction nowadays in wastewater treatment plants wwtps there is an increasing paradigm shift from pollutant removal to resource and energy recovery when treating wastewater and biosolids i e sewage sludge anaerobic digestion ad has been implemented as a promising sustainable way for sludge reduction but with its generation of centrate wastewater cw which contains large amounts of nutrient and organics further polishing is required lackner et al 2014 qiu et al 2021 moreover the gaseous effluent from ad systems namely biogas 40 75 ch4 25 55 co2 and 0 2 o2 kadam and panwar 2017 needs to be upgraded to enhance biomethane content while reduce co2 less than 6 for municipal natural gas networks in most countries as a renewable energy meier et al 2015 hence it is necessary to develop technologies which simultaneously treat cw and biogas and recover resources in a sustainable manner microalgal cw treatment technology has attracted increasing attention due to its competitive advantages such as nutrient uptake and value added biomass production ge et al 2018 however its implementation is still limited largely due to low microalgal activities under high ammonium nh4 n free ammonia fa environment existing in cw markou et al 2016 shen et al 2020 to solve this issue one of the feasible approaches is the construction of evolved microalgal strains using the adaptive laboratory evolution ale technique zhao and huang 2020 for example 32 7 and 80 increases in microalgal growth were obtained after cyclic evolution under high salinity and phenol conditions respectively sun et al 2018a wang et al 2016a another approach is focusing on the reduction of nh4 n fa concentrations to alleviate inhibition on microalgae including the addition of absorbers e g zeolite cao et al 2018 lu et al 2019 or dilution of cw ge and champagne 2016 comparatively the dilution method is easier to conduct but it needs other water resources such as freshwater or secondary wastewater which leads to additional cost and limits its sustainability and implementation on a larger scale above all screening evolved native microalgal consortium enmc from cw and exploring natural water resource for cw dilution if necessary has the potential to improve microalgal performance in cw and the process economic feasibility microalgal cw treatment system also presents an alternative to co2 sequestration from biogas in an environmentally friendly manner cea barcia et al 2018 compared to the physical chemical absorption and membrane technology augelletti et al 2020 vrbová and ciahotný 2017 however the biogas upgrade with microalgae is still in its infancy and requires more investigation firstly no comprehensive study has been reported on an efficient and continuous process concurrently treating biogas and cw from ad system previous studies were conducted in a 6 7 day batch operation using pure microalgae species focusing on the operational parameters effects e g light wavelength intensity photoperiod wang et al 2016b yan and zheng 2013 zhao et al 2013 secondly controversy surrounds the literature concerning the positive or negative effects of biogas on microalgae prandini et al 2016 reported that the injection of biogas containing 77 ch4 achieved doubled biomass productivity while a 26 decreased growth was observed when exposed to biogas with 60 ch4 kao et al 2012 it was also reported that the gradual accumulation of o2 produced by photosynthesis in the closed microalgae system resulted in the stressful impacts on microalgae suggesting that the widely used photobioreactor pbr might not be suitable for the continuous and efficient treatment of biogas and cw the goal of this study was to propose an integrated process and demonstrate its feasibility of applying the adaptive cw originated enmc for simultaneous cw bioremediation and biogas purification by supplementing with local snow in canada with 65 of the land area covered by snow for over six months per year specifically the cultivation and enrichment of enmc in cw and their responses to the supplementation of snow and biogas were systematically assessed through batch tests subsequently a novel enmc snow enmcs system was proposed and operated in a semi continuous pbr for over 300 days the process performance was optimized by adjusting primary operational parameters including fill ratio feeding time hydraulic retention time hrt wastewater pretreatment and pbr type the ideal cultivation strategies were suggested and their effects on nutrient removal and biomass chemical compositions were compared and discussed this integrated configuration will apply to the simultaneous treatment of gaseous and liquid ad effluents as well as biomass production in wwtps especially in regions rich in snow resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 cw native cw microalgal consortium and snow the cw used in this study was collected from the ravensview wwtp located in kingston canada details are shown in text s1 in supporting information si briefly the cw referred to the supernatant from the high speed centrifugation process before subsequent thermophilic 55 c and mesophilic 36 c sludge ad systems cw was collected several times and then stored in a laboratory refrigerator at 4 c until use the ranges in the cw compositions are as follows mg l nh4 n 580 865 nitrite no2 n 0 02 0 18 nitrate no3 n 0 05 0 29 phosphorus po4 3 p 12 0 32 9 chemical oxygen demand cod 350 410 and ph 7 40 8 85 the native microalgal consortium was firstly isolated according to the following procedures a total of 10 ml cw was mixed with 1 6 l sterilized modified bold s basal medium mbbm in a lab scale pbr which was operated at room temperature under 4000 lux illumination using a 14 h 10 h light dark cycle the composition of mbbm is described in si s2 ge and champagne 2016 the obtained microalgal consortium pellets were re cultivated in mbbm for several cycles until stable growth performance was observed resulting in enriched enmc as the inoculum for subsequent experiments from december 2014 to february 2015 the snow used was taken from locations almost devoid of human disturbance in ten different cities across the ontario province of canada detailed sampling location information is provided in figure s1 and table s1 samples were collected from snow pits using plastic scoops with all necessary procedures to avoid contamination and then kept frozen throughout the transportation to the laboratory they were subsequently melted at room temperature 23 25 c transferred into pre cleaned containers reliance canada and stored in a laboratory refrigerator at 4 c until use 2 2 batch tests acquisition of enmc and their responses to medium variations 2 2 1 enmc acquisition and their growth evaluation in cw the previously enriched nmc were cultivated following a series of transfer procedures in order to improve their tolerance to the stressful high nh4 n fa condition in cw by using ale specifically five scenarios with different cw dilutions in tap water were applied including 50 constant volume ratio 50 cw 60 60 cw 70 70 cw 80 80 cw and a gradual increasing volume ratio from 50 to 80 by a 10 interval increase every five cycles g cw for each scenario nmc was cultivated in 3 replicated 250 ml flasks with a working volume of 100 ml a total of 20 cycles was conducted and each cycle lasted for 8 days with an initial cell density of approximately 0 05 g l for each cycle on day 8 the centrifuged 5000 g 10 min and washed twice with tap water nmc pellets were re suspended in the corresponding dilution cw for the next cycle similar operations were conducted with a total of 20 cycles for each scenario the biomass production and reactive oxygen species ros levels in nmc cells cultivated in different scenarios were determined same cultivation conditions were employed in the growth chamber as described above comparing the five scenarios mentioned above the resulting nmc with the highest growth rate in cw was identified as enmc cycle 15 enmc was then selected to further confirm whether they could present enhanced adaptability and growth performance in cw the original nmc without the ale process treatment was taken as control same experimental setups were used as described above at the end of day 8 the growth performance of two groups was compared including the specific growth rate biomass productivity and doubling time which are detailed in si s3 all scenarios were performed in triplicate unless otherwise mentioned 2 2 2 effect of snow addition on enmc growth in cw to investigate the feasibility of replacing tap water with melted snow water for diluting cw the growth of enmc was cultivated in the mixed 70 cw and 30 snow 70 cw 30 sn volume ratio medium the control was conducted in the 70 cw 30 h2o medium the same parameters were compared as described in section 2 2 1 the ionic species in melted snow water were also determined to explain the difference observed for enmc growth 2 2 3 effect of biogas injection on enmc growth in cw two scenarios were conducted with or without biogas injection using enmc grown in the 70 cw 30 h2o medium in 200 ml serum bottles after removing air using a vacuum the serum bottle was sparged with the synthetic biogas containing 70 ch4 25 co2 1 8 o2 3 2 h2o volume ratio and sealed to start the experiment in addition to biomass measurement the gas sample was taken on a daily basis to monitor the variations of the contents of ch4 co2 and o2 until the end of the operation on day 8 2 3 long term operation of enmcs system for bioremediation of cw and biogas based on the batch tests an enmcs process was proposed for simultaneous bioremediation of cw and biogas from the sludge ad system fig 1 briefly cw was firstly pretreated in a hydrolysis acidification reactor har which was anaerobically operated with an hrt of 3 days and the mixed liquor suspended solids of approximately 6000 mg l the effluent from the har named fermented cw fcw together with the snow water entered a pbr enriched with enmc the pbr could be adjusted as an open or closed system for different experimental purposes and it was connected to a biogas purification column 0 6 l 0 5 m in height 0 04 m of diameter by a peristaltic pump to circulate enmc cultures for the biogas composition n2 was used instead of ch4 due to potential explosion hazards the long term operation and optimization of the proposed enmcs process were conducted in six phases in batch in phase 1 and subsequently semi continuous operation for other phases table 1 in phase 1a days 0 24 snow water was applied for a 70 cw dilution in the open pbr 2 l column type 26 cm of height 10 cm of diameter similar cultivation parameters were used except that the fcw diluted with 30 snow 70 fcw 30 sn was employed in phase 1b days 24 64 in phase 2 days 64 128 the open pbr started to be fed semi continuously with the fcw and the hrt was controlled at 8 days in each cycle of the three sub phases phase 2a 2b and 2c different volumes of microalgal broth 80 60 and 50 v v were discarded and then replaced by identical volumes of fcw respectively to determine the optimum fill ratio in phases 3 and 4 the operational changes were implemented for the feeding time 1 min 12 h 24 h and 36 h and hrt 8 d 6 d and 5 d respectively in phase 5 and 6 the open and closed pbrs were compared to investigate the o2 accumulation effect on the enmc growth and nutrient removals 2 4 analytical methods for microalgal consortium and wastewater microalgal consortium biomass was evaluated by both the optical density at 680 nm od680 and dry weight dw using a uv visible spectrophotometer hach method 8171 the ros in nmc was assessed using a microplate reader spectramax m3 molecular devices usa by measuring the fluorescence intensity at 525 nm of emission wavelength and 488 nm of excitation wavelength shen et al 2020 the ros content was expressed by the fluorescence intensity fi in 1010 microalgal cells fi 1010cells moreover biomass composition including lipid protein and carbohydrates was analyzed for samples taken at different operational phases the biomass settleability was determined for cultures in different phases by measuring the settling efficiency in 30 min their contents in biomass were analyzed by following the protocols described in our previous study strictly ge et al 2018 the contents of biogas samples were determined with gas chromatography varian 3400 with hayesep q micropacked column tcd detector as described before li et al 2011 prior to nutrient analysis wastewater samples were filtered using a 0 22 µm pore size glass fiber filter fisher whatman puradisc 25 mm to remove microalgal cells and other particles cod nh4 n no2 n no3 n and po4 3 p concentrations were assessed using a hach model dr 2800 spectrophotometer according to standard methods apha 2005 ph was monitored with a probe connected to a microprocessor meter fisher scientific accumet excel xl60 the ionic species including nh4 na k ca2 mg2 cl no3 and so4 2 in the melted snow water were determined using an ion chromatography system model ics 3000 dionex co germany anions were separated with koh eluent through an as18 column while cations were measured in a cs12a column with methane sulfonic acid eluent 2 5 economic analysis for enmcs system environmental analysis was conducted to emphasize the advantages of the enmcs system in comparison to the traditional nitrification and denitrification system according to the theoretical calculation briefly sludge production and oxygen demand during nitrification are 0 19 g vss g n and 4 86 g g n respectively while carbon consumption co2 production and sludge production during denitrification are 2 86 mg cod g n 3 93 g g n and 0 67 g vss g n respectively ji et al 2020 moreover economic analysis of the enmcs system was performed using a comprehensive economic model fu et al 2019 by balancing the total cost i e pipeline pbr energy packaging transporting employee wages and infrastructure and biomass revenue please refer to the details for calculation in text si s7 2 6 statistical analysis the results presented are average values standard error of mean sem from the independent replicate experiments n 3 the differences in the biomass yield biocomposition content ros content and nutrient removal efficiency between among test groups were analyzed for significance using t test or one way anova with a post hoc tukey s test at a significant level of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 ros reduction improved enmc adaptation in cw by gradual stress increase strategy to improve the adaptation of the originated microalgal consortium in cw five scenarios with different centrate dilutions 50 60 70 80 and 50 80 were conducted to acclimate nmc using the ale method as expected and shown in fig 2 a there were obvious rising trends of biomass growth in all five scenarios in the studied 20 cycles suggesting the feasibility of acclimating nmc in varied volume ratios of cw however the growth performance largely depended on the specific scenario conditions for example the final biomass concentration for 80 cw tended to be only 35 0 53 7 of other scenarios among the first four scenarios the ros level in nmc increased with the cw ratio with the highest value observed for 80 cw 10 57 0 20 fi 1010cells fig 2b which was around 1 5 fold higher than those observed in 50 and 60 cw 80 cw vs 50 and 60 cw p 0 001 one way anova with tukey s post hoc test this indicated that the severe stress led to the unsuitability of 80 cw for nmc acclimation and growth even with the ale process comparatively both the 50 cw and g cw scenarios produced better acclimation in cw with higher growth rates and final biomass concentrations however different observations were obtained between these two scenarios for the g cw scenario although obvious lag phases were observed in the initial two or three cycles for each increment such as cycles 6 8 and cycles 10 11 nmc ended up with enhanced growth in subsequent cycles of 9 10 and 12 15 end of cycle 15 g cw vs 50 cw p 0 01 g cw vs 60 70 and 80 cw p 0 001 one way anova with tukey s post hoc test it is assumed that the effective adaptation of nmc in g cw was likely attributed to reduced ros levels 5 40 0 21 fi 1010cells which were significantly lower than those observed in the other four groups end of cycle 15 g cw vs 50 cw p 0 01 g cw vs 60 70 and 80 cw p 0 001 one way anova with tukey s post hoc test further increase up to 80 in cycles 16 20 did not continuously enhance the biomass production cycle 16 vs cycle 20 p 0 05 t test which was consistent with the slow growth performance in 80 cw this finding was also in agreement with the varied ros levels in high cw volume scenarios it was assumed that the enhanced ros level in the presence of excessively high nutrient amount i e ammonium and fa could induce oxidative stress in microalgae such as the inhibition of protein synthesis dna damage protein crosslinking and reduced photosynthetic activity chokshi et al 2017 shen et al 2020 additionally nmc cultivated in g cw achieved a 41 9 reduction in ros levels from cycle 5 to cycle 15 which was remarkably higher compared with the other four scenarios 1 85 29 2 it indicated that the improved nmc adaptation in g cw might be attributed to the ros reduction along the cultivation process considering that by the end of cycle 15 g cw showed remarkably enhanced growth performance with reduced ros level fig 2a the resulting evolved consortium was obtained from the g cw group by the end of cycle 15 rather than cycle 20 namely enmc to further confirm the improved adaptability of enmc the growth performance in 70 cw was compared again with the original nmc without ale as the control after an 8 day cultivation the growth characteristics of both groups were investigated in terms of four parameters as shown in table 2 clearly enmc showed a better growth performance with a higher dry weight on day 8 0 2750 0 0051 g l exceeding more than twice the original nmc 0 0737 0 0043 g l p 0 001 t test increased values in both the biomass productivity and specific growth rate for enmc were approximately 9 36 and 4 44 times higher than the original nmc p 0 001 t test the increased values of the doubling time of the original nmc 364 99 60 12 h further suggested reduced growth rate compared with enmc 78 12 0 87 h p 0 001 t test confirming that the evolved enmc was more adaptive in the high ammonia fa condition of 70 cw than the original nmc therefore the evolved consortium namely enmc obtained from g cw scenario was selected as the inoculum for subsequent experiments in this study 3 2 supplementation of snow and biogas enhanced emnc growth in cw 3 2 1 ca2 and mg2 in snow facilitate enmc metabolism microalgae cultivation is a water intensive process therefore it is critical to seek a reliable and low cost water supply snow is composed mostly of frozen water indicating that it might be a potential alternative to satisfy the water demand hence instead of adding fresh tap water 70 cw 30 h2o table 2 in cw the melted snow water was applied for cw dilution to a 70 level 70 cw 30 sn as expected in the cultivation conducted with snow addition a comparable and even improved biomass yield was observed on day 8 0 3103 0 0027 g l compared with the fresh water group 0 2877 0 0020 p 0 01 t test similarly the replacement of fresh water with snow also elevated the biomass productivity and growth rate significantly in addition to a lower doubling time value p 0 05 t test this result was also consistent with the ros variation which presented a significantly decreased level when snow was applied with and without sn dilution 4 87 0 03 fi 1010 cells and 5 47 0 12 fi 1010 cells respectively p 0 05 t test indicating that the snow replacement might provide a more preferable environment for enmc growth to explore the underlying explanations for the improved enmc growth performance with snow supplementation the major element concentrations in the sampled snow were analyzed as shown in fig 3 a the water soluble ca2 2 16 0 21 mg l and mg2 0 84 0 12 mg l were the two dominant chemical constituents which were 7 14 60 1 and 2 78 23 3 times higher than other compositions cl and nh4 this observation was in agreement with a previous report demonstrating that the addition of 6 2 mg l ca2 or 9 76 mg l mg2 promoted a 16 7 increase of the biomass yield in chlorella vulgaris c vulgaris compared with ca or mg free medium gorain et al 2013 similar results were also obtained in s obliquus with a 27 3 and 9 1 improvement in ca2 or mg2 supplementation conditions in this study the enhanced growth performance of enmc cultivated in 70 cw 30 sn observed in this study is therefore understandable several previous studies also exhibited accordant conclusions for example c vulgaris seldom grew in 3 n bristol medium which lacked mg2 while chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp cultivated in blue green medium showed lower cell density yield than bristol modified medium which contained ca2 and mg2 ben amor ben ayed et al 2015 chew et al 2018 however it was also remarkable that higher ca2 and mg2 concentrations might be inhibitory chen et al 2020 gorain et al 2013 for example the excess of the optimal ca2 concentration resulted in a 24 3 drop in biomass productivity of scenedesmus sp ren et al 2014 mg2 plays a pivotal role in microalgal metabolism such as chlorophyll synthesis and enzyme activation i e ribulose bisphosphate rubp carboxylase oxygenase rubisco enzyme which might be associated with the improved biomass yield chlorophyll which is an essential pigment for photosynthesis and critical in trapping light requires one mg2 ion for synthesizing each chlorophyll molecule therefore increased mg2 amount showed a positive effect on the chlorophyll synthesis chen et al 2020 rubisco is mainly responsible for the photosynthetic co2 assimilation and photorespiratory metabolism it was observed that mg deficiency led to a remarkably reduced amount of rubisco and rubisco activase only accounting for 0 47 8 of the amount under mg sufficient conditions peng et al 2015 additionally mg deficiency also inhibits photosynthesis which might be related to decreased carboxylation efficiency and reduced rate of rubp regeneration farhat et al 2016 with regard to ca2 its contribution to the microalgal growth is still blurry yet one possible explanation was that ca2 supplementation might lower the ph of cw hence decreasing the toxicity of high ammonium feagley and fenn 1998 it is also likely due to the involvement of ca2 in the maintenance of microalgal membrane stability and the cytoskeleton formation ren et al 2014 it is worth noting that ca2 as a ubiquitous intracellular second messenger has the signal transduction function which might contribute to the regulation of intracellular signaling networks sun et al 2006 this indicated that microalgal cells might need a reliable source of ca2 for growth and reproduction taken together the inclusion of ca2 and mg2 in snow as two principal components might be able to explain the enhanced enmc growth it is noteworthy that the snow in this study was collected from 10 locations near lake ontario in canada if the snow was sampled in north canada especially over the arctic it would be expected to include compositions similar to seawater de caritat et al 2005 and thereby it would require desalination before being applied for freshwater microalgae or could probably be used mainly in marine microalgae cultivation 3 2 2 mutual biogas purification and enmc growth in terms of co2 content in biogas the effect of the synthetic biogas on enmc growth was investigated to study the feasibility of enmc for purifying biogas from the sludge ad system as shown in table 2 the final biomass dw in the absence and presence of biogas were 0 2690 0 0081 and 0 3057 0 0044 g l p 0 05 t test respectively indicating an enhanced biomass yield with the biogas exposure consistent results were observed from other parameters including biomass productivity 0 0274 0 0010 vs 0 0320 0 0005 g l d growth rate 0 2102 0 0037 vs 0 2263 0 0018 d 1 doubling time during the exponential phase 79 20 1 38 vs 73 55 0 59 h and ros 5 51 0 17 vs 4 94 0 04 fi 1010cells p 0 05 for all t test further demonstrating that enmc benefited from the synthetic biogas exposure moreover over the cultivation time course the co2 content in headspace reduced while that of ch4 increased with the final content reaching 4 47 0 64 and 92 63 0 75 day 0 vs day 8 p 0 01 and 0 05 for co2 and ch4 respectively t test fig 3b the o2 content was nearly invariable remaining between 1 77 0 03 and 2 13 0 09 p 0 05 when comparing two consecutive days one way anova with tukey s test therefore the biogas was effective to stimulate enmc production which agreed with previous studies demonstrating improved microalgae biomass productivity and higher growth rate when the co2 level was above the atmospheric concentrations cheng et al 2015 prandini et al 2016 it was considered that co2 served as the carbon source and microalgae were tolerant between 20 and 50 co2 levels this might be due to induced carboxylation and repressed oxygenase activity of rubisco under increased co2 level finally leading to preferable photosynthesis additionally unlike the toxicity observed at 60 and 80 ch4 in chlorella strain kao et al 2012 the synthetic biogas with an initial ch4 level of 70 did not inhibit the enmc growth in this study possibly due to its superior adaptability it was also interesting to obtain similar o2 levels 1 77 2 13 along the cultivation period indicating that there was no o2 accumulation phenomenon as reported elsewhere bahr et al 2014 cea barcia et al 2018 although some studies reported that o2 might be among the compounds utilized in photosynthesis the o2 level during an 8 day biogas exposure was not expected to significantly affect enmc growth in the present study above all through the enmc growth in cw 78 9 of co2 in biogas was removed by enmc and the ch4 content finally reached the standard of fuel requirements 90 with o2 level outside the explosive range 0 4 indicating an excellent biogas upgrading process 3 3 establishment and long term operation of enmcs system based on the aforementioned observations a novel long term operation of the enmcs system was established and optimized by adjusting primary process parameters to achieve simultaneous bioremediation of cw and biogas and production of value added biomass fig 4 illustrates the growth profile of enmc biomass productivity nh4 n and po4 3 p removals and ph variation over time cultivated with 6 phases 3 3 1 optimization of enmcs system and biomass production the variations of biomass concentrations and productivities of enmc responding to the changes of primary parameters for the enmcs system are presented in fig 4a in phase 1 improved biomass productivity by 44 2 was observed when the influent was switched from original cw to anaerobically fermented cw this enhancement could be attributed to the fermentation configuration which tended to degrade refractory organics in cw into micro molecules such as volatile fatty acids promoting microalgal heterotrophic and mixotrophic metabolism and growth this observation was supported by the demonstrated improved biomass yield in pure microalgae system in wastewater supplemented with glycerol and glucose ge et al 2018 wang et al 2020 subsequently after 64 days when enmc cultures achieved stable growth in batch operation phase 2 where pbr was fed semi continuously to enhance the treatment capacity of the enmcs system was initiated it was obvious that in comparison with 70 phase 2a and 30 phase 2c the fill ratio of 50 employed in phase 2b obtained 1 32 fold and 1 35 fold higher biomass productivity this suggested that the selection of fill ratio is one of the critical parameters for the system performance it was assumed that the fill ratio employed directly determined the initial enmc inoculum concentration and nutrient levels after feeding the pbr both of which jointly determined the subsequent microalgal growth performance in the new cycle therefore it was returned to 50 as the optimum fill ratio in phase 3 where the feeding time effect was studied a longer feeding time of 24 h phase 3c remarkably enhanced both biomass yield and productivity compared with 1 min phase 3a and 12 h phase 3b p 0 001 one way anova with tukey s post hoc test while no significant differences were observed between phase 3c and phase 3d in which 36 h was applied p 0 05 it is probably because enmc was more adaptive to the fed batch mode by alleviating the shock effect of high ammonium in cw which normally existed in the sudden supplementation e g 1 min strategy this was also observed and demonstrated in the macroalgae system for cw treatment where step feeding was found to benefit biomass production ge and champagne 2017 additionally a relatively elongated feeding time i e 36 h might lead to insufficiency of certain essential nutrients at certain stages considering the fact that more expenses on feeding operations such as electricity consumption is required with longer feeding time 24 h rather than 36 h was selected in phase 4 in which the effect of hrt was investigated phase 4b hrt of 6 d exhibited slightly reduced biomass concentration compared to phase 4a hrt of 8 d p 0 05 one way anova with tukey s post hoc test but it was clear that phase 4b presented 24 1 and 11 3 enhanced biomass productivity than that in phase 4a and 4c hrt of 4 d respectively this indicated that enmc might have reached the stationary phase within 6 d while an insufficient hrt 4 d for the high levels of nutrient and organic loading might lead to relatively reduced density of enmc suspensions in phase 5 the pbr was closed to investigate the gas effect results showed that biomass productivity exhibited a downward trend along the cycles but this recovered achieving a final productivity of 0 3059 0 0084 g l d at the end of phase 6 when it was replaced by an open pbr this suggests that closed pbr likely inhibited enmc growth in the long term operation this observation might be explained by the build up of o2 in the closed pbr as o2 might compete with co2 for rubisco enzyme which is involved in co2 fixation and biomass generation raso et al 2012 overall the enmcs system was eventually optimized as a 24 h 50 70 fcw 30 sn semi continuous feeding system with hrt of 6 d in the open pbr 3 3 2 nutrient removals and ph variations as shown in fig 4b enmc effectively removed nh4 n and po4 3 p in most phases under long term operation finally achieving the removal efficiency of 95 6 0 13 and 90 8 0 44 respectively table s2 it is noteworthy that enmc cultures required several days of acclimation to obtain enhanced nutrient removal when the cultivation environment is switched for example as the hrt of 8 d was replaced by 6 d in phase 4b the nh4 n removal efficiency dropped from 89 4 0 29 phase 4a to 82 7 0 95 at the end of the 1st cycle in phase 4b while it gradually improved to 84 8 0 62 and 85 0 0 65 after one or two cycle adaptations in phase 4b moreover the trends of nutrient removal in the long term operation tended to follow the variations of enmc biomass concentrations fig 4c and d due to nutrient removal mostly by microalgal metabolic assimilation here only nh4 n levels rather than other nitrogen forms such as no3 n was monitored in cw as microalgae prefer nh4 n to no3 n since no redox reactions and less energy are required in nh4 n assimilation cai et al 2013 additionally the nitrate reductase which assists the reduction of no3 n is generally repressed by the existence of nh4 n indicating that no3 n assimilation might not start until nh4 n is exhausted crawford 1995 given that nitrogen was not completely depleted in all phases it is less critical to monitor the no3 n level compared with the nh4 n in addition ph values showed an overall increase pattern with slight variations fig 4d which was consistent with the trend of enmc concentration the 16 7 increase in ph values between day 0 and day 310 could easily be correlated to the enhanced microalgal photosynthetic activity as supported by multiple studies bartley et al 2014 sakarika and kornaros 2016 3 3 3 biomass settleability and biomass composition the obtained enmc biomass presented good settleability as indicated by the fast settling efficiency in 30 min figure s2 the composition of the settled slurries collected from different phases was evaluated and compared including lipid protein and carbohydrate contents specifically the lowest lipid and carbohydrate levels were obtained in phase 2b table 3 however they were almost doubled in phase 3c p 0 001 one way anova with tukey s test with similar operating parameters except for feeding time in both phases 1 min and 24 h respectively interestingly it appeared that there was an inconsistent range for biomass protein levels in all phases examined with approximately 60 of dry weight biomass although no significant differences were found among most pairs phase 3c showed the lowest protein content in biomass the underlying mechanism behind such variations was unclear a similar study was reported that the insufficient nitrogen environment induced instant carbohydrate synthesis and subsequent lipid accumulation as a long term response for energy storage nordin et al 2020 scott et al 2010 taken together the variations of the three compositions along the phases might be explained by the slower or reduced nitrogen supply as feeding time or hrt varied although nitrogen depletion or starvation was not observed so far several transcription factors have been identified in regulating lipid and carbohydrate accumulation such as nrr1 psr1 and gmdof4 sun et al 2018b however whether they could also be found in enmc and whether they were up or down regulated in the long term operation require further investigation 3 4 environmental and economic analysis for the implementation of the enmcs system the mass flows of carbon and nitrogen as well as the environmental and economic analysis were determined to evaluate the enmcs process for engineering implications as shown in fig 5 a approximately 86 1 of the influent nitrogen in cw was mostly removed by microalgal uptake in the enmcs system with approximately 9 5 nitrogen loss through bacterial metabolism the biogas was upgraded by an 86 reduction of co2 with 38 0 flowing into biomass through photosynthesis in this study the average daily flow of ravensview wwtp of 77 265 m3 d in 2019 was considered 10 of which produced 2 82 107 m3 cw per year through the sludge ad system compared to the traditional nitrification and denitrification processes fig 5b the enmcs process could annually save consumptions of 6 40 103 kg carbon sources and 1 09 107 kg oxygen and failed to produce 8 80 106 kg co2 and 1 93 106 kg sludge moreover the enmcs could capture 5 18 104 kg n y and 8 63 102 kg p y into biomass 4 8 n and 0 1 p in dry biomass ge and champagne 2016 the economic feasibility of the enmcs system was evaluated through a comprehensive economic model fig 5c fu et al 2019 the detailed calculation for each part is presented in s7 and table s3 the expenses of pbrs electricity packaging and transporting employee wages and infrastructure were all included in the total cost amounting to 7 79 107 usd y the energy cost took up 41 4 of the direct costs while the pbr construction cost was the major part of capital costs accounting for 16 4 of the total comparatively the revenue of 1 12 108 usd y from biomass could compensate for expenses related to cultivation infrastructure achieving a gross profit of 40 0 usd kg 8 63 105 kg y biomass and 0 13 usd g biomass indicating that the enmcs system was economically feasible the sensitivity analysis showed that the sensitivity of the energy profit was 1 83 7 87 times more than the other four expense categories suggesting that energy expenditure was the most influential parameter affecting the profit it is also worth noting that the system could also yield total productions of 5 01 105 kg protein 1 21 105 kg carbohydrate per year and around 6 38 104 kg lipid oil based on the 7 40 0 49 of lipid content in dw in phase 6 fig 5b the successful cw bioremediation and biogas purification in the proposed enmcs system relies on achieving high nutrient and co2 removal efficiencies while maximizing biomass productivities the access of dominant enmc and its enrichment in the system is important as this positively correlated with microalgal adaptation and tolerance to cw with over 500 mg l nh4 n further work will be conducted on microbiome analysis to characterize the advantageous deleterious and dominant species strains in the enmc additionally fcw was the preferred feed to ensure the supply of organic carbon sources for mixotrophic growth while the adjustment of several parameters including fill ratio feeding time hrt and pbr type is also critical and might require a case by case investigation for optimization the complexity of cw composition needs to be specifically characterized as well so that the light diffusion and microalgal cultivation would not be affected moreover the involvement of snow in the system will not only enhance nutrient recovery from cw in a centralized manner in wwtps but also alleviate the natural water pollution caused by snow accumulation especially in snowy regions or countries such as canada russia and iceland it is feasible to collect and store the snow in special ponds during snowy seasons for use throughout the year considering their generally vast geography there would not be significant contributions to the greenhouse gas emission and energy consumption during transportation in local areas lastly ch4 was replaced by n2 in the long term operation resulting in the lack of direct observation on the final purified ch4 levels however through the batch study 78 9 co2 was removed and over 90 ch4 content was achieved after an 8 day enmc cultivation suggesting that the enmcs system could be implemented to acheive simultaneous bioremediation of cw and biogas upgrading in wwtps 4 conclusions this study investigated the feasibility of constructing enmc using the ale technique with a gradual cw percentage increase strategy which lasted 15 cycles the effects of snow and biogas supplementation on enmc growth were also examined both of which led to a significantly enhanced biomass production an integrated enmcs system was put forward to simultaneously recover nutrients from cw and upgrade biogas enmc presented comparative growth rates and nutrient removals with a final biomass productivity of 0 3059 0 0084 g l d and nh4 n and po4 3 p removal efficiencies of 95 6 0 1 and 90 8 0 4 when the enmcs system was finally optimized as a 24 h 70 fcw 30 sn semi continuously feeding system with fill ratio of 50 and hrt of 6 d in the open pbr the variations of the above parameters also exhibited influence on enmc cell composition including carbohydrate protein and lipid content the observations in this study provided a novel and techno economically applicable approach to microalgal cultivation as well as simultaneous remediation of biogas and cw paving the way for sustainable microalgal based wastewater

17077,it is necessary to develop sustainable technologies for centrate wastewater cw and biogas treatment from sludge anaerobic digestion ad systems in an environmentally friendly and economical manner the microalgae based bioremediation approach presents a competitive alternative due to its capacity for nutrient recovery and carbon sequestration however process instabilities and operating challenges limit its development and implementation largely due to the complexities in the cw and biogas in this study the evolved native microalgal consortium enmc was firstly developed using the gradual stress increase method to enhance their adaptation in high ammonium condition the supplementation of local snow with ca2 and mg2 and biogas into cw significantly enhanced enmc growth through batch tests subsequently an integrated enmc snow enmcs system was proposed consisting of a hydrolysis acidification reactor har biogas upgrade reactor and photobioreactor pbr the enmcs system was systematically investigated under both batch and semi continuous operations by adjusting primary process parameters including the fill ratio feeding time hydraulic retention time hrt wastewater pretreatment and pbr type it was eventually optimized as a 24 h 70 fermented cw diluted with 30 snow water semi continuous feeding system with a fill ratio of 50 and hrt of 6 d in an open pbr long term operation 310 days showed superior biomass yield 0 3059 0 0039 g l d and nutrient removal efficiencies 95 6 0 13 and 90 8 0 44 for nh4 n and po4 3 p removal meanwhile biogas was upgraded with an 82 2 co2 reduction the economic and environmental analysis further demonstrated the enmcs system as an effective alternative for the bioremediation of ad effluents while simultaneously producing value added biomass especially applicable to snowy regions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords centrate wastewater microalgal consortium biogas gradual stress increase snow 1 introduction nowadays in wastewater treatment plants wwtps there is an increasing paradigm shift from pollutant removal to resource and energy recovery when treating wastewater and biosolids i e sewage sludge anaerobic digestion ad has been implemented as a promising sustainable way for sludge reduction but with its generation of centrate wastewater cw which contains large amounts of nutrient and organics further polishing is required lackner et al 2014 qiu et al 2021 moreover the gaseous effluent from ad systems namely biogas 40 75 ch4 25 55 co2 and 0 2 o2 kadam and panwar 2017 needs to be upgraded to enhance biomethane content while reduce co2 less than 6 for municipal natural gas networks in most countries as a renewable energy meier et al 2015 hence it is necessary to develop technologies which simultaneously treat cw and biogas and recover resources in a sustainable manner microalgal cw treatment technology has attracted increasing attention due to its competitive advantages such as nutrient uptake and value added biomass production ge et al 2018 however its implementation is still limited largely due to low microalgal activities under high ammonium nh4 n free ammonia fa environment existing in cw markou et al 2016 shen et al 2020 to solve this issue one of the feasible approaches is the construction of evolved microalgal strains using the adaptive laboratory evolution ale technique zhao and huang 2020 for example 32 7 and 80 increases in microalgal growth were obtained after cyclic evolution under high salinity and phenol conditions respectively sun et al 2018a wang et al 2016a another approach is focusing on the reduction of nh4 n fa concentrations to alleviate inhibition on microalgae including the addition of absorbers e g zeolite cao et al 2018 lu et al 2019 or dilution of cw ge and champagne 2016 comparatively the dilution method is easier to conduct but it needs other water resources such as freshwater or secondary wastewater which leads to additional cost and limits its sustainability and implementation on a larger scale above all screening evolved native microalgal consortium enmc from cw and exploring natural water resource for cw dilution if necessary has the potential to improve microalgal performance in cw and the process economic feasibility microalgal cw treatment system also presents an alternative to co2 sequestration from biogas in an environmentally friendly manner cea barcia et al 2018 compared to the physical chemical absorption and membrane technology augelletti et al 2020 vrbová and ciahotný 2017 however the biogas upgrade with microalgae is still in its infancy and requires more investigation firstly no comprehensive study has been reported on an efficient and continuous process concurrently treating biogas and cw from ad system previous studies were conducted in a 6 7 day batch operation using pure microalgae species focusing on the operational parameters effects e g light wavelength intensity photoperiod wang et al 2016b yan and zheng 2013 zhao et al 2013 secondly controversy surrounds the literature concerning the positive or negative effects of biogas on microalgae prandini et al 2016 reported that the injection of biogas containing 77 ch4 achieved doubled biomass productivity while a 26 decreased growth was observed when exposed to biogas with 60 ch4 kao et al 2012 it was also reported that the gradual accumulation of o2 produced by photosynthesis in the closed microalgae system resulted in the stressful impacts on microalgae suggesting that the widely used photobioreactor pbr might not be suitable for the continuous and efficient treatment of biogas and cw the goal of this study was to propose an integrated process and demonstrate its feasibility of applying the adaptive cw originated enmc for simultaneous cw bioremediation and biogas purification by supplementing with local snow in canada with 65 of the land area covered by snow for over six months per year specifically the cultivation and enrichment of enmc in cw and their responses to the supplementation of snow and biogas were systematically assessed through batch tests subsequently a novel enmc snow enmcs system was proposed and operated in a semi continuous pbr for over 300 days the process performance was optimized by adjusting primary operational parameters including fill ratio feeding time hydraulic retention time hrt wastewater pretreatment and pbr type the ideal cultivation strategies were suggested and their effects on nutrient removal and biomass chemical compositions were compared and discussed this integrated configuration will apply to the simultaneous treatment of gaseous and liquid ad effluents as well as biomass production in wwtps especially in regions rich in snow resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 cw native cw microalgal consortium and snow the cw used in this study was collected from the ravensview wwtp located in kingston canada details are shown in text s1 in supporting information si briefly the cw referred to the supernatant from the high speed centrifugation process before subsequent thermophilic 55 c and mesophilic 36 c sludge ad systems cw was collected several times and then stored in a laboratory refrigerator at 4 c until use the ranges in the cw compositions are as follows mg l nh4 n 580 865 nitrite no2 n 0 02 0 18 nitrate no3 n 0 05 0 29 phosphorus po4 3 p 12 0 32 9 chemical oxygen demand cod 350 410 and ph 7 40 8 85 the native microalgal consortium was firstly isolated according to the following procedures a total of 10 ml cw was mixed with 1 6 l sterilized modified bold s basal medium mbbm in a lab scale pbr which was operated at room temperature under 4000 lux illumination using a 14 h 10 h light dark cycle the composition of mbbm is described in si s2 ge and champagne 2016 the obtained microalgal consortium pellets were re cultivated in mbbm for several cycles until stable growth performance was observed resulting in enriched enmc as the inoculum for subsequent experiments from december 2014 to february 2015 the snow used was taken from locations almost devoid of human disturbance in ten different cities across the ontario province of canada detailed sampling location information is provided in figure s1 and table s1 samples were collected from snow pits using plastic scoops with all necessary procedures to avoid contamination and then kept frozen throughout the transportation to the laboratory they were subsequently melted at room temperature 23 25 c transferred into pre cleaned containers reliance canada and stored in a laboratory refrigerator at 4 c until use 2 2 batch tests acquisition of enmc and their responses to medium variations 2 2 1 enmc acquisition and their growth evaluation in cw the previously enriched nmc were cultivated following a series of transfer procedures in order to improve their tolerance to the stressful high nh4 n fa condition in cw by using ale specifically five scenarios with different cw dilutions in tap water were applied including 50 constant volume ratio 50 cw 60 60 cw 70 70 cw 80 80 cw and a gradual increasing volume ratio from 50 to 80 by a 10 interval increase every five cycles g cw for each scenario nmc was cultivated in 3 replicated 250 ml flasks with a working volume of 100 ml a total of 20 cycles was conducted and each cycle lasted for 8 days with an initial cell density of approximately 0 05 g l for each cycle on day 8 the centrifuged 5000 g 10 min and washed twice with tap water nmc pellets were re suspended in the corresponding dilution cw for the next cycle similar operations were conducted with a total of 20 cycles for each scenario the biomass production and reactive oxygen species ros levels in nmc cells cultivated in different scenarios were determined same cultivation conditions were employed in the growth chamber as described above comparing the five scenarios mentioned above the resulting nmc with the highest growth rate in cw was identified as enmc cycle 15 enmc was then selected to further confirm whether they could present enhanced adaptability and growth performance in cw the original nmc without the ale process treatment was taken as control same experimental setups were used as described above at the end of day 8 the growth performance of two groups was compared including the specific growth rate biomass productivity and doubling time which are detailed in si s3 all scenarios were performed in triplicate unless otherwise mentioned 2 2 2 effect of snow addition on enmc growth in cw to investigate the feasibility of replacing tap water with melted snow water for diluting cw the growth of enmc was cultivated in the mixed 70 cw and 30 snow 70 cw 30 sn volume ratio medium the control was conducted in the 70 cw 30 h2o medium the same parameters were compared as described in section 2 2 1 the ionic species in melted snow water were also determined to explain the difference observed for enmc growth 2 2 3 effect of biogas injection on enmc growth in cw two scenarios were conducted with or without biogas injection using enmc grown in the 70 cw 30 h2o medium in 200 ml serum bottles after removing air using a vacuum the serum bottle was sparged with the synthetic biogas containing 70 ch4 25 co2 1 8 o2 3 2 h2o volume ratio and sealed to start the experiment in addition to biomass measurement the gas sample was taken on a daily basis to monitor the variations of the contents of ch4 co2 and o2 until the end of the operation on day 8 2 3 long term operation of enmcs system for bioremediation of cw and biogas based on the batch tests an enmcs process was proposed for simultaneous bioremediation of cw and biogas from the sludge ad system fig 1 briefly cw was firstly pretreated in a hydrolysis acidification reactor har which was anaerobically operated with an hrt of 3 days and the mixed liquor suspended solids of approximately 6000 mg l the effluent from the har named fermented cw fcw together with the snow water entered a pbr enriched with enmc the pbr could be adjusted as an open or closed system for different experimental purposes and it was connected to a biogas purification column 0 6 l 0 5 m in height 0 04 m of diameter by a peristaltic pump to circulate enmc cultures for the biogas composition n2 was used instead of ch4 due to potential explosion hazards the long term operation and optimization of the proposed enmcs process were conducted in six phases in batch in phase 1 and subsequently semi continuous operation for other phases table 1 in phase 1a days 0 24 snow water was applied for a 70 cw dilution in the open pbr 2 l column type 26 cm of height 10 cm of diameter similar cultivation parameters were used except that the fcw diluted with 30 snow 70 fcw 30 sn was employed in phase 1b days 24 64 in phase 2 days 64 128 the open pbr started to be fed semi continuously with the fcw and the hrt was controlled at 8 days in each cycle of the three sub phases phase 2a 2b and 2c different volumes of microalgal broth 80 60 and 50 v v were discarded and then replaced by identical volumes of fcw respectively to determine the optimum fill ratio in phases 3 and 4 the operational changes were implemented for the feeding time 1 min 12 h 24 h and 36 h and hrt 8 d 6 d and 5 d respectively in phase 5 and 6 the open and closed pbrs were compared to investigate the o2 accumulation effect on the enmc growth and nutrient removals 2 4 analytical methods for microalgal consortium and wastewater microalgal consortium biomass was evaluated by both the optical density at 680 nm od680 and dry weight dw using a uv visible spectrophotometer hach method 8171 the ros in nmc was assessed using a microplate reader spectramax m3 molecular devices usa by measuring the fluorescence intensity at 525 nm of emission wavelength and 488 nm of excitation wavelength shen et al 2020 the ros content was expressed by the fluorescence intensity fi in 1010 microalgal cells fi 1010cells moreover biomass composition including lipid protein and carbohydrates was analyzed for samples taken at different operational phases the biomass settleability was determined for cultures in different phases by measuring the settling efficiency in 30 min their contents in biomass were analyzed by following the protocols described in our previous study strictly ge et al 2018 the contents of biogas samples were determined with gas chromatography varian 3400 with hayesep q micropacked column tcd detector as described before li et al 2011 prior to nutrient analysis wastewater samples were filtered using a 0 22 µm pore size glass fiber filter fisher whatman puradisc 25 mm to remove microalgal cells and other particles cod nh4 n no2 n no3 n and po4 3 p concentrations were assessed using a hach model dr 2800 spectrophotometer according to standard methods apha 2005 ph was monitored with a probe connected to a microprocessor meter fisher scientific accumet excel xl60 the ionic species including nh4 na k ca2 mg2 cl no3 and so4 2 in the melted snow water were determined using an ion chromatography system model ics 3000 dionex co germany anions were separated with koh eluent through an as18 column while cations were measured in a cs12a column with methane sulfonic acid eluent 2 5 economic analysis for enmcs system environmental analysis was conducted to emphasize the advantages of the enmcs system in comparison to the traditional nitrification and denitrification system according to the theoretical calculation briefly sludge production and oxygen demand during nitrification are 0 19 g vss g n and 4 86 g g n respectively while carbon consumption co2 production and sludge production during denitrification are 2 86 mg cod g n 3 93 g g n and 0 67 g vss g n respectively ji et al 2020 moreover economic analysis of the enmcs system was performed using a comprehensive economic model fu et al 2019 by balancing the total cost i e pipeline pbr energy packaging transporting employee wages and infrastructure and biomass revenue please refer to the details for calculation in text si s7 2 6 statistical analysis the results presented are average values standard error of mean sem from the independent replicate experiments n 3 the differences in the biomass yield biocomposition content ros content and nutrient removal efficiency between among test groups were analyzed for significance using t test or one way anova with a post hoc tukey s test at a significant level of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 ros reduction improved enmc adaptation in cw by gradual stress increase strategy to improve the adaptation of the originated microalgal consortium in cw five scenarios with different centrate dilutions 50 60 70 80 and 50 80 were conducted to acclimate nmc using the ale method as expected and shown in fig 2 a there were obvious rising trends of biomass growth in all five scenarios in the studied 20 cycles suggesting the feasibility of acclimating nmc in varied volume ratios of cw however the growth performance largely depended on the specific scenario conditions for example the final biomass concentration for 80 cw tended to be only 35 0 53 7 of other scenarios among the first four scenarios the ros level in nmc increased with the cw ratio with the highest value observed for 80 cw 10 57 0 20 fi 1010cells fig 2b which was around 1 5 fold higher than those observed in 50 and 60 cw 80 cw vs 50 and 60 cw p 0 001 one way anova with tukey s post hoc test this indicated that the severe stress led to the unsuitability of 80 cw for nmc acclimation and growth even with the ale process comparatively both the 50 cw and g cw scenarios produced better acclimation in cw with higher growth rates and final biomass concentrations however different observations were obtained between these two scenarios for the g cw scenario although obvious lag phases were observed in the initial two or three cycles for each increment such as cycles 6 8 and cycles 10 11 nmc ended up with enhanced growth in subsequent cycles of 9 10 and 12 15 end of cycle 15 g cw vs 50 cw p 0 01 g cw vs 60 70 and 80 cw p 0 001 one way anova with tukey s post hoc test it is assumed that the effective adaptation of nmc in g cw was likely attributed to reduced ros levels 5 40 0 21 fi 1010cells which were significantly lower than those observed in the other four groups end of cycle 15 g cw vs 50 cw p 0 01 g cw vs 60 70 and 80 cw p 0 001 one way anova with tukey s post hoc test further increase up to 80 in cycles 16 20 did not continuously enhance the biomass production cycle 16 vs cycle 20 p 0 05 t test which was consistent with the slow growth performance in 80 cw this finding was also in agreement with the varied ros levels in high cw volume scenarios it was assumed that the enhanced ros level in the presence of excessively high nutrient amount i e ammonium and fa could induce oxidative stress in microalgae such as the inhibition of protein synthesis dna damage protein crosslinking and reduced photosynthetic activity chokshi et al 2017 shen et al 2020 additionally nmc cultivated in g cw achieved a 41 9 reduction in ros levels from cycle 5 to cycle 15 which was remarkably higher compared with the other four scenarios 1 85 29 2 it indicated that the improved nmc adaptation in g cw might be attributed to the ros reduction along the cultivation process considering that by the end of cycle 15 g cw showed remarkably enhanced growth performance with reduced ros level fig 2a the resulting evolved consortium was obtained from the g cw group by the end of cycle 15 rather than cycle 20 namely enmc to further confirm the improved adaptability of enmc the growth performance in 70 cw was compared again with the original nmc without ale as the control after an 8 day cultivation the growth characteristics of both groups were investigated in terms of four parameters as shown in table 2 clearly enmc showed a better growth performance with a higher dry weight on day 8 0 2750 0 0051 g l exceeding more than twice the original nmc 0 0737 0 0043 g l p 0 001 t test increased values in both the biomass productivity and specific growth rate for enmc were approximately 9 36 and 4 44 times higher than the original nmc p 0 001 t test the increased values of the doubling time of the original nmc 364 99 60 12 h further suggested reduced growth rate compared with enmc 78 12 0 87 h p 0 001 t test confirming that the evolved enmc was more adaptive in the high ammonia fa condition of 70 cw than the original nmc therefore the evolved consortium namely enmc obtained from g cw scenario was selected as the inoculum for subsequent experiments in this study 3 2 supplementation of snow and biogas enhanced emnc growth in cw 3 2 1 ca2 and mg2 in snow facilitate enmc metabolism microalgae cultivation is a water intensive process therefore it is critical to seek a reliable and low cost water supply snow is composed mostly of frozen water indicating that it might be a potential alternative to satisfy the water demand hence instead of adding fresh tap water 70 cw 30 h2o table 2 in cw the melted snow water was applied for cw dilution to a 70 level 70 cw 30 sn as expected in the cultivation conducted with snow addition a comparable and even improved biomass yield was observed on day 8 0 3103 0 0027 g l compared with the fresh water group 0 2877 0 0020 p 0 01 t test similarly the replacement of fresh water with snow also elevated the biomass productivity and growth rate significantly in addition to a lower doubling time value p 0 05 t test this result was also consistent with the ros variation which presented a significantly decreased level when snow was applied with and without sn dilution 4 87 0 03 fi 1010 cells and 5 47 0 12 fi 1010 cells respectively p 0 05 t test indicating that the snow replacement might provide a more preferable environment for enmc growth to explore the underlying explanations for the improved enmc growth performance with snow supplementation the major element concentrations in the sampled snow were analyzed as shown in fig 3 a the water soluble ca2 2 16 0 21 mg l and mg2 0 84 0 12 mg l were the two dominant chemical constituents which were 7 14 60 1 and 2 78 23 3 times higher than other compositions cl and nh4 this observation was in agreement with a previous report demonstrating that the addition of 6 2 mg l ca2 or 9 76 mg l mg2 promoted a 16 7 increase of the biomass yield in chlorella vulgaris c vulgaris compared with ca or mg free medium gorain et al 2013 similar results were also obtained in s obliquus with a 27 3 and 9 1 improvement in ca2 or mg2 supplementation conditions in this study the enhanced growth performance of enmc cultivated in 70 cw 30 sn observed in this study is therefore understandable several previous studies also exhibited accordant conclusions for example c vulgaris seldom grew in 3 n bristol medium which lacked mg2 while chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp cultivated in blue green medium showed lower cell density yield than bristol modified medium which contained ca2 and mg2 ben amor ben ayed et al 2015 chew et al 2018 however it was also remarkable that higher ca2 and mg2 concentrations might be inhibitory chen et al 2020 gorain et al 2013 for example the excess of the optimal ca2 concentration resulted in a 24 3 drop in biomass productivity of scenedesmus sp ren et al 2014 mg2 plays a pivotal role in microalgal metabolism such as chlorophyll synthesis and enzyme activation i e ribulose bisphosphate rubp carboxylase oxygenase rubisco enzyme which might be associated with the improved biomass yield chlorophyll which is an essential pigment for photosynthesis and critical in trapping light requires one mg2 ion for synthesizing each chlorophyll molecule therefore increased mg2 amount showed a positive effect on the chlorophyll synthesis chen et al 2020 rubisco is mainly responsible for the photosynthetic co2 assimilation and photorespiratory metabolism it was observed that mg deficiency led to a remarkably reduced amount of rubisco and rubisco activase only accounting for 0 47 8 of the amount under mg sufficient conditions peng et al 2015 additionally mg deficiency also inhibits photosynthesis which might be related to decreased carboxylation efficiency and reduced rate of rubp regeneration farhat et al 2016 with regard to ca2 its contribution to the microalgal growth is still blurry yet one possible explanation was that ca2 supplementation might lower the ph of cw hence decreasing the toxicity of high ammonium feagley and fenn 1998 it is also likely due to the involvement of ca2 in the maintenance of microalgal membrane stability and the cytoskeleton formation ren et al 2014 it is worth noting that ca2 as a ubiquitous intracellular second messenger has the signal transduction function which might contribute to the regulation of intracellular signaling networks sun et al 2006 this indicated that microalgal cells might need a reliable source of ca2 for growth and reproduction taken together the inclusion of ca2 and mg2 in snow as two principal components might be able to explain the enhanced enmc growth it is noteworthy that the snow in this study was collected from 10 locations near lake ontario in canada if the snow was sampled in north canada especially over the arctic it would be expected to include compositions similar to seawater de caritat et al 2005 and thereby it would require desalination before being applied for freshwater microalgae or could probably be used mainly in marine microalgae cultivation 3 2 2 mutual biogas purification and enmc growth in terms of co2 content in biogas the effect of the synthetic biogas on enmc growth was investigated to study the feasibility of enmc for purifying biogas from the sludge ad system as shown in table 2 the final biomass dw in the absence and presence of biogas were 0 2690 0 0081 and 0 3057 0 0044 g l p 0 05 t test respectively indicating an enhanced biomass yield with the biogas exposure consistent results were observed from other parameters including biomass productivity 0 0274 0 0010 vs 0 0320 0 0005 g l d growth rate 0 2102 0 0037 vs 0 2263 0 0018 d 1 doubling time during the exponential phase 79 20 1 38 vs 73 55 0 59 h and ros 5 51 0 17 vs 4 94 0 04 fi 1010cells p 0 05 for all t test further demonstrating that enmc benefited from the synthetic biogas exposure moreover over the cultivation time course the co2 content in headspace reduced while that of ch4 increased with the final content reaching 4 47 0 64 and 92 63 0 75 day 0 vs day 8 p 0 01 and 0 05 for co2 and ch4 respectively t test fig 3b the o2 content was nearly invariable remaining between 1 77 0 03 and 2 13 0 09 p 0 05 when comparing two consecutive days one way anova with tukey s test therefore the biogas was effective to stimulate enmc production which agreed with previous studies demonstrating improved microalgae biomass productivity and higher growth rate when the co2 level was above the atmospheric concentrations cheng et al 2015 prandini et al 2016 it was considered that co2 served as the carbon source and microalgae were tolerant between 20 and 50 co2 levels this might be due to induced carboxylation and repressed oxygenase activity of rubisco under increased co2 level finally leading to preferable photosynthesis additionally unlike the toxicity observed at 60 and 80 ch4 in chlorella strain kao et al 2012 the synthetic biogas with an initial ch4 level of 70 did not inhibit the enmc growth in this study possibly due to its superior adaptability it was also interesting to obtain similar o2 levels 1 77 2 13 along the cultivation period indicating that there was no o2 accumulation phenomenon as reported elsewhere bahr et al 2014 cea barcia et al 2018 although some studies reported that o2 might be among the compounds utilized in photosynthesis the o2 level during an 8 day biogas exposure was not expected to significantly affect enmc growth in the present study above all through the enmc growth in cw 78 9 of co2 in biogas was removed by enmc and the ch4 content finally reached the standard of fuel requirements 90 with o2 level outside the explosive range 0 4 indicating an excellent biogas upgrading process 3 3 establishment and long term operation of enmcs system based on the aforementioned observations a novel long term operation of the enmcs system was established and optimized by adjusting primary process parameters to achieve simultaneous bioremediation of cw and biogas and production of value added biomass fig 4 illustrates the growth profile of enmc biomass productivity nh4 n and po4 3 p removals and ph variation over time cultivated with 6 phases 3 3 1 optimization of enmcs system and biomass production the variations of biomass concentrations and productivities of enmc responding to the changes of primary parameters for the enmcs system are presented in fig 4a in phase 1 improved biomass productivity by 44 2 was observed when the influent was switched from original cw to anaerobically fermented cw this enhancement could be attributed to the fermentation configuration which tended to degrade refractory organics in cw into micro molecules such as volatile fatty acids promoting microalgal heterotrophic and mixotrophic metabolism and growth this observation was supported by the demonstrated improved biomass yield in pure microalgae system in wastewater supplemented with glycerol and glucose ge et al 2018 wang et al 2020 subsequently after 64 days when enmc cultures achieved stable growth in batch operation phase 2 where pbr was fed semi continuously to enhance the treatment capacity of the enmcs system was initiated it was obvious that in comparison with 70 phase 2a and 30 phase 2c the fill ratio of 50 employed in phase 2b obtained 1 32 fold and 1 35 fold higher biomass productivity this suggested that the selection of fill ratio is one of the critical parameters for the system performance it was assumed that the fill ratio employed directly determined the initial enmc inoculum concentration and nutrient levels after feeding the pbr both of which jointly determined the subsequent microalgal growth performance in the new cycle therefore it was returned to 50 as the optimum fill ratio in phase 3 where the feeding time effect was studied a longer feeding time of 24 h phase 3c remarkably enhanced both biomass yield and productivity compared with 1 min phase 3a and 12 h phase 3b p 0 001 one way anova with tukey s post hoc test while no significant differences were observed between phase 3c and phase 3d in which 36 h was applied p 0 05 it is probably because enmc was more adaptive to the fed batch mode by alleviating the shock effect of high ammonium in cw which normally existed in the sudden supplementation e g 1 min strategy this was also observed and demonstrated in the macroalgae system for cw treatment where step feeding was found to benefit biomass production ge and champagne 2017 additionally a relatively elongated feeding time i e 36 h might lead to insufficiency of certain essential nutrients at certain stages considering the fact that more expenses on feeding operations such as electricity consumption is required with longer feeding time 24 h rather than 36 h was selected in phase 4 in which the effect of hrt was investigated phase 4b hrt of 6 d exhibited slightly reduced biomass concentration compared to phase 4a hrt of 8 d p 0 05 one way anova with tukey s post hoc test but it was clear that phase 4b presented 24 1 and 11 3 enhanced biomass productivity than that in phase 4a and 4c hrt of 4 d respectively this indicated that enmc might have reached the stationary phase within 6 d while an insufficient hrt 4 d for the high levels of nutrient and organic loading might lead to relatively reduced density of enmc suspensions in phase 5 the pbr was closed to investigate the gas effect results showed that biomass productivity exhibited a downward trend along the cycles but this recovered achieving a final productivity of 0 3059 0 0084 g l d at the end of phase 6 when it was replaced by an open pbr this suggests that closed pbr likely inhibited enmc growth in the long term operation this observation might be explained by the build up of o2 in the closed pbr as o2 might compete with co2 for rubisco enzyme which is involved in co2 fixation and biomass generation raso et al 2012 overall the enmcs system was eventually optimized as a 24 h 50 70 fcw 30 sn semi continuous feeding system with hrt of 6 d in the open pbr 3 3 2 nutrient removals and ph variations as shown in fig 4b enmc effectively removed nh4 n and po4 3 p in most phases under long term operation finally achieving the removal efficiency of 95 6 0 13 and 90 8 0 44 respectively table s2 it is noteworthy that enmc cultures required several days of acclimation to obtain enhanced nutrient removal when the cultivation environment is switched for example as the hrt of 8 d was replaced by 6 d in phase 4b the nh4 n removal efficiency dropped from 89 4 0 29 phase 4a to 82 7 0 95 at the end of the 1st cycle in phase 4b while it gradually improved to 84 8 0 62 and 85 0 0 65 after one or two cycle adaptations in phase 4b moreover the trends of nutrient removal in the long term operation tended to follow the variations of enmc biomass concentrations fig 4c and d due to nutrient removal mostly by microalgal metabolic assimilation here only nh4 n levels rather than other nitrogen forms such as no3 n was monitored in cw as microalgae prefer nh4 n to no3 n since no redox reactions and less energy are required in nh4 n assimilation cai et al 2013 additionally the nitrate reductase which assists the reduction of no3 n is generally repressed by the existence of nh4 n indicating that no3 n assimilation might not start until nh4 n is exhausted crawford 1995 given that nitrogen was not completely depleted in all phases it is less critical to monitor the no3 n level compared with the nh4 n in addition ph values showed an overall increase pattern with slight variations fig 4d which was consistent with the trend of enmc concentration the 16 7 increase in ph values between day 0 and day 310 could easily be correlated to the enhanced microalgal photosynthetic activity as supported by multiple studies bartley et al 2014 sakarika and kornaros 2016 3 3 3 biomass settleability and biomass composition the obtained enmc biomass presented good settleability as indicated by the fast settling efficiency in 30 min figure s2 the composition of the settled slurries collected from different phases was evaluated and compared including lipid protein and carbohydrate contents specifically the lowest lipid and carbohydrate levels were obtained in phase 2b table 3 however they were almost doubled in phase 3c p 0 001 one way anova with tukey s test with similar operating parameters except for feeding time in both phases 1 min and 24 h respectively interestingly it appeared that there was an inconsistent range for biomass protein levels in all phases examined with approximately 60 of dry weight biomass although no significant differences were found among most pairs phase 3c showed the lowest protein content in biomass the underlying mechanism behind such variations was unclear a similar study was reported that the insufficient nitrogen environment induced instant carbohydrate synthesis and subsequent lipid accumulation as a long term response for energy storage nordin et al 2020 scott et al 2010 taken together the variations of the three compositions along the phases might be explained by the slower or reduced nitrogen supply as feeding time or hrt varied although nitrogen depletion or starvation was not observed so far several transcription factors have been identified in regulating lipid and carbohydrate accumulation such as nrr1 psr1 and gmdof4 sun et al 2018b however whether they could also be found in enmc and whether they were up or down regulated in the long term operation require further investigation 3 4 environmental and economic analysis for the implementation of the enmcs system the mass flows of carbon and nitrogen as well as the environmental and economic analysis were determined to evaluate the enmcs process for engineering implications as shown in fig 5 a approximately 86 1 of the influent nitrogen in cw was mostly removed by microalgal uptake in the enmcs system with approximately 9 5 nitrogen loss through bacterial metabolism the biogas was upgraded by an 86 reduction of co2 with 38 0 flowing into biomass through photosynthesis in this study the average daily flow of ravensview wwtp of 77 265 m3 d in 2019 was considered 10 of which produced 2 82 107 m3 cw per year through the sludge ad system compared to the traditional nitrification and denitrification processes fig 5b the enmcs process could annually save consumptions of 6 40 103 kg carbon sources and 1 09 107 kg oxygen and failed to produce 8 80 106 kg co2 and 1 93 106 kg sludge moreover the enmcs could capture 5 18 104 kg n y and 8 63 102 kg p y into biomass 4 8 n and 0 1 p in dry biomass ge and champagne 2016 the economic feasibility of the enmcs system was evaluated through a comprehensive economic model fig 5c fu et al 2019 the detailed calculation for each part is presented in s7 and table s3 the expenses of pbrs electricity packaging and transporting employee wages and infrastructure were all included in the total cost amounting to 7 79 107 usd y the energy cost took up 41 4 of the direct costs while the pbr construction cost was the major part of capital costs accounting for 16 4 of the total comparatively the revenue of 1 12 108 usd y from biomass could compensate for expenses related to cultivation infrastructure achieving a gross profit of 40 0 usd kg 8 63 105 kg y biomass and 0 13 usd g biomass indicating that the enmcs system was economically feasible the sensitivity analysis showed that the sensitivity of the energy profit was 1 83 7 87 times more than the other four expense categories suggesting that energy expenditure was the most influential parameter affecting the profit it is also worth noting that the system could also yield total productions of 5 01 105 kg protein 1 21 105 kg carbohydrate per year and around 6 38 104 kg lipid oil based on the 7 40 0 49 of lipid content in dw in phase 6 fig 5b the successful cw bioremediation and biogas purification in the proposed enmcs system relies on achieving high nutrient and co2 removal efficiencies while maximizing biomass productivities the access of dominant enmc and its enrichment in the system is important as this positively correlated with microalgal adaptation and tolerance to cw with over 500 mg l nh4 n further work will be conducted on microbiome analysis to characterize the advantageous deleterious and dominant species strains in the enmc additionally fcw was the preferred feed to ensure the supply of organic carbon sources for mixotrophic growth while the adjustment of several parameters including fill ratio feeding time hrt and pbr type is also critical and might require a case by case investigation for optimization the complexity of cw composition needs to be specifically characterized as well so that the light diffusion and microalgal cultivation would not be affected moreover the involvement of snow in the system will not only enhance nutrient recovery from cw in a centralized manner in wwtps but also alleviate the natural water pollution caused by snow accumulation especially in snowy regions or countries such as canada russia and iceland it is feasible to collect and store the snow in special ponds during snowy seasons for use throughout the year considering their generally vast geography there would not be significant contributions to the greenhouse gas emission and energy consumption during transportation in local areas lastly ch4 was replaced by n2 in the long term operation resulting in the lack of direct observation on the final purified ch4 levels however through the batch study 78 9 co2 was removed and over 90 ch4 content was achieved after an 8 day enmc cultivation suggesting that the enmcs system could be implemented to acheive simultaneous bioremediation of cw and biogas upgrading in wwtps 4 conclusions this study investigated the feasibility of constructing enmc using the ale technique with a gradual cw percentage increase strategy which lasted 15 cycles the effects of snow and biogas supplementation on enmc growth were also examined both of which led to a significantly enhanced biomass production an integrated enmcs system was put forward to simultaneously recover nutrients from cw and upgrade biogas enmc presented comparative growth rates and nutrient removals with a final biomass productivity of 0 3059 0 0084 g l d and nh4 n and po4 3 p removal efficiencies of 95 6 0 1 and 90 8 0 4 when the enmcs system was finally optimized as a 24 h 70 fcw 30 sn semi continuously feeding system with fill ratio of 50 and hrt of 6 d in the open pbr the variations of the above parameters also exhibited influence on enmc cell composition including carbohydrate protein and lipid content the observations in this study provided a novel and techno economically applicable approach to microalgal cultivation as well as simultaneous remediation of biogas and cw paving the way for sustainable microalgal based wastewater

conventionally ad is performed at thermophilic 55 c or mesophilic 35 c temperatures to maintain high microbial activity and treatment efficiencies zhang et al 2020 in temperate and cold regions the heating requirement for thermophilic and mesophilic ad reactors requires great energy consumption compared to conventional thermophilic and mesophilic conditions ad operation at ambient room temperature 20 c reduces the capital cost and energy consumption for reactor heating guo et al 2020 keating et al 2018 however the hydrolysis rate is often limited at ambient room temperature or lower temperatures which may result in reduced net energy yields rose et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 to improve hydrolysis efficiency pre treatment techniques and co digestion have been previously investigated zhang et al 2013 one of the low cost strategies is to use single reactor configuration with micro aeration to enhance in situ hydrolysis in ad reactors at low temperatures although oxygen is recognized as an inhibitory agent for strict anaerobes especially methanogens in ad at proper dosages it can be quickly consumed by facultative anaerobes and facilitate the hydrolysis of particulate matters and large molecules botheju and bakke 2011 jagadabhi et al 2010 johansen and bakke 2006 montalvo et al 2016 tsapekos et al 2017 zhu et al 2009 few studies have investigated the microbial

community structure and functionality are altered by changing environmental factors which form ecological niches under different oxygen concentrations micro aeration can lead to changes in microbial community composition predominant species and stable microbial niches under long term operation yu et al 2020 investigated the relationship between oxygen input dosage hydrolysis efficiency and the methane production rate of blackwater ad treatment the oxygen input can promote hydrolysis of particulate organic matters and improve the production of volatile fatty acids vfas while high oxygen

remains unclear how the microbial niches developed gradually in the micro aeration facilitated ad and the key marker microorganisms are yet to be explored in addition to the formation of microbial

methods 2 1 sequencing batch reactors five sequencing batch reactors sbrs with volumes of 1 l and working volumes of 0 71 l were fed with blackwater 1000 mg cod l collected on campus university of

calculations the hydraulic retention time hrt was sequentially reduced to allow adaptation and reach a comparable hrt with previous studies at 35 c gao et al 2019a gao et al 2020 hrt was step wise

and discussions 3 1 reactor performances affected by micro aeration the reactor methanogenesis efficiencies vfa concentrations and organic matter hydrolysis efficiencies are shown in fig 1 from stage 1 to 4 the hydrolysis efficiency was increased from 16 6 37 7 anaerobic to 41 3 53 1 with the oxygen dosage of 5 mg g 1 codfeed it reached the lowest level 17 9 26 5 with the highest oxygen dosage 150 mg g 1 codfeed which can be attributed to inhibition effect of oxygen to hydrolyzing bacteria and the adverse feedback of downstream methanogenesis and acidogenesis processes if inhibited by oxygen the anaerobic and low oxygen dosage reactors 0 5 and 10 mg g 1 codfeed showed higher methanogenesis efficiencies 18 1 40 1 20 0 50 9 15 7 46 3 respectively than the high oxygen dosage reactors of 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed 1 0 18 9 and 4 0 25 6 respectively under all hrt conditions the highest methanogenesis efficiency was observed when the lowest oxygen dosage was applied 5 mg g 1 codfeed with oxidation reduction potential orp of 180 mv supplementary fig s1 higher oxygen dosage led to higher orp 308 180 142 109 and 69 mv for 0 5 10 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed respectively supplementary fig s1 which could affect the survival and activity of methanogens other studies have reported that orp of 265 mv and 180 mv may improve methanogenesis when eliminating sulphide toxicity khanal samir and huang 2003 khanal and huang 2003 nguyen et al 2019 and intermittent micro aeration at 50 mv higher than baseline orp can be inhibitory for methane production khanal and huang 2003 the particulate cod was purposely retained in the reactor and the cod reduction from influent to effluent showed similar rates for low oxygen dosage reactors 0 5 and 10 mg g 1 codfeed supplementary fig s2 the lowest methanogenesis efficiency was observed with an oxygen dosage of 50 mg g 1 codfeed which corresponded to the lowest cod removal efficiency supplementary fig s2 indicating an impaired balance among ad steps hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis the vfa concentrations were lower in the reactors with oxygen dosages of 0 5 and 10 mg g 1 codfeed 90 269 101 325 and 108 296 mg vfa l 1 respectively in all stage stages 1 to 4 than with higher dosages of 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed 339 396 and 203 304 mg vfa l 1 respectively in all stages the differences in total vfas between the low oxygen and high oxygen groups increased from stage 1 to stage 4 the highest vfa accumulation was observed in the reactor with an oxygen input of 50 mg g 1 codfeed corresponding to the lowest methanogenesis efficiency the methanogenesis efficiency and vfa accumulation differences indicate a segregation of microbial communities between low micro aeration dosages 0 5 and 10 mg g 1 codfeed and high oxygen dosages 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed the oxygen inhibition on methanogenesis was initiated when oxygen dosage exceeded 5 mg g 1 codfeed while the acidogenesis process was not impeded when the oxygen dosage increased to 150 mg g 1 codfeed the acidogenesis process was impaired indicated by the lower vfa concentrations than those with the 50 mg g 1 codfeed in addition it is likely that the high oxygen dosage may have caused aerobic consumption of vfas as indicated by the higher co2 content in the biogas supplementary fig s3 high levels of vfa accumulation is another inhibitory factor towards methanogenesis the excessive oxygen at 150 mg oxygen g 1 codfeed resulted in vfa oxidation and mitigated vfa accumulation thus reduced vfa accumulation and improved methanogenesis were observed under the 150 mg oxygen g 1 codfeed condition as compared to the 50 mg oxygen g 1 codfeed condition 3 2 temporal variation of microbial community diversity fig 2 a shows the number of observed genera community richness in archaeal communities the archaeal communities in low range oxygen dosage reactors 0 5 and 10 mg g 1 codfeed showed generally higher richness 8 13 10 12 10 12 genera respectively than the communities of high range oxygen dosage reactors 5 9 and 7 10 genera for 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed respectively in stage 1 hrt 5 d the oxygen dosage of 50 mg g 1 codfeed greatly reduced the richness to 5 genera as compared to 13 genera in the anaerobic condition however the richness gradually recovered in the following stages the high oxygen dosage of 150 mg g 1 codfeed led to a progressive decrease of community richness from 10 to 7 genera in stage 4 hrt 2 d a negative correlation pearson s correlation coefficient r 0 96 p 0 01 was observed between the archaeal community richness and the oxygen dosage 12 12 11 9 and 7 genera for 0 5 10 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed respectively the total archaeal relative abundances was also negatively correlated with the oxygen dosage 0 94 0 58 0 41 0 28 and 0 21 for 0 5 10 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed respectively pearson s correlation coefficient r 0 97 p 0 005 indicating that higher oxygen dosage may inhibit the growth of several archaea the venn diagram in fig 2b shows the number of shared and unique archaeal genera in the last stage four genera were shared in all reactors i e methanosaeta methanosarcina methanospirillum and unidentified genera from the family of methanomassiliicoccaceae as shown in fig 2c the bacterial community richness exhibited a sharp decrease from stage 1 to 2 hrt 5 d to 4 d for all the 0 5 10 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed reactors number of genera from 562 to 384 566 to 397 532 to 375 496 to 328 and 485 to 343 respectively the number of genera further decreased with reduced hrt to 386 338 323 301 and 266 in the final stage it is likely that with gradual adaptation and lowering hrt higher organic loading rate less diverse but highly functional communities were developed due to the introduction of higher substrate loading as well as higher concentrations of inhibitory compounds the high oxygen dosage communities 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed showed lower bacterial richness probably because of oxygen inhibition on strictly anaerobic bacteria there were 153 genera shared in all reactors in the last stage fig 2d including desulfomicrobium christensenellaceae r 7 group paludibacter and sulfurovum each reactor contained unique genera and the high oxygen dosages led to less unique genera compared to the low oxygen dosages 19 19 20 30 67 unique genera for 150 50 10 5 0 mg g 1 codfeed respectively the weighted microbial community distances were evaluated using a bray curtis distance matrix and ordinated on a principal coordinate analysis pcoa plot fig 3 the archaeal communities fig 3a showed the highest variation along pcoa1 axis 55 7 of total community variance associated with the oxygen dosage a frontier was observed between the low oxygen dosage 0 5 and 10 mg g 1 codfeed and high oxygen dosage 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed conditions the second axis pcoa2 21 5 of total community variance was associated with the operational stages differentiating three clusters stage 1 stage 2 3 and stage 4 communities analysis of similarities anosim tests indicated significant community differences among oxygen dosages r 0 36 p 0 004 and among different hrts r 0 26 p 0 008 the decrease of hrt corresponds to longer temporal adaptation of microbial communities leading to higher differences among reactors similarly the bacterial communities fig 3b also exhibited clusters affected by oxygen dosage and hrt the temporal variation showed the highest impact which was presented by the pcoa1 axis explaining 30 5 of community variance along the pcoa2 axis 20 6 of community variance high oxygen dosage and low oxygen dosage communities were differentiated anosim tests indicated significantly different bacterial communities among oxygen dosages r 0 18 p 0 031 and among different hrts r 0 51 p 0 001 for both archaeal and bacterial communities the distance between high oxygen dosage and low oxygen dosage communities increased with time at stage 4 hrt of 2 d the distance between high oxygen dosage and low oxygen dosage communities was the largest compared to other stages indicating increased community divergence resulted from the combinatorial effect of oxygen dosage and temporal adaptation in accordance with the reactor performances fig 1 the microbial communities showed significantly different clusters for high and low oxygen dosage conditions for both archaea and bacteria our results show that the oxygen dosage was an important niche factor leading to microbial community clusters possibly based on their different compositions and functions which is further discussed in the following sections 3 3 microbial community composition 3 3 1 archaeal communities the relative abundances of archaeal genera based on 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing reads are shown in fig 4 different methanogens were enriched at different oxygen dosages methanosaeta abundances were higher in the three low oxygen dosage communities 17 0 50 2 than in the two high oxygen dosage communities 1 1 11 4 in all stages methanobacterium 4 3 16 6 and methanolinea 0 6 1 5 were also enriched in the three low oxygen dosage reactors in the final stage but not detected in the high oxygen dosage reactors methanosarcina were not detected in inoculum but increased during the acclimatization and grew to the third highest methanogen in the last stage 11 4 in the 5 mg g 1 codfeed oxygen dosage reactor methanospirillum and one unclassified genus in the family methanomassiliicoccaceae were higher in the high oxygen dosage reactors 25 7 26 3 and 35 0 41 1 respectively than in the low oxygen dosage reactors 7 4 8 0 and 17 7 23 4 respectively in the final stage the responses of methanogens indicate that methanosaeta and methanobacterium are sensitive to oxygen while methanospirillum and the unclassified genus in the family methanomassiliicoccaceae can tolerant different ranges of oxygen dosages 3 3 2 bacterial communities the bacterial community compositions varied in different reactors at different stages at the phylum level fig 5 bacteroidetes was the most prevalent phylum in the low oxygen dosage reactors at 0 5 10 mg g 1 codfeed 45 2 6 7 44 4 3 8 44 9 3 4 respectively followed by proteobacteria 15 6 3 2 15 7 4 2 15 9 4 1 respectively and firmicutes 13 9 1 2 16 0 3 6 15 3 11 4 respectively bacteroidetes and firmicutes are known to include functional hydrolysers and fermenters in anaerobic digestion reactors and can be promoted by low oxygen range micro aeration fu et al 2016 bacteroidetes and firmicutes decreased with the increased oxygen dosage at 50 mg g 1 codfeed 38 3 5 3 and 13 0 1 2 respectively and further decreased at 150 mg g 1 codfeed 29 1 8 2 and 8 1 0 6 respectively proteobacteria increased with a higher oxygen dosage 22 0 8 3 and 34 9 9 9 for 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed respectively at the genus level all reactors shared some abundant microorganisms supplementary fig s4 including sulfurovum desulfomicrobium christensenellaceae r 7 group and paludibacter the high oxygen dosage communities 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed showed higher abundances than the low oxygen dosage communities 0 5 and 10 mg g 1 codfeed for zoogloea dechloromonas geobacter and lentimicrobium indicating their possible enrichment in microaerophilic and acidogenic conditions the low oxygen dosage reactors were higher in relative abundances of certain bacteria including anaerocella macellibacteroides and treponema inferring their low tolerance to oxygen 3 4 differential marker microorganisms statistical analyses were performed between high and low oxygen dosage microbial niches to determine variance amongst microorganisms markers using lefse linear discriminant analysis effect size segata et al 2011 within the high and low oxygen dosage samples 122 taxa were present at significantly different levels the phylogenetic tree of the marker microorganisms is shown for phylum to order levels fig 6 a and at the genus level fig 6b 3 4 1 enrichment under low oxygen dosage at the phylum class order levels fig 6a methanogens i e methanobacteriales and methanosarcinales were enriched within the microbial communities in low oxygen dosage environments which included methanobacterium methanolinea and methanosaeta at the genus level fig 6b bacterial phyla armatimonadetes bacteroidetes deferribacteres fibrobacteres wps 2 verrucomicrobia and tenericutes were all significantly higher under the low range oxygen dosages fig 6a indicating inhibition effect on them at higher oxygen dosages the enriched bacteria included syntrophic vfa degraders e g syntrophobacteriales are known as syntrophic propionate fermenters zhang et al 2009 syntrophomonas degrade butyrate muller et al 2010 the syntrophic partnership between these bacteria and methanogens may explain the lower levels of vfa accumulation and higher methanogenesis at low oxygen dosages than high oxygen dosages fig 1 the enhanced methanogenesis and vfa utilization provide positive feedback to the hydrolysis whereas high vfa concentrations can inhibit the hydrolysis step some bacteria have been reported to ferment under anaerobic conditions and degrade long chain fatty acids e g microthrix mcilroy et al 2013 cytophaga anderson and ordal 1961 bachmann 1955 starns et al 2014 sja 88 hatamoto et al 2007 desulfomicrobium

dehalobacterium chen et al 2017 acidaminobacter stams and hansen 1984 anaerovorax matthies et al 2000 sedimentibacter imachi et al 2016 and victivallis zoetendal et al 2003 in the reactor of 5 mg g 1 codfeed two bacteroidetes genera m2pb4 65 termite group and vadinha17 and desulfomicrobium were higher than in other reactors supplementary fig s4 bacteroidetes are important hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria fu et al 2016 and desulfomicrobium can utilize propionate to produce acetate xiong et al 2017 which may have contributed to the higher hydrolysis and methanogenesis efficiencies at 5 mg g 1 codfeed fig 1 3 4 2 enrichment under high oxygen dosages the high oxygen dosage environments led to significantly higher abundances of the phyla chlorobi and wwe1 including the orders ignavibacteriales and cloacamonales respectively fig 6a ignavibacteriales contain facultative anaerobic species with functions of producing glycoside hydrolases for plant biomass deconstruction hiras et al 2016 and cellulolytic activity liu et al 2012 cloacamonales phylum wwe1 have been reported to be enriched in cellulose degradation processes in anaerobic digestion limam et al 2014 even though these hydrolytic bacteria are enriched under high oxygen dosages their activity may be negatively affected by the accumulated vfas since there is a lack of syntrophic vfa degradation and methanogenesis the enriched bacteria showed resistance to oxygen in anaerobic environment elusimicrobiales contains a single species elusimicrobium minutum which is a facultative anaerobic ultramicrobacterium and has an oxygen stress protection gene cluster to resist oxygen herlemann et al 2009 genera zoogloea and dechloromonas order rhodocyclales are commonly reported in anaerobic aerobic wastewater treatment systems operated for biological nutrient removal zoogloea are aerobic and dechloromonas are facultative anaerobic chemoorganoheterotrophic organisms that are rapidly selected in the presence of organic matter and a terminal electron acceptor like dissolved oxygen saunders et al 2016 weissbrodt et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 thiotrichales genus thiothrix fig 6b is aerobic or microaerophilic garrity et al 2005 the genus clostridium can resist microoxic conditions by consuming oxygen then resume growth without oxygen with vfa production functions e g c acetobutylicum kawasaki et al 2005 and c butyricum kawasaki et al 1998 the sulfate reducing bacteria desulfovibrio desulfobacter and desulforhopalus can tolerate low level oxygen cypionka et al 1985 fournier et al 2003 van niel and gottschal 1998 the sulfur oxidizing bacteria sulfuricurvum were also enriched in this study and were reported to be facultative anaerobic kodama and watanabe 2004 3 5 relative abundances of mges and args as shown in fig 7 the mobile gene elements mges and args were higher in the low oxygen dosage conditions than in the high oxygen dosage conditions two way anova test hrt and oxygen dosage showed that all the args were significantly correlated with the oxygen dosage applied p 0 05 but not hrt nor the interacted effect of hrt and oxygen p 0 05 supplementary table s2 implying that the micro aeration dosages play a significant role in controlling the abundances of mges and args bacteria can transfer resistance genes using mges such as integrons and plasmids which were quantified using the class 1 integrase gene inti1 ploy et al 2000 and incp 1 plasmid rk2 specific gene korb kornacki et al 1987 pallares vega et al 2019 the relative abundance of korb was higher in all the reactors than blackwater while inti1 increased in low oxygen communities but not in high oxygen dosage communities 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed since both mges showed relatively low abundances in the feeding blackwater their increases in the reactors were likely induced by the oxygen dosages and enriched microbial community rather than from the feeding oxygen level has been found to affect the mges in other studies a study comparing aerobic activated sludge and anaerobic digestion sludge showed that ad had higher integrons and conjugative transposons but lower plasmids than the aerobic sludge osińska 2019 to the contrary another study found that integron and plasmids were much higher in the aerobic sludge than in the ad sludge tao et al 2016 as shown in fig 7 the tetm was relatively low in blackwater and inoculum while it increased in low oxygen dosage communities and remained low in high oxygen dosage communities the ermb was relatively higher than tetm in blackwater and inoculum and varied temporally in the final stage the 150 mg g 1 codfeed dosage reactor showed the lowest tetm and ermb similarly sul1 and sul2 were relatively higher in the low oxygen dosage communities than in high oxygen dosage communities while blactx m and qnrs were not abundant in blackwater inoculum or sbrs the mantel test was performed to examine the correlation pearson s product moment correlation r 0 34 between microbial community and args abundances with p level 0 01 canonical correspondence analysis cca also shows that arg levels are correlated with low oxygen dosage communities supplementary fig s5 p 0 01 indicating that the arg profiles were affected largely by the indigenous microbial community the microbial communities host more mges inti1 and korb in low oxygen conditions than in high oxygen micro aerobic processes which may lead to similar trends of the prevalence of the measured args our study was not able to identify which taxa contributed to the mges and future studies using metagenomic approaches are suggested to relate the mges and specific species contributions du et al 2015 reported that anaerobic and anoxic basins perform better than aerobic basin in removing args sul1 inti tetx tetg tetw in the anaerobic anoxic aerobic wastewater treatment process while the ratio of args to 16s rrna gene in the sludge remained the same it was hypothesized that microorganisms have lower bioactivity under anaerobic condition compared to aerobic condition thus limiting the propagation of args du et al 2015 pei et al 2007 however agreeing to our results some studies showed that ad sludge host more args than aerobic sludge yang et al 2014 showed that ad sludge carried more args than aerobic activated sludge using metagenomic sequencing the average abundance of args in activated sludge 0 2 copy of args per cell was less than ad sludge 0 43 copy of args per cell yin et al 2019 it has been reported that aerobic processes had better arg reduction than anaerobic processes in wastewater treatment systems tao et al 2014 yuan et al 2016 the mechanisms leading to more args in ad than in aerobic sludge include a few hypotheses oxygen concentrations decrease towards the biofilm interior and the lower oxygen and lower metabolic activity were correlated with higher antibiotic tolerance walters et al 2003 indicating that lower metabolic activity in anaerobic conditions may result in higher relative arg levels compared to aerobic conditions another theory is that aerobic sludge microorganisms host higher proportions of efflux pump and target modification genes than anaerobic sludge as revealed by metagenomic analysis christgen et al 2015 thus aerobic and anaerobic aerobic sequence reactors were more effective in reducing args than the anaerobic reactors we compared the predicted efflux pump genes resulted from picrust2 douglas et al 2020 analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequences using kegg antimicrobial resistance gene database kanehisa 2018 supplementary table s3 which revealed that a few genes were higher in the high oxygen dosage conditions including efflux pumps adeabc k18143 k18144 k18145 k18146 abca k18104 mexjk oprm k18303 bpeef oprc k18900 k18901 k18902 k18903 and mexpq opme k19591 supplementary fig s6 metagenomic analysis is suggested to elucidate the true efflux pump gene abundances using isolated escherichia coli it was remonstrated that semi aerobic condition can reduce gene transfer by plasmids between e coli in landfill leachate compared to anaerobic condition threedeach et al 2012 a recent study reported the impact of redox conditions on conjugative gene transfer frequency in wastewater treatment processes where aerobic conditions showed lower gene transfer than anaerobic conditions jong et al 2020 it demonstrated that protozoa predation under aerobic conditions contributed to plasmid reduction but other mechanisms of the oxygen stress on arg transfer remains unclear our results showed that the gene transfer by plasmids and class 1 integrons were less when oxygen was supplied at 50 150 mg g 1 codfeed than at 0 10 mg g 1 codfeed leading to reduced args in the reactor moreover different microorganisms vary in abilities of horizontal gene transfer and antibiotic resistance yang et al 2014 yin et al 2019 thus microbial community composition is a key factor in determining relative arg levels combining the reactor performance results and the prevalence of mges and args the low oxygen dosage conditions showed higher hydrolysis and methanogenesis efficiencies fig 1 but also higher levels of mges and args fig 7 than the high oxygen dosage conditions suggesting that operational strategies using aerobic or high dosage micro aerobic processes can help to combat args in wastewater treatment processes applying aerobic or high dosage micro aerobic conditions before discharging biosolids to the environment may help to reduce arg transfer another strategy is to use high dosage micro aeration in ad process for harvesting vfas meanwhile reducing args 4 conclusions anaerobic digestion of blackwater at ambient room temperature can be improved by micro aeration at proper dosages different oxygen dosages 0 5 10 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed were applied to anaerobic sequencing batch reactors varying micro aeration dosages resulted in significant differences in archaeal and bacterial communities p 0 05 the community dissimilarity beta diversity and reactor performance differences indicated the formation of different microbial ecological niches namely a low oxygen dosage niche 0 5 and 10 mg g 1 codfeed and a high oxygen dosage niche 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed the low oxygen dosage niche 0 10 mg g 1 codfeed functioned well for hydrolysis and methanogenesis while high oxygen dosage niche 50 150 mg g 1 codfeed led to vfa accumulation statistical analysis using linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse revealed the differential marker microorganisms in these two niches anaerobic syntrophic bacteria e g syntrophomonas and certain methanogens methanobacterium methanolinea and methanosaeta were enriched in the low oxygen dosage niche facultative anaerobic bacteria and aerobic bacteria were markers of the high oxygen dosage niche e g ignavibacteriales cloacamonales rhodocyclales since blackwater may contain substances that stimulate args the args and related mges in blackwater and in the reactors were quantified relatively with reference to total bacteria the prevalence of the measured args tetm ermb sul1 sul2 blactx m were higher in the low oxygen dosage niche samples possibly due to the higher mges inti1 and korb and distinct microbial community compositions the application of micro aeration for blackwater treatment is greatly affected by the oxygen dosage as it determines the microbial community niche as well as arg prevalence collectively this study highlights that appropriate oxygen input to ad systems can help to manage the reactor performance and arg levels which provides a strategy for future ad applications declaration of competing interest

conventionally ad is performed at thermophilic 55 c or mesophilic 35 c temperatures to maintain high microbial activity and treatment efficiencies zhang et al 2020 in temperate and cold regions the heating requirement for thermophilic and mesophilic ad reactors requires great energy consumption compared to conventional thermophilic and mesophilic conditions ad operation at ambient room temperature 20 c reduces the capital cost and energy consumption for reactor heating guo et al 2020 keating et al 2018 however the hydrolysis rate is often limited at ambient room temperature or lower temperatures which may result in reduced net energy yields rose et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 to improve hydrolysis efficiency pre treatment techniques and co digestion have been previously investigated zhang et al 2013 one of the low cost strategies is to use single reactor configuration with micro aeration to enhance in situ hydrolysis in ad reactors at low temperatures although oxygen is recognized as an inhibitory agent for strict anaerobes especially methanogens in ad at proper dosages it can be quickly consumed by facultative anaerobes and facilitate the hydrolysis of particulate matters and large molecules botheju and bakke 2011 jagadabhi et al 2010 johansen and bakke 2006 montalvo et al 2016 tsapekos et al 2017 zhu et al 2009 few studies have investigated the microbial community dynamics caused by micro aeration in ad processes either in batch experiments duarte et al 2018 fu et al 2016 or in continuously operated reactors nguyen et al 2019 yu et al 2020 microbial community structure and functionality are altered by changing environmental factors which form ecological niches under different oxygen concentrations micro aeration can lead to changes in microbial community composition predominant species and stable microbial niches under long term operation yu et al 2020 investigated the relationship between oxygen input dosage hydrolysis efficiency and the methane production rate of blackwater ad treatment the oxygen input can promote hydrolysis of particulate organic matters and improve the production of volatile fatty acids vfas while high oxygen dosages may inhibit strict anaerobic bacteria and methanogens and lead to inhibited methane production given the different end products methane or vfas controlled by the micro aeration strategy it remains unclear how the microbial niches developed gradually in the micro aeration facilitated ad and the key marker microorganisms are yet to be explored in addition to the formation of microbial niches micro aeration may affect the prevalence of human associated pollutants such as antimicrobial resistance genes args of particular concern wastewater treatment systems are recognized as

2018 most studies have focused on centralized municipal wastewater treatment systems studies on decentralized systems are limited further there have been no studies to date that have investigated arg prevalence in microbial communities in ads treating blackwater since blackwater contains complex organic substrates and human associated args it continuously introduces args to the ad microbial communities comparison of different wastewater types revealed that human feces contain higher args than mixed source municipal wastewater yee et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 ad treatment

ad sludge carried more args than aerobic sludge christgen et al 2015 yang et al 2014 yin et al 2019 yuan et al 2016 no studies have investigated the effects of different oxygen levels on args in ad systems there is a need to better understand dynamics of populations carrying args in the micro aeration conditions and how they are affected by oxygen dosages in order to provide insights into the association between microbial niches and arg prevalence the aims of this study were to i investigate the microbial niches formed by micro aeration during blackwater anaerobic digestion at ambient room temperature and reveal the marker microorganisms in different niches and ii examine the impacts of oxygen dosages on the prevalence of args and the variation of microbial communities 2 material and

pallares vega et al 2019 were relatively quantified including mobile gene elements class 1 integrase inti1 and korb which is specific for incp 1 plasmid rk2 and args tetracyclines tetm macrolides ermb sulfonamides sul1 and sul2 extended spectrum beta lactamases blactx m and fluoroquinolones qnrs the bacterial rna polymerase beta subunit rpob gene was quantified with qpcr and standard curves using the method described in florentino et al 2019 the relative abundance of args with reference to bacterial rpob was used to represent the prevalence of args 2 c t r p o b c t t a r g e t compared to 16s rrna gene rpob has a key advantage of harbouring only a single copy in the genome of microbial cells dahllöf et al 2000 the primers and conditions are summarized in supplementary table s1 3 results and discussions 3 1 reactor performances affected by micro aeration the reactor methanogenesis efficiencies vfa concentrations and organic matter hydrolysis efficiencies are shown in fig 1 from stage 1 to 4 the hydrolysis efficiency was increased from 16 6 37 7 anaerobic to 41 3 53 1 with the oxygen dosage of 5 mg g 1 codfeed it reached the lowest level 17 9 26 5 with the highest oxygen dosage 150 mg g 1 codfeed which can be attributed to inhibition effect of oxygen to hydrolyzing bacteria and the adverse feedback of downstream methanogenesis and acidogenesis processes if inhibited by oxygen the anaerobic and low oxygen dosage reactors 0 5 and 10 mg g 1 codfeed showed higher methanogenesis efficiencies 18 1 40 1 20 0 50 9 15 7 46 3 respectively than the high oxygen dosage reactors of 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed 1 0 18 9 and 4 0 25 6 respectively under all hrt conditions the highest methanogenesis efficiency was observed when the lowest oxygen dosage was applied 5 mg g 1 codfeed with oxidation reduction potential orp of 180 mv supplementary fig s1 higher oxygen dosage led to higher orp 308 180 142 109 and 69 mv for 0 5 10 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed respectively supplementary fig s1 which could affect the survival and activity of methanogens other studies have reported that orp of 265 mv and 180 mv may improve methanogenesis when eliminating sulphide toxicity khanal samir and huang 2003 khanal and huang 2003 nguyen et al 2019 and intermittent micro aeration at 50 mv higher than baseline orp can be inhibitory for methane production khanal and huang 2003 the particulate cod was purposely retained in the reactor and the cod reduction from influent to effluent showed similar rates for low oxygen dosage reactors 0 5 and 10 mg g 1 codfeed supplementary fig s2 the lowest methanogenesis efficiency was observed with an oxygen dosage of 50 mg g 1 codfeed which corresponded to the lowest cod removal efficiency supplementary fig s2 indicating an impaired balance among ad steps hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis the vfa concentrations were lower in the reactors with oxygen dosages of 0 5 and 10 mg g 1 codfeed 90 269 101 325 and 108 296 mg vfa l 1 respectively in all stage stages 1 to 4 than with higher dosages of 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed 339 396 and 203 304 mg vfa l 1 respectively in all stages the differences in total vfas between the low oxygen and high oxygen groups increased from stage 1 to stage 4 the highest vfa accumulation was observed in the reactor with an oxygen input of 50 mg g 1 codfeed corresponding to the lowest methanogenesis efficiency the methanogenesis efficiency and vfa accumulation differences indicate a segregation of microbial communities between low micro aeration dosages 0 5 and 10 mg g 1 codfeed and high oxygen dosages 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed the oxygen inhibition on methanogenesis was initiated when oxygen dosage exceeded 5 mg g 1 codfeed while the acidogenesis process was not impeded when the oxygen dosage increased to 150 mg g 1 codfeed the acidogenesis process was impaired indicated by the lower vfa concentrations than those with the 50 mg g 1 codfeed in addition it is likely that the high oxygen dosage may have caused aerobic consumption of vfas as indicated by the higher co2 content in the biogas supplementary fig s3 high levels of vfa accumulation is another inhibitory factor towards methanogenesis the excessive oxygen at 150 mg oxygen g 1 codfeed resulted in vfa oxidation and mitigated vfa accumulation thus reduced vfa accumulation and improved methanogenesis were observed under the 150 mg oxygen g 1 codfeed condition as compared to the 50 mg oxygen g 1 codfeed condition 3 2 temporal variation of microbial community diversity fig 2 a shows the number of observed genera community richness in archaeal communities the archaeal communities in low range oxygen dosage reactors 0 5 and 10 mg g 1 codfeed showed generally higher richness 8 13 10 12 10 12 genera respectively than the communities of high range oxygen dosage reactors 5 9 and 7 10 genera for 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed respectively in stage 1 hrt 5 d the oxygen dosage of 50 mg g 1 codfeed greatly reduced the richness to 5 genera as compared to 13 genera in the anaerobic condition however the richness gradually recovered in the following stages the high oxygen dosage of 150 mg g 1 codfeed led to a progressive decrease of community richness from 10 to 7 genera in stage 4 hrt 2 d a negative correlation pearson s correlation coefficient r 0 96 p 0 01 was observed between the archaeal community richness and the oxygen dosage 12 12 11 9 and 7 genera for 0 5 10 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed respectively the total archaeal relative abundances was also negatively correlated with the oxygen dosage 0 94 0 58 0 41 0 28 and 0 21 for 0 5 10 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed respectively pearson s correlation coefficient r 0 97 p 0 005 indicating that higher oxygen dosage may inhibit the growth of several archaea the venn diagram in fig 2b shows the number of shared and unique archaeal genera in the last stage four genera were shared in all reactors i e methanosaeta methanosarcina methanospirillum and unidentified genera from the family of methanomassiliicoccaceae as shown in fig 2c the bacterial community richness exhibited a sharp decrease from stage 1 to 2 hrt 5 d to 4 d for all the 0 5 10 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed reactors number of genera from 562 to 384 566 to 397 532 to 375 496 to 328 and 485 to 343 respectively the number of genera further decreased with reduced hrt to 386 338 323 301 and 266 in the final stage it is likely that with gradual adaptation and lowering hrt higher organic loading rate less diverse but highly functional communities were developed due to the introduction of higher substrate loading as well as higher concentrations of inhibitory compounds the high oxygen dosage communities 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed showed lower bacterial richness probably because of oxygen inhibition on strictly anaerobic bacteria there were 153 genera shared in all reactors in the last stage fig 2d including desulfomicrobium christensenellaceae r 7 group paludibacter and sulfurovum each reactor contained unique genera and the high oxygen dosages led to less unique genera compared to the low oxygen dosages 19 19 20 30 67 unique genera for 150 50 10 5 0 mg g 1 codfeed respectively the weighted microbial community distances were evaluated using a bray curtis distance matrix and ordinated on a principal coordinate analysis pcoa plot fig 3 the archaeal communities fig 3a showed the highest variation along pcoa1 axis 55 7 of total community variance associated with the oxygen dosage a frontier was observed between the low oxygen dosage 0 5 and 10 mg g 1 codfeed and high oxygen dosage 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed conditions the second axis pcoa2 21 5 of total community variance was associated with the operational stages differentiating three clusters stage 1 stage 2 3 and stage 4 communities analysis of similarities anosim tests indicated significant community differences among oxygen dosages r 0 36 p 0 004 and among different hrts r 0 26 p 0 008 the decrease of hrt corresponds to longer temporal adaptation of microbial communities leading to higher differences among reactors similarly the bacterial communities fig 3b also exhibited clusters affected by oxygen dosage and hrt the temporal variation showed the highest impact which was presented by the pcoa1 axis explaining 30 5 of community variance along the pcoa2 axis 20 6 of community variance high oxygen dosage and low oxygen dosage communities were differentiated anosim tests indicated significantly different bacterial communities among oxygen dosages r 0 18 p 0 031 and among different hrts r 0 51 p 0 001 for both archaeal and bacterial communities the distance between high oxygen dosage and low oxygen dosage communities increased with time at stage 4 hrt of 2 d the distance between high oxygen dosage and low oxygen dosage communities was the largest compared to other stages indicating increased community divergence resulted from the combinatorial effect of oxygen dosage and temporal adaptation in accordance with the reactor performances fig 1 the microbial communities showed significantly different clusters for high and low oxygen dosage conditions for both archaea and bacteria our results show that the oxygen dosage was an important niche factor leading to microbial community clusters possibly based on their different compositions and functions which is further discussed in the following sections 3 3 microbial community composition 3 3 1 archaeal communities the relative abundances of archaeal genera based on 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing reads are shown in fig 4 different methanogens were enriched at different oxygen dosages methanosaeta abundances were higher in the three low oxygen dosage communities 17 0 50 2 than in the two high oxygen dosage communities 1 1 11 4 in all stages methanobacterium 4 3 16 6 and methanolinea 0 6 1 5 were also enriched in the three low oxygen dosage reactors in the final stage but not detected in the high oxygen dosage reactors methanosarcina were not detected in inoculum but increased during the acclimatization and grew to the third highest methanogen in the last stage 11 4 in the 5 mg g 1 codfeed oxygen dosage reactor methanospirillum and one unclassified genus in the family methanomassiliicoccaceae were higher in the high oxygen dosage reactors 25 7 26 3 and 35 0 41 1 respectively than in the low oxygen dosage reactors 7 4 8 0 and 17 7 23 4 respectively in the final stage the responses of methanogens indicate that methanosaeta and methanobacterium are sensitive to oxygen while methanospirillum and the unclassified genus in the family methanomassiliicoccaceae can tolerant different ranges of oxygen dosages 3 3 2 bacterial communities the bacterial community compositions varied in different reactors at different stages at the phylum level fig 5 bacteroidetes was the most prevalent phylum in the low oxygen dosage reactors at 0 5 10 mg g 1 codfeed 45 2 6 7 44 4 3 8 44 9 3 4 respectively followed by proteobacteria 15 6 3 2 15 7 4 2 15 9 4 1 respectively and firmicutes 13 9 1 2 16 0 3 6 15 3 11 4 respectively bacteroidetes and firmicutes are known to include functional hydrolysers and fermenters in anaerobic digestion reactors and can be promoted by low oxygen range micro aeration fu et al 2016 bacteroidetes and firmicutes decreased with the increased oxygen dosage at 50 mg g 1 codfeed 38 3 5 3 and 13 0 1 2 respectively and further decreased at 150 mg g 1 codfeed 29 1 8 2 and 8 1 0 6 respectively proteobacteria increased with a higher oxygen dosage 22 0 8 3 and 34 9 9 9 for 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed respectively at the genus level all reactors shared some abundant microorganisms supplementary fig s4 including sulfurovum desulfomicrobium christensenellaceae r 7 group and paludibacter the high oxygen dosage communities 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed showed higher abundances than the low oxygen dosage communities 0 5 and 10 mg g 1 codfeed for zoogloea dechloromonas geobacter and lentimicrobium indicating their possible enrichment in microaerophilic and acidogenic conditions the low oxygen dosage reactors were higher in relative abundances of certain bacteria including anaerocella macellibacteroides and treponema inferring their low tolerance to oxygen 3 4 differential marker microorganisms statistical analyses were performed between high and low oxygen dosage microbial niches to determine variance amongst microorganisms markers using lefse linear discriminant analysis effect size segata et al 2011 within the high and low oxygen dosage samples 122 taxa were present at significantly different levels the phylogenetic tree of the marker microorganisms is shown for phylum to order levels fig 6 a and at the genus level fig 6b 3 4 1 enrichment under low oxygen dosage at the phylum class order levels fig 6a methanogens i e methanobacteriales and methanosarcinales were enriched within the microbial communities in low oxygen dosage environments which included methanobacterium methanolinea and methanosaeta at the genus level fig 6b bacterial phyla armatimonadetes bacteroidetes deferribacteres fibrobacteres wps 2 verrucomicrobia and tenericutes were all significantly higher under the low range oxygen dosages fig 6a indicating inhibition effect on them at higher oxygen dosages the enriched bacteria included syntrophic vfa degraders e g syntrophobacteriales are known as syntrophic propionate fermenters zhang et al 2009 syntrophomonas degrade butyrate muller et al 2010 the syntrophic partnership between these bacteria and methanogens may explain the lower levels of vfa accumulation and higher methanogenesis at low oxygen dosages than high oxygen dosages fig 1 the enhanced methanogenesis and vfa utilization provide positive feedback to the hydrolysis whereas high vfa concentrations can inhibit the hydrolysis step some bacteria have been reported to ferment under anaerobic conditions and degrade long chain fatty acids e g microthrix mcilroy et al 2013 cytophaga anderson and ordal 1961 bachmann 1955 starns et al 2014 sja 88 hatamoto et al 2007 desulfomicrobium copeland et al 2009 several genera can survive under anaerobic meso aerophilic environments e g macellibacteroides jabari et al 2012 petrimonas grabowski et al 2005 proteocatella pikuta et al 2009 dehalobacterium chen et al 2017 acidaminobacter stams and hansen 1984 anaerovorax matthies et al 2000 sedimentibacter imachi et al 2016 and victivallis zoetendal et al 2003 in the reactor of 5 mg g 1 codfeed two bacteroidetes genera m2pb4 65 termite group and vadinha17 and desulfomicrobium were higher than in other reactors supplementary fig s4 bacteroidetes are important hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria fu et al 2016 and desulfomicrobium can utilize propionate to produce acetate xiong et al 2017 which may have contributed to the higher hydrolysis and methanogenesis efficiencies at 5 mg g 1 codfeed fig 1 3 4 2 enrichment under high oxygen dosages the high oxygen dosage environments led to significantly higher abundances of the phyla chlorobi and wwe1 including the orders ignavibacteriales and cloacamonales respectively fig 6a ignavibacteriales contain facultative anaerobic species with functions of producing glycoside hydrolases for plant biomass deconstruction hiras et al 2016 and cellulolytic activity liu et al 2012 cloacamonales phylum wwe1 have been reported to be enriched in cellulose degradation processes in anaerobic digestion limam et al 2014 even though these hydrolytic bacteria are enriched under high oxygen dosages their activity may be negatively affected by the accumulated vfas since there is a lack of syntrophic vfa degradation and methanogenesis the enriched bacteria showed resistance to oxygen in anaerobic environment elusimicrobiales contains a single species elusimicrobium minutum which is a facultative anaerobic ultramicrobacterium and has an oxygen stress protection gene cluster to resist oxygen herlemann et al 2009 genera zoogloea and dechloromonas order rhodocyclales are commonly reported in anaerobic aerobic wastewater treatment systems operated for biological nutrient removal zoogloea are aerobic and dechloromonas are facultative anaerobic chemoorganoheterotrophic organisms that are rapidly selected in the presence of organic matter and a terminal electron acceptor like dissolved oxygen saunders et al 2016 weissbrodt et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 thiotrichales genus thiothrix fig 6b is aerobic or microaerophilic garrity et al 2005 the genus clostridium can resist microoxic conditions by consuming oxygen then resume growth without oxygen with vfa production functions e g c acetobutylicum kawasaki et al 2005 and c butyricum kawasaki et al 1998 the sulfate reducing bacteria desulfovibrio desulfobacter and desulforhopalus can tolerate low level oxygen cypionka et al 1985 fournier et al 2003 van niel and gottschal 1998 the sulfur oxidizing bacteria sulfuricurvum were also enriched in this study and were reported to be facultative anaerobic kodama and watanabe 2004 3 5 relative abundances of mges and args as shown in fig 7 the mobile gene elements mges and args were higher in the low oxygen dosage conditions than in the high oxygen dosage conditions two way anova test hrt and oxygen dosage showed that all the args were significantly correlated with the oxygen dosage applied p 0 05 but not hrt nor the interacted effect of hrt and oxygen p 0 05 supplementary table s2 implying that the micro aeration dosages play a significant role in controlling the abundances of mges and args bacteria can transfer resistance genes using mges such as integrons and plasmids which were quantified using the class 1 integrase gene inti1 ploy et al 2000 and incp 1 plasmid rk2 specific gene korb kornacki et al 1987 pallares vega et al 2019 the relative abundance of korb was higher in all the reactors than blackwater while inti1 increased in low oxygen communities but not in high oxygen dosage communities 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed since both mges showed relatively low abundances in the feeding blackwater their increases in the reactors were likely induced by the oxygen dosages and enriched microbial community rather than from the feeding oxygen level has been found to affect the mges in other studies a study comparing aerobic activated sludge and anaerobic digestion sludge showed that ad had higher integrons and conjugative transposons but lower plasmids than the aerobic sludge osińska 2019 to the contrary another study found that integron and plasmids were much higher in the aerobic sludge than in the ad sludge tao et al 2016 as shown in fig 7 the tetm was relatively low in blackwater and inoculum while it increased in low oxygen dosage communities and remained low in high oxygen dosage communities the ermb was relatively higher than tetm in blackwater and inoculum and varied temporally in the final stage the 150 mg g 1 codfeed dosage reactor showed the lowest tetm and ermb similarly sul1 and sul2 were relatively higher in the low oxygen dosage communities than in high oxygen dosage communities while blactx m and qnrs were not abundant in blackwater inoculum or sbrs the mantel test was performed to examine the correlation pearson s product moment correlation r 0 34 between microbial community and args abundances with p level 0 01 canonical correspondence analysis cca also shows that arg levels are correlated with low oxygen dosage communities supplementary fig s5 p 0 01 indicating that the arg profiles were affected largely by the indigenous microbial community the microbial communities host more mges inti1 and korb in low oxygen conditions than in high oxygen micro aerobic processes which may lead to similar trends of the prevalence of the measured args our study was not able to identify which taxa contributed to the mges and future studies using metagenomic approaches are suggested to relate the mges and specific species contributions du et al 2015 reported that anaerobic and anoxic basins perform better than aerobic basin in removing args sul1 inti tetx tetg tetw in the anaerobic anoxic aerobic wastewater treatment process while the ratio of args to 16s rrna gene in the sludge remained the same it was hypothesized that microorganisms have lower bioactivity under anaerobic condition compared to aerobic condition thus limiting the propagation of args du et al 2015 pei et al 2007 however agreeing to our results some studies showed that ad sludge host more args than aerobic sludge yang et al 2014 showed that ad sludge carried more args than aerobic activated sludge using metagenomic sequencing the average abundance of args in activated sludge 0 2 copy of args per cell was less than ad sludge 0 43 copy of args per cell yin et al 2019 it has been reported that aerobic processes had better arg reduction than anaerobic processes in wastewater treatment systems tao et al 2014 yuan et al 2016 the mechanisms leading to more args in ad than in aerobic sludge include a few hypotheses oxygen concentrations decrease towards the biofilm interior and the lower oxygen and lower metabolic activity were correlated with higher antibiotic tolerance walters et al 2003 indicating that lower metabolic activity in anaerobic conditions may result in higher relative arg levels compared to aerobic conditions another theory is that aerobic sludge microorganisms host higher proportions of efflux pump and target modification genes than anaerobic sludge as revealed by metagenomic analysis christgen et al 2015 thus aerobic and anaerobic aerobic sequence reactors were more effective in reducing args than the anaerobic reactors we compared the predicted efflux pump genes resulted from picrust2 douglas et al 2020 analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequences using kegg antimicrobial resistance gene database kanehisa 2018 supplementary table s3 which revealed that a few genes were higher in the high oxygen dosage conditions including efflux pumps adeabc k18143 k18144 k18145 k18146 abca k18104 mexjk oprm k18303 bpeef oprc k18900 k18901 k18902 k18903 and mexpq opme k19591 supplementary fig s6 metagenomic analysis is suggested to elucidate the true efflux pump gene abundances using isolated escherichia coli it was remonstrated that semi aerobic condition can reduce gene transfer by plasmids between e coli in landfill leachate compared to anaerobic condition threedeach et al 2012 a recent study reported the impact of redox conditions on conjugative gene transfer frequency in wastewater treatment processes where aerobic conditions showed lower gene transfer than anaerobic conditions jong et al 2020 it demonstrated that protozoa predation under aerobic conditions contributed to plasmid reduction but other mechanisms of the oxygen stress on arg transfer remains unclear our results showed that the gene transfer by plasmids and class 1 integrons were less when oxygen was supplied at 50 150 mg g 1 codfeed than at 0 10 mg g 1 codfeed leading to reduced args in the reactor moreover different microorganisms vary in abilities of horizontal gene transfer and antibiotic resistance yang et al 2014 yin et al 2019 thus microbial community composition is a key factor in determining relative arg levels combining the reactor performance results and the prevalence of mges and args the low oxygen dosage conditions showed higher hydrolysis and methanogenesis efficiencies fig 1 but also higher levels of mges and args fig 7 than the high oxygen dosage conditions suggesting that operational strategies using aerobic or high dosage micro aerobic processes can help to combat args in wastewater treatment processes applying aerobic or high dosage micro aerobic conditions before discharging biosolids to the environment may help to reduce arg transfer another strategy is to use high dosage micro aeration in ad process for harvesting vfas meanwhile reducing args 4 conclusions anaerobic digestion of blackwater at ambient room temperature can be improved by micro aeration at proper dosages different oxygen dosages 0 5 10 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed were applied to anaerobic sequencing batch reactors varying micro aeration dosages resulted in significant differences in archaeal and bacterial communities p 0 05 the community dissimilarity beta diversity and reactor performance differences indicated the formation of different microbial ecological niches namely a low oxygen dosage niche 0 5 and 10 mg g 1 codfeed and a high oxygen dosage niche 50 and 150 mg g 1 codfeed the low oxygen dosage niche 0 10 mg g 1 codfeed functioned well for hydrolysis and methanogenesis while high oxygen dosage niche 50 150 mg g 1 codfeed led to vfa accumulation statistical analysis using linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse revealed the differential marker microorganisms in these two niches anaerobic syntrophic bacteria e g syntrophomonas and certain methanogens methanobacterium methanolinea and methanosaeta were enriched in the low oxygen dosage niche facultative anaerobic bacteria and aerobic bacteria were markers of the high oxygen dosage niche e g ignavibacteriales cloacamonales rhodocyclales since blackwater may contain substances that stimulate args the args and related mges in blackwater and in the reactors were quantified relatively with reference to total bacteria the prevalence of the measured args tetm ermb sul1 sul2 blactx m were higher in the low oxygen dosage niche samples possibly due to the higher mges inti1 and korb and distinct microbial community compositions the application of micro aeration for blackwater treatment is greatly affected by the oxygen dosage as it determines the microbial community niche as well as arg prevalence collectively this study highlights that appropriate oxygen input to ad systems can help to manage the reactor performance and arg levels which provides a strategy for future ad applications declaration of competing interest

17079,manganese mn oxides are ubiquitous in the environment and have strong reactivity to induce the transformation of various contaminants however whether reactive oxygen species contribute to their surface reactivity remains unclear here sustainable production of superoxide radicals o2 by various mno2 polymorphs in the dark was quantified and the mechanisms involved were explored the results confirm that o2 was produced through one electron transfer from surface mn iii to adsorbed o2 in contrast no h2o2 was detected due to its decomposition by mn oxides to form o2 and mn iii leading to the sustained production of o2 on mn oxide surfaces in addition the production of o2 was found to make a clear contribution 4 28 to the transformation of a series of halophenols by mno2 suggesting that the o2 mediated surface reaction is an important supplement to the direct electron transfer mechanism in the reactivity of mn oxides these findings advance our understanding of the surface reactivity of mn oxides and also reveal an important but hitherto unrecognized abiotic source of o2 in the natural environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords manganese oxides mn iii superoxide radicals halophenols flow chemiluminescence 1 introduction manganese oxides are ubiquitous in both aquatic and terrestrial environments and are considered to be some of the strongest naturally occurring oxidants capable of the abiotic transformation of a large number of organic pollutants such as antibacterial agents dyes endocrine disruptors pesticides and surfactants post 1999 remucal and ginder vogel 2014 although surface reactivities of mn oxides have been widely studied mechanisms involved in the transformation of compounds by mn oxides remain far from clear direct electron transfer from adsorbed pollutants to surface mn iv mn iii is so far the most widely accepted mechanism for the oxidation of organic pollutants by mn oxides stone 1987 ulrich and stone 1989 and no studies have explored whether or not there is any other mechanism by which mn oxides transform compounds it is well known that reactive oxygen species ros are very important oxidants in the environment studies in recent decades have indicated that naturally occurring substances such as humic substances page et al 2013 2012 minerals tong et al 2016 yuan et al 2018 and microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria diaz et al 2016 2013 can generate ros even under ambient dark conditions which may further induce the transformation of surrounding substances superoxide radical o2 is a widespread ros formed by one electron reduction of molecular oxygen o2 and it is an important precursor of other ros including hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl radical oh anpo et al 1999 hayyan et al 2016 in the natural environment o2 can be formed through both abiotic and biotic processes baxter and carey 1983 shaked and rose 2013 abiotic production of o2 occurs mainly through photochemical activation of o2 by colored dissolved organic matter which is considered to be the main source of o2 in surface waters cooper et al 1989 fujii and otani 2017 biotic production of o2 is mainly through microbial respiration or extracellular enzymatic catalysis diaz et al 2019 and bacteria fungi algae and plants have been reported to produce o2 diaz et al 2016 2013 diaz and plummer 2018 which is thought to be the main nonphotochemical source of o2 shaked and rose 2013 in theory o2 can be formed on metal oxide surfaces via direct electron transfer if the energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo of the adsorbed o2 is lower than the fermi levels of the oxides anpo et al 1999 recent studies indicate that oxidation of structural fe ii can produce o2 han et al 2020 schaefer et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 however o2 was considered only as the precursor of h2o2 and oh and thus received very little attention very recently wang et al 2020 observed the formation of o2 on mno2 surfaces and they suggested that o2 participated in the transformation of anthracene based on the apparent inhibition of its transformation when p benzoquinone p bq was added as a scavenger of o2 thus mn oxides are expected to have the capacity to reduce molecular o2 to form o2 without chemical electrical thermal or photo stimulation however no studies have attempted to quantify the production of o2 by mn oxides which is critical for deciphering the reactions by which o2 is generated moreover the mechanism involved in the formation of o2 and its role in the transformation of organic pollutants remain unclear here we quantify the generation of o2 by various mno2 polymorphs under ambient dark conditions a series of experiments were conducted to investigate the mechanisms involved in the generation of o2 on mno2 surfaces the contribution of o2 to the transformation of a series of halophenols by mno2 was also studied the results provide solid evidence of and important insights into the mechanisms involved in the sustained generation of o2 by mn oxides in the dark and indicate that surface o2 may be an important driving force in the transformation of organic pollutants by mn oxides 2

microwave power 20 mw modulation frequency 100 khz modulation amplitude 1 g and sweep time 328 ms the detection and quantification of o2 were conducted using a flow chemiluminescent cl system mpi b remex xi an china based on the interaction between o2 and methyl cypridina luciferin analog mcla rose et al 2008 the cl system was composed of two separate fluid lines one for the analyte solution and

polypropylene and the mno2 loaded filter was then inserted upstream of the flow cell in the analyte line interference by mn ii was eliminated during the analysis using 100 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid dtpa buffered with 20 mm phosphate ph 7 as the carrier solution first the carrier solution was passed over the mno2 loaded in line filter for around 2 10 min for different mno2 to obtain a stable baseline then mcla reagent 5 μm mcla 50 mm sodium acetate ph 6 was pumped through the other line and reacted with filtrate from the mno2 loaded filter and detected in the flow cell the flow rate was set at 2 0 0 1 ml min 1 in both the analyte and mcla lines all experiments were conducted at room temperature and mno2 samples were protected from light by covering with aluminum foil an o2 calibration curve was established according to the literatures diaz et al 2013 rose et al 2008 as detailed in the supporting information and fig s2 the production rate of o2 was calculated as the product of the steady state concentration of o2 and flow rate divided by the mass of mno2 loaded in the filter the mno2 samples were kept in water and the production of o2 was determined at certain time intervals over a period of 21 days singlet oxygen 1o2 and oh produced by δ mno2 0 1 g l 1 were detected using furfuryl alcohol haag et al 1984 and coumarin han et al 2018 respectively as probes the detection of h2o2 was through a similar flow cl system to that used in the determination of o2 based on the interaction between acridinium ester ae and h2o2 according to king et al 2007 with a minor modification full details are provided in the supporting information 2 4 experimental and theoretical analysis of the roles of mn iii and o2 in the generation of o2 by δ mno2 experiments under aerobic and anaerobic conditions were conducted to study the role of o2 in the formation of o2 in the anaerobic experiments 1 g l 1 of δ mno2 mixed with 25 mm bmpo suspension was prepared in an anaerobic incubator the samples remained in an n2 atmosphere until they were determined by esr in the aerobic experiments 1 g l 1 of δ mno2 was mixed with 25 mm bmpo in the air and determined using esr the role of mn iii in the formation of o2 was studied using 0 2 m sodium pyrophosphate na pp or 1 μm deferoxamine mesylate salt dfo to complex mn iii on the mno2 surfaces butterfield et al 2013 wang et al 2014 and the o2 signals were detected by esr and cl respectively possible interferences from na pp and an induced increase in ph in the detection of o2 by esr were excluded supporting information and fig s3 dfo instead of na pp was used as the mn iii complexing reagent for the detection of o2 by the flow cl method because it has been confirmed not to interfere with the cl signal of o2 fig s4 the electron donating capacity edc of δ mno2 was determined as previously reported lv et al 2018 using an electrochemical workstation chi630d chenhua shanghai china with details provided in the supporting information the formation of o2 on partially reduced mno2 surfaces was studied by density function theory dft using the vienna ab initio simulation package vasp code hohenberg and kohn 1964 kohn and sham 1965 kresse and furthmüller 1996a b the 001 plane of δ mno2 was selected to build the model in order to construct surface mn iii sites an oxygen vacancy was modeled on the 001 plane where the formation of two mn iii atoms is accompanied by the generation of one oxygen vacancy according to crude electron pair lewis theory of the chemical bond mcfarland and metiu 2013 the three layer model was used during the calculations with the bottom layer fixed and the other layers and the adsorbed species relaxed moreover interactions between slabs were eliminated by setting the vacuum region to 15 å in the z direction to separate the slabs details of the dft calculation are provided in the supporting information 2 5 production of mn iii and superoxide radicals by reaction between h2o2 and δ mno2 a range of concentrations of h2o2 10 20 40 60 and 100 μm in solution 100 μm dtpa and 20 mm phosphate ph 7 were passed through δ mno2 2 mg loaded in the in line filter and o2 and h2o2 were detected in real time by the flow cl method using mcla and ae respectively as probes the content of mn iii produced by the reaction between δ mno2 and h2o2 was measured by rinsing the δ mno2 loaded filter 2 mg with h2o2 at different concentrations 10 20 40 60 and 100 μm and then 1 mm na pp was used to complex mn iii to form mn iii pp which was determined by uv vis spectrophotometry uv 2600 shimadzu kyoto japan at a wavelength of 258 nm butterfield et al 2013 the production of o2 by δ mno2 after reaction with h2o2 10 20 40 60 and 100 μm was measured by the flow cl method the carrier solution containing h2o2 at various concentrations 10 20 40 60 and 100 μm was passed through the δ mno2 loaded filter 2 mg at a flow rate of 2 0 0 1 ml min 1 which was then rinsed with ultrapure water to remove the residual h2o2 and subjected to the analysis of the o2 produced using the flow cl method 2 6 degradation of halophenols by δ mno2 with and without o2 scavenger experiments on the degradation of the halophenols 4 chlorophenol 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 4 bromophenol 2 4 dibromophenol 2 4 6 tribromophenol and triclosan by δ mno2 in the presence and absence of superoxide dismutase sod 80 u ml 1 or p bq 1 mm were carried out in duplicate a δ mno2 suspension at 0 1 g l 1 was prepared and the reactions were initiated by adding a known amount of stock solution of halophenols to the suspensions with the initial concentration of halophenols at 10 μm reactions were conducted in glass conical bottles covered with black paper under continuous shaking at 25 c in a shaking incubator after shaking for 1 h triclosan and 24 h chlorophenols and bromophenols based on their different reaction kinetics an aqueous suspension was collected and mixed with methanol in an excess of l ascorbic acid and filtered through 0 22 μm pore polypropylene syringe filters the concentrations of the halophenols were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1200 santa clara ca with a uv detector details in table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mn oxides the xrd patterns of the four synthesized mno2 polymorphs fig 1 were precisely matched with the standard patterns of α mno2 jcpds 44 0141 β mno2 jcpds 24 0735 γ mno2 jcpds 44 0142 and δ mno2 jcpds 80 1098 respectively without any impurity in any mno2 tem and sem images indicate that δ mno2 had nanowire like morphology and the other mno2 had nanorod like morphology fig s5 the xps spectra of mn2p3 2 of the mno2 polymorphs are shown in fig 1 peaks at 643 2 642 2 and 641 1 ev can be attributed to mn iv mn iii and mn ii respectively hayashi et al 2019 tang et al 2014 the proportions of mn of different valences on the mno2 surfaces are listed in table 1 the proportion of low valence mn mn iii and mn ii on mno2 surfaces followed the order δ mno2 0 75 α mno2 0 65 γ mno2 0 58 β mno2 0 53 which is also an indicator of surface oxygen vacancies because oxygen vacancies are generated to balance the charge due to the downshift of mn iv liu et al 2009 the average oxidation state aos of mn was calculated according to the equation aos 8 956 1 126 δe in which δe is the difference of the binding energy between the two peaks of mn3s fig 1 and table 1 he et al 2020 rong et al 2018 the results show that the aos followed the opposite order to the proportion of the low valence mn in the oxides the lower aos will lead to a higher content of oxygen vacancy to maintain the charge balance jia et al 2016 meng et al 2020 the peaks of o1s at 531 5 and 529 8 ev can be assigned to surface adsorbed oxygen species oads and lattice oxygen olatt respectively rong et al 2018 fig 1 and the proportion of oads olatt is presented in table 1 surface adsorbed oxygen species generally occur on the surface oxygen vacancies and are considered more active than lattice oxygen liu et al 2009 wang et al 2012 thus they are likely to participate in the formation of o2 3 2 quantification of o2 generated by mno2 under ambient dark conditions δ mno2 was first used to explore the potential formation of o2 by the mno2 polymorphs bmpo was added as a spin trap agent to the δ mno2 water suspension under ambient dark conditions and a weak but repeatable signal was observed using esr fig 2 a i which was ascribed to bmpo o2 based on the waveform characteristics zhao et al 2001 this suggests the production of o2 and the weak bmpoo2 signal was likely due to the disproportion of o2 in water hayyan et al 2016 thus dmso an aprotic solvent was added to the δ mno2 suspension dmso water 4 1 v v to stabilize the o2 generated sawyer and valentine 1981 as a result the observed bmpoo2 signal was significantly enhanced fig 2a ii moreover sod was used to quench the o2 induced signal in order to confirm that the observed bmpoo2 signal was exactly produced by o2 when sod was added to the filtrate of the δ mno2 suspension dmso water the bmpoo2 signal disappeared fig 2a iv confirming the production of o2 by δ mno2 the other three mno2 α β and γ mno2 were also found to produce o2 fig 2b indicating the universality of the generation of o2 by mn oxides under ambient dark conditions similarly the generation of o2 by different mno2 was also observed via esr analysis in a recent study wang et al 2020 generation of o2 by mno2 was further detected online using a continuous flow cl system fig s1 based on the reaction between o2 and mcla diaz et al 2013 rose et al 2008 strong cl signals were observed when carrier fluid passed through the mno2 loaded filter and the cl signals returned to baseline immediately after the addition of sod to quench o2 fig 3 a consistent with the esr observations the production rates of o2 by mno2 polymorphs were calculated and are shown in fig 3b with initial production rates of δ mno2 α mno2 γ mno2 and β mno2 respectively of 581 13 82 6 65 6 and 5 8 1 8 pmol g 1 s 1 furthermore sustainable production of o2 by mno2 was observed over 21 days fig 3b of the four mno2 polymorphs birnessite like δ mno2 one of the most common mn oxides in the environment and a main component of biogenic mn oxides with strong oxidative activity tebo et al 2005 displayed the highest ability to produce o2 in previous studies extracellular o2 production by microorganisms has been regarded as an important nonphotochemical source of o2 shaked and rose 2013 here we detected and quantified the generation of o2 by mno2 polymorphs under ambient dark conditions indicating that o2 produced by mno2 is most likely an important hitherto overlooked abiotic source of o2 in the natural environment 3 3 mechanism for the sustained generation of o2 by mn oxides a generally accepted mechanism for the formation of o2 on metal oxide surfaces is via one electron transfer from an electron donor to the ground state o2 anpo et al 1999 we therefore first tested the generation of o2 in the absence of o2 by δ mno2 using esr the disappearance of the o2 signal under anoxic conditions fig 2a v indicates a requirement for o2 for the formation of o2 mn iii an intermediate state that exists in mn oxides has been widely reported to be the most active site on mn oxide surfaces and strongly determines the catalytic activity of mn oxides huang et al 2018 landrot et al 2012 a significant relationship r2 0 93 p 0 05 between the proportion of mn iii on mno2 surfaces and the production rate of o2 fig s6 was obtained suggesting a strong link between mn iii and the production of o2 to test the role of mn iii in the formation of o2 na pp a strong complexing reagent for mn iii learman et al 2011 was used to trap mn iii and the resulting effect on the production of o2 by δ mno2 was tested using esr as shown in fig 2a vi the addition of na pp led to complete inhibition of the bmpoo2 signal similarly the o2 induced cl signal disappeared when dfo was introduced to the cl system to complex mn iii fig 3a both esr and cl confirm the essential role of mn iii in the formation of o2 by acting as the electron donor to o2 this can be mainly attributed to the fact that mn iii possesses d4 ions in the t2g 3eg 1 state where the eg 1 electron in the antibonding orbital can be readily donated during the formation of o2 huang et al 2018 maitra et al 2013 the absence of eg 1 electron in mn iv d3 t2g 3 and the half filled d orbital hund s rule of mn ii d5 make mn iv and mn ii less active than mn iii the edc of δ mno2 was determined to be 0 2 0 01 mme g 1 fig s7 via an abts mediated electrochemical method gorski et al 2012b indicating that δ mno2 was able to donate an electron to the abts radical cation abts to form abts previous studies have observed that ferrous minerals with such edc values can be oxidized to produce o2 under ambient dark conditions gorski et al 2012a yuan et al 2018 electron transfer between mn iii and o2 during the formation of o2 was further ascertained by dft calculation a model of δ mno2 001 surfaces with an oxygen vacancy was established based on details shown in the methods section the results indicate that molecular oxygen was vertically adsorbed onto the surface oxygen vacancy and bound to its neighboring mn iii atoms with an adsorption energy of 0 93 ev fig 4 the corresponding o o bond length was 1 29 å similar to that of o2 1 31 å zhao et al 2012 suggesting that it belongs to oo binding in o2 furthermore the differential charge density of the o2 adsorption configuration shows that surface mn iii was inclined to provide electrons to o2 figs 4c and 4d therefore both the experimental and theoretical results here support the generation of o2 through the reduction of o2 by capturing an electron from surface mn iii eqs 1 and 2 1 o 2 mn iii o 2 mn iii 2 o 2 mn iii o 2 mn iv empirically o2 is easily transformed to other reactive oxygen species through a series of radical reactions such as the reactions in eqs 3 and 4 or a fenton like reaction eq 5 kim et al 2017 parida et al 2005 and similar reactions have been found to occur during the oxidation of structural fe ii han et al 2020 tong et al 2016 unexpectedly no 1o2 h2o2 or oh was detected here indicating their negligible production by δ mno2 under ambient dark conditions 3 2 o 2 2 h h 2 o 2 o 2 4 o 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 oh o h 5 h 2 o 2 mn iii mn iv oh o h h2o2 was the most likely of these ros to be formed if o2 was present which has also been observed during the oxidation of ferrous minerals han et al 2020 tong et al 2016 the likeliest explanation for the undetectable h2o2 in this study is the rapid decomposition of h2o2 by δ mno2 as previously reported exogenous h2o2 at mm level can be decomposed by mn oxides at a neural ph resulting in the formation of o2 and mn iii eq 6 furman et al 2009 watts richard et al 2005 in order to confirm this reaction under the conditions of this study h2o2 and o2 were detected in real time by the flow cl method when 10 μm h2o2 continuously passed through the δ mno2 loaded filter a sharp drop in h2o2 signal fig s8 was synchronous with a rapid increase in o2 signal fig 5 a demonstrating the rapid decomposition of h2o2 and the formation of o2 by the reaction between h2o2 and δ mno2 this may explain why h2o2 could not be detected in the presence of δ mno2 the quick decomposition of h2o2 to o2 blocked the formation of oh from h2o2 it must be noted that decomposition of h2o2 by mn iv can also produce mn iii as shown in eq 6 in order to explore whether mn iii was formed by the reaction of h2o2 on the δ mno2 surface δ mno2 was reacted with h2o2 at concentrations of 10 100 μm and na pp was then immediately added to complex the possibly generated mn iii to form mn iii pp which was analyzed by uv vis spectrophotometry as shown in fig 5b the absorbance at 258 nm due to the formation of the mn iii pyrophosphate complexes butterfield et al 2013 increased with increasing h2o2 concentration demonstrating the reduction of mn iv to mn iii by h2o2 in order to further test the possible role of mn iii produced by the reduction of mn iv by h2o2 in the formation of o2 δ mno2 was pretreated with h2o2 at a series of concentrations 10 100 μm followed by a thorough washing with water to remove any residual h2o2 left after reaction by which δ mno2 containing increased amounts of mn iii was obtained flow cl analysis was then conducted and as expected an enhanced production of o2 was observed with the enhancements greater for δ mno2 pretreated with higher h2o2 concentrations fig 5c due to formation of mn iii by the reaction between h2o2 and δ mno2 at higher content for higher h2o2 concentration during the pretreatment fig 5b therefore it is expected that the transformation of o2 to h2o2 and the fast reaction between h2o2 and mn oxides induced the regeneration of mn iii which sustained the generation of o2 on the δ mno2 surface 6 h 2 o 2 mn iv mn iii 2 h o 2 3 4 contribution of superoxide radicals to the transformation of halophenols by δ mno2 the transformations of halophenols induced by mn oxides through electron transfer mechanism have been widely reported lin et al 2014 petrie et al 2002 ulrich and stone 1989 zhao et al 2009 here the seven halophenols 4 chlorophenol 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 4 bromophenol 2 4 dibromophenol 2 4 6 tribromophenol and triclosan were selected as representatives to react with δ mno2 in parallel sod was used as an o2 quencher to confirm the role of o2 in the transformation of halophenols all the halophenols were observed to be transformed by δ mno2 under ambient dark conditions with the ratios ranging from 34 to 78 over 24 h in the case of chlorophenols and bromophenols and 1 h in the case of triclosan fig 6 the addition of sod clearly reduced the transformation ratios of all the halophenols thus confirming the role of o2 in halophenol transformation likely due to the strong nucleophilicity of o2 as reported previously hayyan et al 2016 sugimoto et al 1987 in a recent study wang et al 2020 also observed the degradation of anthracene by amorphous mno2 under ambient dark conditions using p bq as the scavenger for o2 however p bq is not a specific inhibitor for o2 it has a large capacity to trap electrons and to react with oh further p bq can also be adsorbed on mno2 surfaces inhibiting the transformation of organic contaminants through electron transfer mechanisms anbar and neta 1967 rodríguez et al 2015 schuchmann et al 1998 these can result in the overestimation of the role of o2 in the transformation of organic contaminants comparison between using p bq and sod as the scavengers for o2 showed that the addition of p bq resulted in much higher inhibitions of all the halophenols than sod 34 77 and 4 28 with the addition of p bq and sod respectively fig s9 therefore sod is more suitable than p bq for use as the scavenger to evaluate the contribution of o2 in the transformation of organic pollutants by mn oxides according to the results of the sod inhibition test the contribution of o2 to the transformation of these halophenols ranged from 4 to 28 considering the continuous production of o2 by δ mno2 its contribution to the long term transformation of compounds may be larger therefore the o2 mediated oxidation pathway is very likely to be an overlooked mechanism for the transformation of organic compounds by mn oxides under ambient dark conditions except the generally accepted pathway through direct electron transfer between surface mn and adsorbed compounds remucal and ginder vogel 2014 moreover the inhibition ratios of sod on the transformation of halophenols decreased with increasing number of halogen atoms on phenol indicating that the contribution of o2 to the transformation of halophenols was dependent on its chemical structure further studies are necessary to quantify the contributions of o2 produced on mn oxide surfaces to the transformation of organic compounds with diversified chemical structures 4 conclusions the superoxide radical is a widespread ros in the aquatic environment and participates in many important biogeochemical reactions here we quantified the o2 generated by mn oxides under ambient dark conditions experimental and theoretical results indicate that mn iii played a dominant role in the generation of o2 by acting as the electron donor to o2 while h2o2 was unstable on mn oxide surfaces and easily reduced mn iv to mn iii coupled with the formation of o2 thus a coupling cycle was established between o2 and mn iv iii leading to the sustained production of o2 on the mn oxide surfaces these findings advance our understanding of the surface reactivity of mn oxides furthermore the o2 produced contributed 4 28 of the transformation of halophenols by δ mno2 suggesting that an o2 mediated transformation reaction is an overlooked pathway in the transformation of halophenols and very likely other organic compounds by mn oxides under ambient dark conditions considering the abundance and wide distribution of mn oxides in both aquatic and terrestrial environments the proposed dark abiotic production of o2 by mn oxides may provide a

17079,manganese mn oxides are ubiquitous in the environment and have strong reactivity to induce the transformation of various contaminants however whether reactive oxygen species contribute to their surface reactivity remains unclear here sustainable production of superoxide radicals o2 by various mno2 polymorphs in the dark was quantified and the mechanisms involved were explored the results confirm that o2 was produced through one electron transfer from surface mn iii to adsorbed o2 in contrast no h2o2 was detected due to its decomposition by mn oxides to form o2 and mn iii leading to the sustained production of o2 on mn oxide surfaces in addition the production of o2 was found to make a clear contribution 4 28 to the transformation of a series of halophenols by mno2 suggesting that the o2 mediated surface reaction is an important supplement to the direct electron transfer mechanism in the reactivity of mn oxides these findings advance our understanding of the surface reactivity of mn oxides and also reveal an important but hitherto unrecognized abiotic source of o2 in the natural environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords manganese oxides mn iii superoxide radicals halophenols flow chemiluminescence 1 introduction manganese oxides are ubiquitous in both aquatic and terrestrial environments and are considered to be some of the strongest naturally occurring oxidants capable of the abiotic transformation of a large number of organic pollutants such as antibacterial agents dyes endocrine disruptors pesticides and surfactants post 1999 remucal and ginder vogel 2014 although surface reactivities of mn oxides have been widely studied mechanisms involved in the transformation of compounds by mn oxides remain far from clear direct electron transfer from adsorbed pollutants to surface mn iv mn iii is so far the most widely accepted mechanism for the oxidation of organic pollutants by mn oxides stone 1987 ulrich and stone 1989 and no studies have explored whether or not there is any other mechanism by which mn oxides transform compounds it is well known that reactive oxygen species ros are very important oxidants in the environment studies in recent decades have indicated that naturally occurring substances such as humic substances page et al 2013 2012 minerals tong et al 2016 yuan et al 2018 and microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria diaz et al 2016 2013 can generate ros even under ambient dark conditions which may further induce the transformation of surrounding substances superoxide radical o2 is a widespread ros formed by one electron reduction of molecular oxygen o2 and it is an important precursor of other ros including hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl radical oh anpo et al 1999 hayyan et al 2016 in the natural environment o2 can be formed through both abiotic and biotic processes baxter and carey 1983 shaked and rose 2013 abiotic production of o2 occurs mainly through photochemical activation of o2 by colored dissolved organic matter which is considered to be the main source of o2 in surface waters cooper et al 1989 fujii and otani 2017 biotic production of o2 is mainly through microbial respiration or extracellular enzymatic catalysis diaz et al 2019 and bacteria fungi algae and plants have been reported to produce o2 diaz et al 2016 2013 diaz and plummer 2018 which is thought to be the main nonphotochemical source of o2 shaked and rose 2013 in theory o2 can be formed on metal oxide surfaces via direct electron transfer if the energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo of the adsorbed o2 is lower than the fermi levels of the oxides anpo et al 1999 recent studies indicate that oxidation of structural fe ii can produce o2 han et al 2020 schaefer et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 however o2 was considered only as the precursor of h2o2 and oh and thus received very little attention very recently wang et al 2020 observed the formation of o2 on mno2 surfaces and they suggested that o2 participated in the transformation of anthracene based on the apparent inhibition of its transformation when p benzoquinone p bq was added as a scavenger of o2 thus mn oxides are expected to have the capacity to reduce molecular o2 to form o2 without chemical electrical thermal or photo stimulation however no studies have attempted to quantify the production of o2 by mn oxides which is critical for deciphering the reactions by which o2 is generated moreover the mechanism involved in the formation of o2 and its role in the transformation of organic pollutants remain unclear here we quantify the generation of o2 by various mno2 polymorphs under ambient dark conditions a series of experiments were conducted to investigate the mechanisms involved in the generation of o2 on mno2 surfaces the contribution of o2 to the transformation of a series of halophenols by mno2 was also studied the results provide solid evidence of and important insights into the mechanisms involved in the sustained generation of o2 by mn oxides in the dark and indicate that surface o2 may be an important driving force in the transformation of organic pollutants by mn oxides 2

microwave power 20 mw modulation frequency 100 khz modulation amplitude 1 g and sweep time 328 ms the detection and quantification of o2 were conducted using a flow chemiluminescent cl system mpi b remex xi an china based on the interaction between o2 and methyl cypridina luciferin analog mcla rose et al 2008 the cl system was composed of two separate fluid lines one for the analyte solution and the other for the mcla solution fig s1a both solutions were independently flushed through the system via one peristaltic pump operating at the same flow rate and merged in a spiral flow cell immediately adjacent to a photomultiplier tube which continuously recorded the real time cl signal similar systems have been used to conduct highly sensitive determination of biogenic o2 and photogenic o2 in natural waters diaz et al 2016 2013 paul hansard et al 2010 in the analysis of o2 produced by mn oxides certain amounts of mno2 2 15 mg were loaded into a filter 25 mm 0 22 μm polypropylene and the mno2 loaded filter was then inserted upstream of the flow cell in the analyte line interference by mn ii was eliminated during the analysis using 100 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid dtpa buffered with 20 mm phosphate ph 7 as the carrier solution first the carrier solution was passed over the mno2 loaded in line filter for around 2 10 min for different mno2 to obtain a stable baseline then mcla reagent 5 μm mcla 50 mm sodium acetate ph 6 was pumped through the other line and reacted with filtrate from the mno2 loaded filter and detected in the flow cell the flow rate was set at 2 0 0 1 ml min 1 in both the analyte and mcla lines all experiments were conducted at room temperature and mno2 samples were protected from light by covering with aluminum foil an o2 calibration curve was established according to the literatures diaz et al 2013 rose et al 2008 as detailed in the supporting information and fig s2 the production rate of o2 was calculated as the product of the steady state concentration of o2 and flow rate divided by the mass of mno2 loaded in the filter the mno2 samples were kept in water and the production of o2 was determined at certain time intervals over a period of 21 days singlet oxygen 1o2 and oh produced by δ mno2 0 1 g l 1 were detected using furfuryl alcohol haag et al 1984 and coumarin han et al 2018 respectively as probes the detection of h2o2 was through a similar flow cl system to that used in the determination of o2 based on the interaction between acridinium ester ae and h2o2 according to king et al 2007 with a minor modification full details are provided in the supporting information 2 4 experimental and theoretical analysis of the roles of mn iii and o2 in the generation of o2 by δ mno2 experiments under aerobic and anaerobic conditions were conducted to study the role of o2 in the formation of o2 in the anaerobic experiments 1 g l 1 of δ mno2 mixed with 25 mm bmpo suspension

determined using esr the role of mn iii in the formation of o2 was studied using 0 2 m sodium pyrophosphate na pp or 1 μm deferoxamine mesylate salt dfo to complex mn iii on the mno2 surfaces butterfield et al 2013 wang et al 2014 and the o2 signals were detected by esr and cl respectively possible interferences from na pp and an induced increase in ph in the detection of o2 by esr were excluded supporting information and fig s3 dfo instead of na pp was used as the mn iii complexing reagent for the detection of o2 by the flow cl method because it has been confirmed not to interfere with the cl signal of o2 fig s4 the electron donating capacity edc of δ mno2 was determined as previously reported lv et al 2018 using an electrochemical workstation chi630d chenhua shanghai china

modeled on the 001 plane where the formation of two mn iii atoms is accompanied by the generation of one oxygen vacancy according to crude electron pair lewis theory of the chemical bond mcfarland and metiu 2013 the three layer model was used during the calculations with the bottom layer fixed and the other layers and the adsorbed species relaxed moreover interactions between slabs were eliminated by setting the vacuum region to 15 å in the z direction to separate the slabs details of the dft calculation are provided in the supporting information 2 5 production of mn iii and superoxide radicals by reaction between h2o2 and δ mno2 a range of concentrations of h2o2 10 20 40 60 and 100 μm in solution 100 μm dtpa and 20 mm phosphate ph 7 were passed through δ mno2 2 mg loaded in the in line filter and o2 and h2o2 were detected in real time by the flow cl method using mcla and ae respectively as probes the content of mn iii produced by the reaction between δ mno2 and h2o2 was measured by rinsing the δ mno2 loaded filter 2 mg with h2o2 at different concentrations 10 20 40 60 and 100 μm and then 1 mm na pp was used to complex mn iii to form mn iii pp which was determined by uv vis spectrophotometry uv 2600 shimadzu kyoto japan at a wavelength of 258 nm butterfield et al 2013 the production of o2 by δ mno2 after reaction with h2o2 10 20 40 60 and 100 μm was measured by the flow cl method the carrier solution containing h2o2 at various concentrations 10 20 40 60 and 100 μm was passed through the δ mno2 loaded filter 2 mg at a flow rate of 2 0 0 1 ml min 1 which was then rinsed with ultrapure water to remove the residual h2o2 and subjected to the analysis of the o2 produced using the flow cl method 2 6 degradation of halophenols by δ mno2 with and without o2 scavenger experiments on the degradation of the halophenols 4 chlorophenol 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 4 bromophenol 2 4 dibromophenol 2 4 6 tribromophenol and triclosan by δ mno2 in the presence and absence of superoxide dismutase sod 80 u ml 1 or p bq 1 mm were carried out in duplicate a δ mno2 suspension at 0 1 g l 1 was prepared and the reactions were initiated by adding a known amount of stock solution of halophenols to the suspensions with the initial concentration of halophenols at 10 μm reactions were conducted in glass conical bottles covered with black paper under continuous shaking at 25 c in a shaking incubator after shaking for 1 h triclosan and 24 h chlorophenols and bromophenols based on their different reaction kinetics an aqueous suspension was collected and mixed with methanol in an excess of l ascorbic acid and filtered through 0 22 μm pore polypropylene syringe filters the concentrations of the halophenols were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1200 santa clara ca with a uv detector details in table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mn oxides the xrd patterns of the four synthesized mno2 polymorphs fig 1 were precisely matched with the standard patterns of α mno2 jcpds 44 0141 β mno2 jcpds 24 0735 γ mno2 jcpds 44 0142 and δ mno2 jcpds 80 1098 respectively without any impurity in any mno2 tem and sem images indicate that δ mno2 had nanowire like morphology and the other mno2 had nanorod like morphology fig s5 the xps spectra of mn2p3 2 of the mno2 polymorphs are shown in fig 1 peaks at 643 2 642 2 and 641 1 ev can be attributed to mn iv mn iii and mn ii respectively hayashi et al 2019 tang et al 2014 the proportions of mn of different valences on the mno2 surfaces are listed in table 1 the proportion of low valence mn mn iii and mn ii on mno2 surfaces followed the order δ mno2 0 75 α mno2 0 65 γ mno2 0 58 β mno2 0 53 which is also an indicator of surface oxygen vacancies because oxygen vacancies are generated to balance the charge due to the downshift of mn iv liu et al 2009 the average oxidation state aos of mn was calculated according to the equation aos 8 956 1 126 δe in which δe is the difference of the binding energy between the two peaks of mn3s fig 1 and table 1 he et al 2020 rong et al 2018 the results show that the aos followed the opposite order to the proportion of the low valence mn in the oxides the lower aos will lead to a higher content of oxygen vacancy to maintain the charge balance jia et al 2016 meng et al 2020 the peaks of o1s at 531 5 and 529 8 ev can be assigned to surface adsorbed oxygen species oads and lattice oxygen olatt respectively rong et al 2018 fig 1 and the proportion of oads olatt is presented in table 1 surface adsorbed oxygen species generally occur on the surface oxygen vacancies and are considered more active than lattice oxygen liu et al 2009 wang et al 2012 thus they are likely to participate in the formation of o2 3 2 quantification of o2 generated by mno2 under ambient dark conditions δ mno2 was first used to explore the potential formation of o2 by the mno2 polymorphs bmpo was added as a spin trap agent to the δ mno2 water suspension under ambient dark conditions and a weak but repeatable signal was observed using esr fig 2 a i which was ascribed to bmpo o2 based on the waveform characteristics zhao et al 2001 this suggests the production of o2 and the weak bmpoo2 signal was likely due to the disproportion of o2 in water hayyan et al 2016 thus dmso an aprotic solvent was added to the δ mno2 suspension dmso water 4 1 v v to stabilize the o2 generated sawyer and valentine 1981 as a result the observed bmpoo2 signal was significantly enhanced fig 2a ii moreover sod was used to quench the o2 induced signal in order to confirm that the observed bmpoo2 signal was exactly produced by o2 when sod was added to the filtrate of the δ mno2 suspension dmso water the bmpoo2 signal disappeared fig 2a iv confirming the production of o2 by δ mno2 the other three mno2 α β and γ mno2 were also found to produce o2 fig 2b indicating the universality of the generation of o2 by mn oxides under ambient dark conditions similarly the generation of o2 by different mno2 was also observed via esr analysis in a recent study wang et al 2020 generation of o2 by mno2 was further detected online using a continuous flow cl system fig s1 based on the reaction between o2 and mcla diaz et al 2013 rose et al 2008 strong cl signals were observed when carrier fluid passed through the mno2 loaded filter and the cl signals returned to baseline immediately after the addition of sod to quench o2 fig 3 a consistent with the esr observations the production rates of o2 by mno2 polymorphs were calculated and are shown in fig 3b with initial production rates of δ mno2 α mno2 γ mno2 and β mno2 respectively of 581 13 82 6 65 6 and 5 8 1 8 pmol g 1 s 1 furthermore sustainable production of o2 by mno2 was observed over 21 days fig 3b of the four mno2 polymorphs birnessite like δ mno2 one of the most common mn oxides in the environment and a main component of biogenic mn oxides with strong oxidative activity tebo et al 2005 displayed the highest ability to produce o2 in previous studies extracellular o2 production by microorganisms has been regarded as an important nonphotochemical source of o2 shaked and rose 2013 here we detected and quantified the generation of o2 by mno2 polymorphs under ambient dark conditions indicating that o2 produced by mno2 is most likely an important hitherto overlooked abiotic source of o2 in the natural environment 3 3 mechanism for the sustained generation of o2 by mn oxides a generally accepted mechanism for the formation of o2 on metal oxide surfaces is via one electron transfer from an electron donor to the ground state o2 anpo et al 1999 we therefore first tested the generation of o2 in the absence of o2 by δ mno2 using esr the disappearance of the o2 signal under anoxic conditions fig 2a v indicates a requirement for o2 for the formation of o2 mn iii an intermediate state that exists in mn oxides has been widely reported to be the most active site on mn oxide surfaces and strongly determines the catalytic activity of mn oxides huang et al 2018 landrot et al 2012 a significant relationship r2 0 93 p 0 05 between the proportion of mn iii on mno2 surfaces and the production rate of o2 fig s6 was obtained suggesting a strong link between mn iii and the production of o2 to test the role of mn iii in the formation of o2 na pp a strong complexing reagent for mn iii learman et al 2011 was used to trap mn iii and the resulting effect on the production of o2 by δ mno2 was tested using esr as shown in fig 2a vi the addition of na pp led to complete inhibition of the bmpoo2 signal similarly the o2 induced cl signal disappeared when dfo was introduced to the cl system to complex mn iii fig 3a both esr and cl confirm the essential role of mn iii in the formation of o2 by acting as the electron donor to o2 this can be mainly attributed to the fact that mn iii possesses d4 ions in the t2g 3eg 1 state where the eg 1 electron in the antibonding orbital can be readily donated during the formation of o2 huang et al 2018 maitra et al 2013 the absence of eg 1 electron in mn iv d3 t2g 3 and the half filled d orbital hund s rule of mn ii d5 make mn iv and mn ii less active than mn iii the edc of δ mno2 was determined to be 0 2 0 01 mme g 1 fig s7 via an abts mediated electrochemical method gorski et al 2012b indicating that δ mno2 was able to donate an electron to the abts radical cation abts to form abts previous studies have observed that ferrous minerals with such edc values can be oxidized to produce o2 under ambient dark conditions gorski et al 2012a yuan et al 2018 electron transfer between mn iii and o2 during the formation of o2 was further ascertained by dft calculation a model of δ mno2 001 surfaces with an oxygen vacancy was established based on details shown in the methods section the results indicate that molecular oxygen was vertically adsorbed onto the surface oxygen vacancy and bound to its neighboring mn iii atoms with an adsorption energy of 0 93 ev fig 4 the corresponding o o bond length was 1 29 å similar to that of o2 1 31 å zhao et al 2012 suggesting that it belongs to oo binding in o2 furthermore the differential charge density of the o2 adsorption configuration shows that surface mn iii was inclined to provide electrons to o2 figs 4c and 4d therefore both the experimental and theoretical results here support the generation of o2 through the reduction of o2 by capturing an electron from surface mn iii eqs 1 and 2 1 o 2 mn iii o 2 mn iii 2 o 2 mn iii o 2 mn iv empirically o2 is easily transformed to other reactive oxygen species through a series of radical reactions such as the reactions in eqs 3 and 4 or a fenton like reaction eq 5 kim et al 2017 parida et al 2005 and similar reactions have been found to occur during the oxidation of structural fe ii han et al 2020 tong et al 2016 unexpectedly no 1o2 h2o2 or oh was detected here indicating their negligible production by δ mno2 under ambient dark conditions 3 2 o 2 2 h h 2 o 2 o 2 4 o 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 oh o h 5 h 2 o 2 mn iii mn iv oh o h h2o2 was the most likely of these ros to be formed if o2 was present which has also been observed during the oxidation of ferrous minerals han et al 2020 tong et al 2016 the likeliest explanation for the undetectable h2o2 in this study is the rapid decomposition of h2o2 by δ mno2 as previously reported exogenous h2o2 at mm level can be decomposed by mn oxides at a neural ph resulting in the formation of o2 and mn iii eq 6 furman et al 2009 watts richard et al 2005 in order to confirm this reaction under the conditions of this study h2o2 and o2 were detected in real time by the flow cl method when 10 μm h2o2 continuously passed through the δ mno2 loaded filter a sharp drop in h2o2 signal fig s8 was synchronous with a rapid increase in o2 signal fig 5 a demonstrating the rapid decomposition of h2o2 and the formation of o2 by the reaction between h2o2 and δ mno2 this may explain why h2o2 could not be detected in the presence of δ mno2 the quick decomposition of h2o2 to o2 blocked the formation of oh from h2o2 it must be noted that decomposition of h2o2 by mn iv can also produce mn iii as shown in eq 6 in order to explore whether mn iii was formed by the reaction of h2o2 on the δ mno2 surface δ mno2 was reacted with h2o2 at concentrations of 10 100 μm and na pp was then immediately added to complex the possibly generated mn iii to form mn iii pp which was analyzed by uv vis spectrophotometry as shown in fig 5b the absorbance at 258 nm due to the formation of the mn iii pyrophosphate complexes butterfield et al 2013 increased with increasing h2o2 concentration demonstrating the reduction of mn iv to mn iii by h2o2 in order to further test the possible role of mn iii produced by the reduction of mn iv by h2o2 in the formation of o2 δ mno2 was pretreated with h2o2 at a series of concentrations 10 100 μm followed by a thorough washing with water to remove any residual h2o2 left after reaction by which δ mno2 containing increased amounts of mn iii was obtained flow cl analysis was then conducted and as expected an enhanced production of o2 was observed with the enhancements greater for δ mno2 pretreated with higher h2o2 concentrations fig 5c due to formation of mn iii by the reaction between h2o2 and δ mno2 at higher content for higher h2o2 concentration during the pretreatment fig 5b therefore it is expected that the transformation of o2 to h2o2 and the fast reaction between h2o2 and mn oxides induced the regeneration of mn iii which sustained the generation of o2 on the δ mno2 surface 6 h 2 o 2 mn iv mn iii 2 h o 2 3 4 contribution of superoxide radicals to the transformation of halophenols by δ mno2 the transformations of halophenols induced by mn oxides through electron transfer mechanism have been widely reported lin et al 2014 petrie et al 2002 ulrich and stone 1989 zhao et al 2009 here the seven halophenols 4 chlorophenol 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 4 bromophenol 2 4 dibromophenol 2 4 6 tribromophenol and triclosan were selected as representatives to react with δ mno2 in parallel sod was used as an o2 quencher to confirm the role of o2 in the transformation of halophenols all the halophenols were observed to be transformed by δ mno2 under ambient dark conditions with the ratios ranging from 34 to 78 over 24 h in the case of chlorophenols and bromophenols and 1 h in the case of triclosan fig 6 the addition of sod clearly reduced the transformation ratios of all the halophenols thus confirming the role of o2 in halophenol transformation likely due to the strong nucleophilicity of o2 as reported previously hayyan et al 2016 sugimoto et al 1987 in a recent study wang et al 2020 also observed the degradation of anthracene by amorphous mno2 under ambient dark conditions using p bq as the scavenger for o2 however p bq is not a specific inhibitor for o2 it has a large capacity to trap electrons and to react with oh further p bq can also be adsorbed on mno2 surfaces inhibiting the transformation of organic contaminants through electron transfer mechanisms anbar and neta 1967 rodríguez et al 2015 schuchmann et al 1998 these can result in the overestimation of the role of o2 in the transformation of organic contaminants comparison between using p bq and sod as the scavengers for o2 showed that the addition of p bq resulted in much higher inhibitions of all the halophenols than sod 34 77 and 4 28 with the addition of p bq and sod respectively fig s9 therefore sod is more suitable than p bq for use as the scavenger to evaluate the contribution of o2 in the transformation of organic pollutants by mn oxides according to the results of the sod inhibition test the contribution of o2 to the transformation of these halophenols ranged from 4 to 28 considering the continuous production of o2 by δ mno2 its contribution to the long term transformation of compounds may be larger therefore the o2 mediated oxidation pathway is very likely to be an overlooked mechanism for the transformation of organic compounds by mn oxides under ambient dark conditions except the generally accepted pathway through direct electron transfer between surface mn and adsorbed compounds remucal and ginder vogel 2014 moreover the inhibition ratios of sod on the transformation of halophenols decreased with increasing number of halogen atoms on phenol indicating that the contribution of o2 to the transformation of halophenols was dependent on its chemical structure further studies are necessary to quantify the contributions of o2 produced on mn oxide surfaces to the transformation of organic compounds with diversified chemical structures 4 conclusions the superoxide radical is a widespread ros in the aquatic environment and participates in many important biogeochemical reactions here we quantified the o2 generated by mn oxides under ambient dark conditions experimental and theoretical results indicate that mn iii played a dominant role in the generation of o2 by acting as the electron donor to o2 while h2o2 was unstable on mn oxide surfaces and easily reduced mn iv to mn iii coupled with the formation of o2 thus a coupling cycle was established between o2 and mn iv iii leading to the sustained production of o2 on the mn oxide surfaces these findings advance our understanding of the surface reactivity of mn oxides furthermore the o2 produced contributed 4 28 of the transformation of halophenols by δ mno2 suggesting that an o2 mediated transformation reaction is an overlooked pathway in the transformation of halophenols and very likely other organic compounds by mn oxides under ambient dark conditions considering the abundance and wide distribution of mn oxides in both aquatic and terrestrial environments the proposed dark abiotic production of o2 by mn oxides may provide a
