18935,municipal sewage treatment plants stps are an important point source of microplastics in domestic waterways in the present study effluents from the largest water reclamation plant in china were sampled throughout the treatment process and microplastics were extracted and identified to evaluate their removal as expected microplastics were detected in the influent 12 03 1 29 items l following treatment concentrations of microplastics were reduced by greater than 95 and 0 59 0 22 items l of microplastics were detected in reclaimed waters among detected microplastics 18 types of polymers of ten colors were identified polyethylene terephthalate pet polystyrene ps and polypropylene pp accounted for greater than 70 of detected microplastics furthermore microfibers were the dominant shape detected with an average size of 1110 72 862 95 μm however microparticles accounted for only 14 08 of total microplastics with an average size of 681 46 528 73 μm results of the present study suggest that current treatment technologies employed at the chosen stp are efficient to remove the majority of microplastics however consideration of stps as a point source of microplastics is important due to the large volumes of effluents being released into the aquatic environment on a consistent basis graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics effluents reclaimed water point source μft ir 1 introduction microplastics are polymer particles that are less than 5 mm in size microplastics can be ingested by aquatic organisms and adversely affect growth development and reproduction wright et al 2013 recently it has been demonstrated that microplastics accumulate in the liver kidney and gut of mice and alter energy and lipid metabolism as well as oxidative stress suggesting potential toxicity to mammals deng et al 2017 moreover microplastics might pose a potential threat to human health through exposure to contaminated salts karami et al 2017 aquatic products bessa et al 2018 van cauwenberghe and janssen 2014 beer liebezeit and liebezeit 2014 and drinking water schymanski et al 2018 recently primary and secondary sources of microplastics and their contribution to environmental microplastics were evaluated sundt et al 2014 2016 verschoor et al 2016 among sources sewage treatment plants stps have been identified as a primary source of microplastics in the environment carr et al 2016 estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 murphy et al 2016 as significantly greater concentrations of microplastics have been detected downstream of an stp when compared to water upstream of the stp estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 mccormick et al 2014 moreover a strong association between stp and plastic pollution in rivers has been demonstrated hoellein et al 2016 although stps have been demonstrated to remove greater than 90 of microplastics from influents carr et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017a b the large volumes of treated effluents containing low concentrations of microplastics being released daily to receiving waters is cause for concern it is estimated that between 15 000 and 4 5 million microplastic particles per day are released to surface waters from stps regardless of removal efficiencies hoellein et al 2016 in addition it has been demonstrated that microplastic particles have a high affinity for pathogenic bacteria used in wastewater treatment processes which can lead to their release in effluents kirstein et al 2016 viršek et al 2017 raju et al 2018 consequently engineered bacterial communities absorbed to microplastic particles are more likely to be harmful than natural bacteria found in rivers harrison et al 2017 mccormick et al 2014 to mitigate potential risks from the release of microplastics to receiving waters stringent water quality requirements for effluents are required however there currently exists no specific requirements for the removal of microplastics by stps therefore an understanding of microplastic removal by stps implementing various wastewater treatment technologies would be helpful for identifying best performing technologies recently removal efficiency of microplastics from effluents by four municipal stps in finland implementing different advanced final stage treatment technologies were investigated results of the study demonstrated greater than 99 9 removal of microplastics by membrane bioreactors reduction from 6 9 to 0 005 item l 97 removal by rapid sand filter from 0 7 to 0 02 item l 95 removal by dissolved air flotation from 0 1 to 2 0 item l and 40 98 5 by discfilter treatment from 0 5 to 2 0 to 0 03 0 3 item l talvitie et al 2017a in china widely adopted wastewater treatment systems consist of a2o treatment anaerobic anoxic and aerobic and subsequent advanced treatment processes denitrification ultra filtration ozonation and ultraviolet it has been estimated that 1 56 1014 sludge based microplastic particles are released per year to surrounding water bodies li et al 2018 however little attention has been given to the removal of microplastics throughout the treatment process in the present study we aimed to gain an understanding of the physical and chemical properties and composition of microplastics in stps and to evaluate their removal throughout the treatment process thus the removal of microplastics at different treatment stages were quantified continuously for 3 months at the largest water reclamation plant in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 effluent sampling the gaobeidian sewage treatment plant gstp located in the chaoyang district of beijing is the largest stp and largest water reclamation plant in china the plant treats primarily domestic effluents with a mean flow of 1 000 000 m3 day and services a population of approximately 2 400 000 people treatment processes include an aerated grit chamber primary sedimentation tank secondary sedimentation tank following a2o treatments anaerobic anoxic and aerobic and a series of advanced treatment processes denitrification ultra filtration ozonation and ultraviolet overall hydraulic retention time is 4 12 h and sludge retention is 5 15 days to evaluate the removal of microplastics throughout the treatment process 30 l samples were collected from april to june in 2018 at the beginning of each month from the influent effluent from the primary tank secondary sedimentation tank and draining pool respectively fig 1 water samples were collected by use of glass bottles and then stored at 4 c for further analysis during our experiment all tools including beakers bottles sieves and funnels before and after each use were thoroughly washed and rinsed with tap water filtered through a 1 μm nylon member jiudinggaoke filter beijing corporation china and then covered with aluminum foil 2 2 isolation and purification of microplastics influent and effluent samples were treated by use of a slight modified wet peroxide oxidation as recommended by national oceanic and atmospheric administration of u s for the isolation and purification of microplastics in water masura et al 2015 briefly water samples were filtered in 10 l batches by using of a 5 mm and 50 μm 300 mesh stainless steel sieve ф 20 cm n 3 all solids retained on the 50 μm sieve were transferred to a 1 l beaker filled with tap water and then filtered through a 10 μm nylon membrane ф 5 cm membranes laden with filtered microplastics were soaked in 200 ml beakers with 50 ml ultra purified water and sonicated for 20min next membranes were rinsed 3 times with fresh ultra purified water and the final volume of water in the beaker was less than 100 ml beakers were covered with aluminum foil and placed in a 90 c drying oven for 12 h or until samples were dry 20 ml of a freshly prepared feso4 solution 0 05 m was added to the dried beakers subsequently 20 ml of hydrogen peroxide solution 30 was added and mixed vigorously to oxidize organic materials and beakers were left at room temperature for 5min without disturbance next beakers were heated to 60 c on a hotplate for 30min while stirring continuously by use of a glass rod an additional 20 ml of hydrogen peroxide was added to beakers with visible solid particles subsequent aliquots of hydrogen peroxide were added to beakers until no solid particles were visible the resulting solution was cooled to room temperature and zncl2 s was added on a weight to volume basis 97 g 100 ml 1 5 g cm3 to facilitate density separation next 5 10 ml hcl was added to facilitate dissolution of zncl2 solutions were transferred to a separatory funnel and settled overnight settled solids were collected from the bottom of the separatory funnel and discarded following visual inspection for microplastics by use of a microscope the remaining solution was filtered by use of a ptfe membrane 10 μm to prevent contamination of samples throughout the treatment process all water and solutions were filtered by use of a 1 μm filter membrane prior to use in addition all tools and bottles were rinsed three times with filtered water moreover containers were covered with lids to prevent contamination by air three negative controls each consisting of 10 l filtered tap water 1 μm were treated and analyzed as described above to investigate potential sources of contamination 2 3 identification of microplastics suspected microplastics were confirmed counted and imaged by use of a leica dm4 m germany first suspected microplastics were classified as a fiber or particle next these microfibers were classified into ten groups according to their color classified microfibers and microparticles were analyzed by use of a spotlight 200 ft ir microscopy systems μ ft ir perkinelmer usa the full spectrum of each particle was analyzed by use of a bio rad knowitall informatics system 2018 64 bit ir spectral library bio rad laboratories california usa to confirm microplastic identities following noise and baseline correction each spectrum was searched and automatically matched to potential spectra from a database of known polymers or compounds identities of microplastics were then determined by matching peak wavenumber positions finally the number of microplastics of each type were recalculated after removal of non plastic particles daily releases of microplastics from gstp were estimated by use of equation 1 1 microplastics released d a y c o n c e n t r a t i o n m i c r o p l a s t i c s v o l u m e e f f l u e n t s 2 4 data analysis numbers of microplastic among samples were compared by use of one way analysis of variance anova and when necessary data were transformed appropriately to meet assumptions of anova the post hoc tukey test was used to identify significant differences among samples p 0 05 pearson correlation analysis was performed to compare stage of treatment and concentrations of microplastics 3 results and discussion 3 1 contamination of samples use of negative controls are important to assess potential contamination of samples by the treatment or extraction process although a number of precautions were taken to prevent contamination such as minimal exposure of samples to air use of nitrile gloves and laboratory coats covering of filter membranes etc contamination of negative controls by microfibers was detected and ranged from 1 item filter to 7 items filter however other sources of microplastics from room fiber and equipment cannot also be discounted detected microfibers attributed to contamination were mainly pet polyvinyl chloride pvc and ps as identified by use of μ ftir as a result microplastic counts in each sample were corrected by of the average background counts for the negative control samples in addition cotton fiber contamination was detected in samples and might originate from experimental clothes these were not classified as microplastics although a number of precautions were taken to prevent contamination it could not be avoided completely thus implementation of more stringent contamination control measures is advised to ensure reliability of results such as treatment of samples in a clean bench for example 96 5 aerial microfiber contamination had been eliminated by the used clean bench wesch et al 2017 3 2 microplastic composition in effluents from gstp a total of 18 types of polymers were detected in samples collected from gstp between april and june 2018 however only 2 polymers including pet and phenol formaldehyde resin pf were detected in all samplings table 1 which has previously been reported in other wastewater samples murphy et al 2016 as expected the polymer types decreased with the treatment train that is 6 10 types of polymers were detected in influents and only 4 6 types of polymers were detected in draining effluents indicating that most microplastics were removed effectively especially the microparticles whatever their materials moreover no obvious difference on polymer composition was found among samplings overall pet 42 25 polyester pes 19 09 and polypropylene pp 13 05 were the most prevalent microplastics accounting for greater than 70 of total microplastics pet and pes were mainly detected as fibers and might originate from textile fibers in domestic washing effluents interestingly the fraction of pe which accounted for only 1 64 was rather lower compared to previous studies from europe av 14 talvitie et al 2017a and the us 90 carr and tesoro 2016 implying the potential differences in microplastic use between china and europe us moreover these pe particles were detected in influent and effluents collected in may only but not in april and june in addition some microparticles 2 09 also demonstrated mixed characteristics of polyethylene pe and pp synthetic rubber microparticles 1 30 were identified in effluents and might originate from tire wear as a whole the majority of microplastics were black 36 60 transparent 33 84 or blue 11 88 fig 2 suggesting these microplastics came from a number of differing sources by use of physical shape microplastics were further classified into two groups microfibers or microparticles microfibers 85 92 of microplastics fig 3 a 2 d averaged 1110 72 862 95 μm in size fig 4 a and implies they are likely from domestic washing microparticles fig 3 e 2 h which included spherical granule fragment film and irregular shapes accounting for 14 08 of microplastics and averaged 681 46 528 73 μm in size with most particles concentrated around 300 μm fig 4 b it is important to note that microparticles with sizes less than 50 μm could not be extracted and quantified by use of the implemented extraction method one challenge apparent throughout the implemented procedures was the large concentrations of suspended particulate matter which clogged filters rapidly therefore a 50 μm stainless steel filter was used moreover collected microplastics were isolated by hand under a microscope and microparticles 50 μm could not be separated a previous report found that the higher microplastic concentration were detected when using smaller filters to collect microplastics erni cassola et al 2017 consequently the present study was likely underestimating the microplastic concentration by only looking down to 50 μm thus future works should focus on the identification and quantification of these smaller microparticles previous studies have categorized microplastics as primary manufactured in small size or secondary sources derived from larger plastics based on morphology estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 talvitie et al 2017a in the present study however no primary microparticles similar to microbeads from cosmetics were detected in influents or effluents although they are widely used in personal care products lei et al 2017 thus these microplastics including microfibers and microparticles might come from the secondary sources mainly in addition it should be pointed out that some suspended particles isolated from samples were non plastic after confirmation by ftir and the highest ratio of 85 of suspected microplastics from influents were natural particle or fiber mainly this was similar to a previous study which had reported 22 and 90 of the suspected microplastics to be non plastic particles ziajahromi et al 2017 3 3 removal of microplastics throughout the treatment process microplastics were detected in all effluents collected from gstp and their concentration decreased substantially throughout the treatment processes fig 5 suggesting their efficient removal by current treatment technologies implemented at gstp briefly 12 03 1 29 item l of microplastics were detected in incoming influents and was similar to influents from scotland 15 70 5 20 items l murphy et al 2016 but was lesser slightly than wastewater collected from canada 31 1 6 7 items l items l gies et al 2018 following primary aerated grit treatment 58 84 8 05 of microplastics were removed and was significantly less than the influent p 0 05 subsequently 54 47 14 73 microplastics and 71 67 11 58 microplastics were removed consecutively after a2 o and a series of advanced treatments p 0 05 respectively overall 95 16 1 57 of microplastics in the incoming influents were removed following treatment at gstp although the removal efficiency of microplastics in gstp was lesser than that of a membrane bioreactor 99 9 talvitie et al 2017a it was similar to previous reports carr et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017b for rapid sand filters and dissolved air flotation treatment technologies talvitie et al 2017a throughout the treatment process no single treatment step had a significantly greater removal efficiency thus indicating that microplastic removal was reliant on the treatment process as a whole finally only 0 59 0 22 items l were detected in the final effluent reclaimed water which was similar to final effluents 0 25 0 04 items l in scotland murphy et al 2016 and in australia 0 28 items l ziajahromi et al 2017 but was higher slightly than the effluents in europe talvitie et al 2017a and the us mason et al 2016 moreover microfibers comprised the majority of microplastics in reclaimed waters to be used for industrial cooling street flushing urban greening or in effluents discharged into surrounding water bodies it is important to note that treatment technologies currently used throughout gstp were not designed for the removal of microplastics regardless a large fraction of microplastics were removed from the influent at gstp further improvements would be difficult as advanced technologies are currently employed at gstp for example it has been reported that installed post filtration units can be used to reduce synthetic fiber loads mintenig et al 2017 a technology already employed at gstp ultra filtration following the secondary sedimentation treatment as a greater understanding of the composition of microplastics in incoming influents is gained microplastic sources can be better controlled to limit their presence in the influent in the present study microfibers were the dominant components of influents and effluents and greater than 60 of microfibers were significantly removed p 0 05 following aerated grit chamber treatment thus aerated grit chamber treatment might be an effective alternative to be used in reducing microfiber loads in stps for example the use of a microfiber catching bag could be implemented throughout the washing process to limit the initial discharge of microfibers and subsequent downstream release from stps based on the present investigation data it is estimated that approximately 0 59 0 22 109 items of microplastics are released into the aquatic environment daily from gstp while the majority of microplastics in influent 95 16 1 57 remained in sewage sludge and it is estimated that the microplastics in dry sludge from 28 stps across 11 provinces in china ranged between 1 60 56 4 103 microplastics kg dry sludge with an average of 22 7 12 1 103 microplastics kg dry sludge li et al 2018 additionally microfibers were the predominant form of microplastics bayo et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017a which was similar to the present results it is estimated that 3956 t d sludge is produced wang 2011 therefore management of sewage sludge laden with microplastics should be the focus of future research in addition potential ecological risks of microplastics in sludge should be evaluated before used for commercial or agricultural applications 4 conclusion in the present study we provide a systematic characterization of microplastics in waters processed at the largest water reclamation plant in china throughout the treatment process in addition microplastics were detected quantified and grouped by type and color microfibers in influents and effluents were primarily comprised of pet pes and pp overall 95 16 1 57 of microplastics in incoming influents were removed and deposited into sewage sludge and 0 59 0 22 items l remained in effluents released to surrounding water bodies future studies should focus on the microfibers before entering into stps and the sewage sludge when land application declaration of interests the authors declare that they

concentration by only looking down to 50 μm thus future works should focus on the identification and quantification of these smaller microparticles previous studies have categorized microplastics as primary manufactured in small size or secondary sources derived from larger plastics based on morphology estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 talvitie et al 2017a in the present study however no primary microparticles similar to microbeads from cosmetics were detected in influents or effluents although they are widely used in personal care products lei et al 2017 thus these microplastics including microfibers and microparticles might come from the secondary sources mainly in addition it should be pointed out that some suspended particles isolated from samples were non plastic after confirmation by ftir and the highest ratio of 85 of suspected microplastics from influents were natural particle or fiber mainly this was similar to a previous study which had reported 22 and 90 of the suspected microplastics to be non plastic particles ziajahromi et al 2017 3 3 removal of microplastics throughout the treatment process microplastics were detected in all effluents collected from gstp and their concentration decreased substantially throughout the treatment processes fig 5 suggesting their efficient removal by current treatment technologies implemented at gstp briefly 12 03 1 29 item l of microplastics were detected in incoming influents and was similar to influents from scotland 15 70 5 20 items l murphy et al 2016 but was lesser slightly than wastewater collected from canada 31 1 6 7 items l items l gies et al 2018 following primary aerated grit treatment 58 84 8 05 of microplastics were removed and was significantly less than the influent p 0 05 subsequently 54 47 14 73 microplastics and 71 67 11 58 microplastics were removed consecutively after a2 o and a series of advanced treatments p 0 05 respectively overall 95 16 1 57 of microplastics in the incoming influents were removed following treatment at gstp although the removal efficiency of microplastics in gstp was lesser than that of a membrane bioreactor 99 9 talvitie et al 2017a it was similar to previous reports carr et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017b for rapid sand filters and dissolved air flotation treatment technologies talvitie et al 2017a throughout the treatment process no single treatment step had a significantly greater removal efficiency thus indicating that microplastic removal was reliant on the treatment process as a whole finally only 0 59 0 22 items l were detected in the final effluent reclaimed water which was similar to final effluents 0 25 0 04 items l in scotland murphy et al 2016 and in australia 0 28 items l ziajahromi et al 2017 but was higher slightly than the effluents in europe talvitie et al 2017a and the us mason et al 2016 moreover microfibers comprised the majority of microplastics in reclaimed waters to be used for industrial cooling street flushing urban greening or in effluents discharged into surrounding water bodies it is important to note that treatment technologies currently used throughout gstp were not designed for the removal of microplastics regardless a large fraction of microplastics were removed from the influent at gstp further improvements would be difficult as advanced technologies are currently employed at gstp for example it has been reported that installed post filtration units can be used to reduce synthetic fiber loads mintenig et al 2017 a technology already employed at gstp ultra filtration following the secondary sedimentation treatment as a greater understanding of the composition of microplastics in incoming influents is gained microplastic sources can be better controlled to limit their presence in the influent in the present study microfibers were the dominant components of influents and effluents and greater than 60 of microfibers were significantly removed p 0 05 following aerated grit chamber treatment thus aerated grit chamber treatment might be an effective alternative to be used in reducing microfiber loads in stps for example the use of a microfiber catching bag could be implemented throughout the washing process to limit the initial discharge of microfibers and subsequent downstream release from stps based on the present investigation data it is estimated that approximately 0 59 0 22 109 items of microplastics are released into the aquatic environment daily from gstp while the majority of microplastics in influent 95 16 1 57 remained in sewage sludge and it is estimated that the microplastics in dry sludge from 28 stps across 11 provinces in china ranged between 1 60 56 4 103 microplastics kg dry sludge with an average of 22 7 12 1 103 microplastics kg dry sludge li et al 2018 additionally microfibers were the predominant form of microplastics bayo et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017a which was similar to the present results it is estimated that 3956 t d sludge is produced wang 2011 therefore management of sewage sludge laden with microplastics should be the focus of future research in addition potential ecological risks of microplastics in sludge should be evaluated before used for commercial or agricultural applications 4 conclusion in the present study we provide a systematic characterization of microplastics in waters processed at the largest water reclamation plant in china throughout the treatment process in addition microplastics were detected quantified and grouped by type and color microfibers in influents and effluents were primarily comprised of pet pes and pp overall 95 16 1 57 of microplastics in incoming influents were removed and deposited into sewage sludge and 0 59 0 22 items l remained in effluents released to surrounding water bodies future studies should focus on the microfibers before entering into stps and the sewage sludge when land application declaration of interests the authors declare that they

18936,disinfection of drinking water using chlorine can lead to the formation of genotoxic by products when chlorine reacts with natural organic matter nom a vast number of such disinfection by products dbps have been identified making it almost impossible to routinely monitor all dbps with chemical analysis in this study a bioanalytical approach was used measuring oxidative stress nrf2 activity genotoxicity micronucleus test and aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr activation to evaluate an innovative water treatment process including suspended ion exchange ozonation in line coagulation ceramic microfiltration and granular activated carbon chlorination was performed in laboratory scale after each step in the treatment process in order to investigate the effect of each treatment process to the formation of dbps suspended ion exchange had a high capacity to remove dissolved organic carbon doc and to decrease uv absorbance and nrf2 activity in non chlorinated water high dose chlorination 10 mg cl2 l 1 of raw water caused a drastic induction of nrf2 activity which was decreased by 70 in water chlorinated after suspended ion exchange further reduction of nrf2 activity following chlorination was achieved by ozonation and the concomitant treatment steps the ozonation treatment resulted in decreased nrf2 activity in spite of unchanged doc levels however a strong correlation was found between uv absorbing compounds and nrf2 activity demonstrating that nrf2 inducing dbps were formed from pre cursors of a specific nom fraction constituted of mainly aromatic compounds moreover high dose chlorination of raw water induced genotoxicity in similarity to the doc levels uv absorbance and nrf2 activity the disinfection induced genotoxicity was also reduced by each treatment step of the innovative water treatment technique ahr activity was observed in the water produced by the conventional process and in the raw water but the activity was clearly decreased by the ozonation step in the innovative water treatment process graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water disinfection byproducts oxidative stress nrf2 genotoxicity 1 introduction the use of different forms of chlorine for drinking water disinfection was a major public health breakthrough to avoid outbreaks of waterborne diseases however using disinfectants in drinking water production can lead to the formation of unwanted disinfection by products dbps of which some are bioactive and genotoxic richardson et al 2007 li and mitch 2018 in epidemiological studies exposure to dbps in chlorinated drinking water has been associated with various human health effects such as bladder cancer miscarriage and birth defects villanueva et al 2015 bove et al 2002 dbps are formed when a disinfectant such as chlorine monochloramine or chlorine dioxide reacts with different fractions of natural organic matter nom richardson et al 2007 nom is a complex mixture and its structure and characteristics vary with different nom sources and the hydrographic conditions of the watershed barrett et al 2000 ledesma et al 2012 furthermore natural occurrence of bromide and iodide in the raw water can lead to the formation of bromo or iodo dbps which are often more toxic than the chloro dbp equivalents sharma et al 2014 richardson et al 1999 liu et al 2017 postigo et al 2017 plewa et al 2008 the dbp formation also depends on additional factors such as disinfectant type dosage contact time ph and temperature liang and singer 2003 one way to reduce dbp exposure is to optimize the removal of nom at the drinking water treatment plants before the point of disinfection to increase nom removal and thereby decrease dbp formation ion exchange is a possible alternative galjaard et al 2009 especially for raw waters with lower specific uv absorbance suva that are not optimal for conventional chemical coagulation for some waters ion exchange has a higher nom removal capacity than coagulation and is particularly useful to remove the large fraction of nom that is negatively charged at natural ph boyer and singer 2008 allpike et al 2005 croué et al 1999 another potential treatment ozonation causes breakage of carbon carbon double bonds in nom which results in the production of more bioavailable organic matter therefore ozonation may enhance the removal of organic material in subsequent biologically active filters e g slow sand filters or biological active carbon bac filters siddiqui et al 1997 camel and bermond 1998 at present more than 700 different dbps have been identified richardson and ternes 2018 highlighting the challenge to routinely monitor dbps with chemical analysis alone for that cause bioanalytical methods provide valuable tools to assess the combined effects of all dbps present in a sample bioanalytical methods such as in vitro bioassays based on human cells designed to respond to specific toxicity mechanisms have been used for water quality assessments of drinking water in general rosenmai et al 2018 brand et al 2013 conley et al 2017 escher et al 2014 hebert et al 2018 leusch et al 2018 macova et al 2011 and also more specifically to address the issue of dbps hebert et al 2018 farré et al 2013 neale et al 2012 stalter et al 2013 2016a escher et al 2012 2013 tang et al 2014 dbps have been reported to activate oxidative stress response systems such as the nrf2 pathway farré et al 2013 neale et al 2012 wang et al 2013 oxidative stress can cause genotoxicity e g by induction of micronuclei by measuring the oxidative stress response in water samples before and after disinfection it is possible to monitor the total bioactivity of formed dbps both known and unknown another biological pathway that can be activated by a broad range of chemicals is the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr pathway which has been associated with regulation of cellular responses to xenobiotic compounds in this study we have used bioanalytical methods to assess the induction of oxidative stress genotoxic activity and ahr activation in water from a conventional drinking water treatment plant using coagulation rapid sand filtration and slow sand filtration prior to disinfection and compared it with a pilot plant facility that included suspended ion exchange six ozonation in line coagulation ceramic micro filtration ceramac and filtration through granular activated carbon gac further we have investigated the oxidative stress and genotoxic activities after laboratory scale chlorination to evaluate the efficiency of these new treatment processes to remove precursors forming such bioactive compounds 2 materials and methods 2 1 conventional full scale and novel pilot scale treatment lovö drinking water treatment plant dwtp is one of three surface dwtps in stockholm sweden treating raw water from lake mälaren the third largest lake in sweden lovö and norsborg dwtp belongs to stockholm vatten och avfall svoa and görvälnverket to the municipal council norrvatten and together the three dwtps provide approximately 2 million inhabitants with drinking water norrvatten and svoa share a number of challenges in order to secure a future drinking water production with sufficient quality and quantity of potable water therefore a collaborative one year study of a novel treatment process which was performed at lovö dwtp was initiated in 2016 lovö dwtp currently employ conventional coagulation treatment using aluminium sulfate al2 so4 3 followed by sedimentation rapid sand filtration slow sand filtration uv disinfection and dosing of monochloramine fig 1 the pilot plant facility included novel ion exchange and membrane treatment provided by the dutch pwnt water technology fig 1 additional information regarding suspended ion exchange six and membrane filtration with the ceramic microfilter membrane ceramac used in this study can be found elsewhere galjaard et al 2009 metcalfe et al 2016 both ozone and in line coagulation here the coagulant pix 311 fecl3 was used were available as pre treatments for the ceramac membrane for six an acrylic quaternary amine strongly basic gel type anionic resin was used lewatit s5128 lanxess germany when the sampling for this study was performed the same resin had been in continuous use for approximately 10 months due to operating issues with the ceramac membrane the gac filter which constituted the next treatment step was only running intermittently it was however backwashed regularly in total 720 m3 of water was filtered which was equivalent to 2200 bed volumes with the empty bed contact time of 20 min that was used this can be translated to approximately 30 days of continuous operation therefore the gac performance was higher than what can be expected in a full scale application where the activated carbon may be regenerated or replaced after 1 2 years of operation or in some cases not at all 2 2 sampling and chlorination experiments from lovö dwtp and its connected pilot plant water samples 5 l were collected and filtered through pre combusted 450 c for 5 h gf f glass fiber filters 0 7 μm porosity hypochlorite and monochloramine were taken from lovö dwtp and used the same day in laboratory scale chlorination and chloramination experiments the level of free chlorine as cl2 and total chlorine the sum of combined and free chlorine as cl2 analyzed upon dosage were measured using an exact idip photometer for the chlorine additions abbreviated as hocl in tables and figures free chlorine was measured and for the monochloramine additions abbreviated as nh2cl in tables and figures total chlorine was measured the experimental setup including additional treatments and chlorine residuals are summarized in table 1 in experiment 1 samples from the conventional full scale plant rw dw and the novel pilot scale plant rw sixout ozoneout ceramacout gacout were extracted by solid phase extraction spe see 2 3 without further modifications in order to investigate the potential inherent toxicity of the raw water and effects from the different treatments the exception was ozoneout where 2 5 ml l 0 01 m na2s2o3 was added to the bottles before sampling to quench the excess ozone 1 mg l 1 present at this sampling point only in experiment 2 performed to evaluate the effects on bioactivity from the different treatment processes in the pilot plant due to potential dbp formation sodium hypochlorite and monochloramine were added to finished gacout water samples from the pilot process at doses typical for swedish dwtps

nine gacout samples with three replicates for control without addition sodium hypochlorite and monochloramine addition respectively after disinfectant addition the samples were stored in the dark at 15 c for 24 h before spe conditions designed to mimic a situation for analyzing water at the consumer s tap in experiment 3 a high dose chlorination experiment was performed to water samples after each treatment step in the pilot plant rw sixout ceramacout o3 ceramacout o3 gacout to distinguish between the effect of ozone and coagulation on the ceramic membrane direct filtration samples were collected with ozone turned on and off respectively the ozone levels were controlled by online measurements as well as repeated manual sampling and measurements accuvac mr method hach at ozoneout and ceramacout sodium hypochlorite was added to the water samples at a residual of 10 mg cl2 l 1 measured as free chlorine at ph 8 5 the chlorinated samples were stored in the dark at room temperature for 3 days hypochlorite was added to fifteen water samples in total three replicate samples for each step in the treatment process two controls were included for each step without addition of hypochlorite one control for each treatment step was collected at the same day while the other was collected another day due to practical reasons after 3 days all samples had levels of free chlorine above 6 mg l 1 to shift the equilibrium towards gaseous chlorine and hence remove reactive chlorine from the water before extraction ph was lowered to 1 5 using 3 m hcl prepared by hydrochloric acid 32 puriss p a and ultrapure water the level of free chlorine was below 1 mg l 1 before spe was initiated 2 3 sample preparation water samples except those subject to high dose chlorination were adjusted to ph 2 5 using 3 m hcl prepared by hydrochloric acid 32 puriss p a and ultrapure water and extracted using spe with a agilent bond elute ppl resin 1 g 6 ml and a vacuum manifold system the cartridges were conditioned with lc ms ultra chromasolv methanol meoh 10 ml followed by ultrapure water 10 ml ph 2 5 the volume used for extraction was based on the amount of dissolved organic carbon doc for raw water 2 5 l and 5 l for other samples the water samples were connected to the cartridges by teflon tubing and the flow was kept below 20 ml min 1 by a peristaltic pump after extraction the cartridges were washed with lc ms ultra chromasolv 0 1 formic acid in water to remove remaining ions and dried briefly 15 s with air using the vacuum manifold finally the cartridges were eluted with lc ms ultra chromasolv meoh 10 ml and the extracts stored in freezer at 20 c before bioanalysis 9 5 ml of the meoh sample was spiked with 50 μl 2 5 l samples or 100 μl 5 l samples dimethyl sulfoxide dmso as a keeper and the meoh was evaporated using an automatic environmental speedvac system each sample was then re dissolved in a lower volume of ethanol total volume of 0 5 ml for the 2 5 l samples and total volume of 1 ml for the 5 l samples giving an enrichment factor of 5000 2 4 analysis of water characteristics dissolved organic carbon doc and absorbance at 254 nm uva254 was used to assess nom quantity and quality the specific absorbance suva determined at 254 nm have been used to indicate the degree of aromaticity of nom weishaar et al 2003 water samples were stored at 8 c until analysis of doc maximum 6 days and absorbance maximum 3 days doc was measured at the norrvatten accredited lab using the non purgeable organic carbon npoc method multi n c 3100 analytik jena absorbance at 254

bioassays the water samples and vehicle control were tested for ahr and nrf2 activities in reporter gene assays and for cytotoxicity by cell viability assays mts assay in addition water samples from the high dose chlorination experiment experiment 3 were tested for genotoxicity by an in vitro micronucleus test nrf2 activity was assayed in a hepg2 cell line stably transfected with a luciferase plasmid where the expression of the luciferase protein is under the control of an nrf2 responsive promoter element this cell line was purchased from signosis inc santa clara ca catalog number sl 0046 np and the assay was performed in accordance with the standardized protocol including recommended positive control provided by the manufacturer ahr activity was assayed in transiently transfected hepg2 cells using a luciferase reporter plasmid under the control of a dna element responsive to ligand activated ahr promega rosenmai et al 2018 micronuclei formation was assayed by flow cytometry in human lymphoblast tk6 cells using a microflow kit litron laboratories us a detailed description of the bioanalytical methods is provided in supplementary information when incubated with the cells the concentrated water samples were diluted 100 fold with cell medium to get a final concentration of 0 9 ethanol and 0 1 dmso and a relative enrichment factor ref of 50 0 9 ethanol and 0 1 dmso was used as solvent control for nrf2 activity selected samples were run in dilution series to enable the calculation of effect concentrations the enrichment and dilution of the samples constitute the ref calculated as described by escher et al 2014 r e f e n r i c h m e n t f a c t o r s p e d i l u t i o n f a c t o r b i o a s s a y the dilution and enrichment factors are calculated by the following

mitomycin c mmc for the micronucleus test the standard curve for tcdd was used to calculate the tcdd equivalent concentration tcddeq for observed ahr activities 2 6 technical replicates for each sample site and experimental treatment of water three technical replicate samples were collected or produced to prove technical reproducibility all three technical replicates were analyzed in quadruplicate in the bioassays for nrf2 and ahr activities all three technical replicates for each sampling site and experimental treatment showed reproducible bioassay result one technical replicate for each sampling site or experimental treatment was then reanalyzed in an independent experiment for each bioassay to prove biological reproducibility the independent bioassays showed reproducible results the results from one of these representative experiments are presented 2 7 data analysis initially all water samples were analyzed for bioactivity at ref 50 in the bioassays for nrf2 and ahr activities for nrf2 activity an induction ratio of 1 5 compared to vehicle control was used as the cut off value for bioactivity as proposed by escher et al 2012 samples showing nrf2 activity at ref 50 was then analyzed in a 2 fold dilution series from ref 25 to ref 0 78 to investigate concentration response relationships and enable the calculation of the relative enrichment factor corresponding to an induction ratio of 1 5 ecir1 5 for ahr a 2 fold induction of the activity compared to the vehicle control was used as the cut off value for bioactivity this definition of bioactivity for the ahr bioassay was calculated from the limit of detection lod for the assay which was defined as 1 plus 3 times the standard deviation for the vehicle control only minor effects on ahr activity were observed at ref 50 and for that reason no concentration response experiments were performed for the ahr activity micronucleus test was performed for samples in the high dose chlorination experiment experiment 3 each sample was analyzed at the highest non cytotoxic ref value 3 results and discussion 3 1 water characteristics doc concentrations uva254 and suva values are presented in table 1 in the conventional full scale treatment doc was reduced from 6 9 to 3 9 mg l 1 in the novel pilot scale treatment doc was reduced to about 2 5 mg l 1 already after six ozonation had little effect on the doc concentration while in line coagulation together with the ceramic micro filtration further reduced doc to about 2 mg l 1 finally the activated carbon filter removed doc to a final concentration of 0 4 0 5 mg l 1 in the finished pilot process water it should be noted that the gac filter was not saturated at the time of sampling and the doc removal capacity might be lower in a full scale application where filters may be operated as biological filters i e as biological active carbon bac the pilot treatment process also affected uva254 and suva more dramatically compared to the conventional process table 1 the conventional process reduced suva from 2 8 to 2 0 l mg 1 m 1 while the pilot process provided a reduction down to 0 3 0 4 l mg 1 m 1 all steps in the pilot process reduced 254 nm absorbance and suva with no doc removal but a major reduction in uv absorbance the effect of ozone on suva was clear indicating a modification of the organic material composition resulting from cleavage of aromatic structures for the other treatments uva254 and suva reductions were likely due to removal of uv absorbing organic structures e g aromatic structures 3 2 cell viability to ensure that the bioassays were conducted under conditions where the general cell viability was not compromised we assayed the effects of all concentrated water samples on the cell viability of hepg2 cells at ref 50 none of the water samples exerted cytotoxic effects defined as a cell viability 80 compared to the vehicle control at ref 50 fig s1 3 3 ahr activity for the conventional process a 2 fold induction in the ahr activity was observed in the concentrated samples representing both raw water and the finished drinking water at ref 50 fig 2 a indicating that there are compounds present in the raw water causing this effect and that the current treatment process steps are unable to remove these compounds we have previously observed similar results regarding ahr activities for drinking water produced from the same water source rosenmai et al 2018 for the pilot plant the observed 2 fold induction of ahr activity in the raw water was unaltered by suspended ion exchange treatment but clearly decreased by ozonation fig 2b possibly due to decreased concentration of aromatic compounds after ozone treatment normal dose disinfection of water collected after gac with chlorine or monochloramine did not induce ahr activity fig 2d and furthermore the ahr activity did not differ from the gac effluent without hypochlorite or monochloramine addition this demonstrates the benefit of increased nom removal prior to monochloramine dosing compared to the full scale treatment in contrast high dose chlorination caused a 2 fold induction of ahr activity in all samples from the pilot treatment process fig 2e the observed effects are equivalent to effects caused by tcdd at concentrations in the range of 125 167 pm table s1 3 4 nrf2 activity in conventional and pilot treatment process experiment 1 showed that the induction for nrf2 activity in the raw water was below the cut off level for activity of 1 5 fold at ref 50 fig 3 a the two samples of finished drinking water from the conventional treatment process showed an induction ratio for nrf2 of approximately 2 at ref 50 fig 3a a higher induction ratio in the treated drinking water compared to the raw water indicates that nrf2 inducing compounds are formed during the conventional water treatment process the change in induction ratio in this case however is marginal and statistically non significant and should therefore be interpreted with caution raw water and two drinking water samples from the conventional process was also analyzed in a dilution series covering ref 25 to 0 78 fig 4 a c ecir1 5 was calculated to ref 21 9 for raw water 21 0 and 24 9 respectively for the two drinking water samples fig 4a c the pilot process without disinfection resulted in a decreased induction ratio for nrf2 after suspended ion exchange indicating that this treatment removes nrf2 inducing compounds fig 3b experiment 1 all these samples had an ecir1 5 of 50 ref disinfection of finished pilot plant water gac filtrate with normal doses of hypochlorite and monochloramine experiment 2 did not induce nrf2 activity indicating that the pilot plant has removed pre cursors resulting in decreased formation of toxic dbps compared to the conventional full scale process fig 3d the ref values of drinking water from the current process can be compared to the study by hebert et al 2018 reporting ecir1 5 in the range from ref 15 to 100 from a study of three drinking water plants in france with rather big differences in ecir1 5 ref values between plants and sampling seasons for all three water distribution systems higher nrf2 activities were observed in may and september compared to november and march for may the authors also observed higher levels of total organic carbon toc and dbps as compared to november and march which could be an explanation for the observed increase in nrf2 activity however the toc and dbp levels in september were similar to those observed in november and march in a bioanalytical assessment of an australian drinking water treatment plant neale et al 2012 found increased toxicity including nrf2 activity after chlorination which was associated with increased levels of both adsorbable organic halogens aoxs which represent the total level of halogenated compounds and specific dbps chcl3 chbrcl2 chbr2cl chbr3 they reported an ecir1 5 of ref 35 for the raw inlet water an ecir1 5 of ref 3 23 after chlorination 2 2 5 mg l 1 free chlorine residual 2 3 mg l 1 doc and of ref 5 54 after subsequent chloramination 2 5 mg l 1 total chlorine residual 2 3 mg l 1 doc in the present study we observed higher doc levels in the samples from the conventional full scale process compared to the plants studied by neale et al but also higher ecir1 5 values for the oxidative stress response however the monochloramine residual used in our study was lower 0 3 mg l 1 measured as total chlorine likely explaining part of the difference in ecir1 5 values an effect based trigger value based on the australian drinking water guidelines has been proposed by escher et al 2013 as an ecir1 5 of ref 6 for nrf2 activity compared to the proposed effect trigger value our study shows a 3 5 4 0 fold margin for the observed effects by water samples from the conventional water treatment process it should be noted that the effect based trigger value and our study has been performed with two different assays although both assay the nrf2 activity however the sensitivity of these two assays are similar shown by the similarity in ecir1 5 for the positive control in this study we report an ecir1 5 of 1 7 2 0 μm for tbhq while it has been reported to be 1 1 μm escher et al 2013 and 1 9 μm hebert et al 2018 for the arec32 assay this indicates that the results obtained with the assay used in this study can be compared with the effect based trigger value obtained with the arec32 assay 3 5 formation potential of nrf2 inducing and genotoxic disinfection by products in the experiment investigating the effect of each pilot treatment step on disinfection induced toxicity experiment 3 water samples from each step were disinfected with a high dose of hypochlorite 10 mg cl2 l 1 with a contact time of 3 days we observed a drastic increase by 30 fold compared to the vehicle control in nrf2 activity when raw water was chlorinated fig 3e for water that had been treated with suspended ion exchange before chlorination the nrf2 induction was reduced by 70 as compared to the raw water indicating that six removes compounds from the water that can form nrf2 activating compounds additional treatment steps further reduced the potential for nrf2 induction after chlorination all samples from the high dose chlorination experiment were analyzed in dilution series to enable the calculation of ecir1 5 for the nrf2 inducing effect fig 4d h the ecir1 5 for raw water exposed to high dose chlorination was ref 4 7 after six ref 7 1 after ceramic microfiltration including in line coagulation and ozonation ref 22 3 and after activated carbon filter ref 47 2 this increase in the ecir1 5 value for each step in the pilot treatment process indicates that the treatment steps remove compounds from the water that have the potential to form nrf2 activating compounds in the disinfection process the ecir1 5 values for each sample is presented in table 2 as described above escher et al 2013 have proposed an effect based trigger value for the nrf2 activity of an ecir1 5 value of ref 6 in this study the raw water used for drinking water production had an ecir1 5 below the proposed effect based trigger value when disinfected with 10 mg l 1 chlorine and would thus indicate a potential health hazard if it was drinking water the treatment techniques in the studied pilot plant increased the ecir1 5 drastically and when water collected after the pilot plant process was chlorinated with 10 mg l 1 chlorine the ecir1 5 was 47 2 meaning that the treated water has a margin of more than 7 fold for the observed effects as compared to the proposed effect trigger value there is a strong correlation between the doc concentrations associated with each stage in the pilot treatment process and the nrf2 activity at ref 50 fig 5 a lending support to the hypothesis that the formation of oxidative stress inducing compounds in the high dose disinfection process depends to a high extent on the doc level nrf2 activities at ref 50 were also plotted against uva254 fig 5b producing a better fit where uva254 could be used to explain nrf2 activities associated with dbps formed also for the point after ozonation this indicates that the abundance of uva254 absorbing nom compounds and their associated structural characteristics i e aromatic moieties could best describe the formation of oxidative stress inducing compounds upon high dose chlorination uva254 shows a very high correlation with nrf2 activity even if the raw water sample is excluded from the analysis r2 0 972 data not shown which is not the case for the correlation between doc concentration and nrf2 activity with the raw water sample excluded r2 0 649 data not shown farré et al 2013 have reported ecir1 5 of ref 1 8 5 6 following formation potential experiments chlorine and monochloramine residual 2 mg cl2 l 1 reaction time 3 days ph 7 of water sampled after the coagulation stage for three conventional drinking water treatment plants with ecir1 5 of ref 7 8 9 9 before chlorination we observed an ecir1 5 of ref 4 7 and 7 1 after chlorination 10 mg l 1 3 days ph 8 5 of raw water and after six respectively one of the dwtp evaluated by farré et al with similar doc levels 2 8 mg l 1 and suva 2 05 l mg 1 m 1 after coagulation compared to sixout had an ecir1 5 of ref 2 8 the higher nrf2 activity reported by farré et al despite lower chlorination could be due to a higher level of bromide in that water source 0 16 mg l 1 compared to lake mälaren 0 03 0 05 mg l 1 at the point after six resulting in elevated levels of more toxic br dbps as dbps may also be genotoxic we analyzed the samples from the high dose chlorination experiments in an in vitro micronucleus test as a cytotoxicity control cells were stained with ethidium monoazide ema in accordance with the instructions from the manufacturer a cut off for cytotoxicity was set at 55 ema positive cells samples were analyzed at the highest possible ref still having an ema positive score 55 raw water disinfected with high dose chlorination had an ema positive score of 77 this sample was therefore analyzed at ref 25 we found fig 6 that raw water subjected to high dose chlorination for 3 days exerted a significant genotoxicity with a micronuclei percentage above 20 at ref 25 for each step in the water treatment process subject to high dose chlorination we observed a decreased micronuclei formation indicating that the water treatment process removes compounds that can form genotoxic products in the disinfection process conflicting results have previously been reported regarding the genotoxicity of dbps for example the three haloacetic acids iodoacetic acid iaa bromoacetic acid baa and chloroacetic acid caa were reported to induce formation of micronuclei by ali et al 2014 while liviac et al 2010 reported that the same three compounds did not induce formation of micronuclei for drinking water samples chen et al 2016 reported induced micronuclei formation after chlorine disinfection our results lend support to the suggestion that drinking water disinfection may form compounds that can induce micronuclei formation several swedish drinking water facilities face challenges due to increasing levels of nom in the source waters this could partly be due to climate change but inadequate catchment management including urbanization construction and development and agricultural practices can also affect the nom level in eastern lake mälaren which provides drinking water for more than two million inhabitants the level of total organic carbon toc yearly average has increased from approximately 7 mg c l 1 to 8 mg c l 1 from the 1990 s to the 2010 s during the same period the toc level in the produced drinking water has also increased the currently used conventional treatment that includes coagulation has limited ability to remove nom and the amount of dbps could be expected to rise this study provides important knowledge on the design of future drinking water treatment processes aiming to decrease the risk associated with dbp formation specifically suspended ion exchange showed promising potential with a three fold reduction of the nrf2 activity along with decreased micronuclei formation for lake mälaren water furthermore ozonation showed to reduce almost two fold fig 3e the formation of nrf2 inducing compounds in spite of limited doc removal highlighting that the organic carbon concentration might not accurately predict the formation of nrf2 inducing dbps after this step the decrease in nrf2 inducing compounds during ozonation could however be explained by a change in structural characteristics of the organic carbon measured as uva254 which indicates a strong correlation between aromatic nom and formation of dbps causing oxidative stress during chlorination the combination of in line coagulation with ozonation and ceramac also reduced the nrf2 activity and micronuclei formation however the effect of gac needs to be interpreted with caution since the filter was rather new and not saturated which is the normal situation at many drinking water treatment plants the findings from these type of experiments reflect the toxicity of the extract from the spe cartridge used alterations in nrf2 activity or micronuclei formation could be due to changes in the amount of dbps formed as well as changes in dbp speciation importantly both situations are accounted for providing a relevant bioanalytical assessment of human dbp exposure when performing sample preparation with spe according to the current protocol it can be expected that only non volatile and semi volatile dbps but not volatile dbps are retained in the sample it has been reported that the bioactivity from volatile dbps to a large extent is explained by known dbps stalter et al 2016b and mixture toxicity modeling has shown that the volatile fraction of the dbps only had a minor contribution to the total bioactivity of dbps hebert et al 2018 therefore the method used is expected to capture a highly relevant fraction of dbps formed it should be noted that spe extraction have a doc extraction efficiency in the order of 60 for these types of samples and that more hydrophilic compounds are extracted to a lower degree than more hydrophobic compounds dittmar et al 2008 however spe extraction following the same protocol as here and analyzed with fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry revealed 800 novel dbps from one single dwtp gonsior et al 2014 confirming that spe extracts capture a high number and complex mixture of dbps 4 conclusions in conclusion we have used a bioanalytical assessment approach to show that a water treatment process including suspended ion exchange six followed by ozonation in line coagulation ceramic microfiltration ceramac and granular activated carbon gac efficiently decreased the oxidative stress and genotoxic activity which most probably can be connected to their removal or influence on precursors leading to alterations in dbp formation and toxicity further we have shown that uva254 absorbing nom compounds show a very high correlation with the risk of disinfection induced toxicity in the form of nrf2 activity conflicts of interest the authors

18936,disinfection of drinking water using chlorine can lead to the formation of genotoxic by products when chlorine reacts with natural organic matter nom a vast number of such disinfection by products dbps have been identified making it almost impossible to routinely monitor all dbps with chemical analysis in this study a bioanalytical approach was used measuring oxidative stress nrf2 activity genotoxicity micronucleus test and aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr activation to evaluate an innovative water treatment process including suspended ion exchange ozonation in line coagulation ceramic microfiltration and granular activated carbon chlorination was performed in laboratory scale after each step in the treatment process in order to investigate the effect of each treatment process to the formation of dbps suspended ion exchange had a high capacity to remove dissolved organic carbon doc and to decrease uv absorbance and nrf2 activity in non chlorinated water high dose chlorination 10 mg cl2 l 1 of raw water caused a drastic induction of nrf2 activity which was decreased by 70 in water chlorinated after suspended ion exchange further reduction of nrf2 activity following chlorination was achieved by ozonation and the concomitant treatment steps the ozonation treatment resulted in decreased nrf2 activity in spite of unchanged doc levels however a strong correlation was found between uv absorbing compounds and nrf2 activity demonstrating that nrf2 inducing dbps were formed from pre cursors of a specific nom fraction constituted of mainly aromatic compounds moreover high dose chlorination of raw water induced genotoxicity in similarity to the doc levels uv absorbance and nrf2 activity the disinfection induced genotoxicity was also reduced by each treatment step of the innovative water treatment technique ahr activity was observed in the water produced by the conventional process and in the raw water but the activity was clearly decreased by the ozonation step in the innovative water treatment process graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water disinfection byproducts oxidative stress nrf2 genotoxicity 1 introduction the use of different forms of chlorine for drinking water disinfection was a major public health breakthrough to avoid outbreaks of waterborne diseases however using disinfectants in drinking water production can lead to the formation of unwanted disinfection by products dbps of which some are bioactive and genotoxic richardson et al 2007 li and mitch 2018 in epidemiological studies exposure to dbps in chlorinated drinking water has been associated with various human health effects such as bladder cancer miscarriage and birth defects villanueva et al 2015 bove et al 2002 dbps are formed when a disinfectant such as chlorine monochloramine or chlorine dioxide reacts with different fractions of natural organic matter nom richardson et al 2007 nom is a complex mixture and its structure and characteristics vary with different nom sources and the hydrographic conditions of the watershed barrett et al 2000 ledesma et al 2012 furthermore natural occurrence of bromide and iodide in the raw water can lead to the formation of bromo or iodo dbps which are often more toxic than the chloro dbp equivalents sharma et al 2014 richardson et al 1999 liu et al 2017 postigo et al 2017 plewa et al 2008 the dbp formation also depends on additional factors such as disinfectant type dosage contact time ph and temperature liang and singer 2003 one way to reduce dbp exposure is to optimize the removal of nom at the drinking water treatment plants before the point of disinfection to increase nom removal and thereby decrease dbp formation ion exchange is a possible alternative galjaard et al 2009 especially for raw waters with lower specific uv absorbance suva that are not optimal for conventional chemical coagulation for some waters ion exchange has a higher nom removal capacity than coagulation and is particularly useful to remove the large fraction of nom that is negatively charged at natural ph boyer and singer 2008 allpike et al 2005 croué et al 1999 another potential treatment ozonation causes breakage of carbon carbon double bonds in nom which results in the production of more bioavailable organic matter therefore ozonation may enhance the removal of organic material in subsequent biologically active filters e g slow sand filters or biological active carbon bac filters siddiqui et al 1997 camel and bermond 1998 at present more than 700 different dbps have been identified richardson and ternes 2018 highlighting the challenge to routinely monitor dbps with chemical analysis alone for that cause bioanalytical methods provide valuable tools to assess the combined effects of all dbps present in a sample bioanalytical methods such as in vitro bioassays based on human cells designed to respond to specific toxicity mechanisms have been used for water quality assessments of drinking water in general rosenmai et al 2018 brand et al 2013 conley et al 2017 escher et al 2014 hebert et al 2018 leusch et al 2018 macova et al 2011 and also more specifically to address the issue of dbps hebert et al 2018 farré et al 2013 neale et al 2012 stalter et al 2013 2016a escher et al 2012 2013 tang et al 2014 dbps have been reported to activate oxidative stress response systems such as the nrf2 pathway farré et al 2013 neale et al 2012 wang et al 2013 oxidative stress can cause genotoxicity e g by induction of micronuclei by measuring the oxidative stress response in water samples before and after disinfection it is possible to monitor the total bioactivity of formed dbps both known and unknown another biological pathway that can be activated by a broad range of chemicals is the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr pathway which has been associated with regulation of cellular responses to xenobiotic compounds in this study we have used bioanalytical methods to assess the induction of oxidative stress genotoxic activity and ahr activation in water from a conventional drinking water treatment plant using coagulation rapid sand filtration and slow sand filtration prior to disinfection and compared it with a pilot plant facility that included suspended ion exchange six ozonation in line coagulation ceramic micro filtration ceramac and filtration through granular activated carbon gac further we have investigated the oxidative stress and genotoxic activities after laboratory scale chlorination to evaluate the efficiency of these new treatment processes to remove precursors forming such bioactive compounds 2 materials and methods 2 1 conventional full scale and novel pilot scale treatment lovö drinking water treatment plant dwtp is one of three surface dwtps in stockholm sweden treating raw water from lake mälaren the third largest lake in sweden lovö and norsborg dwtp belongs to stockholm vatten och avfall svoa and görvälnverket to the municipal council norrvatten and together the three dwtps provide approximately 2 million inhabitants with drinking water norrvatten and svoa share a number of challenges in order to secure a future drinking water production with sufficient quality and quantity of potable water therefore a collaborative one year study of a novel treatment process which was performed at lovö dwtp was initiated in 2016 lovö dwtp currently employ conventional coagulation treatment using aluminium sulfate al2 so4 3 followed by sedimentation rapid sand filtration slow sand filtration uv disinfection and dosing of monochloramine fig 1 the pilot plant facility included novel ion exchange and membrane treatment provided by the dutch pwnt water technology fig 1 additional information regarding suspended ion exchange six and membrane filtration with the ceramic microfilter membrane ceramac used in this study can be found elsewhere galjaard et al 2009 metcalfe et al 2016 both ozone and in line coagulation here the coagulant pix 311 fecl3 was used were available as pre treatments for the ceramac membrane for six an acrylic quaternary amine strongly basic gel type anionic resin was used lewatit s5128 lanxess germany when the sampling for this study was performed the same resin had been in continuous use for approximately 10 months due to operating issues with the ceramac membrane the gac filter which constituted the next treatment step was only running intermittently it was however backwashed regularly in total 720 m3 of water was filtered which was equivalent to 2200 bed volumes with the empty bed contact time of 20 min that was used this can be translated to approximately 30 days of continuous operation therefore the gac performance was higher than what can be expected in a full scale application where the activated carbon may be regenerated or replaced after 1 2 years of operation or in some cases not at all 2 2 sampling and chlorination experiments from lovö dwtp and its connected pilot plant water samples 5 l were collected and filtered through pre combusted 450 c for 5 h gf f glass fiber filters 0 7 μm porosity hypochlorite and monochloramine were taken from lovö dwtp and used the same day in laboratory scale chlorination and chloramination experiments the level of free chlorine as cl2 and total chlorine the sum of combined and free chlorine as cl2 analyzed upon dosage were measured using an exact idip photometer for the chlorine additions abbreviated as hocl in tables and figures free chlorine was measured and for the monochloramine additions abbreviated as nh2cl in tables and figures total chlorine was measured the experimental setup including additional treatments and chlorine residuals are summarized in table 1 in experiment 1 samples from the conventional full scale plant rw dw and the novel pilot scale plant rw sixout ozoneout ceramacout gacout were extracted by solid phase extraction spe see 2 3 without further modifications in order to investigate the potential inherent toxicity of the raw water and effects from the different treatments the exception was ozoneout where 2 5 ml l 0 01 m na2s2o3 was added to the bottles before sampling to quench the excess ozone 1 mg l 1 present at this sampling point only in experiment 2 performed to evaluate the effects on bioactivity from the different treatment processes in the pilot plant due to potential dbp formation sodium hypochlorite and monochloramine were added to finished gacout water samples from the pilot process at doses typical for swedish dwtps 0 3 0 4 mg l 1 residual measured as free and total chlorine respectively referred to as normal dose in text tables and figures ph was adjusted to 8 5 using 1 m naoh the experiment was performed on nine gacout samples with three replicates for control without addition sodium hypochlorite and monochloramine addition respectively after disinfectant addition the samples were stored in the dark at 15 c for 24 h before spe conditions designed to mimic a situation for analyzing water at the consumer s tap in experiment 3 a high dose chlorination experiment was performed to water samples after each treatment step in the pilot plant rw sixout ceramacout o3 ceramacout o3 gacout to distinguish between the effect of ozone and coagulation on the ceramic membrane direct filtration samples were collected with ozone turned on and off respectively the ozone levels were controlled by online measurements as well as repeated manual sampling and measurements accuvac mr method hach at ozoneout and ceramacout sodium hypochlorite was added to the water samples at a residual of 10 mg cl2 l 1 measured as free chlorine at ph 8 5 the chlorinated samples were stored in the dark at room temperature for 3 days hypochlorite was added to fifteen water samples in total three replicate samples for each step in the treatment process two controls were included for each step without addition of hypochlorite one control for each treatment step was collected at the same day while the other was collected another day due to practical reasons after 3 days all samples had levels of free chlorine above 6 mg l 1 to shift the equilibrium towards gaseous chlorine and hence remove reactive chlorine from the water before extraction ph was lowered to 1 5 using 3 m hcl prepared by hydrochloric acid 32 puriss p a and ultrapure water the level of free chlorine was below 1 mg l 1 before spe was initiated 2 3 sample preparation water samples except those subject to high dose chlorination were adjusted to ph 2 5 using 3 m hcl prepared by hydrochloric acid 32 puriss p a and ultrapure water and extracted using spe with a agilent bond elute ppl resin 1 g 6 ml and a vacuum manifold system the cartridges were conditioned with lc ms ultra chromasolv methanol meoh 10 ml followed by ultrapure water 10 ml ph 2 5 the volume used for extraction was based on the amount of dissolved organic carbon doc for raw water 2 5 l and 5 l for other samples the water samples were connected to the cartridges by teflon tubing and the flow was kept below 20 ml min 1 by a peristaltic pump after extraction the cartridges were washed with lc ms ultra chromasolv 0 1 formic acid in water to remove remaining ions and dried briefly 15 s with air using the vacuum manifold finally the cartridges were eluted with lc ms ultra chromasolv meoh 10 ml and the extracts stored in freezer at 20 c before bioanalysis 9 5 ml of the meoh sample was spiked with 50 μl 2 5 l samples or 100 μl 5 l samples dimethyl sulfoxide dmso as a keeper and the meoh was evaporated using an automatic environmental speedvac system each sample was then re dissolved in a lower volume of ethanol total volume of 0 5 ml for the 2 5 l samples and total volume of 1 ml for the 5 l samples giving an enrichment factor of 5000 2 4 analysis of water characteristics dissolved organic carbon doc and absorbance at 254 nm uva254 was used to assess nom quantity and quality the specific absorbance suva determined at 254 nm have been used to indicate the degree of aromaticity of nom weishaar et al 2003 water samples were stored at 8 c until analysis of doc maximum 6 days and absorbance maximum 3 days doc was measured at the norrvatten accredited lab using the non purgeable organic carbon npoc method multi n c 3100 analytik jena absorbance at 254

bioassays the water samples and vehicle control were tested for ahr and nrf2 activities in reporter gene assays and for cytotoxicity by cell viability assays mts assay in addition water samples from the high dose chlorination experiment experiment 3 were tested for genotoxicity by an in vitro micronucleus test nrf2 activity was assayed in a hepg2 cell line stably transfected with a luciferase plasmid where the expression of the luciferase protein is under the control of an nrf2 responsive promoter element this cell line was purchased from signosis inc santa clara ca catalog number sl 0046 np and the assay was performed in accordance with the standardized protocol including recommended positive control provided by the manufacturer ahr activity was assayed in transiently transfected hepg2 cells using a luciferase reporter plasmid under the control of a dna element responsive to ligand activated ahr promega rosenmai et al 2018 micronuclei formation was assayed by flow cytometry in human lymphoblast tk6 cells using a microflow kit litron laboratories us a detailed description of the bioanalytical methods is provided in supplementary information when incubated with the cells the concentrated water samples were diluted 100 fold with cell medium to get a final concentration of 0 9 ethanol and 0 1 dmso and a relative enrichment factor ref of 50 0 9 ethanol and 0 1 dmso was used as solvent control for nrf2 activity selected samples were run in dilution series to enable the calculation of effect concentrations the enrichment and dilution of the samples constitute the ref calculated as described by escher et al 2014 r e f e n r i c h m e n t f a c t o r s p e d i l u t i o n f a c t o r b i o a s s a y the dilution and enrichment factors are calculated by the following

mitomycin c mmc for the micronucleus test the standard curve for tcdd was used to calculate the tcdd equivalent concentration tcddeq for observed ahr activities 2 6 technical replicates for each sample site and experimental treatment of water three technical replicate samples were collected or produced to prove technical reproducibility all three technical replicates were analyzed in quadruplicate in the bioassays for nrf2 and ahr activities all three technical replicates for each sampling site and experimental treatment showed reproducible bioassay result one technical replicate for each sampling site or experimental treatment was then reanalyzed in an independent experiment for each bioassay to prove biological reproducibility the independent bioassays showed reproducible results the results from one of these representative experiments are presented 2 7 data analysis initially all water samples were analyzed for bioactivity at ref 50 in the bioassays for nrf2 and ahr activities for nrf2 activity an induction ratio of 1 5 compared to vehicle control was used as the cut off value for bioactivity as proposed by escher et al 2012 samples showing nrf2 activity at ref 50 was then analyzed in a 2 fold dilution series from ref 25 to ref 0 78 to investigate concentration response relationships and enable the calculation of the relative enrichment factor corresponding to an induction ratio of 1 5 ecir1 5 for ahr a 2 fold induction of the activity compared to the vehicle control was used as the cut off value for bioactivity this definition of bioactivity for the ahr bioassay was calculated from the limit of detection lod for the assay which was defined as 1 plus 3 times the standard deviation for the vehicle control only minor effects on ahr activity were observed at ref 50 and for that reason no concentration response experiments were performed for the ahr activity micronucleus test was performed for samples in the high dose chlorination experiment experiment 3 each sample was analyzed at the highest non cytotoxic ref value 3 results and discussion 3 1 water characteristics doc concentrations uva254 and suva values are presented in table 1 in the conventional full scale treatment doc was reduced from 6 9 to 3 9 mg l 1 in the novel pilot scale treatment doc was reduced to about 2 5 mg l 1 already after six ozonation had little effect on the doc concentration while in line coagulation together with the ceramic micro filtration further reduced doc to about 2 mg l 1 finally the activated carbon filter removed doc to a final concentration of 0 4 0 5 mg l 1 in the finished pilot process water it should be noted that the gac filter was not saturated at the time of sampling and the doc removal capacity might be lower in a full scale application where filters may be operated as biological filters i e as biological active carbon bac the pilot treatment process also affected uva254 and suva more dramatically compared to the conventional process table 1 the conventional process reduced suva from 2 8 to 2 0 l mg 1 m 1 while the pilot process provided a reduction down to 0 3 0 4 l mg 1 m 1 all steps in the pilot process reduced 254 nm absorbance and suva with no doc removal but a major reduction in uv absorbance the effect of ozone on suva was clear indicating a modification of the organic material composition resulting from cleavage of aromatic structures for the other treatments uva254 and suva reductions were likely due to removal of uv absorbing organic structures e g aromatic structures 3 2 cell viability to ensure that the bioassays were conducted under conditions where the general cell viability was not compromised we assayed the effects of all concentrated water samples on the cell viability of hepg2 cells at ref 50 none of the water samples exerted cytotoxic effects defined as a cell viability 80 compared to the vehicle control at ref 50 fig s1 3 3 ahr activity for the conventional process a 2 fold induction in the ahr activity was observed in the concentrated samples representing both raw water and the finished drinking water at ref 50 fig 2 a indicating that there are compounds present in the raw water causing this effect and that the current treatment process steps are unable to remove these compounds we have previously observed similar results regarding ahr activities for drinking water produced from the same water source rosenmai et al 2018 for the pilot plant the observed 2 fold induction of ahr activity in the raw water was unaltered by suspended ion exchange treatment but clearly decreased by ozonation fig 2b possibly due to decreased concentration of aromatic compounds after ozone treatment normal dose disinfection of water collected after gac with chlorine or monochloramine did not induce ahr activity fig 2d and furthermore the ahr activity did not differ from the gac effluent without hypochlorite or monochloramine addition this demonstrates the benefit of increased nom removal prior to monochloramine dosing compared to the full scale treatment in contrast high dose chlorination caused a 2 fold induction of ahr activity in all samples from the pilot treatment process fig 2e the observed effects are equivalent to effects caused by tcdd at concentrations in the range of 125 167 pm table s1 3 4 nrf2 activity in conventional and pilot treatment process experiment 1 showed that the induction for nrf2 activity in the raw water was below the cut off level for activity of 1 5 fold at ref 50 fig 3 a the two samples of finished drinking water from the conventional treatment process showed an induction ratio for nrf2 of approximately 2 at ref 50 fig 3a a higher induction ratio in the treated drinking water compared to the raw water indicates that nrf2 inducing compounds are formed during the conventional water treatment process the change in induction ratio in this case however is marginal and statistically non significant and should therefore be interpreted with caution raw water and two drinking water samples from the conventional process was also analyzed in a dilution series covering ref 25 to 0 78 fig 4 a c ecir1 5 was calculated to ref 21 9 for raw water 21 0 and 24 9 respectively for the two drinking water samples fig 4a c the pilot process without disinfection resulted in a decreased induction ratio for nrf2 after suspended ion exchange indicating that this treatment removes nrf2 inducing compounds fig 3b experiment 1 all these samples had an ecir1 5 of 50 ref disinfection of finished pilot plant water gac filtrate with normal doses of hypochlorite and monochloramine experiment 2 did not induce nrf2 activity indicating that the pilot plant has removed pre cursors resulting in decreased formation of toxic dbps compared to the conventional full scale process fig 3d the ref values of drinking water from the current process can be compared to the study by hebert et al 2018 reporting ecir1 5 in the range from ref 15 to 100 from a study of three drinking water plants in france with rather big differences in ecir1 5 ref values between plants and sampling seasons for all three water distribution systems higher nrf2 activities were observed in may and september compared to november and march for may the authors also observed higher levels of total organic carbon toc and dbps as compared to november and march which could be an explanation for the observed increase in nrf2 activity however the toc and dbp levels in september were similar to those observed in november and march in a bioanalytical assessment of an australian drinking water treatment plant neale et al 2012 found increased toxicity including nrf2 activity after chlorination which was associated with increased levels of both adsorbable organic halogens aoxs which represent the total level of halogenated compounds and specific dbps chcl3 chbrcl2 chbr2cl chbr3 they reported an ecir1 5 of ref 35 for the raw inlet water an ecir1 5 of ref 3 23 after chlorination 2 2 5 mg l 1 free chlorine residual 2 3 mg l 1 doc and of ref 5 54 after subsequent chloramination 2 5 mg l 1 total chlorine residual 2 3 mg l 1 doc in the present study we observed higher doc levels in the samples from the conventional full scale process compared to the plants studied by neale et al but also higher ecir1 5 values for the oxidative stress response however the monochloramine residual used in our study was lower 0 3 mg l 1 measured as total chlorine likely explaining part of the difference in ecir1 5 values an effect based trigger value based on the australian drinking water guidelines has been proposed by escher et al 2013 as an ecir1 5 of ref 6 for nrf2 activity compared to the proposed effect trigger value our study shows a 3 5 4 0 fold margin for the observed effects by water samples from the conventional water treatment process it should be noted that the effect based trigger value and our study has been performed with two different assays although both assay the nrf2 activity however the sensitivity of these two assays are similar shown by the similarity in ecir1 5 for the positive control in this study we report an ecir1 5 of 1 7 2 0 μm for tbhq while it has been reported to be 1 1 μm escher et al 2013 and 1 9 μm hebert et al 2018 for the arec32 assay this indicates that the results obtained with the assay used in this study can be compared with the effect based trigger value obtained with the arec32 assay 3 5 formation potential of nrf2 inducing and genotoxic disinfection by products in the experiment investigating the effect of each pilot treatment step on disinfection induced toxicity experiment 3 water samples from each step were disinfected with a high dose of hypochlorite 10 mg cl2 l 1 with a contact time of 3 days we observed a drastic increase by 30 fold compared to the vehicle control in nrf2 activity when raw water was chlorinated fig 3e for water that had been treated with suspended ion exchange before chlorination the nrf2 induction was reduced by 70 as compared to the raw water indicating that six removes compounds from the water that can form nrf2 activating compounds additional treatment steps further reduced the potential for nrf2 induction after chlorination all samples from the high dose chlorination experiment were analyzed in dilution series to enable the calculation of ecir1 5 for the nrf2 inducing effect fig 4d h the ecir1 5 for raw water exposed to high dose chlorination was ref 4 7 after six ref 7 1 after ceramic microfiltration including in line coagulation and ozonation ref 22 3 and after activated carbon filter ref 47 2 this increase in the ecir1 5 value for each step in the pilot treatment process indicates that the treatment steps remove compounds from the water that have the potential to form nrf2 activating compounds in the disinfection process the ecir1 5 values for each sample is presented in table 2 as described above escher et al 2013 have proposed an effect based trigger value for the nrf2 activity of an ecir1 5 value of ref 6 in this study the raw water used for drinking water production had an ecir1 5 below the proposed effect based trigger value when disinfected with 10 mg l 1 chlorine and would thus indicate a potential health hazard if it was drinking water the treatment techniques in the studied pilot plant increased the ecir1 5 drastically and when water collected after the pilot plant process was chlorinated with 10 mg l 1 chlorine the ecir1 5 was 47 2 meaning that the treated water has a margin of more than 7 fold for the observed effects as compared to the proposed effect trigger value there is a strong correlation between the doc concentrations associated with each stage in the pilot treatment process and the nrf2 activity at ref 50 fig 5 a lending support to the hypothesis that the formation of oxidative stress inducing compounds in the high dose disinfection process depends to a high extent on the doc level nrf2 activities at ref 50 were also plotted against uva254 fig 5b producing a better fit where uva254 could be used to explain nrf2 activities associated with dbps formed also for the point after ozonation this indicates that the abundance of uva254 absorbing nom compounds and their associated structural characteristics i e aromatic moieties could best describe the formation of oxidative stress inducing compounds upon high dose chlorination uva254 shows a very high correlation with nrf2 activity even if the raw water sample is excluded from the analysis r2 0 972 data not shown which is not the case for the correlation between doc concentration and nrf2 activity with the raw water sample excluded r2 0 649 data not shown farré et al 2013 have reported ecir1 5 of ref 1 8 5 6 following formation potential experiments chlorine and monochloramine residual 2 mg cl2 l 1 reaction time 3 days ph 7 of water sampled after the coagulation stage for three conventional drinking water treatment plants with ecir1 5 of ref 7 8 9 9 before chlorination we observed an ecir1 5 of ref 4 7 and 7 1 after chlorination 10 mg l 1 3 days ph 8 5 of raw water and after six respectively one of the dwtp evaluated by farré et al with similar doc levels 2 8 mg l 1 and suva 2 05 l mg 1 m 1 after coagulation compared to sixout had an ecir1 5 of ref 2 8 the higher nrf2 activity reported by farré et al despite lower chlorination could be due to a higher level of bromide in that water source 0 16 mg l 1 compared to lake mälaren 0 03 0 05 mg l 1 at the point after six resulting in elevated levels of more toxic br dbps as dbps may also be genotoxic we analyzed the samples from the high dose chlorination experiments in an in vitro micronucleus test as a cytotoxicity control cells were stained with ethidium monoazide ema in accordance with the instructions from the manufacturer a cut off for cytotoxicity was set at 55 ema positive cells samples were analyzed at the highest possible ref still having an ema positive score 55 raw water disinfected with high dose chlorination had an ema positive score of 77 this sample was therefore analyzed at ref 25 we found fig 6 that raw water subjected to high dose chlorination for 3 days exerted a significant genotoxicity with a micronuclei percentage above 20 at ref 25 for each step in the water treatment process subject to high dose chlorination we observed a decreased micronuclei formation indicating that the water treatment process removes compounds that can form genotoxic products in the disinfection process conflicting results have previously been reported regarding the genotoxicity of dbps for example the three haloacetic acids iodoacetic acid iaa bromoacetic acid baa and chloroacetic acid caa were reported to induce formation of micronuclei by ali et al 2014 while liviac et al 2010 reported that the same three compounds did not induce formation of micronuclei for drinking water samples chen et al 2016 reported induced micronuclei formation after chlorine disinfection our results lend support to the suggestion that drinking water disinfection may form compounds that can induce micronuclei formation several swedish drinking water facilities face challenges due to increasing levels of nom in the source waters this could partly be due to climate change but inadequate catchment management including urbanization construction and development and agricultural practices can also affect the nom level in eastern lake mälaren which provides drinking water for more than two million inhabitants the level of total organic carbon toc yearly average has increased from approximately 7 mg c l 1 to 8 mg c l 1 from the 1990 s to the 2010 s during the same period the toc level in the produced drinking water has also increased the currently used conventional treatment that includes coagulation has limited ability to remove nom and the amount of dbps could be expected to rise this study provides important knowledge on the design of future drinking water treatment processes aiming to decrease the risk associated with dbp formation specifically suspended ion exchange showed promising potential with a three fold reduction of the nrf2 activity along with decreased micronuclei formation for lake mälaren water furthermore ozonation showed to reduce almost two fold fig 3e the formation of nrf2 inducing compounds in spite of limited doc removal highlighting that the organic carbon concentration might not accurately predict the formation of nrf2 inducing dbps after this step the decrease in nrf2 inducing compounds during ozonation could however be explained by a change in structural characteristics of the organic carbon measured as uva254 which indicates a strong correlation between aromatic nom and formation of dbps causing oxidative stress during chlorination the combination of in line coagulation with ozonation and ceramac also reduced the nrf2 activity and micronuclei formation however the effect of gac needs to be interpreted with caution since the filter was rather new and not saturated which is the normal situation at many drinking water treatment plants the findings from these type of experiments reflect the toxicity of the extract from the spe cartridge used alterations in nrf2 activity or micronuclei formation could be due to changes in the amount of dbps formed as well as changes in dbp speciation importantly both situations are accounted for providing a relevant bioanalytical assessment of human dbp exposure when performing sample preparation with spe according to the current protocol it can be expected that only non volatile and semi volatile dbps but not volatile dbps are retained in the sample it has been reported that the bioactivity from volatile dbps to a large extent is explained by known dbps stalter et al 2016b and mixture toxicity modeling has shown that the volatile fraction of the dbps only had a minor contribution to the total bioactivity of dbps hebert et al 2018 therefore the method used is expected to capture a highly relevant fraction of dbps formed it should be noted that spe extraction have a doc extraction efficiency in the order of 60 for these types of samples and that more hydrophilic compounds are extracted to a lower degree than more hydrophobic compounds dittmar et al 2008 however spe extraction following the same protocol as here and analyzed with fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry revealed 800 novel dbps from one single dwtp gonsior et al 2014 confirming that spe extracts capture a high number and complex mixture of dbps 4 conclusions in conclusion we have used a bioanalytical assessment approach to show that a water treatment process including suspended ion exchange six followed by ozonation in line coagulation ceramic microfiltration ceramac and granular activated carbon gac efficiently decreased the oxidative stress and genotoxic activity which most probably can be connected to their removal or influence on precursors leading to alterations in dbp formation and toxicity further we have shown that uva254 absorbing nom compounds show a very high correlation with the risk of disinfection induced toxicity in the form of nrf2 activity conflicts of interest the authors

18937,the stability and transport of clay colloids in groundwater are strongly influenced by colloid interactions with dissolved organic matter dom protein is an important dom component that is ubiquitous in natural water reclaimed water and soil solutions to date the interactions between clay colloids and proteins have not been fully studied the objective of this study was to examine the effect of bovine serum albumin bsa a representative protein on the stability aggregation and transport of kaolinite colloids under neutral ph conditions hydrodynamic diameter and ζ potential measurements stability tests and column transport experiments were performed in salt solutions with a range of ionic strengths and different bsa concentrations at ph 7 additionally bsa kaolinite colloid interactions were studied using tem and batch adsorption experiments the experimental results showed that bsa prevented colloid aggregation and increased the stability and transport of colloids especially at high ionic strength even though the charges of kaolinite colloids were less negative in the presence of bsa theoretical calculation of the interaction energies indicated that xdlvo theory in which the steric force is considered due to bsa adsorption could correctly quantify the interaction energies in the presence of bsa this study demonstrated that the role of protein needs to be determined in order to better predict the overall effect of dom on particle aggregation and transport in the soil environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords clay colloids bsa fine particle aggregation and transport steric force xdlvo theory 1 introduction clay colloids are abundant in groundwater and can act as carriers for many organic and inorganic contaminants grolimund et al 1996 saiers 2002 walshe et al 2010 cheng and saiers 2015 the stability and transport of clay colloids therefore have significant implications for contaminant migration and groundwater quality natural dissolved organic matter dom is present in almost all aquatic and soil ecosystems and plays a critical role in mediating the stability aggregation and transport of clay colloids in subsurface environments additionally dom has an important influence on nutrient cycling contaminant transport and many other biogeochemistry processes kim and corapcioglu 2002a 2002b nebbioso and piccolo 2013 jansen et al 2014 wang et al 2015 fisher power and cheng 2018 cheng et al 2016 the major components of dom are humic substances such as humic and fulvic acids in many studies humic substances are used as a representative for dom to investigate how dom influences the stability and transport of fine particles wu and cheng 2016 hu et al 2010 zhu et al 2014 humic substances can significantly increase the stability and transport of clay colloids bacteria viruses and engineered nanomaterials huangfu et al 2013 han et al 2014 cheng and saiers 2015 dong et al 2017 in addition to humic substances other organic molecules such as proteins amino acids mono and poly saccharides nucleic acids and fatty acids may be present in aquatic systems often as minor components of dom qin et al 2018 protein is a major component of extracellular polymeric substances eps and decomposition products of phytoplankton nebbioso and piccolo 2013 protein is frequently found in surface water philippe and schaumann 2014 animal manure zhou et al 2016 and dairy industry waste barral et al 2008 schulze 2005 reported the presence of several proteins in dom samples collected at two different soil depths 5 cm and 90 cm and during both seasons summer and winter fellman et al 2009 found 11 4 7 1 and 8 1 protein like components in the dissolved organic carbon solutions from the subcatchment of bog forested wetland and upland forest soils respectively proteins are also typical in reclaimed water which is being used to recharge groundwater zhu et al 2018 it was found that the concentration of protein like compounds in the reclaimed water was 8 6 mg l 1 and that the effluent from recharge was 2 74 mg l 1 zhu et al 2018 therefore protein is one of the important substances in the subsurface environment which is rich in microbial activity and organic matter proteins can promote the stability of engineered nanoparticles e g single walled carbon nanotubes saleh et al 2010 ceo2 nanoparticles zhang et al 2016 hematite nanoparticles sheng et al 2016 silver nanoparticles valenti and giacomelli 2015 and tio2 nanoparticles ren et al 2017 additionally the ability of eps to stabilize tio2 nanoparticles was found to increase with increasing protein concentration in eps lin et al 2016 furthermore the outer membrane protein tolc prevented escherichia coli attachment to porous media and promoted transport feriancikova et al 2013 whereas the enterococcal surface protein increased the attachment of enterococcus faecium to silica sand and inhibited transport johanson et al 2012 these results showed that proteins or protein like components can stabilize fine particles compared to that of humic substances the surface charge of proteins is usually weak therefore protein adsorption to fine particles slightly decreases the electrostatic repulsion between particles huangfu et al 2013 the enhanced stability and transport of fine particles caused by proteins are related to other mechanisms it was suggested that steric interactions could be a major factor in increasing the repulsive interactions between particles which resulted in the enhanced stability of fine particles saleh et al 2010 sheng et al 2016 therefore proteins might play a vital role in the stability and transport of clay colloids in the subsurface environment the stability of clay colloids is highly related to solution

swartzen allen and matijevic 1976 sotirelis and chrysikopoulos 2017 the transport of clay colloids can be affected by various factors in the porous media including the flow velocity chen et al 2005

mineral surfaces ding and henrichs 2002 barral et al 2008 duarte silva et al 2014 lepoitevin et al 2014 hence proteins may alter the stability and transport of clay colloids as well nelson et al 1999 found that clay particles in natural sediments were easier to disperse in water when the sediments contained higher amino acid or protein content indicating that these organic species may stabilize clay particles however to our current knowledge there have been no systematic studies on how protein influences the stability and transport of clay colloids this type of study is necessary to distinguish the distinct role of protein in dom on clay colloids so that the overall effect of dom can be better predicted the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of protein on clay colloid stability and transport bovine serum albumin bsa is one of the most abundant proteins in serum and biological culture media and is commonly used as a model for proteins saleh et al 2010 valenti and giacomelli 2015 zhang et al 2016 sheng et al 2016 in addition bsa and similar proteins are commonly found in urban sewage and discharges of wastewater treatment plants vakondios et al 2014 ren et al 2017 bsa was chosen as a representative material in this study to investigate its influence on kaolinite colloid aggregation and transport under neutral ph conditions the light absorbance and particle size of kaolinite suspensions under a range of ionic strengths and bsa concentrations were measured to determine the stability and aggregation of the kaolinite colloids at ph 7 column experiments were carried out to examine colloid transport in quartz sand under water chemistry conditions similar to those used in the stability tests the interaction energies among the kaolinite colloids and between kaolinite and quartz sand were calculated using the classical dlvo theory or xdlvo theory to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved at ph 7 2 materials and methods 2 1 porous media quartz sand sinopharm chemical reagent china with a diameter range of 425 600 μm was used in the column experiments to remove a trace amount of metal oxides the sieved sand was soaked in the concentrated hcl for at least 24 h and then rinsed with di water until the electrical conductivity of the solution was less than 2 μs cm 1 the sand was dried at 105 c in an oven and then heated for at least 4 h in a muffle furnace at 600 c to remove the organic compounds yang et al 2017 to measure the electrophoretic mobility epm of fine quartz particles the sand was crushed to powder and then suspended in di water the obtained sand suspension was gravitationally settled for 30 min and then the supernatant was used to measure the epm using zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk shang et al 2013 wang et al 2014 2015a 2 2 preparation of solution and suspensions to prepare bsa stock solution 0 1 g bsa powder product number a7030 sigma aldrich was added to 0 1 l di water and stirred until bsa was well dispersed the bsa stock solution was stored in a refrigerator at 4 c until use kaolinite stock suspension was prepared by suspending 10 g kaolinite powder product number 60609 sigma aldrich in 1 l di water the specific surface area of kaolinite is 16 0 m2 g 1 which was measured using a micromeritics instrument asap 2020 atlanta usa by the n2 bet method at 77 k the kaolinite has the cation exchange capacity of 24 3 cmol kg 1 as determined with compulsive exchange method using mg2 ca2 exchange sumner and miller 1996 kaolinite suspension was prepared in a 1 l graduated cylinder and settled for 24 h to obtain colloidal kaolinite the top 30 cm supernatant from the graduated cylinder was carefully collected and used as a stock suspension of kaolinite colloid and kaolinite concentration of the stock suspension was determined gravimetrically jerez et al 2006 2 3 characterization of kaolinite without with bsa a 50 mg l 1 kaolinite colloid suspension was prepared in the absence presence of different concentration of bsa 4 8 16 mg l 1 at various is 1 10 50 and 100 mm with ph 7 the hydrodynamic diameter d h and epm of bare kaolinite and kaolinite with bsa kao bsa were determined at ph 7 using zetasizer and the epm results were used in ohshima s soft particle theory ohshima 1994 the epms of bsa and kaolinite were measured in 0 1 mm nano3 solution with varying ph from 3 to 11 the ζ potentials of the suspensions were calculated based on the measured epm using the smoluchowski equation wang et al 2015a kaolinite colloid suspensions were examined on a transmission electron microscope tem jem 1230 jeol operated at 80 kv the tem samples were prepared by placing a drop of kaolinite suspension with without 8 mg l 1 bsa in 10 mm nano3 solution with ph 7 on a 200 mesh copper grid coated with carbon and then dried under an led lamp more than 50 bsa colloids in the tem images were randomly selected and analyzed to determine particle size distribution using imagej software sheng et al 2016 2 4 bsa adsorption experiment the isotherms of bsa adsorption to kaolinite colloid or quartz sand under various is 1 5 10 50 and 100 mm at neutral ph condition were experimentally determined by batch experiments to measure bsa adsorption on kaolinite 50 mg l 1 kaolinite suspensions at different is were sonicated in an ultrasonic bath shumei kq 300 300w 40 khz jiangsu china for 10 min before adding the chosen bsa concentrations of 0 0 5 1 2 4 8 16 mg l 1 to measure bsa adsorption on quartz sand 2 0 g of quartz sand was mixed with bsa concentrations of 0 0 5 1 0 2 5 5 0 7 5 and 10 0 mg l 1 at different is and neutral ph conditions the kaolinite bsa and sand bsa mixtures were shaken at 120 rpm for 120 min after shaking the kaolinite bsa mixture was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 20 min to settle down the kaolinite colloids the sand bsa mixture was stood in the centrifuge tubes for 10 min to obtain the residual bsa in the supernatant the bsa concentration in the supernatant was measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f97 pro leng guang china the adsorbed bsa concentration was calculated as difference between the initial bsa concentration and residual bsa concentration in the supernatant after shaking 2 5 stability test to evaluate the effect of bsa on the stability of kaolinite colloid kaolinite suspension was prepared firstly at different is 1 5 10 50 or 100 mm solutions and then bsa was added into kaolinite suspension with the selected concentrations the is of the suspensions was adjusted using 1 m nano3 solution and the ph of the suspension was adjusted to 7 using 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hno3 solutions the kaolinite concentration in the suspension was 50 mg l 1 with different concentration 0 4 8 or 16 mg l 1 of bsa for the stability experiment immediately after preparation the absorbance of the suspensions was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer tu 1900 persee china to determine the initial absorbance a 0 at a wavelength of 350 nm the absorbance a of the suspension was then measured every 2 min until the last measurement was taken at 120 min the wavelength of 350 nm was chosen to eliminate the interference of bsa on the measurement of kaolinite previous studies and our preliminary tests showed that the absorbance of clay colloids was high at this wavelength whereas the absorbance of bsa was negligible sun et al 2010 zhu et al 2012 2 6 column experiments a stainless steel column length 12 6 cm and diameter 2 6 cm was used for kaolinite colloid transport experiments the column was wet packed with clean quartz sand and a nylon membrane pore size 180 μm was placed at each end of the column to hold the sand and distribute water flow the bulk density of the packed column was approximately 1 39 g cm 3 and the average porosity was around 0 47 table 1 influent kaolinite suspensions were prepared firstly by mixing stock kaolinite suspension and then mixed with appropriate amount of bsa stock solution for at least 10 min before the column experiment kaolinite concentration of the influent suspension was 50 mg l 1 and the concentrations of bsa were 0 4 8 and 16 mg l 1 respectively nano3 solution with different is 1 5 10 50 or 100 mm was used as the background solution and the same ph of 7 a peristaltic pump dhl a huxi china was connected to the bottom of the column to inject the solution suspension at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 the column was flushed with the background solution for at least 10 pore volumes pvs afterward 3 pvs of kaolinite suspensions in the same background solution were injected followed by elution with 5 pvs of the background solution the effluent was collected at 5 min interval using a fraction collector bsz 100 huxi china at the end of each column experiment the sand in the column was carefully excavated at 1 cm increment to determine the spatial distribution of the retained kaolinite each sand fraction of the column was placed into 20 ml di water in a 50 ml flask and shaken for 4 h to release kaolinite colloids from the sand surface the kaolinite concentration of the samples was determined using uv vis spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 350 nm a tracer test was also performed to determine the dispersivity of the packed column during a tracer test the column was flushed firstly with at least 10 pvs of di water to equilibrate the steady flow system in the column 3 pvs of 3 mm nano3 solution was injected into the column which was followed by elution with 5 pvs of di water no3 concentration in the effluent was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 235 nm following the method used by shang et al 2010 2 7 calculation of interaction energy the kaolinite kaolinite and kaolinite quartz interaction energy were calculated using the classical dlvo theory or extended dlvo xdlvo theory tables s2 and si ohshima s soft particle theory ohshima 1994 1995 phenrat et al 2007 zhang et al 2013 was applied to the kao bsa suspension systems for calculating the thickness of the adsorbed bsa layer d tables s3 and si which was used to quantify the steric energy in the xdlvo calculation detailed information describing the calculation of the dlvo xdlvo and ohshima s soft particle theory is provided in the supplementary data 3 results and discussion 3 1 kaolinite stability and aggregation the measured ζ potentials of kaolinite and bsa are shown in fig s1 indicating that kaolinite is negatively charged in the selected ph range 3 ph 11 and bsa is negatively charged when the solution ph is higher than 4 8 a previous study showed that the point of zero charge pzc of bsa in a 1 mm nano3 solution was approximately 4 76 salgin et al 2012 this result meant that the interaction between kaolinite and bsa was repulsive at neutral ph which was the selected ph for all the experiments in this study if the solution ph was lower than 4 76 the interaction between kaolinite and bsa was favorable when the solution ph was neutral or alkaline the absolute zeta potential value of the bsa suspension was much lower than that of the kaolinite suspension indicating that bsa had a less negative surface charge than kaolinite the stability of the kaolinite suspensions at ph 7 was noticeably affected by bsa fig 1 in the absence of bsa the suspensions were unstable for all the iss tested 1 100 mm as evidenced by the decrease in the relative absorbance a a 0 with time fig 1 a it was also observed that a higher is resulted in a higher degree of instability as shown by the more rapid decrease in the relative absorbance the interaction energy between kaolinite particles at each of the iss calculated using the dlvo theory showed that at is values of 1 5 and 10 mm the energy barrier was high and the instability was due to secondary minima whereas at is values of 50 and 100 mm no energy barrier was present and the aggregation was under favorable conditions fig 2 a bsa greatly increased the stability at ph 7 especially at high is with 8 mg l 1 bsa the relative absorbance of all the suspensions decreased only slightly during the experiment fig 1 b at is values of 10 and 100 mm the addition of 4 8 and 16 mg l 1 bsa promoted stability fig 1 c and d however the decrease in the relative absorbance was not sensitive to bsa concentration i e the additional increase in bsa concentration did not further change stability the results of hydrodynamic diameter measurements confirmed that bsa enhanced the kaolinite dispersion at ph 7 in the absence of bsa the particle size increased from 500 nm to over 2000 nm when the is increased from 1 to 100 mm fig s2 a si the higher particle size at a higher is in the absence of bsa correlated well with the greater decrease in relative absorbance a a 0 in the stability tests fig 1 implying that the decrease in the relative absorbance was due to particle aggregation which promoted particle gravity sedimentation and further changed the light absorbance properties of the particle when 8 mg l 1 bsa was present particle size only slightly increased especially at higher is values fig s2 a si at a fixed is of 10 or 100 mm compared to those without bsa the particle sizes were smaller approximately 1000 nm when bsa was present and the size decreased with increasing bsa concentration when the is was equal to 100 mm fig s2 b si tem observations also provided further confirmation that bsa prevented kaolinite colloid aggregation when bsa was absent in a 10 mm nano3 solution large particle aggregates with diameters of 4000 5000 nm were observed by tem fig s3 a si which was larger than the hydrodynamic size of the aggregates in suspension due to the aggregation by drying in contrast at the same is the size of the kaolinite aggregates was much smaller 500 nm fig s3 b si when 8 mg l 1 bsa was present it is well established that organic macro molecules such as humic substances increase the dispersion and stability of colloids and nanoparticles mainly via electrostatic or steric effects loosli et al 2013 tang and cheng 2018 additionally previous studies suggested that biocolloids e g bacteria and virus could be adsorbed on the surface of kaolinite when the biocolloids and kaolinite coexisted in the solution syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2010 vasiliadou et al 2011 vasiliadou and chrysikopoulos 2011 adsorption of these negatively charged biocolloids to clay surfaces altered the negative charges of the clay and hence influenced the repulsive forces between the heteroaggregates of biocolloids and clay particles in our experiments both tem observation and bsa isotherm results confirmed bsa adsorption to kaolinite surfaces figs s3 b and fig s4 a si a previous study showed that the ζ potential of mno2 could be altered because of bsa adsorption huangfu et al 2013 the charges of bsa at ph 7 however were weaker than those of clay colloids with ionic strength changing from 1 to 100 mm the ζ potential of bsa ranged from 9 0 to 3 5 mv figs s5 and si which was much less negative than those of kaolinite colloids 40 8 to 22 6 mv in the absence of bsa table 2 the addition of 8 mg l 1 bsa to the kaolinite suspensions shifted the ζ potential of kaolinite to less negative values 30 6 to 15 6 mv at each of the is values table 2 suggesting that adsorbed bsa induced less repulsive interaction as shown in fig 2 a the secondary minima 3 3 and 6 1 kt at is 5 and 10 mm respectively were deeper than the mean thermal energy of brownian particles 1 5 kt hahn and o melia 2004 and they were sufficiently deep to cause aggregation these interaction energy profiles were in agreement with the experimentally observed stability aggregation at different iss the presence of bsa largely enhanced the stability of kaolinite particles at different iss the interaction energy calculated using the xdlvo theory in which the steric forces were considered showed much higher energy barriers 10 000 kt for all iss fig 2 b c and d fig s6 shows that even at is 50 mm the steric repulsion provided a high energy barrier energy barriers 10 000 kt between tio2 nanoparticles and surfactants have also been previously reported sun et al 2015 these predictions were consistent with the enhanced stability in systems with bsa and demonstrated that the steric forces due to adsorbed bsa played an essential role in stabilizing the kaolinite particles 3 2 kaolinite transport 3 2 1 effect of ionic strength in the absence of bsa in the absence of bsa kaolinite transport and retention were strongly influenced by is with increasing is the effluent kaolinite concentration c c 0 decreased while the retained particle concentration n n i increased fig 3 a and b this result was consistent with previous studies zhuang et al 2004 chowdhury et al 2011 wang et al 2015a chrysikopoulos et al 2017 and was attributable to the increased attractive interaction energy between kaolinite particles and quartz sand the interaction energy calculated by the classical dlvo theory showed that when the is was in the range of 1 50 mm the energy barriers were high 108 0 816 7 kt and the higher kaolinite retention at higher is was due to the deeper secondary minima table 2 at is 10 mm the secondary minima were deeper than 1 5 kt which caused a large amount of particle retention at the grain surface at an is of 100 mm no energy barrier was present and kaolinite attachment to the sand surface was under favorable conditions resulting in 100 kaolinite retention the shapes of the breakthrough curves btcs and retention profiles rps were also influenced by is at an is of 1 and 5 mm the btcs showed blocking and normal shapes respectively i e after the initial sharp increase the effluent concentration slightly increased called blocking or leveled off normal during particle injection fig 3 a the blocking process occurred because the deposited colloids might have prevented the further attachment of colloids on the collector surface as the fraction of colloid on the surface increased liu et al 1995 camesano et al 1999 the rps at these low iss showed an exponential shape fig 3 b consistent with the classical filtration theory yao et al 1971 at an is higher than 10 mm the btc showed ripening i e after the initial increase the effluent concentration decreased during particle injection fig 3 a ripening was a process in which the rate of colloid deposition could increase with further colloid injection when the attached colloids acted as additional collectors for attachment by forming multilayer films camesano et al 1999 kretzschmar et al 1999 the rp at high is also changed to a hyperexponential shape i e the particles were retained mainly near the column inlet and the retained particle concentration decreased very rapidly with depth fig 3 b which was inconsistent with the classical filtration theory deviation from the classic theory at high iss indicated that deposition mechanisms other than electrostatic forces played an important role under these conditions previous studies have shown that size selective retention may lead to hyperexponential rp jiang et al 2012 wang et al 2015a 2015b as discussed in section 3 1 kaolinite aggregation occurred at high is and the mean hydrodynamic diameter of the aggregate was 2 000 nm at iss of 50 and 100 mm figs s2 and si these large aggregates were susceptible to gravity sedimentation and physical straining xu et al 2006 through which most of the particles were retained near the column inlet 3 2 2 effect of bsa the presence of 8 mg l 1 bsa significantly decreased kaolinite retention and increased transport at each is the amount of kaolinite that was recovered from the effluents with 8 mg l 1 bsa was much higher than that without bsa especially at high is fig 3 c vs fig 3 a and table 1 additionally for all the experiments with added bsa the btcs showed a normal shape or blocking the rps showed an exponential shape for is 10 mm and the rps showed a hyperexponential shape for is 50 mm fig 3 c and d the decreased retention in the experiments with bsa suggested stronger repulsive forces between kaolinite and quartz sand than those in the absence of bsa because bsa showed a weaker negative surface charge the ζ potential of kaolinite became less negative in the presence of bsa due to adsorption as discussed in section 3 1 the ζ potential of quartz sand was not influenced by bsa since bsa adsorption to the quartz surface was negligible as shown by our adsorption experiments fig s4 b si when the steric effect induced by bsa was considered the interaction energy calculated by the xdlvo theory showed high energy barriers 2 000 kt for all experiments table 2 the predictions by the xdlvo theory were consistent with the enhanced transport observed and demonstrated that the steric force due to bsa adsorption which effectively increased the energy barriers between the particle and sand surface was a key mechanism affecting kaolinite attachment and transport similar to bsa some nanoparticles e g tio2 and graphene oxide could reduce the ζ potential of kaolinite however these nanoparticles inhibited kaolinite transport in a water saturated medium cai et al 2014 chrysikopoulos et al 2017 this phenomenon was observed because no steric force between kaolinite and medium existed in the presence of the mentioned colloids the shape of the rps at is 50 mm was hyperexponential and potential reasons have been proposed such as secondary minima hahn and o melia 2004 redman et al 2004 tufenkji and elimelech 2005 shen et al 2007 colloid aggregation chen and elimelech 2006 wang et al 2011 2012 wang et al 2012a straining bradford et al 2002 2003 2006 xu et al 2006 surface roughness bradford and torkzaban 2013 torkzaban and bradford 2016 and surface heterogeneities li et al 2004 tufenkji and elimelech 2005 chatterjee et al 2010 wang et al 2012b in our experiments even at iss of 50 and 100 mm the kaolinite colloids were stable in the presence of bsa as discussed in section 3 1 however the secondary minima 15 7 to 20 1 kt were deeper than 1 5 kt and might have contributed to the hyperexponential shape of the rps straining might be another potential reason for the hyperexponential rps when the maximum value of d h d p was larger than 0 002 bradford et al 2002 2006 wang et al 2013 for the kaolinite colloid at iss of 50 and 100 mm the d h d p values were 0 0040 and 0 0042 respectively without bsa and they were 0 0017 and 0 0022 with 8 mg l 1 bsa suggesting that the straining might also have played a role in kaolinite retention when is 50 mm at a fixed is of 10 mm the kaolinite mobility is increased as the bsa concentration is enhanced from 0 to 4 8 and 16 mg l 1 fig 4 and table 1 again it was found that the steric forces between kaolinite and quartz sand were a key factor that governed the interactions between particles and collectors under varying bsa concentration conditions the interaction energy using xdlvo theory showed a high energy barrier 2 000 kt and a shallow secondary minimum 2 2 kt the shape of the btcs changed from ripening to normal with increasing bsa concentration and the shape of the rps changed from hyperexponential to exponential fig 4 as discussed previously the hyperexponential shape of the rp at high is in the absence of bsa could be caused by size selective retention which retained the larger particles near the column inlet in the presence of bsa kaolinite aggregation was significantly decreased which resulted in smaller particle sizes figs s2 and si this result in turn eliminated gravity sedimentation and physical straining and changed the shape of the rp from hyperexponential to exponential for kaolinite with different concentrations of bsa at an is of 10 mm the highest value of d h d p was 0 0014 table 2 revealing that straining was unlikely to occur at is 100 mm kaolinite transport slightly increased with increasing bsa concentration and the rps showed a hyperexponential shape the secondary minima were substantially deeper 19 7 to 20 4 kt for all tested bsa concentrations and the values of d h d p 0 0027 and 0 0016 were higher than the cutoff value of 0 002 when the bsa concentration was 4 and 8 mg l 1 respectively the above results demonstrated that both the secondary minimum and straining might have contributed to the hyperexponential rp and the lower mobility of kaolinite 4 conclusions this study systematically showed that bsa a representative protein had a significant effect on the stability and transport of clay colloid in salt solutions with varying iss under neutral ph condition since the phpzc of bsa is 4 76 the interaction between bsa and kaolinite is repulsive under neutral ph or alkaline ph conditions the results from this study showed that under ph neutral conditions clay colloid aggregation was inhibited and transport was enhanced in the presence of bsa due to the steric effect of the adsorbed bsa layer on clays these phenomena were more notable at higher is ranges and higher bsa concentrations the ζ potential of clay colloids with adsorbed bsa is less negative than those without bsa which results in weak repulsive electrostatic forces and strong steric forces between surfaces as shown by the xdlvo theory the effect of protein on clay stability and transport was highly dependent on both solution and protein properties more studies are needed to fully understand how the complex interplay of solution ph and protein pzc affects clay colloid stability and transport considering the complex nature and diverse chemical composition of dom in natural aquatic environments and the ubiquitous presence of proteins in these systems this study demonstrated that the approach of using humic substances as a representative dom must be treated with caution additionally the distinct role of different types of organic molecules

18937,the stability and transport of clay colloids in groundwater are strongly influenced by colloid interactions with dissolved organic matter dom protein is an important dom component that is ubiquitous in natural water reclaimed water and soil solutions to date the interactions between clay colloids and proteins have not been fully studied the objective of this study was to examine the effect of bovine serum albumin bsa a representative protein on the stability aggregation and transport of kaolinite colloids under neutral ph conditions hydrodynamic diameter and ζ potential measurements stability tests and column transport experiments were performed in salt solutions with a range of ionic strengths and different bsa concentrations at ph 7 additionally bsa kaolinite colloid interactions were studied using tem and batch adsorption experiments the experimental results showed that bsa prevented colloid aggregation and increased the stability and transport of colloids especially at high ionic strength even though the charges of kaolinite colloids were less negative in the presence of bsa theoretical calculation of the interaction energies indicated that xdlvo theory in which the steric force is considered due to bsa adsorption could correctly quantify the interaction energies in the presence of bsa this study demonstrated that the role of protein needs to be determined in order to better predict the overall effect of dom on particle aggregation and transport in the soil environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords clay colloids bsa fine particle aggregation and transport steric force xdlvo theory 1 introduction clay colloids are abundant in groundwater and can act as carriers for many organic and inorganic contaminants grolimund et al 1996 saiers 2002 walshe et al 2010 cheng and saiers 2015 the stability and transport of clay colloids therefore have significant implications for contaminant migration and groundwater quality natural dissolved organic matter dom is present in almost all aquatic and soil ecosystems and plays a critical role in mediating the stability aggregation and transport of clay colloids in subsurface environments additionally dom has an important influence on nutrient cycling contaminant transport and many other biogeochemistry processes kim and corapcioglu 2002a 2002b nebbioso and piccolo 2013 jansen et al 2014 wang et al 2015 fisher power and cheng 2018 cheng et al 2016 the major components of dom are humic substances such as humic and fulvic acids in many studies humic substances are used as a representative for dom to investigate how dom influences the stability and transport of fine particles wu and cheng 2016 hu et al 2010 zhu et al 2014 humic substances can significantly increase the stability and transport of clay colloids bacteria viruses and engineered nanomaterials huangfu et al 2013 han et al 2014 cheng and saiers 2015 dong et al 2017 in addition to humic substances other organic molecules such as proteins amino acids mono and poly saccharides nucleic acids and fatty acids may be present in aquatic systems often as minor components of dom qin et al 2018 protein is a major component of extracellular polymeric substances eps and decomposition products of phytoplankton nebbioso and piccolo 2013 protein is frequently found in surface water philippe and schaumann 2014 animal manure zhou et al 2016 and dairy industry waste barral et al 2008 schulze 2005 reported the presence of several proteins in dom samples collected at two different soil depths 5 cm and 90 cm and during both seasons summer and winter fellman et al 2009 found 11 4 7 1 and 8 1 protein like components in the dissolved organic carbon solutions from the subcatchment of bog forested wetland and upland forest soils respectively proteins are also typical in reclaimed water which is being used to recharge groundwater zhu et al 2018 it was found that the concentration of protein like compounds in the reclaimed water was 8 6 mg l 1 and that the effluent from recharge was 2 74 mg l 1 zhu et al 2018 therefore protein is one of the important substances in the subsurface environment which is rich in microbial activity and organic matter proteins can promote the stability of engineered nanoparticles e g single walled carbon nanotubes saleh et al 2010 ceo2 nanoparticles zhang et al 2016 hematite nanoparticles sheng et al 2016 silver nanoparticles valenti and giacomelli 2015 and tio2 nanoparticles ren et al 2017 additionally the ability of eps to stabilize tio2 nanoparticles was found to increase with increasing protein concentration in eps lin et al 2016 furthermore the outer membrane protein tolc prevented escherichia coli attachment to porous media and promoted transport feriancikova et al 2013 whereas the enterococcal surface protein increased the attachment of enterococcus faecium to silica sand and inhibited transport johanson et al 2012 these results showed that proteins or protein like components can stabilize fine particles compared to that of humic substances the surface charge of proteins is usually weak therefore protein adsorption to fine particles slightly decreases the electrostatic repulsion between particles huangfu et al 2013 the enhanced stability and transport of fine particles caused by proteins are related to other mechanisms it was suggested that steric interactions could be a major factor in increasing the repulsive interactions between particles which resulted in the enhanced stability of fine particles saleh et al 2010 sheng et al 2016 therefore proteins might play a vital role in the stability and transport of clay colloids in the subsurface environment the stability of clay colloids is highly related to solution

swartzen allen and matijevic 1976 sotirelis and chrysikopoulos 2017 the transport of clay colloids can be affected by various factors in the porous media including the flow velocity chen et al 2005

mineral surfaces ding and henrichs 2002 barral et al 2008 duarte silva et al 2014 lepoitevin et al 2014 hence proteins may alter the stability and transport of clay colloids as well nelson et al 1999 found that clay particles in natural sediments were easier to disperse in water when the sediments contained higher amino acid or protein content indicating that these organic species may stabilize clay particles however to our current knowledge there have been no systematic studies on how protein influences the stability and transport of clay colloids this type of study is necessary to distinguish the distinct role of protein in dom on clay colloids so that the overall effect of dom can be better predicted the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of protein on clay colloid stability and transport bovine serum albumin bsa is one of the most abundant proteins in serum and biological culture media and is commonly used as a model for proteins saleh et al 2010 valenti and giacomelli 2015 zhang et al 2016 sheng et al 2016 in addition bsa and similar proteins are commonly found in urban sewage and discharges of wastewater treatment plants vakondios et al 2014 ren et al 2017 bsa was chosen as a representative material in this study to investigate its influence on kaolinite colloid aggregation and transport under neutral ph conditions the light absorbance and particle size of kaolinite suspensions under a range of ionic strengths and bsa concentrations were measured to determine the stability and aggregation of the kaolinite colloids at ph 7 column experiments were carried out to examine colloid transport in quartz sand under water chemistry conditions similar to those used in the stability tests the interaction energies among the kaolinite colloids and between kaolinite and quartz sand were calculated using the classical dlvo theory or xdlvo theory to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved at ph 7 2 materials and methods 2 1

the concentrated hcl for at least 24 h and then rinsed with di water until the electrical conductivity of the solution was less than 2 μs cm 1 the sand was dried at 105 c in an oven and then heated for at least 4 h in a muffle furnace at 600 c to remove the organic compounds yang et al 2017 to measure the electrophoretic mobility epm of fine quartz particles the sand was crushed to powder and then suspended in di water the obtained sand suspension was gravitationally settled for 30 min and then the supernatant was used to measure the epm using zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk shang et al 2013 wang et al 2014 2015a 2 2 preparation of solution and suspensions to prepare bsa stock solution 0 1 g bsa powder product number a7030 sigma aldrich was added to 0 1 l di water and stirred until bsa was well dispersed the bsa stock solution was stored in a refrigerator at 4 c until use kaolinite stock suspension was prepared by suspending 10 g kaolinite powder product number 60609 sigma aldrich in 1 l di water the specific surface area of kaolinite is 16 0 m2 g 1 which was measured using a micromeritics instrument asap 2020 atlanta usa by the n2 bet method at 77 k the kaolinite has the cation exchange capacity of 24 3 cmol kg 1 as determined with compulsive exchange method using mg2 ca2 exchange sumner and miller 1996 kaolinite suspension was prepared in a 1 l graduated cylinder and settled for 24 h to obtain colloidal kaolinite the top 30 cm supernatant from the graduated cylinder was carefully collected and used as a stock suspension of kaolinite colloid and kaolinite concentration of the stock suspension was determined gravimetrically jerez et al 2006 2 3 characterization of kaolinite without with bsa a 50 mg l 1 kaolinite colloid suspension was prepared in the absence presence of different concentration of bsa 4 8 16 mg l 1 at various is 1 10 50 and 100 mm with ph 7 the hydrodynamic diameter d h and epm of bare kaolinite and kaolinite with bsa kao bsa were determined at ph 7 using zetasizer and the epm results were used in ohshima s soft particle theory ohshima 1994 the epms of bsa and kaolinite were measured in 0 1 mm nano3 solution with varying ph from 3 to 11 the ζ potentials of the suspensions were calculated based on the measured epm using the smoluchowski equation wang et al 2015a kaolinite colloid suspensions were examined on a transmission electron microscope tem jem 1230 jeol operated at 80 kv the tem samples were prepared by placing a drop of kaolinite suspension with without 8 mg l 1 bsa in 10 mm nano3 solution with ph 7 on a 200 mesh copper grid coated with carbon and then dried under an led lamp more than 50 bsa colloids in the tem images were randomly selected and analyzed to determine particle size distribution using imagej software sheng et al 2016 2 4 bsa adsorption experiment the isotherms of bsa adsorption to kaolinite colloid or quartz sand under various is 1 5 10 50 and 100 mm at neutral ph condition were experimentally determined by batch experiments to measure bsa adsorption on kaolinite 50 mg l 1 kaolinite suspensions at different is were sonicated in an ultrasonic bath shumei kq 300 300w 40 khz jiangsu china for 10 min before adding the chosen bsa concentrations of 0 0 5 1 2 4 8 16 mg l 1 to measure bsa adsorption on quartz sand 2 0 g of quartz sand was mixed with bsa concentrations of 0 0 5 1 0 2 5 5 0 7 5 and 10 0 mg l 1 at different is and neutral ph conditions the kaolinite bsa and sand bsa mixtures were shaken at 120 rpm for 120 min after shaking the kaolinite bsa mixture was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 20 min to settle down the kaolinite colloids the sand bsa mixture was stood in the centrifuge tubes for 10 min to obtain the residual bsa in the supernatant the bsa concentration in the supernatant was measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f97 pro leng guang china the adsorbed bsa concentration was calculated as difference between the initial bsa concentration and residual bsa concentration in the supernatant after shaking 2 5 stability test to evaluate the effect of bsa on the stability of kaolinite colloid kaolinite suspension was prepared firstly at different is 1 5 10 50 or 100 mm solutions and then bsa was added into kaolinite suspension with the selected concentrations the is of the suspensions was adjusted using 1 m nano3 solution and the ph of the suspension was adjusted to 7 using 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hno3 solutions the kaolinite concentration in the suspension was 50 mg l 1 with different concentration 0 4 8 or 16 mg l 1 of bsa for the stability experiment immediately after preparation the absorbance of the suspensions was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer tu 1900 persee china to determine the initial absorbance a 0 at a wavelength of 350 nm the absorbance a of the suspension was then measured every 2 min until the last measurement was taken at 120 min the wavelength of 350 nm was chosen to eliminate the interference of bsa on the measurement of kaolinite previous studies and our preliminary tests showed that the absorbance of clay colloids was high at this wavelength whereas the absorbance of bsa was negligible sun et al 2010 zhu et al 2012 2 6 column experiments a stainless steel column length 12 6 cm and diameter 2 6 cm was used for kaolinite colloid transport experiments the column was wet packed with clean quartz sand and a nylon membrane pore size 180 μm was placed at each end of the column to hold the sand and distribute water flow the bulk density of the packed column was approximately 1 39 g cm 3 and the average porosity was around 0 47 table 1 influent kaolinite suspensions were prepared firstly by mixing stock kaolinite suspension and then mixed with appropriate amount of bsa stock solution for at least 10 min before the column experiment kaolinite concentration of the influent suspension was 50 mg l 1 and the concentrations of bsa were 0 4 8 and 16 mg l 1 respectively nano3 solution with different is 1 5 10 50 or 100 mm was used as the background solution and the same ph of 7 a peristaltic pump dhl a huxi china was connected to the bottom of the column to inject the solution suspension at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 the column was flushed with the background solution for at least 10 pore volumes pvs afterward 3 pvs of kaolinite suspensions in the same background solution were injected followed by elution with 5 pvs of the background solution the effluent was collected at 5 min interval using a fraction collector bsz 100 huxi china at the end of each column experiment the sand in the column was carefully excavated at 1 cm increment to determine the spatial distribution of the retained kaolinite each sand fraction of the column was placed into 20 ml di water in a 50 ml flask and shaken for 4 h to release kaolinite colloids from the sand surface the kaolinite concentration of the samples was determined using uv vis spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 350 nm a tracer test was also performed to determine the dispersivity of the packed column during a tracer test the column was flushed firstly with at least 10 pvs of di water to equilibrate the steady flow system in the column 3 pvs of 3 mm nano3 solution was injected into the column which was followed by elution with 5 pvs of di water no3 concentration in the effluent was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 235 nm following the method used by shang et al 2010 2 7 calculation of interaction energy the kaolinite kaolinite and kaolinite quartz interaction energy were calculated using the classical dlvo theory or extended dlvo xdlvo theory tables s2 and si ohshima s soft particle theory ohshima 1994 1995 phenrat et al 2007 zhang et al 2013 was applied to the kao bsa suspension systems for calculating the thickness of the adsorbed bsa layer d tables s3 and si which was used to quantify the steric energy in the xdlvo calculation detailed information describing the calculation of the dlvo xdlvo and ohshima s soft particle theory is provided in the supplementary data 3 results and discussion 3 1 kaolinite stability and aggregation the measured ζ potentials of kaolinite and bsa are shown in fig s1 indicating that kaolinite is negatively charged in the selected ph range 3 ph 11 and bsa is negatively charged when the solution ph is higher than 4 8 a previous study showed that the point of zero charge pzc of bsa in a 1 mm nano3 solution was approximately 4 76 salgin et al 2012 this result meant that the interaction between kaolinite and bsa was repulsive at neutral ph which was the selected ph for all the experiments in this study if the solution ph was lower than 4 76 the interaction between kaolinite and bsa was favorable when the solution ph was neutral or alkaline the absolute zeta potential value of the bsa suspension was much lower than that of the kaolinite suspension indicating that bsa had a less negative surface charge than kaolinite the stability of the kaolinite suspensions at ph 7 was noticeably affected by bsa fig 1 in the absence of bsa the suspensions were unstable for all the iss tested 1 100 mm as evidenced by the decrease in the relative absorbance a a 0 with time fig 1 a it was also observed that a higher is resulted in a higher degree of instability as shown by the more rapid decrease in the relative absorbance the interaction energy between kaolinite particles at each of the iss calculated using the dlvo theory showed that at is values of 1 5 and 10 mm the energy barrier was high and the instability was due to secondary minima whereas at is values of 50 and 100 mm no energy barrier was present and the aggregation was under favorable conditions fig 2 a bsa greatly increased the stability at ph 7 especially at high is with 8 mg l 1 bsa the relative absorbance of all the suspensions decreased only slightly during the experiment fig 1 b at is values of 10 and 100 mm the addition of 4 8 and 16 mg l 1 bsa promoted stability fig 1 c and d however the decrease in the relative absorbance was not sensitive to bsa concentration i e the additional increase in bsa concentration did not further change stability the results of hydrodynamic diameter measurements confirmed that bsa enhanced the kaolinite dispersion at ph 7 in the absence of bsa the particle size increased from 500 nm to over 2000 nm when the is increased from 1 to 100 mm fig s2 a si the higher particle size at a higher is in the absence of bsa correlated well with the greater decrease in relative absorbance a a 0 in the stability tests fig 1 implying that the decrease in the relative absorbance was due to particle aggregation which promoted particle gravity sedimentation and further changed the light absorbance properties of the particle when 8 mg l 1 bsa was present particle size only slightly increased especially at higher is values fig s2 a si at a fixed is of 10 or 100 mm compared to those without bsa the particle sizes were smaller approximately 1000 nm when bsa was present and the size decreased with increasing bsa concentration when the is was equal to 100 mm fig s2 b si tem observations also provided further confirmation that bsa prevented kaolinite colloid aggregation when bsa was absent in a 10 mm nano3 solution large particle aggregates with diameters of 4000 5000 nm were observed by tem fig s3 a si which was larger than the hydrodynamic size of the aggregates in suspension due to the aggregation by drying in contrast at the same is the size of the kaolinite aggregates was much smaller 500 nm fig s3 b si when 8 mg l 1 bsa was present it is well established that organic macro molecules such as humic substances increase the dispersion and stability of colloids and nanoparticles mainly via electrostatic or steric effects loosli et al 2013 tang and cheng 2018 additionally previous studies suggested that biocolloids e g bacteria and virus could be adsorbed on the surface of kaolinite when the biocolloids and kaolinite coexisted in the solution syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2010 vasiliadou et al 2011 vasiliadou and chrysikopoulos 2011 adsorption of these negatively charged biocolloids to clay surfaces altered the negative charges of the clay and hence influenced the repulsive forces between the heteroaggregates of biocolloids and clay particles in our experiments both tem observation and bsa isotherm results confirmed bsa adsorption to kaolinite surfaces figs s3 b and fig s4 a si a previous study showed that the ζ potential of mno2 could be altered because of bsa adsorption huangfu et al 2013 the charges of bsa at ph 7 however were weaker than those of clay colloids with ionic strength changing from 1 to 100 mm the ζ potential of bsa ranged from 9 0 to 3 5 mv figs s5 and si which was much less negative than those of kaolinite colloids 40 8 to 22 6 mv in the absence of bsa table 2 the addition of 8 mg l 1 bsa to the kaolinite suspensions shifted the ζ potential of kaolinite to less negative values 30 6 to 15 6 mv at each of the is values table 2 suggesting that adsorbed bsa induced less repulsive interaction as shown in fig 2 a the secondary minima 3 3 and 6 1 kt at is 5 and 10 mm respectively were deeper than the mean thermal energy of brownian particles 1 5 kt hahn and o melia 2004 and they were sufficiently deep to cause aggregation these interaction energy profiles were in agreement with the experimentally observed stability aggregation at different iss the presence of bsa largely enhanced the stability of kaolinite particles at different iss the interaction energy calculated using the xdlvo theory in which the steric forces were considered showed much higher energy barriers 10 000 kt for all iss fig 2 b c and d fig s6 shows that even at is 50 mm the steric repulsion provided a high energy barrier energy barriers 10 000 kt between tio2 nanoparticles and surfactants have also been previously reported sun et al 2015 these predictions were consistent with the enhanced stability in systems with bsa and demonstrated that the steric forces due to adsorbed bsa played an essential role in stabilizing the kaolinite particles 3 2 kaolinite transport 3 2 1 effect of ionic strength in the absence of bsa in the absence of bsa kaolinite transport and retention were strongly influenced by is with increasing is the effluent kaolinite concentration c c 0 decreased while the retained particle concentration n n i increased fig 3 a and b this result was consistent with previous studies zhuang et al 2004 chowdhury et al 2011 wang et al 2015a chrysikopoulos et al 2017 and was attributable to the increased attractive interaction energy between kaolinite particles and quartz sand the interaction energy calculated by the classical dlvo theory showed that when the is was in the range of 1 50 mm the energy barriers were high 108 0 816 7 kt and the higher kaolinite retention at higher is was due to the deeper secondary minima table 2 at is 10 mm the secondary minima were deeper than 1 5 kt which caused a large amount of particle retention at the grain surface at an is of 100 mm no energy barrier was present and kaolinite attachment to the sand surface was under favorable conditions resulting in 100 kaolinite retention the shapes of the breakthrough curves btcs and retention profiles rps were also influenced by is at an is of 1 and 5 mm the btcs showed blocking and normal shapes respectively i e after the initial sharp increase the effluent concentration slightly increased called blocking or leveled off normal during particle injection fig 3 a the blocking process occurred because the deposited colloids might have prevented the further attachment of colloids on the collector surface as the fraction of colloid on the surface increased liu et al 1995 camesano et al 1999 the rps at these low iss showed an exponential shape fig 3 b consistent with the classical filtration theory yao et al 1971 at an is higher than 10 mm the btc showed ripening i e after the initial increase the effluent concentration decreased during particle injection fig 3 a ripening was a process in which the rate of colloid deposition could increase with further colloid injection when the attached colloids acted as additional collectors for attachment by forming multilayer films camesano et al 1999 kretzschmar et al 1999 the rp at high is also changed to a hyperexponential shape i e the particles were retained mainly near the column inlet and the retained particle concentration decreased very rapidly with depth fig 3 b which was inconsistent with the classical filtration theory deviation from the classic theory at high iss indicated that deposition mechanisms other than electrostatic forces played an important role under these conditions previous studies have shown that size selective retention may lead to hyperexponential rp jiang et al 2012 wang et al 2015a 2015b as discussed in section 3 1 kaolinite aggregation occurred at high is and the mean hydrodynamic diameter of the aggregate was 2 000 nm at iss of 50 and 100 mm figs s2 and si these large aggregates were susceptible to gravity sedimentation and physical straining xu et al 2006 through which most of the particles were retained near the column inlet 3 2 2 effect of bsa the presence of 8 mg l 1 bsa significantly decreased kaolinite retention and increased transport at each is the amount of kaolinite that was recovered from the effluents with 8 mg l 1 bsa was much higher than that without bsa especially at high is fig 3 c vs fig 3 a and table 1 additionally for all the experiments with added bsa the btcs showed a normal shape or blocking the rps showed an exponential shape for is 10 mm and the rps showed a hyperexponential shape for is 50 mm fig 3 c and d the decreased retention in the experiments with bsa suggested stronger repulsive forces between kaolinite and quartz sand than those in the absence of bsa because bsa showed a weaker negative surface charge the ζ potential of kaolinite became less negative in the presence of bsa due to adsorption as discussed in section 3 1 the ζ potential of quartz sand was not influenced by bsa since bsa adsorption to the quartz surface was negligible as shown by our adsorption experiments fig s4 b si when the steric effect induced by bsa was considered the interaction energy calculated by the xdlvo theory showed high energy barriers 2 000 kt for all experiments table 2 the predictions by the xdlvo theory were consistent with the enhanced transport observed and demonstrated that the steric force due to bsa adsorption which effectively increased the energy barriers between the particle and sand surface was a key mechanism affecting kaolinite attachment and transport similar to bsa some nanoparticles e g tio2 and graphene oxide could reduce the ζ potential of kaolinite however these nanoparticles inhibited kaolinite transport in a water saturated medium cai et al 2014 chrysikopoulos et al 2017 this phenomenon was observed because no steric force between kaolinite and medium existed in the presence of the mentioned colloids the shape of the rps at is 50 mm was hyperexponential and potential reasons have been proposed such as secondary minima hahn and o melia 2004 redman et al 2004 tufenkji and elimelech 2005 shen et al 2007 colloid aggregation chen and elimelech 2006 wang et al 2011 2012 wang et al 2012a straining bradford et al 2002 2003 2006 xu et al 2006 surface roughness bradford and torkzaban 2013 torkzaban and bradford 2016 and surface heterogeneities li et al 2004 tufenkji and elimelech 2005 chatterjee et al 2010 wang et al 2012b in our experiments even at iss of 50 and 100 mm the kaolinite colloids were stable in the presence of bsa as discussed in section 3 1 however the secondary minima 15 7 to 20 1 kt were deeper than 1 5 kt and might have contributed to the hyperexponential shape of the rps straining might be another potential reason for the hyperexponential rps when the maximum value of d h d p was larger than 0 002 bradford et al 2002 2006 wang et al 2013 for the kaolinite colloid at iss of 50 and 100 mm the d h d p values were 0 0040 and 0 0042 respectively without bsa and they were 0 0017 and 0 0022 with 8 mg l 1 bsa suggesting that the straining might also have played a role in kaolinite retention when is 50 mm at a fixed is of 10 mm the kaolinite mobility is increased as the bsa concentration is enhanced from 0 to 4 8 and 16 mg l 1 fig 4 and table 1 again it was found that the steric forces between kaolinite and quartz sand were a key factor that governed the interactions between particles and collectors under varying bsa concentration conditions the interaction energy using xdlvo theory showed a high energy barrier 2 000 kt and a shallow secondary minimum 2 2 kt the shape of the btcs changed from ripening to normal with increasing bsa concentration and the shape of the rps changed from hyperexponential to exponential fig 4 as discussed previously the hyperexponential shape of the rp at high is in the absence of bsa could be caused by size selective retention which retained the larger particles near the column inlet in the presence of bsa kaolinite aggregation was significantly decreased which resulted in smaller particle sizes figs s2 and si this result in turn eliminated gravity sedimentation and physical straining and changed the shape of the rp from hyperexponential to exponential for kaolinite with different concentrations of bsa at an is of 10 mm the highest value of d h d p was 0 0014 table 2 revealing that straining was unlikely to occur at is 100 mm kaolinite transport slightly increased with increasing bsa concentration and the rps showed a hyperexponential shape the secondary minima were substantially deeper 19 7 to 20 4 kt for all tested bsa concentrations and the values of d h d p 0 0027 and 0 0016 were higher than the cutoff value of 0 002 when the bsa concentration was 4 and 8 mg l 1 respectively the above results demonstrated that both the secondary minimum and straining might have contributed to the hyperexponential rp and the lower mobility of kaolinite 4 conclusions this study systematically showed that bsa a representative protein had a significant effect on the stability and transport of clay colloid in salt solutions with varying iss under neutral ph condition since the phpzc of bsa is 4 76 the interaction between bsa and kaolinite is repulsive under neutral ph or alkaline ph conditions the results from this study showed that under ph neutral conditions clay colloid aggregation was inhibited and transport was enhanced in the presence of bsa due to the steric effect of the adsorbed bsa layer on clays these phenomena were more notable at higher is ranges and higher bsa concentrations the ζ potential of clay colloids with adsorbed bsa is less negative than those without bsa which results in weak repulsive electrostatic forces and strong steric forces between surfaces as shown by the xdlvo theory the effect of protein on clay stability and transport was highly dependent on both solution and protein properties more studies are needed to fully understand how the complex interplay of solution ph and protein pzc affects clay colloid stability and transport considering the complex nature and diverse chemical composition of dom in natural aquatic environments and the ubiquitous presence of proteins in these systems this study demonstrated that the approach of using humic substances as a representative dom must be treated with caution additionally the distinct role of different types of organic molecules in dom needs to be distinguished in order to better predict the overall effect of dom on particle aggregation and transport conflicts of interest the authors declared that they have no conflicts of

18938,the effect of bioaugmentation with different microorganisms on anaerobic digestion to mitigate the ammonia inhibition problem was investigated seven pure strains of microorganisms including obligate aceticlastic methanogen facultative aceticlastic methanogen hydrogenotrophic methanogen syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria saob were selected and thirteen bioaugmentation approaches were tested bioaugmentation with hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanobrevibacter smithii mbs and saob syntrophaceticu schinkii together was the optimal choice methane production mp was 71 1 higher than that in blank the activity of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was greatly heightened according to specific methanogenic activity analysis bioaugmentation with facultative aceticlastic methanogen methanosarcina barkeri msb alone without saob addition was also proven efficient mp was 59 7 higher than that in blank both aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis were enhanced further evaluation with carbon isotope fractionations analysis indicated that balancing the activities of the aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathways is of great importance 16s rrna gene sequencing results showed that methanobacterium spp and methanosaeta spp were the dominant archaea in all 14 reactors nevertheless bioaugmentation with methanosaeta spp did not result in a positive effect on mp on the other hand methanobrevibacter spp and methanosarcina spp were non dominant archaea even after bioaugmentation with mbs or msb the relative abundances were still poor 2 but displayed pivotal roles in determining the overall microbial consortium and in turn improved the overall performance graphical abstract image 1 keywords methanogenic pathway specific methanogenic

of ammonium and free ammonia nh3 is considered to be a key parameter affecting the stability and efficiency of the ad process yuan and zhu 2016 ammonia toxicity especially nh3 n toxicity is regularly

ammonia at concentrations over 3 g nh4 n l can inhibit the ad process chen et al 2008 yenigun and demirel 2013 previous studies suggest that ammonia inhibition could be alleviated by decreasing ph increasing the c n ratio lowering the reactor temperature or diluting with water nielsen and angelidaki 2008 yenigun and demirel 2013 unfortunately these chemical and physical methods can only counteract ammonia toxicity to a limited extend and are neither economical nor provide a permanent solution masse et al 2014 bioaugmentation which involves addition of specific microorganisms to a

efficiency by strengthening the saob hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathway through bioaugmentation with certain strains fotidis et al 2013 2014 westerholm et al 2012 so far six saobs have been isolated including three mesophilic strains syntrophaceticus schinkii westerholm et al 2010 tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans westerholm et al 2011 and clostridium ultunense anna et al 1996 and three

hydrogenotrophic methanogens bioaugmentation with certain strains via the sao hydrogenotrophic methanogenic clostridium ultunense methanoculleus pathway has been proven to be an effective way to alleviate ammonia inhibition fotidis et al 2013 2014 however other studies did not indicate significant improvements after bioaugmentation wang et al 2015 westerholm et al 2011 considering these contrasting findings reaching a consensus is difficult since different researchers selected different strains operated with different parameters and investigated different bioaugmentation methods complete knowledge of how to mitigate the ammonia inhibition effect with saob hydrogenotrophic methanogens is lacking and thorough research on the topic is necessary the obligate aceticlastic methanogen methanosaeta and facultative aceticlastic methanogen methanosarcina were previously found to be dominant archaea in previous studies westerholm et al 2011 2012 however whether bioaugmentation with aceticlastic methanogens could achieve efficient methane production mp under high ammonia levels remains unknown the objectives of the present research are as follows 1 to compare the bioaugmentation effects of different strains following different methanogenic pathways and 2 to develop an ammonia tolerant environment for mp in ad reactors with high tans thus the reactor performances methanogenic pathways specific methanogenic activities smas and methanogenic communities in different mesophilic reactors were investigated to evaluate bioaugmentation effects 2 materials and methods 2 1 pure strains and inoculum seven pure strains were selected and used in this study table 1 methanosaeta is the only obligate aceticlastic methanogen to the best of our knowledge ferraro et al 2018 methanosarcina is the one and the only important facultative aceticlastic methanogen hao et al 2015 according to previous studies methanobacterium methanoculleus and methanobrevibacter are three typical and important hydrogenotrophic methanogens fotidis et al 2017 yenigun and demirel 2013 three mesophilic saobs have ever been isolated anna et al 1996 westerholm et al 2010 2011 and the two purchasable saobs syntrophaceticus schinkii and tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans were tested all pure strains were obtained from dsmz deutsche sammlung von mikroorganismen und zellkulturen gmbh company germany different approaches addition of obligate aceticlastic methanogen facultative aceticlastic methanogen hydrogenotrophic methanogen saob alone saob facultative aceticlastic methanogen and saob hydrogenotrophic methanogen were tested to mitigate ammonia inhibition and to explore the mechanism of bioaugmentation before the main experiments the pure strains were cultivated in the corresponding growth media suggested by dsmz to acquire the necessary biomass table 1 anaerobic sludge with high ammonia levels was derived from a 6 l mesophilic anaerobic digestion reactor that was operated for over 200 days under 4 g nh4 n l and then used as the inoculum for the mesophilic reactors in this study the characteristics of the inoculum were as follows ph 8 7 0 1 total solids ts 11

amount was too low and bioaugmentation strains would be washed out of the system venkiteshwaran et al 2016 nevertheless successful bioaugmentation could be achieve with several distinct steps in a short period fotidis et al 2017 li et al 2017 in this research bioaugmentation was performed during phase ii days 37 41 into two distinct steps days 37 and 41 table a1 mixing in the reactors was stopped 3 h before and resumed 3 h after each bioaugmentation step to avoid the loss of active biomass and allow the cultures to settle the volumes and optical densities ods of different cultures during bioaugmentation are summarized in table a1 during phase ii and phase iii days 42 101 the reactors were operated continuously with feedstock and tans kept identical to those in phase i the above experiments were carried out in a mesophilic 37 c continuous stirred shaking incubator 130 rpm 2 2 2 specific methanogenic activity sma test the sma in each reactor in phase iii was tested and compared to estimate the ammonia sensitivity of aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens bottles with a total volume of 118 ml and working volume of 40 ml were used for the tests the bottles were placed in a shaking incubator at 37 c and 130 rpm the batch test contained 20 ml of ba medium and 20 ml of active biomass retrieved from the reactors the bottles liquid phase and headspace were firstly flushed with n2 to create anoxic conditions and then with acetate 1 18 g l and h2 co2 2 bar 80 20 v v in the headspace to serve as carbon sources 2 3 analytical methods ph was determined by a ph meter mettler switzerland after centrifugation of the samples at 10 000 rpm for 10 min the supernatants were immediately analyzed as the soluble fraction chemical oxygen demand cod and nh3 n were measured according to the standard methods apha 1998 and carbohydrate concentration was measured by the phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 using glucose as the standard biogas ch4 and co2 volume of reactors in all three phases was calculated by measuring the collected gas inside the gas bag biogas volume in sma test was determined according to the pressure in the headspace and the pressure was measured by a 3151 wal bmp test system pressure gauge wal mess und regelsysteme gmbh germany after the pressure measured referred as p1 mbar the biogas in the digester was released under

were quality checked and normalized to approximately 30 000 sequences detailed information were shown in supporting information appendix a relative abundance was defined as the number of sequences affiliated with a taxon divided by the total number of sequences per sample orders and genera comprising less than 1 of the total composition in all samples were summed and indicated as others 2 6 data analysis analysis of variance anova and student s t test were used to test the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered to indicate statistical significance the gas volume reported in this study was calibrated to standard temperature 273 k and pressure 1 atm the steady state in each phase was defined as a relative variation of mp and vfa production less than 10 the samples were taken every day for analysis the standard deviation of mp and vfa were calculated based on the data of the steady state of phase i and phase iii the nh3 n concentration was calculated from equation 6

29 10 9 at 37 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactors performance the reactors were operated for 101 days and established steady states in both phase i and phase iii phase i was used as a baseline for determining possible enhancements with different bioaugmentation strains mps in different reactors and different phases are illustrated in fig 1 the mp biodegradability increase ratio and relative increase ratio in each reactor are also summarized in table 2 elemental analysis indicated that the theoretical mp is 371 ml g glu throughout phase i all of the reactors remained at an inhibited steady state with mpbefore of 180 3 191 7 ml g glu which were about 50 of theoretical methane production bdbefore around 50 and then mp was significantly affected p 0 05 since the bioaugmentation strains were added along with culture medium containing carbon source nevertheless the medium shock was vanished away after about 20 days operation fig 1 in phase iii mp in all reactors with bioaugmentation decreased immediately and reached a steady state in the steady state of phase iii the mp of blank was 2 8 p 0 05 which is higher than that in phase i as microorganisms slowly adapt to high ammonia levels chen et al 2008 fotidis et al 2014 this increase was non significant as shown in fig 1 and table 2 a significant improvement p 0 05 in mp was observed in the steady state of phase iii days 61 101 in the reactors ss mbb ta mbb ss mbs ta mbs mbs ss msb ta msb msb ss and ta with increase ratios of 35 0 30 6 71 2 45 5 28 6 41 8 47 9 58 3 17 6 and 7 1 respectively compared with the corresponding values in phase i to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to demonstrate that bioaugmentation with a facultative aceticlastic methanogen msb saob facultative aceticlastic methanogen ss msb ta msb and saob hydrogenotrophic methanogen ss mbs ta mbs could exhibit profound improvements increase ratio 40 in mp at high tans these methods are entirely new approaches of bioaugmentation to mitigate the ammonia inhibition problem during anaerobic mp previous published bioaugmentation methods only tested saob hydrogenotrophic methanogens fotidis et al 2013 2014 mbs appeared to be the optimal choice and its effects were enhanced better by addition of ss mp ss mbs ta mbs mbs the mp of ss mbs was 71 higher than that in blank this result was in accordance with other studies showing that hydrogenotrophic methanogens gain energy and break down acetate into h2 and co2 products that they cannot catabolize by themselves by using the efficient metabolic abilities of saob stams and plugge 2009a however it was unexpected to discover that mp in the reactor where msb was added alone was 13 5 and 6 6 higher than the corresponding values in ss msb and ta msb respectively among the treatments tested addition of msb facultative aceticlastic methanogen without saob was the most useful in recovering mp about 59 7 compared with that in blank as shown fig 1 the mp profile in msb in which bdafter decreased to 59 5 and then gradually increased to 79 8 was observed on day 53 phase iii the reason may be attributed to a shift of methanogenic pathway with msb addition since msb was the unique kind of facultative aceticlastic methanogen this mechanism will be discussed later in this study the mp of msh was similar to that of blank p 0 05 and even lower than the mp observed before bioaugmentation this finding indicates that addition of the obligate aceticlastic methanogen msh exerts no positive effect on the microbial community initially established in the reactor a slight reduction in mp was also observed in ss mcb and ta mcb which respectively showed mpafter of 0 5 and 5 7 lower than the corresponding mpbefore fotidis et al 2013 revealed that bioaugmentation with sao co cultures does not affect mp at high ammonia levels however data from the present study show that bioaugmentation with ss and ta both saobs exerts a positive effect on the ad process no increase in mpafter was observed in the ss mcb and ta mcb reactors likely because ss and ta cannot oxidize acetate into hydrogen when syntrophically cultivated with mcb this phenomenon has also been observed in previous study wang et al 2015 the reactors where the bioaugmentation failed ss mcb ta mcb had the same nutrients as the reactors where it worked ss mbs ta mbs ss mbb ta mbb so nutrients in the growth media had limited effect on the reactor performance 3 2 volatile fatty acid concentration and ph glucose concentration in the effluent of all reactors were practically zero throughout the experiment phase i iii as shown in fig 2 and table 3 all reactors started with similar total vfa tvfa levels 2500 2900 mg l during phase i during bioaugmentation phase ii addition of medium containing some residual carbon sources led to an increase in tvfa that eventually declined after bioaugmentation and reached a steady state which should be vanish away with continuous operation coincident with mp the tvfa concentration in blank was significantly higher p 0 05 than those in ss mbb ta mbb ss mbs ta mbs mbs ss msb ta msb and msb during the steady state in phase iii specifically the tvfa in ss mbs 1032 mg l ta mbs 1452 mg l ss msb 1624 mg l ta msb 1507 mg l and msb 1384 mg l was less than 70 of that in blank until the steady state was achieved in phase iii bdafter 72 85 the tvfa levels of ss mbb ta mbb mbs ss and ta were lower than their tvfa concentrations in phase i remaining over 1700 mg l after bioaugmentation with bdafter 71 fig 1 by comparison the tvfa levels in msh ss mcb and ta mcb remained similar to the tvfa concentrations observed in phase i indicating an unhealthy ad process the vfa composition in phase i and the steady state of phase iii was further analyzed and summarized in table 3 acetate 35 40 and propionate 57 63 were the main vfas in all reactors in phase i total percentage 94 given a similar total percentage of acetate and propionate 95 in the steady state of phase iii the vfa distributions in ss mbs ta mbs ss msb ta msb and msb were changed after bioaugmentation in this case acetate contents increased by over 45 while propionate content decreased by 20 compared with those values found in phase i the tvfa of other reactors in the steady state of phase iii was similar to that observed in phase i these differences indicate that bioaugmentation may exert positive effects on the metabolism of propionate degrading bacteria however acetogenesis and methanogenesis were still inhibited in these reactors after bioaugmentation while the ph of the 14 reactors in phase i was about 7 5 it stabilized to around 7 3 7 6 in the steady state of phase iii here nh3 n concentrations fluctuated at 80 110 mg l fig 3 although ph and fan concentrations varied in different bioaugmentation reactors no correlations were found between ph and bioaugmentation or between fan and bioaugmentation all reactors were able to inhibit ammonia at slightly high ph 7 3 which means bioaugmentation may exert no significant effect on ph or fan concentration nevertheless ph levels remained within the favorable range for the ad process in all reactors throughout the experiment liu et al 2008 details of the shift in the methanogenic pathway and the function of saob in these reactors remain lacking in recent studies as such this study further explores why reactors with mbs and msb ss mbs ta mbs mbs ss msb ta msb and msb yielded higher mps than other reactors 3 3 specific methanogenic activity sma test our previous results found that when bioaugmentation is used to mitigate ammonia inhibition during the anaerobic mp process mbs exhibits a positive effect and this effect is enhanced by addition of ss and ta conversely mp in msb was higher than that in ss msb and ta msb mp msb ta msb ss msb the sma test was carried out to explore the methanogen activities in these reactors the sma with h2 co2 or acetate as a substrate and mpafter of seven reactors msb ta msb ss msb mbs ta mbs ss mbs and blank in the steady state of phase iii are shown in fig 4 the sma of h2 co2 activity of hydrogenotrophic methanogens and the sma of acetate activity of aceticlastic methanogens in the reactors with bioaugmentation were higher than those in the abiotic augmentation reactor blank in addition the sma of h2 co2 in msb ta msb ss msb mbs ta mbs ss mbs and blank were 26 1 65 3 163 8 273 6 193 1 200 4 and 26 6 higher than the sma of acetate respectively the results of the sma test are basically consistent with previous studies indicating that hydrogenotrophic methanogens are more robust to ammonia inhibition compared with aceticlastic methanogens wang et al 2016 yenigun and demirel 2013 comparison of the smas in mbs ta mbs and ss mbs revealed that the smas of h2 co2 and acetate increased with increasing mp addition of mbs enhanced hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in the reactors and addition of ta and ss promoted acetate oxidation into h2 co2 and accelerated hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis this phenomenon is similar to previous studies that found a positive effect on the growth rate of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis with saob bioaugmentation fotidis et al 2013 it should be pointed out that although ta mbs and ss mbs addition could stimulate aceticlastic methanogenesis ss was a better partner to increase mp with mbs the sma results of h2 co2 and acetate in mbs ta mbs and ss mbs coincided well with the mp data mbs ta mbs ss mbs this finding further indicates that reactor performance may be improved effectively by enhancing aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis on account of the synergistic effects of the microbes comparison of the smas in msb ta msb and ss msb demonstrated that increasing the sma of acetate also increased mp although the sma of h2 co2 decreased the mp of msb first decreased but gradually increased to high levels increase ratio 58 3 in phase iii fig 1 such a trend was not detected in reactors bioaugmented with msb and saob together probably because of the methanogenic pathway shift after bioaugmentation with msb alone as a facultative aceticlastic methanogen msb greatly enhances aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis addition of msb and saob mostly facilitates hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis most studies focus on the enhancement of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis fotidis et al 2013 2014 westerholm et al 2012 in the present study balanced enhancement of both aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis could be contributed to achieving high mp in spite of the differences in these two groups with different methanogens we may conclude that when bioaugmentation was used to mitigate the ammonia inhibition issue the enhancement of aceticlastic methanogenesis is also of great importance which should also be valued as well as the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis 3 4 stable isotopic analysis carbon isotope fractionations are illustrated in fig 5 to evaluate the methanogenic pathway in reactors with bioaugmentation with msb or mbs in phase iii all seven reactors were dominated by the hydrogenotrophic pathway αc 1 065 comparison of the αc of msb ta msb and ss msb clearly showed that bioaugmentation with saob msb enhances hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis the αc of mbs alone was higher than those of ta mbs and ss mbs hydrogenotrophic methanogen might be markedly strengthened at high αc but the corresponding increase in mp is not observed an appropriate αc appears to be necessary to achieve high mp with the recovery of the microbiological system 3 5 microbial community the microbial communities of two samples in the steady state of phase i day 34 b 1 and b 2 the two samples were collected from different reactors before bioaugmentation and their similarity represents their reproducibility and samples from all of the reactors in the steady state of phase iii were analyzed the richness and diversity of the microbial communities are summarized in table 4 the obtained sequences were quality checked and normalized to approximately 30 000 sequences all of the coverage values were above 99 97 which means an abundance of taxonomic groups were covered well in all samples the number of otus chao s richness estimation and shannon diversities of all samples were similar thereby indicating that the abundance of microbial communities was similar in all reactors furthermore as shown in figure a1 appendix a different strains addition performed an increasing relative abundance in matched reactors indicating an effective bioaugmentation heatmap analysis was used to intuitively display differences in relative abundances of archaea at the genus level among all samples fig 6 the similarity of results between b 1 and b 2 indicates that all of the reactors had similar microbial community diversity in phase i all 16 samples were similar in terms of microbial composition and abundance methanobacterium purple and methanosaeta purple and blue were the two dominant genera in the microbial communities of all reactors bioaugmentation with the dominant archaea mbb increased the relative abundance of methanobacterium spp from 62 9 in blank to 68 9 in ss mbb and 70 1 in ta mbb as illustrated in appendix a figure a2 a the abundance of methanobacterium spp correlated well with mp performance r2 0 9 which suggests that an increase in methanobacterium spp exerts a positive effect on mp fig 1 although the increase ratio was less than 8 methanosaeta was found dominant in all three reactors with msb bioaugmentation msb ta msb and ss msb with a coverage of about 35 which is 10 higher than that in blank fig 7 a methanosaeta is an obligate aceticlastic methanogen while methanosarcina spp is a unique methanogen that can achieve metabolism via both aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis methanosaeta and methanosarcina belong to the order methanosarcinales thus the three reactors bioaugmented with msb msb ta msb and ss msb facilitate and enrich the growth of methanosaeta spp which also dominated ss mbs and ta mbs with coverages above than 35 purple in fig 6 the corresponding coverage was less than 20 in mbs fig 7 a blue color in fig 6 mbs is an obligate hydrogenotrophic methanogen and its addition to reactors with saob stimulated mp recovery and decreased vfa accumulation in this environment the activity of methanosaeta spp was recovered and the relative abundance of methanosaeta spp increased previous studies report that methanosaeta spp could be boosted under high concentration of ammonia but low acetate levels and the aceticlastic methanogenic pathway could be strengthened by these microbes lu et al 2013 unexpectedly direct addition of msh did not enrich the abundance of methanosaeta spp as shown in fig 7 b the relative abundance of methanosarcina spp in msb ta msb and ss msb increased by 20 14 and 13 fold respectively compared with methanosarcina spp in blank which indicates that methanosarcina spp are robust to ammonia inhibition as shown in figure a2 b the abundance of methanosarcina spp appeared to correlate well with mp performance r2 0 96 although their relative abundance was less than 2 considering the higher ratio of methanosarcina spp in msb than in ta msb or ss msb fig 7 b these species may metabolize more through the aceticlastic methanogenic pathway than through the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathway under high tans some studies have reported that methanosarcina could accept electrons via direct interspecies electron transfer diet rotaru et al 2014 instead of the interspecies hydrogen transfer strategy and this genus could be capable of using either hydrogen or electrons derived from diet for mp as such while the relative abundance of methanosarcina was comparatively low in the reactors 2 after bioaugmentation the resulting mp was greatly improved fig 1 and appendix a figure a2 b the percentage of methanosarcina spp in each reactor was comparatively low 0 1 in blank 2 0 in msb 1 4 in ta msb and 1 3 in ss msb however methanosarcina spp appeared to achieve a critical biomass in msb ta msb and ss msb and became process steering microbes thereby influencing the activity of the complete microbiological system bioaugmentation with non dominant archaea led to an increase in mp in the reactors which was previously called the microbiological domino effect fotidis et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 the relative abundance of methanobrevibacter spp in reactors mbs ta mbs and ss mbs increased 5 8 and 11 fold respectively compared with methanobrevibacter spp in blank from 0 1 to 0 5 1 0 and 1 2 fig 7 c although the percentage of methanobrevibacter spp was less than 1 5 in the total archaeal community as another process steering microbe the improvement in mp performance due to mbs addition cannot be underestimated a positive linear correlation r2 0 95 between the relative abundance of methanobrevibacter spp and mp appendix a figure a2 c was obtained although methanobrevibacter spp were relatively poor in abundance bioaugmentation with methanobrevibacter spp as well as methanosarcina spp revealed a pivotal role in determining the overall microbial consortium and in turn the final performance of the reactors as a obligate hydrogenotrophic methanogen mbs was facilitated as saob presented comparing fig 7 b and c saob directly affected the relative abundance of different methanogens due to differences in stimulation of the methanogenic pathway bioaugmentation with saob ss and ta alone increased mp by 7 17 fig 7 d clearly illustrates that the abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens increased by 5 while the abundance of the obligate aceticlastic methanogen decreased to 2 4 compared with those in blank this result indicates that addition of saob facilitates the growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogens which can use the metabolic products of saob and overcome the related energy barriers stams and plugge 2009b however the increase ratio of mp was not especially high probably because of the low growth rate of saob fotidis et al 2013 4 conclusions bioaugmentation with different microorganisms in anaerobic digestion reactors were investigated in this article in order to mitigate the ammonia inhibition seven pure strains were selected and thirteen bioaugmentation approaches were tested bioaugmentation with hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanobrevibacter smithii and syntrophaceticu schinkii together was the optimal choice with 71 1 increased mp than that in blank and bdafter could reach 85 bioaugmentation with facultative aceticlastic methanogen methanosarcina barkeri alone was also an efficient way with 59 7 higher than that in blank according to the further analysis with specific methanogenic activity and carbon isotope fractionations aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathway should be both taken into account during bioaugmentation and the balance could result in a better reactor performance methanobacterium spp and methanosaeta spp were both the dominant archaea in ad reactors with high ammonia concentration in this article bioaugmentation with methanobacterium spp along with saobs could obtain 30 35 increased mp while no positive effect could reach when methanosaeta spp was bioaugmented on the other side methanobrevibacter spp and methanosarcina spp were the non dominant archaea in all reactors even the relative abundances were still poor 2 after bioaugmentation with mbs or msb but they both displayed pivotal roles in increasing mp and improving the overall performance declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known

18938,the effect of bioaugmentation with different microorganisms on anaerobic digestion to mitigate the ammonia inhibition problem was investigated seven pure strains of microorganisms including obligate aceticlastic methanogen facultative aceticlastic methanogen hydrogenotrophic methanogen syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria saob were selected and thirteen bioaugmentation approaches were tested bioaugmentation with hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanobrevibacter smithii mbs and saob syntrophaceticu schinkii together was the optimal choice methane production mp was 71 1 higher than that in blank the activity of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was greatly heightened according to specific methanogenic activity analysis bioaugmentation with facultative aceticlastic methanogen methanosarcina barkeri msb alone without saob addition was also proven efficient mp was 59 7 higher than that in blank both aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis were enhanced further evaluation with carbon isotope fractionations analysis indicated that balancing the activities of the aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathways is of great importance 16s rrna gene sequencing results showed that methanobacterium spp and methanosaeta spp were the dominant archaea in all 14 reactors nevertheless bioaugmentation with methanosaeta spp did not result in a positive effect on mp on the other hand methanobrevibacter spp and methanosarcina spp were non dominant archaea even after bioaugmentation with mbs or msb the relative abundances were still poor 2 but displayed pivotal roles in determining the overall microbial consortium and in turn improved the overall performance graphical abstract image 1 keywords methanogenic pathway specific methanogenic

renewable energy such as hydrogen methane can be produced through biological treatment of wastes with different characteristics tampio et al 2016 yenigun and demirel 2013 ammonia level including those of ammonium and free ammonia nh3 is considered to be a key parameter affecting the stability and efficiency of the ad process yuan and zhu 2016 ammonia toxicity especially nh3 n toxicity is regularly reported as the primary cause of failure of digestion when fed with nitrogen rich substrates due to direct inhibition of microbial activity changes in intracellular ph increases in maintenance energy requirement depletion of intracellular potassium and inhibition of specific enzyme reactions rajagopal et al 2013 wittmann christoph et al 1996 different thresholds of total ammonia nitrogen concentration tan ranging from 1 7 g l to 14 g l cause inhibition due to differences in substrates inocula operation parameters and acclimation periods chen et al 2008 rajagopal et al 2013 in general ammonia at concentrations over 3 g nh4 n l can inhibit the ad process chen et al 2008 yenigun and demirel 2013 previous studies suggest that ammonia inhibition could be alleviated by decreasing ph increasing the c n ratio lowering the reactor temperature or diluting with water nielsen and angelidaki 2008 yenigun and demirel 2013 unfortunately these chemical and physical methods can only counteract ammonia toxicity to a limited extend and are neither economical nor provide a permanent solution masse et al 2014 bioaugmentation which involves addition of specific microorganisms to a system to enhance a desired activity during degradation could be used as a potential method to establish ammonia tolerant cultures and improve the efficiency of ad costa et al 2012 li et al 2017 bioaugmentation has been successfully used to improve the ad performance of systems employing cellulosic cater et al 2015 and lipid rich cirne et al 2006 wastes ad is a four step process consisting of hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis angelidaki et al 2011 methanogenesis from acetate can follow two pathways 1 aceticlastic methanogenesis reaction 1 stephen h zinder and koch 1984 in which acetate is cleaved into methyl directly converted to ch4 and carboxyl oxidized to co2 groups and 2 a two step reaction reactions 2 and 3 stephen h zinder and koch 1984 that oxidizes acetate to h2 and co2 via syntrophic acetate oxidation bacteria saob these products are subsequently converted to ch4 by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis karakashev 2006 1 c h 3 c o o h 2 o c h 4 h c o

efficiency by strengthening the saob hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathway through bioaugmentation with certain strains fotidis et al 2013 2014 westerholm et al 2012 so far six saobs have been isolated including three mesophilic strains syntrophaceticus schinkii westerholm et al 2010 tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans westerholm et al 2011 and clostridium ultunense anna et al 1996 and three thermophilic thermacetogenium phaeum hattori et al 2000 thermotoga lettingae balk et al 2002 and strain aor lee and zinder 1988 in anaerobic digesters saob exhibits a syntrophic association with hydrogenotrophic methanogens bioaugmentation with certain strains via the sao hydrogenotrophic methanogenic clostridium ultunense methanoculleus pathway has been proven to be an effective way to alleviate ammonia inhibition fotidis et al 2013 2014 however other studies did not indicate significant improvements after bioaugmentation wang et al 2015 westerholm et al 2011 considering these contrasting findings reaching a consensus is difficult since different researchers selected different strains operated with different parameters and investigated different bioaugmentation methods complete knowledge of how to mitigate the ammonia inhibition effect with saob hydrogenotrophic methanogens is lacking and thorough research on the topic is necessary the obligate aceticlastic methanogen methanosaeta and facultative aceticlastic methanogen methanosarcina were previously found to be dominant archaea in previous studies westerholm et al 2011 2012 however whether bioaugmentation with aceticlastic methanogens could achieve efficient methane production mp under high ammonia levels remains unknown the objectives of the present research are as follows 1 to compare the bioaugmentation effects of different strains following different methanogenic pathways and 2 to develop an ammonia tolerant environment for mp in ad reactors with high tans thus the reactor performances methanogenic pathways specific methanogenic activities smas and methanogenic communities in different mesophilic reactors were investigated to evaluate bioaugmentation effects 2 materials and methods 2 1 pure strains and inoculum seven pure strains were selected and used in this study table 1 methanosaeta is the only obligate aceticlastic methanogen to the best of our knowledge ferraro et al 2018 methanosarcina is the one and the only important facultative aceticlastic methanogen hao et al 2015 according to previous studies methanobacterium methanoculleus and methanobrevibacter are three typical and important hydrogenotrophic methanogens fotidis et al 2017 yenigun and demirel 2013 three mesophilic saobs have ever been isolated anna et al 1996 westerholm et al 2010 2011 and the two purchasable saobs syntrophaceticus schinkii and tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans were tested all pure strains were obtained from dsmz deutsche sammlung von mikroorganismen und zellkulturen gmbh company germany different approaches addition of obligate aceticlastic methanogen facultative aceticlastic methanogen hydrogenotrophic methanogen saob alone saob facultative aceticlastic methanogen and saob hydrogenotrophic methanogen were tested to mitigate ammonia inhibition and to explore the mechanism of bioaugmentation before the main experiments the pure strains were cultivated in the corresponding growth media suggested by dsmz to acquire the necessary biomass table 1 anaerobic sludge with high ammonia levels was derived from a 6 l mesophilic anaerobic digestion reactor that was operated for over 200 days under 4 g nh4 n l and then used as the inoculum for the mesophilic reactors in this study the characteristics of the inoculum were as follows ph 8 7 0 1 total solids ts 11

volumes of the reactors were 500 and 350 ml respectively 200 ml of inoculum was added into the reactor at the beginning basal anaerobic ba medium was used as the feedstock for all experiments

amount was too low and bioaugmentation strains would be washed out of the system venkiteshwaran et al 2016 nevertheless successful bioaugmentation could be achieve with several distinct steps in a short period fotidis et al 2017 li et al 2017 in this research bioaugmentation was performed during phase ii days 37 41 into two distinct steps days 37 and 41 table a1 mixing in the reactors was stopped 3 h before and resumed 3 h after each bioaugmentation step to avoid the loss of active biomass and allow the cultures to settle the volumes and optical densities ods of different cultures during bioaugmentation are summarized in table a1 during phase ii and phase iii days 42 101 the reactors were operated continuously with feedstock and tans kept identical to those in phase i the above experiments were carried out in a mesophilic 37 c continuous stirred shaking incubator 130 rpm 2 2 2 specific methanogenic activity sma test the sma in each reactor in phase iii was tested and compared to estimate the ammonia sensitivity of aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens bottles with a total volume of 118 ml and working volume of 40 ml were used for the tests the bottles were placed in a shaking incubator at 37 c and 130 rpm the batch test contained 20 ml of ba medium and 20 ml of active biomass retrieved from the reactors the bottles liquid phase and headspace were firstly flushed with n2 to create anoxic conditions and then with acetate 1 18 g l and h2 co2 2 bar 80 20 v v in the headspace to serve as carbon sources 2 3 analytical methods ph was determined by a ph meter mettler switzerland after centrifugation of the samples at 10 000 rpm for 10 min the supernatants were immediately analyzed as the soluble fraction chemical oxygen demand cod and nh3 n were measured according to the standard methods apha 1998 and carbohydrate concentration was measured by the phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 using glucose as the standard biogas ch4 and co2 volume of reactors in all three phases was calculated by measuring the collected gas inside the gas bag biogas volume in sma test was determined according to the pressure in the headspace and the pressure was measured by a 3151 wal bmp test system pressure gauge wal mess und regelsysteme gmbh germany after the pressure measured referred as p1 mbar the biogas in the digester was released under water to prevent gas exchange and the pressure was then measured again used as p2 for the next day mbar the volume of biogas produced was calculated as follow equation 4 v biogas p 1 p 2 v head m r t

isotopes of co2 and ch4 as described by whiticar et al 1986 αc 1 065 indicates dominance of the hydrogenotrophic pathway while αc 1 055 indicates dominance of aceticlastic methanogenesis as the main pathway whiticar 1999 whiticar et al 1986 2 5 high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing and analysis samples from all reactors in the steady state of different phases were retrieved to elucidate possible changes in the relative abundance of archaeal populations microbial dna was extracted from anaerobic sludge samples using the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga usa according to

paired end sequenced 2 300 bp on an illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa according to the standard protocols by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china the obtained sequences were quality checked and normalized to approximately 30 000 sequences detailed information were shown in supporting information appendix a relative abundance was defined as the number of sequences affiliated with a taxon divided by the total number of sequences per sample orders and genera comprising less than 1 of the total composition in all samples were summed and indicated as others 2 6 data analysis analysis of variance anova and student s t test were used to test the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered to indicate statistical significance the gas volume reported in this study was calibrated to standard temperature 273 k and pressure 1 atm the steady state in each phase was defined as a relative variation of mp and vfa production less than 10 the samples were taken every day for analysis the standard deviation of mp and vfa were calculated based on the data of the steady state of phase i and phase iii the nh3 n concentration was calculated from equation 6 angelidaki and ahring 1993 6 fan t a n 1 10 p h k a where fan and tan are the concentrations of nh3 n and total ammonia the sum of nh3 n and nh4 n respectively and k a is the dissociation constant 1 29 10 9 at 37 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactors performance the reactors were operated for 101 days and established steady states in both phase i and phase iii phase i was used as a baseline for determining possible enhancements with different bioaugmentation strains mps in different reactors and different phases are illustrated in fig 1 the mp biodegradability increase ratio and relative increase ratio in each reactor are also summarized in table 2 elemental analysis indicated that the theoretical mp is 371 ml g glu throughout phase i all of the reactors remained at an inhibited steady state with mpbefore of 180 3 191 7 ml g glu which were about 50 of theoretical methane production bdbefore around 50 and then mp was significantly affected p 0 05 since the bioaugmentation strains were added along with culture medium containing carbon source nevertheless the medium shock was vanished away after about 20 days operation fig 1 in phase iii mp in all reactors with bioaugmentation decreased immediately and reached a steady state in the steady state of phase iii the mp of blank was 2 8 p 0 05 which is higher than that in phase i as microorganisms slowly adapt to high ammonia levels chen et al 2008 fotidis et al 2014 this increase was non significant as shown in fig 1 and table 2 a significant improvement p 0 05 in mp was observed in the steady state of phase iii days 61 101 in the reactors ss mbb ta mbb ss mbs ta mbs mbs ss msb ta msb msb ss and ta with increase ratios of 35 0 30 6 71 2 45 5 28 6 41 8 47 9 58 3 17 6 and 7 1 respectively compared with the corresponding values in phase i to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to demonstrate that bioaugmentation with a facultative aceticlastic methanogen msb saob facultative aceticlastic methanogen ss msb ta msb and saob hydrogenotrophic methanogen ss mbs ta mbs could exhibit profound improvements increase ratio 40 in mp at high tans these methods are entirely new approaches of bioaugmentation to mitigate the ammonia inhibition problem during anaerobic mp previous published bioaugmentation methods only tested saob hydrogenotrophic methanogens fotidis et al 2013 2014 mbs appeared to be the optimal choice and its effects were enhanced better by addition of ss mp ss mbs ta mbs mbs the mp of ss mbs was 71 higher than that in blank this result was in accordance with other studies showing that hydrogenotrophic methanogens gain energy and break down acetate into h2 and co2 products that they cannot catabolize by themselves by using the efficient metabolic abilities of saob stams and plugge 2009a however it was unexpected to discover that mp in the reactor where msb was added alone was 13 5 and 6 6 higher than the corresponding values in ss msb and ta msb respectively among the treatments tested addition of msb facultative aceticlastic methanogen without saob was the most useful in recovering mp about 59 7 compared with that in blank as shown fig 1 the mp profile in msb in which bdafter decreased to 59 5 and then gradually increased to 79 8 was observed on day 53 phase iii the reason may be attributed to a shift of methanogenic pathway with msb addition since msb was the unique kind of facultative aceticlastic methanogen this mechanism will be discussed later in this study the mp of msh was similar to that of blank p 0 05 and even lower than the mp observed before bioaugmentation this finding indicates that addition of the obligate aceticlastic methanogen msh exerts no positive effect on the microbial community initially established in the reactor a slight reduction in mp was also observed in ss mcb and ta mcb which respectively showed mpafter of 0 5 and 5 7 lower than the corresponding mpbefore fotidis et al 2013 revealed that bioaugmentation with sao co cultures does not affect mp at high ammonia levels however data from the present study show that bioaugmentation with ss and ta both saobs exerts a positive effect on the ad process no increase in mpafter was observed in the ss mcb and ta mcb reactors likely because ss and ta cannot oxidize acetate into hydrogen when syntrophically cultivated with mcb this phenomenon has also been observed in previous study wang et al 2015 the reactors where the bioaugmentation failed ss mcb ta mcb had the same nutrients as the reactors where it worked ss mbs ta mbs ss mbb ta mbb so nutrients in the growth media had limited effect on the reactor performance 3 2 volatile fatty acid concentration and ph glucose concentration in the effluent of all reactors were practically zero throughout the experiment phase i iii as shown in fig 2 and table 3 all reactors started with similar total vfa tvfa levels 2500 2900 mg l during phase i during bioaugmentation phase ii addition of medium containing some residual carbon sources led to an increase in tvfa that eventually declined after bioaugmentation and reached a steady state which should be vanish away with continuous operation coincident with mp the tvfa concentration in blank was significantly higher p 0 05 than those in ss mbb ta mbb ss mbs ta mbs mbs ss msb ta msb and msb during the steady state in phase iii specifically the tvfa in ss mbs 1032 mg l ta mbs 1452 mg l ss msb 1624 mg l ta msb 1507 mg l and msb 1384 mg l was less than 70 of that in blank until the steady state was achieved in phase iii bdafter 72 85 the tvfa levels of ss mbb ta mbb mbs ss and ta were lower than their tvfa concentrations in phase i remaining over 1700 mg l after bioaugmentation with bdafter 71 fig 1 by comparison the tvfa levels in msh ss mcb and ta mcb remained similar to the tvfa concentrations observed in phase i indicating an unhealthy ad process the vfa composition in phase i and the steady state of phase iii was further analyzed and summarized in table 3 acetate 35 40 and propionate 57 63 were the main vfas in all reactors in phase i total percentage 94 given a similar total percentage of acetate and propionate 95 in the steady state of phase iii the vfa distributions in ss mbs ta mbs ss msb ta msb and msb were changed after bioaugmentation in this case acetate contents increased by over 45 while propionate content decreased by 20 compared with those values found in phase i the tvfa of other reactors in the steady state of phase iii was similar to that observed in phase i these differences indicate that bioaugmentation may exert positive effects on the metabolism of propionate degrading bacteria however acetogenesis and methanogenesis were still inhibited in these reactors after bioaugmentation while the ph of the 14 reactors in phase i was about 7 5 it stabilized to around 7 3 7 6 in the steady state of phase iii here nh3 n concentrations fluctuated at 80 110 mg l fig 3 although ph and fan concentrations varied in different bioaugmentation reactors no correlations were found between ph and bioaugmentation or between fan and bioaugmentation all reactors were able to inhibit ammonia at slightly high ph 7 3 which means bioaugmentation may exert no significant effect on ph or fan concentration nevertheless ph levels remained within the favorable range for the ad process in all reactors throughout the experiment liu et al 2008 details of the shift in the methanogenic pathway and the function of saob in these reactors remain lacking in recent studies as such this study further explores why reactors with mbs and msb ss mbs ta mbs mbs ss msb ta msb and msb yielded higher mps than other reactors 3 3 specific methanogenic activity sma test our previous results found that when bioaugmentation is used to mitigate ammonia inhibition during the anaerobic mp process mbs exhibits a positive effect and this effect is enhanced by addition of ss and ta conversely mp in msb was higher than that in ss msb and ta msb mp msb ta msb ss msb the sma test was carried out to explore the methanogen activities in these reactors the sma with h2 co2 or acetate as a substrate and mpafter of seven reactors msb ta msb ss msb mbs ta mbs ss mbs and blank in the steady state of phase iii are shown in fig 4 the sma of h2 co2 activity of hydrogenotrophic methanogens and the sma of acetate activity of aceticlastic methanogens in the reactors with bioaugmentation were higher than those in the abiotic augmentation reactor blank in addition the sma of h2 co2 in msb ta msb ss msb mbs ta mbs ss mbs and blank were 26 1 65 3 163 8 273 6 193 1 200 4 and 26 6 higher than the sma of acetate respectively the results of the sma test are basically consistent with previous studies indicating that hydrogenotrophic methanogens are more robust to ammonia inhibition compared with aceticlastic methanogens wang et al 2016 yenigun and demirel 2013 comparison of the smas in mbs ta mbs and ss mbs revealed that the smas of h2 co2 and acetate increased with increasing mp addition of mbs enhanced hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in the reactors and addition of ta and ss promoted acetate oxidation into h2 co2 and accelerated hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis this phenomenon is similar to previous studies that found a positive effect on the growth rate of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis with saob bioaugmentation fotidis et al 2013 it should be pointed out that although ta mbs and ss mbs addition could stimulate aceticlastic methanogenesis ss was a better partner to increase mp with mbs the sma results of h2 co2 and acetate in mbs ta mbs and ss mbs coincided well with the mp data mbs ta mbs ss mbs this finding further indicates that reactor performance may be improved effectively by enhancing aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis on account of the synergistic effects of the microbes comparison of the smas in msb ta msb and ss msb demonstrated that increasing the sma of acetate also increased mp although the sma of h2 co2 decreased the mp of msb first decreased but gradually increased to high levels increase ratio 58 3 in phase iii fig 1 such a trend was not detected in reactors bioaugmented with msb and saob together probably because of the methanogenic pathway shift after bioaugmentation with msb alone as a facultative aceticlastic methanogen msb greatly enhances aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis addition of msb and saob mostly facilitates hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis most studies focus on the enhancement of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis fotidis et al 2013 2014 westerholm et al 2012 in the present study balanced enhancement of both aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis could be contributed to achieving high mp in spite of the differences in these two groups with different methanogens we may conclude that when bioaugmentation was used to mitigate the ammonia inhibition issue the enhancement of aceticlastic methanogenesis is also of great importance which should also be valued as well as the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis 3 4 stable isotopic analysis carbon isotope fractionations are illustrated in fig 5 to evaluate the methanogenic pathway in reactors with bioaugmentation with msb or mbs in phase iii all seven reactors were dominated by the hydrogenotrophic pathway αc 1 065 comparison of the αc of msb ta msb and ss msb clearly showed that bioaugmentation with saob msb enhances hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis the αc of mbs alone was higher than those of ta mbs and ss mbs hydrogenotrophic methanogen might be markedly strengthened at high αc but the corresponding increase in mp is not observed an appropriate αc appears to be necessary to achieve high mp with the recovery of the microbiological system 3 5 microbial community the microbial communities of two samples in the steady state of phase i day 34 b 1 and b 2 the two samples were collected from different reactors before bioaugmentation and their similarity represents their reproducibility and samples from all of the reactors in the steady state of phase iii were analyzed the richness and diversity of the microbial communities are summarized in table 4 the obtained sequences were quality checked and normalized to approximately 30 000 sequences all of the coverage values were above 99 97 which means an abundance of taxonomic groups were covered well in all samples the number of otus chao s richness estimation and shannon diversities of all samples were similar thereby indicating that the abundance of microbial communities was similar in all reactors furthermore as shown in figure a1 appendix a different strains addition performed an increasing relative abundance in matched reactors indicating an effective bioaugmentation heatmap analysis was used to intuitively display differences in relative abundances of archaea at the genus level among all samples fig 6 the similarity of results between b 1 and b 2 indicates that all of the reactors had similar microbial community diversity in phase i all 16 samples were similar in terms of microbial composition and abundance methanobacterium purple and methanosaeta purple and blue were the two dominant genera in the microbial communities of all reactors bioaugmentation with the dominant archaea mbb increased the relative abundance of methanobacterium spp from 62 9 in blank to 68 9 in ss mbb and 70 1 in ta mbb as illustrated in appendix a figure a2 a the abundance of methanobacterium spp correlated well with mp performance r2 0 9 which suggests that an increase in methanobacterium spp exerts a positive effect on mp fig 1 although the increase ratio was less than 8 methanosaeta was found dominant in all three reactors with msb bioaugmentation msb ta msb and ss msb with a coverage of about 35 which is 10 higher than that in blank fig 7 a methanosaeta is an obligate aceticlastic methanogen while methanosarcina spp is a unique methanogen that can achieve metabolism via both aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis methanosaeta and methanosarcina belong to the order methanosarcinales thus the three reactors bioaugmented with msb msb ta msb and ss msb facilitate and enrich the growth of methanosaeta spp which also dominated ss mbs and ta mbs with coverages above than 35 purple in fig 6 the corresponding coverage was less than 20 in mbs fig 7 a blue color in fig 6 mbs is an obligate hydrogenotrophic methanogen and its addition to reactors with saob stimulated mp recovery and decreased vfa accumulation in this environment the activity of methanosaeta spp was recovered and the relative abundance of methanosaeta spp increased previous studies report that methanosaeta spp could be boosted under high concentration of ammonia but low acetate levels and the aceticlastic methanogenic pathway could be strengthened by these microbes lu et al 2013 unexpectedly direct addition of msh did not enrich the abundance of methanosaeta spp as shown in fig 7 b the relative abundance of methanosarcina spp in msb ta msb and ss msb increased by 20 14 and 13 fold respectively compared with methanosarcina spp in blank which indicates that methanosarcina spp are robust to ammonia inhibition as shown in figure a2 b the abundance of methanosarcina spp appeared to correlate well with mp performance r2 0 96 although their relative abundance was less than 2 considering the higher ratio of methanosarcina spp in msb than in ta msb or ss msb fig 7 b these species may metabolize more through the aceticlastic methanogenic pathway than through the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathway under high tans some studies have reported that methanosarcina could accept electrons via direct interspecies electron transfer diet rotaru et al 2014 instead of the interspecies hydrogen transfer strategy and this genus could be capable of using either hydrogen or electrons derived from diet for mp as such while the relative abundance of methanosarcina was comparatively low in the reactors 2 after bioaugmentation the resulting mp was greatly improved fig 1 and appendix a figure a2 b the percentage of methanosarcina spp in each reactor was comparatively low 0 1 in blank 2 0 in msb 1 4 in ta msb and 1 3 in ss msb however methanosarcina spp appeared to achieve a critical biomass in msb ta msb and ss msb and became process steering microbes thereby influencing the activity of the complete microbiological system bioaugmentation with non dominant archaea led to an increase in mp in the reactors which was previously called the microbiological domino effect fotidis et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 the relative abundance of methanobrevibacter spp in reactors mbs ta mbs and ss mbs increased 5 8 and 11 fold respectively compared with methanobrevibacter spp in blank from 0 1 to 0 5 1 0 and 1 2 fig 7 c although the percentage of methanobrevibacter spp was less than 1 5 in the total archaeal community as another process steering microbe the improvement in mp performance due to mbs addition cannot be underestimated a positive linear correlation r2 0 95 between the relative abundance of methanobrevibacter spp and mp appendix a figure a2 c was obtained although methanobrevibacter spp were relatively poor in abundance bioaugmentation with methanobrevibacter spp as well as methanosarcina spp revealed a pivotal role in determining the overall microbial consortium and in turn the final performance of the reactors as a obligate hydrogenotrophic methanogen mbs was facilitated as saob presented comparing fig 7 b and c saob directly affected the relative abundance of different methanogens due to differences in stimulation of the methanogenic pathway bioaugmentation with saob ss and ta alone increased mp by 7 17 fig 7 d clearly illustrates that the abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens increased by 5 while the abundance of the obligate aceticlastic methanogen decreased to 2 4 compared with those in blank this result indicates that addition of saob facilitates the growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogens which can use the metabolic products of saob and overcome the related energy barriers stams and plugge 2009b however the increase ratio of mp was not especially high probably because of the low growth rate of saob fotidis et al 2013 4 conclusions bioaugmentation with different microorganisms in anaerobic digestion reactors were investigated in this article in order to mitigate the ammonia inhibition seven pure strains were selected and thirteen bioaugmentation approaches were tested bioaugmentation with hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanobrevibacter smithii and syntrophaceticu schinkii together was the optimal choice with 71 1 increased mp than that in blank and bdafter could reach 85 bioaugmentation with facultative aceticlastic methanogen methanosarcina barkeri alone was also an efficient way with 59 7 higher than that in blank according to the further analysis with specific methanogenic activity and carbon isotope fractionations aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathway should be both taken into account during bioaugmentation and the balance could result in a better reactor performance methanobacterium spp and methanosaeta spp were both the dominant archaea in ad reactors with high ammonia concentration in this article bioaugmentation with methanobacterium spp along with saobs could obtain 30 35 increased mp while no positive effect could reach when methanosaeta spp was bioaugmented on the other side methanobrevibacter spp and methanosarcina spp were the non dominant archaea in all reactors even the relative abundances were still poor 2 after bioaugmentation with mbs or msb but they both displayed pivotal roles in increasing mp and improving the overall performance declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known

point are difficult to dewater and pose an explosion risk for conventional thermal drying here we develop a facile one pot alkali assisted hydrothermal treatment aht method for cost efficient hazardous waste dewatering dry mass minimization and volume reduction wet paint sludge wps a hazardous organic waste was reduced 79 by total weight and 52 by dry mass by dewatering through aht hydrophobic modification and the product was nonflammable conversion of bound water to free water enhanced wps dissolution for further decomposition alkali was critical for boosting ether demethylation in the solid phase and cleavage of ethers forming alcohols that facilitated transfer of solid mass into the liquid phase polar functional groups were eliminated through aht which increased the relative abundance of hydrophobic functional groups on the surface of solid residues and promoted dewatering we also demonstrate that aht can be widely adapted and scaled up to treat various hazardous organic waste streams which is of significant industrial and environmental interest graphical abstract image 1 keywords hazardous waste dewatering hydrothermal treatment paint sludge hydrophobic 1 introduction hazardous wastes which are characterized by their ignitability corrosivity reactivity and or toxicity are generated in large quantities from industrial manufacturing process d alisa et al 2014 daniels 1986 disposal of hazardous waste is often outsourced to licensed incineration facilities that are approaching their treatment capacities walser et al 2012 garcia labiano et al 2007 furthermore hazardous wastes disposal represents a significant quantity dependent cost table s1 considering the growing amounts of hazardous wastes being generated rising disposal costs and public opposition to the siting of new disposal facilities it is important to develop strategies for waste volume reduction e g through enhanced dewatering that also facilitate further treatment in a safe and cost effective manner lim et al 2011 xu et al 2018 most chemical process industries e g refineries pharmaceutical automotive and textile use water solvents and polymers that end up in their hazardous wastes dmitrienko and strizhak 2018 yin et al 2015 zhang et al 2007 zhu et al 2018 these industries generate large quantities of hazardous organic waste often volatile sludge with a large fraction of non drainable moisture i e low ratio of free to bound water guo et al 2019 xiao et al 2018 bound water which significantly contributes to waste volume is held tightly to the polar groups or ionic sites on molecules and cannot be squeezed out by conventional dewatering technologies such as high pressure plate and frame filter pressing belt press filtering and centrifuge processing christensen et al 2015 thermal drying processes tdp are often used to evaporate moisture from the dewatered wastes bennamoun et al 2013 however separating water from the hazardous organic waste by tdp suffers from low energy efficiency zhang et al 2014 and poses an explosion hazard due to the low flash point of these wastes liaw et al 2010 salihoglu and salihoglu 2016 note that dewatering is important to reduce the waste volume through solid liquid separation but it does not per se achieve dry mass reduction christensen et al 2015 this underscores the need for broadly applicable and cost effective treatment approaches that reduce both the volume and dry mass of hazardous organic sludges hydrothermal treatment ht which is conducted in a closed reactor at 180 350 c under autogenous pressure offers a reliable route to convert waste activated sludge into value added products higgins et al 2017 li et al 2017 and facilitate dewatering due to decomposition of water binding components yu et al 2014 and dehydration reactions wang and li 2015 however the feasibility of ht for hazardous sludge volume reduction and dry mass removal has not been addressed in the literature since depolymerization decomposition and solubilization of organic wastes e g using supercritical fluids contribute to dry mass reduction chen et al 1995 demirbas 2010 staszak and malinowski 1987 it is essential to promote these reactions in the mild hydrothermal process the benefits of ht treatment on depolymerization has been documented only in the presence of large amounts of olefin metathesis over long reaction periods i e 4 d jia et al 2016 or intensive energy input to achieve high temperatures 400 c aguado et al 2008 serrano et al 2012 with microwave assistance fan et al 2013 however alkaline conditions decrease the polarity of organic matter and facilitate the hydrolytic cleavage of carbon functional groups under milder conditions comisar et al 2008 mursito et al 2011 roberts et al 2010 thus we envisioned that alkali addition might assist ht treatment to enhance dry mass reduction since paint is broadly applied in industry wet paint sludge wps is a common hazardous organic waste that is generated in large and increasing quantities salihoglu and salihoglu 2016 akafuah et al 2013 this paper reports wps volume and dry mass reduction through a facile one pot alkaline hydrothermal aht method a systematic investigation was conducted to discern the underlying mechanisms for hydrophobic modification of wps to convert bound water to easily drainable free water the reaction pathway was investigated to discern the critical role of alkali for dry mass reduction furthermore pilot scale tests were operated with a variety of other hazardous wastes to demonstrate aht as a reliable industrially scalable and broadly applicable process 2 materials and methods 2 1 wet paint sludge wps and other hazardous wastes wps was obtained from an automotive lock company shanghai

in hydrothermal treatment ht for wps dewatering fig s3 using design expert software version 8 05 stat ease inc usa a five level two variable central composite design ccd table 1 was adopted to select the ht parameters hydrothermal batch reactions were conducted by loading 25 g of wps in 100 ml airtight stainless steel tubular reactor polyphenylene container inside fig s4a the reactors were heated to the selected temperatures variable a table 1 in a homothermic oven dhg 9013a after a stipulated time period variable b table 1 these reactors were cooled to room temperature in water bath the samples were withdrawn from the containers and dewatered by vacuum filtration fig s4a for 3 min then the residues on the filter paper were weighed the residues were dried in a homothermic oven dhg 9013a at 105 c for 24 h for dry mass measurement all tests were performed in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation the total mass reduction tmr of wps was calculated using eq 1 whereas dry mass reduction dmr using eq 2 1 tmr m1 m2 m1 100 2 dmr m3 m4 m3 100 where m1 is the weight of raw waste m2 is the weight of solid residues in the filter paper after vacuum filtration m3 is the dry weight of raw wps and m4 is the dry weight of the solid residues after vacuum filtration regression analysis yielded predictive polynomial quadratic models table s4 for both responses tmr and dmr response surface methodology showed that the interacting effects of temperature and time on total mass reduction tmr p 0 09 and dry mass reduction dmr p 0 08 were significant table s5 fig s5 tmr increased rapidly from 50 to 71 by increasing the temperature from 180 to 220 c and time from 3 to 4 h fig 1 a and it increased slowly to 75 with longer duration 4 h at a higher temperature 220 c however dmr only increased with temperature when the temperature was below 220 c fig 1b and it stabilized from 220 to 260 c at longer reaction times 4 h higher temperature and longer reaction time increase operating and capital costs thus the condition for ht treatment of wps was selected at 220 c for 4 h under an autogenous pressure of 385 12 psi 2 3 alkali assisted hydrothermal

higher in the reactor with naoh added than those with other chemical agents fig s6a the optimal dosage was 38 mg naoh g wps fig s6b and was selected as the alkali assisted hydrothermal treatment aht

wps dewatering and dry mass minimization hydrothermal treatment was effective in dewatering wps and dmr significantly increased with alkali addition at 38 mg naoh g wps fig 2 a from 36 3 1 6 for ht without naoh to 52 1 1 3 for aht p 0 0005 table s8 tmr also significantly increased from 71 5 2 1 for ht to 79 1 3 6 for aht p 0 05 table s9 removal of organic matter from the solid phase after ht or aht treatment was corroborated by difference thermo gravimetry dtg from 200 to 350 c fig 2b and fig s7 based on mass balances most of the organic matter lost from the solid phase was transferred to the liquid phase volatilization of organics predominantly 1 butanol and camphene table s10 was relatively minor 1 4 2 9 fig s8 the beneficial effect of hydrothermal processing on polyethylene pe depolymerization has been reported jia et al 2016 although this required large amounts of re2o7 al2o3 catalyst over long reaction periods i e 4 days olefin metathesis of the internal double bonds at high temperatures 400 c reduces the pe chain length forming light alkenes c3c5 aguado et al 2008 serrano et al 2012 similarly cellulose can be depolymerized by hydrothermal processing with cleavage of the polysaccharide chain and release of ch2oh proceeding at elevated temperatures 240 260 c with microwave assistance fan et al 2013 here we used naoh to make ht treatment a milder more eco friendly and facile process 3 2 reaction mechanisms 3 2 1 hydrophobic modification of solids surface enhanced dewatering and mass reduction the treated wps solid was nonflammable table s2 and hydrophobic as evidenced by an increase in the water contact angle θ from 13 for raw wps fig 3 a to 25 after ht treatment fig 3b or 107 after aht treatment fig 3c the observed decrease in the polarity of the surface reflects a decrease in surface free energy associated with the formation of hydrophobic functional groups which is consistent with their neutral non polar or slightly polar nature valsaraj 1994 hydrophobic modification of the wps surface through the aht process enhanced separation of water from the solids surface much easier which significantly increased dewaterability compared to raw wps and ht treated waste the microstructures of the solid samples from wps before and after treatment by ht or aht were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem fig s9 the raw wps had a condensed flaky petrous morphology fig 3d that changed to a loose packing porous structure with spherical particles fig 3e after ht treatment in contrast residual solid wps after aht treatment had an urchin like structure spread over the surface fig 3f wps contains both si and zn fig s10 which likely contributed to this morphology silicate oligomers have been reported to form urchin like agglomerates under alkaline conditions cai et al 2001 and basicity was reported to play an important role in self assembly and crystal growth of urchin like zno structures jiang et al 2009 we also observed a crystalline structure after aht using x ray diffraction xrd analysis fig s11 which was ascribed to alkali serving as a surface modifier for crystal growth sahraneshin et al 2012 the crystalline structure associated with the urchin like microstructures affected the surface tension at the interfaces of liquid and solid phases sadovnikov and gusev 2017 resulting in lower surface energy and hydrophobic surfaces in aht treated wps 3 2 2 conversion of bound to free water increased drainable water volume the temperature increase breaks hydrogen bonds 25 40 kj mol to enable water and alkali to act as solvent and reactant akiya and savage 2002 unterlass 2018 after ht or aht treatment the ratio of free to bound water wf increased from 1 10 g g dry mass for raw wps to 2 98 g g dry mass for the ht process product and 4 57 g g dry mass for the aht process product fig 4 a which increased the free drainable water volume fig s12 aht with the increase in temperature drastically increased the ionic product of water i e kw to act as solvent and boost further chemical reactions unterlass 2018 furthermore the decrease of the negative charge on the treated solids surface table s11 decreased electrostatic repulsion between the particles wang and hu 2013 thus facilitating particles aggregation and conversion of bound water to free water thomas et al 2017 3 2 3 solubilization enhanced dry mass reduction the chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia concentrations in the aqueous phase were significantly increased by 81 and 70 fold respectively after ht treatment and by 112 and 120 fold after aht treatment fig 4b this represents deamination and a significant conversion of the organic matter into the aqueous phase p 0 001 table s12 and table s13 enhanced solubilization of volatile organics was verified by gc ms fig 4c showing that the peak intensities of 2 ethyl 1 hexanol and 1 butanol in the liquid after aht processing were 1 5 fold higher than those in the ht treated sample an increase in wps specific surface area during aht treatment table s14 likely contributed to enhanced solubilization depolymerization likely occurred during aht processing as indicated by the right shift of peaks a d towards a lower molecular weight mw distribution fig 4d the fraction of smaller mw in the liquid 1k dramatically increased after ht 8 2 and aht treatment 17 3 compared to the untreated wps leachate 0 04 fig s13 this is consistent with the observation that the released organics in the aqueous phase were biodegradable fig s14 indicating that the generated wastewater was amenable to biological treatment supplementary information the inorganic metallic components of wps that are important pigment and driers in paint were also released to the aqueous phase through the ht and aht treatment processes and their solubilization was also enhanced under alkaline conditions fig s10 3 2 4 proposed reactions for the alkali assisted hydrothermal process examination of the solid phase at the molecular level was also conducted to advance mechanistic understanding of wps transformations during the aht process we propose a series of reactions involving alkaline hydrolysis dehydration decarboxylation depolymerization and demethylation fig 5 a based on the following results a van krevelen diagram fig 5b reveals that wps was significantly dehydrated during the ht process following the increase of temperature from 140 to 240 c green arrows which caused a significant loss of oxygen and hydrogen from the wps solids wps decarboxylation i e disappearance of the coo band pointed by red arrows was also observed red arrows furthermore demethylation likely due to alkaline hydrolysis of ether bonds increased with increasing naoh dosage blue arrows deg which is an ether used as solvent for paints and varnishes and was abundant in wps table s6 was likely demethylated and degraded to ethylene glycol n butanol 2 butoxyethanol and 2 ethyl 1 hexanol fig 6 these alcohols accumulated after aht at 5 fold higher concentrations than after using ht process without alkali fig 5c furthermore methyl methacrylate the monomer of pmma which is abundant in wps table s7 appeared in the liquid phase after ht fig 5d indicating depolymerization fig 6 methanol was generated when pmma was treated by aht fig 5d since methyl esterified residues undergo saponification overall alkali boosted ether demethylation in the solid phase forming alcohols that facilitated transfer of solid mass into the liquid phase 3 2 5 hydrophobic functional groups increased in the solid phase ftir patterns fig 7 a depict changes in the abundance of functional groups among raw wps ht and aht solid products after ht or aht treatment new peaks corresponding to hydrophobic functional groups pointed by red triangles became apparent compared to raw wps the peaks from the samples after ht or aht treatment became apparent in the 800 700 cm 1 region ch2 and ch bending vibrations and 2970 2910 cm 1 region aliphatic ch2 and ch3 stretching vibrations compared to raw wps which imply a significant hydrophobic character this observation is consistent with previous reports that an increase in alkali c ratio shifted the hydrothermal reaction equilibrium of biomass towards hydrophobic products allcock 2008 furthermore polar functional groups such as ethers 1150 cm 1 alcohols 3400 cm 1 and amines 3350 cm 1 disappeared from the solid surface after hydrothermal treatment in the presence of naoh basic conditions decreased the polarity of solid surfaces and polarized ether bonds making it easier to cleave heterolytically comisar et al 2008 mursito et al 2011 roberts et al 2010 therefore alkali addition enhanced the transfer of organic matter containing carboxyl alcohol and ammonia groups from solid to the aqueous phase fig s15 this explains the observed dry mass loss in the volatile organic fraction after aht processing and the overall conversion to a nonflammable solid residue solid samples from raw wps ht and aht products were characterized by solid state 13c nmr fig 7b and showed two similar trends first hydrophilic functional groups appeared at chemical shifts δ between 113 to 44 and 200 to 161 ppm second hydrophobic functional groups were observed at chemical shifts between 44 to 0 and 161 to 113 ppm liu et al 2015 because these trends the hi hb empirical index of solid hydrophilicity showed a decline from 0 35 raw to 0 34 ht and to 0 28 aht table 2 the aggregation of hydrophobic groups is conducive to decreasing the number of organized water molecules surrounding them and this increase in entropy promotes dewatering this corroborates the vital role of alkali in increasing the number of hydrophobic functional groups on the solids surface thus promoting further dewatering and solid mass reduction 3 3 aht application to other hazardous organic wastes and pilot scale study aht has broad applicability to treat hazardous organic waste streams from dissimilar industries and resulted in significant tmr and dmr for various hazardous organic wastes table s3 including paint sludges from another manufacturer 67 3 1 3 for tmr and 44 5 1 8 for dmr oil sludge 62 9

industry tmr 85 8 4 7 furthermore no significant weight change of five metal coupons stainless steel titanium nickel alloys zirconium alloy and hastelloy was observed after five cycles of ht or aht process weight change 0 01 table s15 indicating that reactors made by either of these materials should resist corrosion by the hydrothermal chemical reactions thus we scaled up this process using a 50 l pilot scale batch hydrothermal system to treat wps fig s4b using an operating temperature of 220 c with a reaction time of 4 h we achieved tmr of 55 6 6 7 ht and 69 8 3 9 aht dmr of 31 6 5 4 ht and 40 9 3 2 aht table s16 4 conclusions this study addressed significant limitations associated with dewatering of hazardous organic wastes to achieve volume and dry mass reduction we demonstrate that aht can significantly reduce the volume and mass of various hazardous organic wastes converting them to nonflammable hydrophobic solid residues and biodegradable wastewater the released water with a higher ionic product acts as a solvent under hydrothermal conditions to enhance the solubilization of organic matter to aqueous phase this conversion contributes to dry mass reduction accompanied by demethylation of carbon chains alkali triggers solid solid interactions that increase exposure of hydrophobic functional groups to the particle surface forming hydrophobic matter to improve dewatering

north renmin road shanghai 201620 china hazardous waste dewatering is important for volume reduction and further treatment hazardous organic wastes with low ratio of free to bound water and low flash point are difficult to dewater and pose an explosion risk for conventional thermal drying here we develop a facile one pot alkali assisted hydrothermal treatment aht method for cost efficient hazardous waste dewatering dry mass minimization and volume reduction wet paint sludge wps a hazardous organic waste was reduced 79 by total weight and 52 by dry mass by dewatering through aht hydrophobic modification and the product was nonflammable conversion of bound water to free water enhanced wps dissolution for further decomposition alkali was critical for boosting ether demethylation in the solid phase and cleavage of ethers forming alcohols that facilitated transfer of solid mass into the liquid phase polar functional groups were eliminated through aht which increased the relative abundance of hydrophobic functional groups on the surface of solid residues and promoted dewatering we also demonstrate that aht can be widely adapted and scaled up to treat various hazardous organic waste streams which is of significant industrial and environmental interest graphical abstract image 1 keywords hazardous waste dewatering hydrothermal treatment paint sludge hydrophobic 1 introduction hazardous wastes which are characterized by their ignitability corrosivity reactivity and or toxicity are generated in large quantities from industrial manufacturing process d alisa et al 2014 daniels 1986 disposal of hazardous waste is often outsourced to licensed incineration facilities that are approaching their treatment capacities walser et al 2012 garcia labiano et al 2007 furthermore hazardous wastes disposal represents a significant quantity dependent cost table s1 considering the growing amounts of hazardous wastes being generated rising disposal costs and public opposition to the siting of new disposal facilities it is important to develop strategies for waste volume reduction e g through enhanced dewatering that also facilitate further treatment in a safe and cost effective manner lim et al 2011 xu et al 2018 most chemical process industries e g refineries pharmaceutical automotive and textile use water solvents and polymers that end up in their hazardous wastes dmitrienko and strizhak 2018 yin et al 2015 zhang et al 2007 zhu et al 2018 these industries generate large quantities of hazardous organic waste often volatile sludge with a large fraction of non drainable moisture i e low ratio of free to bound water guo et al 2019 xiao et al 2018 bound water which significantly contributes to waste volume is held tightly to the polar groups or ionic sites on molecules and cannot be squeezed out by conventional dewatering technologies such as high pressure plate and frame filter pressing belt press filtering and centrifuge processing christensen et al 2015 thermal drying processes tdp are often used to evaporate moisture from the dewatered wastes bennamoun et al 2013 however separating water from the hazardous organic waste by tdp suffers from low energy efficiency zhang et al 2014 and poses an explosion hazard due to the low flash point of these wastes liaw et al 2010 salihoglu and salihoglu 2016 note that dewatering is important to reduce the waste volume through solid liquid separation but it does not per se achieve dry mass reduction christensen et al 2015 this underscores the need for broadly applicable and cost effective treatment approaches that reduce both the volume and dry mass of hazardous organic sludges hydrothermal treatment ht which is conducted in a closed reactor at 180 350 c under autogenous pressure offers a reliable route to convert waste activated sludge into value added products higgins et al 2017 li et al 2017 and facilitate dewatering due to decomposition of water binding components yu et al 2014 and dehydration reactions wang and li 2015 however the feasibility of ht for hazardous sludge volume reduction and dry mass removal has not been addressed in the literature since depolymerization decomposition and solubilization of organic wastes e g using supercritical fluids contribute to dry mass reduction chen et al 1995 demirbas 2010 staszak and malinowski 1987 it is essential to promote these reactions in the mild hydrothermal process the benefits of ht treatment on depolymerization has been documented only in the presence of large amounts of olefin metathesis over long reaction periods i e 4 d jia et al 2016 or intensive energy input to achieve high temperatures 400 c aguado et al 2008 serrano et al 2012 with microwave assistance fan et al 2013 however alkaline conditions decrease the polarity of organic matter and facilitate the hydrolytic cleavage of carbon functional groups under milder conditions comisar et al 2008 mursito et al 2011 roberts et al 2010 thus we envisioned that alkali addition might assist ht treatment to enhance dry mass reduction since paint is broadly applied in industry wet paint sludge wps is a common hazardous organic waste that is generated in large and increasing quantities salihoglu and salihoglu 2016 akafuah et al 2013 this paper reports wps volume and dry mass reduction through a facile one pot alkaline hydrothermal aht method a systematic investigation was conducted to discern the underlying mechanisms for hydrophobic modification of wps to convert bound water to easily drainable free water the reaction pathway was investigated to discern the critical role of alkali for dry mass reduction furthermore pilot scale tests were operated with a variety of other hazardous wastes to demonstrate aht as a reliable industrially scalable and broadly applicable process 2 materials and methods 2 1 wet paint sludge wps and other hazardous wastes wps was obtained from an automotive lock company shanghai china it has a sticky paste like consistency with a significant non drainable moisture content 77 5 and a high volatile solid to total solid ratio vs ts 83 5 reflected by its relatively low ratio of free to bound water wf 1 10 g g dry mass fig s1 by differential scanning calorimetry dsc and flash point 67 1 c table s2 to evaluate the alkali assisted hydrothermal treatment as a broadly applicable technique the following hazardous wastes were chosen oil sludge pharmaceutical residues high boiling residues from distillation towers concentrated solutions from the fluorine industry and textile sludge fig s2 these hazardous organic wastes are characterized by high moisture content 57 8 85 4 and high vs ts ratio 64 3 93 4 as detailed in table s3 waste samples were stored at 4 c prior to use 2 2 selection of hydrothermal reaction parameters using response surface methodology a preliminary study see supplementary information verified that temperature and reaction time are crucial parameters in hydrothermal treatment ht for wps dewatering fig s3 using design expert software version 8 05 stat ease inc usa a five level two variable central composite design ccd table 1 was adopted to select the ht parameters hydrothermal batch reactions were conducted by loading 25 g of wps in 100 ml airtight stainless steel tubular reactor polyphenylene container inside fig s4a the reactors were heated to the selected temperatures variable a table 1 in a homothermic oven dhg 9013a after a stipulated time period variable b table 1 these reactors were cooled to room temperature in water bath the samples were withdrawn from the containers and dewatered by vacuum filtration fig s4a for 3 min then the residues on the filter paper were weighed the residues were dried in a homothermic oven dhg 9013a at 105 c for 24 h for dry mass measurement all tests were performed in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation the total mass reduction tmr of wps was calculated using eq 1 whereas dry mass reduction dmr using eq 2 1 tmr m1 m2 m1 100 2 dmr m3 m4 m3 100 where m1 is the weight of raw waste m2 is the weight of solid residues in the filter paper after vacuum filtration m3 is the dry weight of raw wps and m4 is the dry weight of the solid residues after vacuum filtration regression analysis yielded predictive polynomial quadratic models table s4 for both responses tmr and dmr response surface methodology showed that the interacting effects of temperature and time on total mass reduction tmr p 0 09 and dry mass reduction dmr p 0 08 were significant table s5 fig s5 tmr increased rapidly from 50 to 71 by increasing the temperature from 180 to 220 c and time from 3 to 4 h fig 1 a and it increased slowly to 75 with longer duration 4 h at a higher temperature 220 c however dmr only increased with temperature when the temperature was below 220 c fig 1b and it stabilized from 220 to 260 c at longer reaction times 4 h higher temperature and longer reaction time increase operating and capital costs thus the condition for ht treatment of wps was selected at 220 c for 4 h under an autogenous pressure of 385 12 psi 2 3 alkali assisted hydrothermal treatment aht and products characterization before hydrothermal treatment different chemical agents dosage 50 mg g wps were mixed with 25 g wps unless otherwise noted the hydrothermal reaction was conducted at a temperature of 220 c for 4 h the overall process was the same as described in section 2 2 based on this preliminary study supplementary information dry mass reduction dmr of wps was higher in the reactor with naoh added than those with other chemical agents fig s6a the optimal dosage was 38 mg naoh g wps fig s6b and was selected as the alkali assisted hydrothermal treatment aht

ether deg and poly methyl methacrylate pmma were chosen for evaluation of bond cleavage and depolymerization due to their high abundance in wps table s6 and table s7 the ht and aht reactor both

wps dewatering and dry mass minimization hydrothermal treatment was effective in dewatering wps and dmr significantly increased with alkali addition at 38 mg naoh g wps fig 2 a from 36 3 1 6 for ht without naoh to 52 1 1 3 for aht p 0 0005 table s8 tmr also significantly increased from 71 5 2 1 for ht to 79 1 3 6 for aht p 0 05 table s9 removal of organic matter from the solid phase after ht or aht treatment was corroborated by difference thermo gravimetry dtg from 200 to 350 c fig 2b and fig s7 based on mass balances most of the organic matter lost from the solid phase was transferred to the liquid phase volatilization of organics predominantly 1 butanol and camphene table s10 was relatively minor 1 4 2 9 fig s8 the beneficial effect of hydrothermal processing on polyethylene pe depolymerization has been reported jia et al 2016 although this required large amounts of re2o7 al2o3 catalyst over long reaction periods i e 4 days olefin metathesis of the internal double bonds at high temperatures 400 c reduces the pe chain length forming light alkenes c3c5 aguado et al 2008 serrano et al 2012 similarly cellulose can be depolymerized by hydrothermal processing with cleavage of the polysaccharide chain and release of ch2oh proceeding at elevated temperatures 240 260 c with microwave assistance fan et al 2013 here we used naoh to make ht treatment a milder more eco friendly and facile process 3 2 reaction mechanisms 3 2 1 hydrophobic modification of solids surface enhanced dewatering and mass reduction the treated wps solid was nonflammable table s2 and hydrophobic as evidenced by an increase in the water contact angle θ from 13 for raw wps fig 3 a to 25 after ht treatment fig 3b or 107 after aht treatment fig 3c the observed decrease in the polarity of the surface reflects a decrease in surface free energy associated with the formation of hydrophobic functional groups which is consistent with their neutral non polar or slightly polar nature valsaraj 1994 hydrophobic modification of the wps surface through the aht process enhanced separation of water from the solids surface much easier which significantly increased dewaterability compared to raw wps and ht treated waste the microstructures of the solid samples from wps before and after treatment by ht or aht were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem fig s9 the raw wps had a condensed flaky petrous morphology fig 3d that changed to a loose packing porous structure with spherical particles fig 3e after ht treatment in contrast residual solid wps after aht treatment had an urchin like structure spread over the surface fig 3f wps contains both si and zn fig s10 which likely contributed to this morphology silicate oligomers have been reported to form urchin like agglomerates under alkaline conditions cai et al 2001 and basicity was reported to play an important role in self assembly and crystal growth of urchin like zno structures jiang et al 2009 we also observed a crystalline structure after aht using x ray diffraction xrd analysis fig s11 which was ascribed to alkali serving as a surface modifier for crystal growth sahraneshin et al 2012 the crystalline structure associated with the urchin like microstructures affected the surface tension at the interfaces of liquid and solid phases sadovnikov and gusev 2017 resulting in lower surface energy and hydrophobic surfaces in aht treated wps 3 2 2 conversion of bound to free water increased drainable water volume the temperature increase breaks hydrogen bonds 25 40 kj mol to enable water and alkali to act as solvent and reactant akiya and savage 2002 unterlass 2018 after ht or aht treatment the ratio of free to bound water wf increased from 1 10 g g dry mass for raw wps to 2 98 g g dry mass for the ht process product and 4 57 g g dry mass for the aht process product fig 4 a which increased the free drainable water volume fig s12 aht with the increase in temperature drastically increased the ionic product of water i e kw to act as solvent and boost further chemical reactions unterlass 2018 furthermore the decrease of the negative charge on the treated solids surface table s11 decreased electrostatic repulsion between the particles wang and hu 2013 thus facilitating particles aggregation and conversion of bound water to free water thomas et al 2017 3 2 3 solubilization enhanced dry mass reduction the chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia concentrations in the aqueous phase were significantly increased by 81 and 70 fold respectively after ht treatment and by 112 and 120 fold after aht treatment fig 4b this represents deamination and a significant conversion of the organic matter into the aqueous phase p 0 001 table s12 and table s13 enhanced solubilization of volatile organics was verified by gc ms fig 4c showing that the peak intensities of 2 ethyl 1 hexanol and 1 butanol in the liquid after aht processing were 1 5 fold higher than those in the ht treated sample an increase in wps specific surface area during aht treatment table s14 likely contributed to enhanced solubilization depolymerization likely occurred during aht processing as indicated by the right shift of peaks a d towards a lower molecular weight mw distribution fig 4d the fraction of smaller mw in the liquid 1k dramatically increased after ht 8 2 and aht treatment 17 3 compared to the untreated wps leachate 0 04 fig s13 this is consistent with the observation that the released organics in the aqueous phase were biodegradable fig s14 indicating that the generated wastewater was amenable to biological treatment supplementary information the inorganic metallic components of wps that are important pigment and driers in paint were also released to the aqueous phase through the ht and aht treatment processes and their solubilization was also enhanced under alkaline conditions fig s10 3 2 4 proposed reactions for the alkali assisted hydrothermal process examination of the solid phase at the molecular level was also conducted to advance mechanistic understanding of wps transformations during the aht process we propose a series of reactions involving alkaline hydrolysis dehydration decarboxylation depolymerization and demethylation fig 5 a based on the following results a van krevelen diagram fig 5b reveals that wps was significantly dehydrated during the ht process following the increase of temperature from 140 to 240 c green arrows which caused a significant loss of oxygen and hydrogen from the wps solids wps decarboxylation i e disappearance of the coo band pointed by red arrows was also observed red arrows furthermore demethylation likely due to alkaline hydrolysis of ether bonds increased with increasing naoh dosage blue arrows deg which is an ether used as solvent for paints and varnishes and was abundant in wps table s6 was likely demethylated and degraded to ethylene glycol n butanol 2 butoxyethanol and 2 ethyl 1 hexanol fig 6 these alcohols accumulated after aht at 5 fold higher concentrations than after using ht process without alkali fig 5c furthermore methyl methacrylate the monomer of pmma which is abundant in wps table s7 appeared in the liquid phase after ht fig 5d indicating depolymerization fig 6 methanol was generated when pmma was treated by aht fig 5d since methyl esterified residues undergo saponification overall alkali boosted ether demethylation in the solid phase forming alcohols that facilitated transfer of solid mass into the liquid phase 3 2 5 hydrophobic functional groups increased in the solid phase ftir patterns fig 7 a depict changes in the abundance of functional groups among raw wps ht and aht solid products after ht or aht treatment new peaks corresponding to hydrophobic functional groups pointed by red triangles became apparent compared to raw wps the peaks from the samples after ht or aht treatment became apparent in the 800 700 cm 1 region ch2 and ch bending vibrations and 2970 2910 cm 1 region aliphatic ch2 and ch3 stretching vibrations compared to raw wps which imply a significant hydrophobic character this observation is consistent with previous reports that an increase in alkali c ratio shifted the hydrothermal reaction equilibrium of biomass towards hydrophobic products allcock 2008 furthermore polar functional groups such as ethers 1150 cm 1 alcohols 3400 cm 1 and amines 3350 cm 1 disappeared from the solid surface after hydrothermal treatment in the presence of naoh basic conditions decreased the polarity of solid surfaces and polarized ether bonds making it easier to cleave heterolytically comisar et al 2008 mursito et al 2011 roberts et al 2010 therefore alkali addition enhanced the transfer of organic matter containing carboxyl alcohol and ammonia groups from solid to the aqueous phase fig s15 this explains the observed dry mass loss in the volatile organic fraction after aht processing and the overall conversion to a nonflammable solid residue solid samples from raw wps ht and aht products were characterized by solid state 13c nmr fig 7b and showed two similar trends first hydrophilic functional groups appeared at chemical shifts δ between 113 to 44 and 200 to 161 ppm second hydrophobic functional groups were observed at chemical shifts between 44 to 0 and 161 to 113 ppm liu et al 2015 because these trends the hi hb empirical index of solid hydrophilicity showed a decline from 0 35 raw to 0 34 ht and to 0 28 aht table 2 the aggregation of hydrophobic groups is conducive to decreasing the number of organized water molecules surrounding them and this increase in entropy promotes dewatering this corroborates the vital role of alkali in increasing the number of hydrophobic functional groups on the solids surface thus promoting further dewatering and solid mass reduction 3 3 aht application to other hazardous organic wastes and pilot scale study aht has broad applicability to treat hazardous organic waste streams from dissimilar industries and resulted in significant tmr and dmr for various hazardous organic wastes table s3 including paint sludges from another manufacturer 67 3 1 3 for tmr and 44 5 1 8 for dmr oil sludge 62 9 2 7 and 21 4 4 8 pharmaceutical residues 65 1 1 9 and 54 3 2 8 textile sludge 68 2 1 5 and 50 1 1 2 high boiling residues from distillation tower tmr 75 2 3 6 and concentrated solutions of fluorine industry tmr 85 8 4 7 furthermore no significant weight change of five metal coupons stainless steel titanium nickel alloys zirconium alloy and hastelloy was observed after five cycles of ht or aht process weight change 0 01 table s15 indicating that reactors made by either of these materials should resist corrosion by the hydrothermal chemical reactions thus we scaled up this process using a 50 l pilot scale batch hydrothermal system to treat wps fig s4b using an operating temperature of 220 c with a reaction time of 4 h we achieved tmr of 55 6 6 7 ht and 69 8 3 9 aht dmr of 31 6 5 4 ht and 40 9 3 2 aht table s16 4 conclusions this study addressed significant limitations associated with dewatering of hazardous organic wastes to achieve volume and dry mass reduction we demonstrate that aht can significantly reduce the volume and mass of various hazardous organic wastes converting them to nonflammable hydrophobic solid residues and biodegradable wastewater the released water with a higher ionic product acts as a solvent under hydrothermal conditions to enhance the solubilization of organic matter to aqueous phase this conversion contributes to dry mass reduction accompanied by demethylation of carbon chains alkali triggers solid solid interactions that increase exposure of hydrophobic functional groups to the particle surface forming hydrophobic matter to improve dewatering
