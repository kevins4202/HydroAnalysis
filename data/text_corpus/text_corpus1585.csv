7925,study region abuja federal capital territory fct nigeria study focus rapid population growth has led to significant land use changes with potential negative impacts on groundwater quality however the lack of understanding of hydrogeological settings often due to limited data availability is one of the main obstacles to sound planning in rapidly changing environments to assess the specific groundwater vulnerability to nitrate a drastic lu model was applied combining the land use data from the last 20 years with the intrinsic aquifer vulnerability this study represents the first attempt to assess aquifer vulnerability in the region new hydrogeological insights for the region results show that the abuja fct has been affected by a dramatic change in land use with an increase in urbanized and agricultural areas and may induce nitrate contamination in groundwater currently several wells in the region are showing nitrate concentrations that exceed the statutory limit for drinking purposes the comparison of drastic lu results with nitrate concentrations shows that the highest concentrations are found in urban peri urban areas although fertilizers are generally considered to be the main source of nitrate contamination these results suggest a possible mixed urban and agricultural pollution origin this investigation therefore represents a starting point for future nitrate monitoring assessments and for supporting decision makers with adequate information for urban planning in view of the expected population growth in the area keywords abuja fct groundwater contamination drastic lu model land use changes nitrate contamination 1 introduction the overall impact of climate change on groundwater resources in africa is expected to be relatively smaller than the non climatic drivers such as population and urbanization growth macdonald and calow 2009 carter and parker 2009 macdonald et al 2009 niang et al 2014 and references therein taylor et al 2009 since the 1950s the urban population in africa has experienced a rapid twenty fold increase ranging from 27 million in 1950 to 567 million people in 2020 due to high population growth urban sprawling and the reclassification of rural settlements oecd swac 2020 in nigeria the urban population has experienced a rapid rise over the last fifty years and is expected to grow from the current 170 million people to more than 300 million within the next 30 years bloch et al 2015 as a result in 2050 nigeria will become the country with the second largest urban population after india opoko and oluwatayo 2014 in abuja the capital and eighth most populous city in the country population growth is basically driven by political economic and social drivers a population growth of about 400 between 2000 and 2020 has been reported un desa 2022 clearly such rapid and significant changes cannot fail to have serious repercussions on the natural environment and on the resources that are necessary to support population growth as far as water resources are concerned on a national scale groundwater supplies nearly 73 of the drinking purposes in rural areas and 45 in urban ones japan international cooperation agency 2014 with some cities being totally dependent on groundwater for their water supply consequently increasing pressure is exerted on groundwater resources both in terms of abstraction to supply domestic and industrial needs and in terms of contaminant loads oni et al 2019 in abuja city recent investigations enoguanbhor et al 2019 2020 showed an increase in urban built up areas of nearly 20 times in 40 years from 1 8 in 1987 to 19 in 2017 with the largest observed transition featuring urban growth in place of vegetation a similar trend can be observed in other countries in africa and worldwide de la barrera and henríquez 2017 gao and o neill 2020 hassan 2017 and will have inevitable social and economic consequences potentially contributing to an increase in both water scarcity and water quality degradation abubakar 2014 therefore in view of the ongoing and future changes it is of paramount importance to assess the vulnerability status of groundwater resources i e the potential for seepage and diffusion of contaminants from the soil surface into the groundwater system oroji 2018 and to apply this information to future development plans given the possible co existence of multiple contamination sources and the potential increase in contaminant loads due to population growth the understanding of groundwater intrinsic vulnerability defined by the inherent hydrogeological and geological characteristics that determine the susceptibility of groundwater to contamination by human activities doerfliger et al 1999 barbulescu 2020 is a fundamental prerequisite for more advanced assessments and planning in addition it may serve as a reference for subsequent research targeted to assessing specific aquifer vulnerability many approaches are used for estimating groundwater vulnerability they may be divided into three types i the index overlay aller et al 1987 civita and de maio 1994 doerfliger et al 1999 2021 ii statistical burkart et al 1999 johnson and belitz 2009 teso et al 1996 troiano et al 1997 and iii process based anane et al 2013 connell and van den daele 2003 guekie simo et al 2013 milnes 2011 zhang et al 2013 the choice of method is largely dependent on the scale of the study the type of aquifer data availability and in the case of specific vulnerability assessment the pollutant type the index overlay method is the most widely used due to its simplicity clarity and limited data requirement it integrates several factors that control the migration of contaminants into the saturated zone but its major limitation is the assumption of uniform rates of nominal values over an area therefore results should be used with caution on a local scale especially in areas with high geological variability and complex structures despite this limitation the method represents an excellent basis for providing policy makers with a rapid appraisal of the state of an area among index overlay methods the drastic depth to water net recharge aquifer media soil media topography impact of vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity aller et al 1987 model is the most widely used for groundwater vulnerability mapping and it has been modified by several authors to fit the specific needs of different study areas jimeneze madrid et al 2013 malakootian and nozari 2020 saha and alam 2014 singh et al 2015 zhou et al 2010 lad et al 2019 khosravi et al 2018 the drastic model has previously been applied in groundwater vulnerability assessment in several parts of nigeria oke 2020 ahmed et al 2017 ekwere and edet 2017 george 2021 hamza et al 2017 ibe et al 2001 ojuri and bankole 2013 the present study reports its application to the aquifer in abuja federal capital territory fct i e the administrative region in central nigeria that includes abuja city where there is a lack of hydrogeological and groundwater vulnerability assessments in the study area as in other parts of sub saharan africa groundwater abstraction and the placement of sewage systems are often indiscriminate and unregulated even where responsible government agencies exist leading to the use of poorly structured and poorly maintained facilities and inappropriate siting of anthropogenic sources of contaminations relative to water sources ekwere and edet 2017 this study aims at forestalling the possible negative impact of groundwater deterioration associated with an increase in anthropogenic pressure with special attention to nitrate contamination as one of the main threats in the region dan hassan et al 2012 by mapping out the intrinsic aquifer vulnerability of the abuja fct aquifer and assessing the specific vulnerability associated with land use changes compared to field data on no3 concentrations this valuable but currently lacking information will aid the sustainable development of the area as well as groundwater management policies in one of the fastest growing cities in sub saharan africa abubakar 2014 2 study area abuja fct is located in north central nigeria it approximately lies between longitudes 6 46 and 7 37 e and latitudes 8 21 and 9 18 n it covers an area of approximately 8000 km² with a mean elevation of 476 m above sea level ngdpr 2020 fig 1 geologically the study area belongs to the western province of the basement complex the observed tectonic structures are n s to nne ssw trending resulting from the pan african orogeny which involved the collision between the west african craton and pan african mobile belts alagbe 1979 crystalline and sedimentary rocks extensively outcrop in the study area representing 85 and 15 respectively these rocks can be divided into four main groups dada 2008 the migmatite gneiss units pan african to eburnean of the crystalline basement constitute the most widespread rock type in the area the metasediments upper proterozoic consist of amphibolite schist phyllites quartzites and serpentinites they have low grade metasediment dominated belts n s trending the older granites late proterozoic are the deep seated usually concordant or semi concordant granites of the basement complex the sedimentary units are deposited in the bida basin upper cretaceous a sequence of alluvial to marine deposits ranging from clay to gravel rahaman et al 2019 the sedimentary deposits directly covering the basement units filled the tectonically controlled bida basin the thickness of this unit ranges between 900 and 2000 m and it extensively outcrops in the sw section of the study area in addition alluvial deposits are located along the river courses they are made up of heterometric loss deposits from clay to gravel with a thickness that depends on the depositional capability of each river in tropical africa the hydrogeological conceptual model is usually schematically divided into two main layers a weathered regolith layer and the underlying crystalline bedrock chilton and foster 1995 bianchi et al 2020 proposed a more detailed hydrogeological model composed of five layers defined as follows 1 residual soil this layer often comprises ferralitic soils with laterite pisoliths with a thickness of a few meters even though the presence of laterite may enhance its permeability the overall permeability of this layer is low due to the high clay content 2 upper saprolite this layer is rich in secondary clay minerals with a thickness ranging from a few to tens of meters its permeability is very low hence this layer is not suitable for groundwater abstraction 3 lower saprolite this layer is similar to the upper saprolite but with a higher percentage of primary minerals in direct relationship with its depth its permeability also increases with depth reaching its maximum values at the base of the lower saprolite layer 4 saprock this is a fractured layer with a thickness of up to ten meters covering the fresh rock basement this layer is characterized by a good permeability decreasing with depth toward the unfractured basement 5 fresh rock low fractured rocks the permeability of this layer is assumed to be mainly representative of the rock matrix the main aquifer layers in the area are the lower saprolite layer and the underlying saprock fig 2 which have sufficient permeability to support successful boreholes for small scale village water supply the groundwater discharge direction of the regolith aquifer is mainly from ne to sw indicating that the aquifer is strictly influenced by its surface morphology groundwater flows toward gaining streams supporting the base flow of the rivers the aquifer hosted in the fresh rock basement is characterized by secondary permeability depending on the frequency and magnitude of rocks fractures this aquifer is usually characterized by low productivity there is no large difference on the regolith derived from the different crystalline units however some evidence should be considered weathered crystalline and coarse grain rocks such as gneiss and migmatite evolved in sandy deposits argillaceous meta sediment rocks more likely weather into clayey and low permeability units the thickness of the regolith layer is highly variable within the basin ranging up to tens of meters dan hassan 2015 the shallow aquifers are mainly exploited by rural communities using hand dug wells with a depth of approximately 10 m the study area lies in the tropical sudan savannah region of nigeria the vegetation is forest and savannah mostly comprised of woody plants agbelade et al 2017 the temperature is usually between 18 c and 37 c the harmattan wind a dust laden continental tropical air mass from the sahara desert prevails throughout the period the rainy season is between april and october with most of the precipitation occurring in august or september jimoh and wojuola 2009 the mean annual precipitation in the area is approximately 1200 mm fct handbook 1994 despite the amount of annual precipitation the tropical temperatures are reflected in high evapotranspiration rates which account for the major water loss the mean recharge rate estimated in nigeria is lower than 15 of the total rainfall japan international cooperation agency 2014 with small differences in each catchment ashaolu et al 2020 3 materials and methods 3 1 vulnerability maps the drastic index overlay model was used to define the most vulnerable zones in abuja fct this model is a probabilistic representation of nominal values of surface and subsurface features that control the aquifer vulnerability the drastic index model is based on seven parameters which indicate possible groundwater contamination aller et al 1987 depth to groundwater d net recharge r aquifer media a soil media s the impact of vadose zone i and hydraulic conductivity c in addition the land use maps from 2000 and 2020 were included in the elaboration of drastic lu maps these maps reflect the specific vulnerability to nitrates according to the different land uses and the variation of the anthropic pressure over the last 20 years all the drastic layers have been categorized with different rates and weight values the data used and their references are listed in table 1 discrete data usually have a scattered distribution additionally environmental data usually show a higher degree of similarity and correlation when the observation points are close together than when they are far apart showing both random and regional trend distributions we applied the ordinary kriging geostatistical technique in arcgis 10 8 1 to assess the spatial variability of each variable a variogram was elaborated to estimate the parameter distributions between the observation points the final vulnerability index of the drastic model consists of a linear combination of the seven parameters each multiplied by a corresponding weight in the elaboration of the specific vulnerability maps the land use layer lu was included in the elaboration vulnerability drastic d w d r r w r r a w a r s w s r t w t r i w i r c w c r lu w lu r where d r a s t i and c are the abbreviations of the seven hydrogeological parameters lu corresponds to the land use map r and w define parameters rating and weight respectively the chosen rates and weight for each parameter are mostly based on aller et al 1987 the detailed description of each layer is reported below 3 1 1 depth to static water level d d is the depth to static water level which describes the thickness of the unsaturated zone that a pollutant has to travel through to reach the water table from the surface it is the vertical distance from the ground surface to the saturated zone of the phreatic aquifer the depth to ground water has direct impacts on the degree of attenuation of the contaminant the aquifer vulnerability has an inverse relationship with depth to static water level d was calculated as the difference between the surface elevation and the groundwater level measured in 141 wells locations in fig s1 the available data were previously explored in a q q plot diagram to identify and discard the points that did not belong to the investigated aquifer 3 1 2 net recharge r the net recharge r is the quantity of water that infiltrates from the surface toward the aquifer r is just a fraction of the rainfall p as most of the water is lost due to the evapotranspiration et and surface runoff sr processes r p et sr long term climatic data were acquired from the national centers for environmental prediction climate forecast system reanalysis 2021 provides data on rainfall and temperature between 1979 and 2013 at a horizontal resolution of 0 5 twenty five weather points covering the abuja fct area were used in this study fig s2 cumulate p and the mean temperature tm were calculated for each weather point once a year and then spatialized using ordinary kriging the yearly et was calculated by applying the turc s formula et 0 0133 t m t m 15 r s 50 where rs is the incoming shortwave solar radiation using the raster calculator tool direct quantification of the surface runoff was not possible due to the lack of reliable hydrographic data within the study area the mean sr was then estimated according to the runoff rate sr p 100 reported by japan international cooperation agency 2014 for the abuja fct catchment the mean r was then calculated from the yearly r values r is responsible for contaminant conveyance to the aquifer and its lateral movements areas with higher r are expected to be more vulnerable 3 1 3 aquifer media a aquifer media refers to the structural texture of consolidated or unconsolidated rock materials that serve as aquifer the aquifer media information was extracted from a geological map of abuja fct despite the limited differences that are expected to be inside the regolith deposits we decided to distinguish the aquifer media according to the underlying parental material the similar ratings between the crystalline rocks demonstrate these limited differences 3 1 4 soil media s this is defined as the uppermost portion of the vadose zone characterized by significant biological activity anane et al 2013 it has the potential to adsorb and attenuate surface and near surface derived pollutants the soil media was defined from the soil map of nigeria it was reclassified and rated into two subclasses silt loam and silt clay 3 1 5 topographic map t topographic refers to the slope and slope variability of the land surface anane et al 2013 and it affects the velocity of surface runoff this map was realized from the data of the shuttle radar topography mission srtm the topography of the study area was classified into four subclasses 3 1 6 impact of vadose zone i the vadose zone is defined as the zone above the water table and is generally unsaturated or discontinuously saturated aller et al 1987 the vadose zone media and its permeability determine the nature of attenuation processes between the topsoil and the water table the layer was computed using the geologic map of the area 3 1 7 hydraulic conductivity c hydraulic conductivity refers to the ability of an aquifer to transmit water and control the rate of groundwater flow it determines the migration velocity of pollutants thereby controlling residence time and attenuation potential high conductivity values will be associated with higher vulnerability the hydraulic conductivity map was realized using the permeability data obtained by pumping tests performed on the same wells used for the elaboration of the d layer rural water supply program china fgn 2006 fig s1 discrete data were interpolated in arcgis 10 8 1 to create the layer 3 1 8 land use lu maps representing the land use in 2000 fig 3a and in 2020 fig 3b were included in the elaboration in order to evaluate the variation of the anthropic pressure in the study area the maps provide information of the extension of built up areas cultivated lands and natural areas forest and grassland with a cell resolution of 30 m higher details of cultivations or type of land properties e g residential commercial are not currently available the increase of the population between 2000 and 2020 is directly reflected in the increase of the built up areas from 2 to 7 table 2 at the same time the higher food demand also drives the spread of cultivated lands which increased from 19 to 47 of the study area table 2 the urban and agricultural expansion mainly affected the grassland areas 30 whereas the extension of forest cover seems to be almost stable 3 2 field activities between march and april 2021 46 groundwater samples were collected in abuja fct fig s3 detail in table s1 from private and public boreholes and hand dug wells ph and electrical conductivity with automatic compensation to 25 c were measured in the field using portable probes hanna equipment h198191 chemical analyses were performed at the centre national de l energie des sciences et des techniques nuclaires cnesten in rabat morocco major elements were analyzed by ion chromatography on unacidified hco3 cl no3 and so4 2 and acidified na k mg2 and ca2 samples all samples were filtered in the field using 0 45 µm minisart sterile cellulose acetate membrane filters and then an aliquot was acidified 1 with ultra pure merck hno3 all reported water analyses show charge balances of less than 5 4 results 4 1 drastic and drastic lu maps the rates and weights assigned to each parameter are reported in table 3 the rates vary from 1 to 10 while the weights range from 1 to 5 with higher values describing greater susceptibility to pollution except for values of depth to water table and topography which have an inverse relationship with vulnerability the depths to groundwater in the study area range between 5 5 and 12 5 m they are grouped into three classes 5 5 7 5 m 7 5 10 m and 10 0 12 5 m table 3 the lowest depth range is mainly defined around bwari in the central part of the municipal council area and southern parts of abaji and kwali fig 4a the principal source of groundwater recharge is the local precipitation which infiltrates into the ground and percolates toward the water table the recharge also plays an important role in the nitrate contamination process being the main vehicle for leaching and transport of contaminants toward the aquifer the estimated mean recharge was grouped into five 5 classes table 3 the highest recharge values were defined in the bwari and municipal area council the estimated recharge progressively decreases moving toward south west the lowest recharge values were expected around the kwali and abaji areas fig 4b the regolith aquifer is mostly constituted by weathered deposits of migmatite gneiss and schist and metasediments covering more than 80 of the study area a very limited section 5 corresponds to the granitic units in the western sector of bwari and municipal at the niger state border rates 3 and 4 were respectively assigned to the regolith deriving from these units which are characterized by similar hydrogeological features fig 4c sedimentary units are mostly present in southwestern parts of abaji kwali and kuje covering 12 of the study area a higher rate was assigned to these units 6 the soil may have a noteworthy impact on the ability of pollutants to migrate toward the vadose zone due to attenuation filtration biodegradation sorption and volatilization processes the predominant soil type in the area is silty clay covering 80 and was thus assigned the rating of 3 fig 4d it has a very high attenuation ability approximately 20 of the study area is covered by silty loam soil type with a rating of 4 the topography represented in the study area was classified into three classes fig 4e the topography map indicates that the slope distribution of the study area is steep in the eastern parts of the study area along the mountain range and gentler along the western parts the impact of the vadose zone is an important variable in the estimation of vulnerability the data used to define the impact of vadose is the same as that used for the aquifer media crystalline basement rocks comprising of migmatites were assigned a rating of 3 schist and meta sediments were assigned a rating of 4 and granite was assigned a rating of 5 sandstone and river alluvium deposits were assigned a rating of 6 fig 4f hydraulic conductivity determines the migration velocity of pollutants and hence the residence time and attenuation potential high conductivity values will be associated with higher contamination risk the hydraulic conductivity in the study area was grouped into four classes fig 4g the permeability values range between 0 57 and 2 16 m d in agreement with the interval reported in jimoh and wojuola 2009 the narrow range of the hydraulic conductivity values reflects the small variability of the characteristics of the saprolite deposits the seven layers were combined to form the drastic intrinsic vulnerability model of the abuja fct area the vulnerability values range between 77 and 134 fig 5 the five vulnerability classes very low low medium high and very high are defined on the basis of the geometrical interval classification on arcgis based on this classification the bwari abuja municipal and the southwestern parts of abaji are characterized by very high to high vulnerability land use was considered to be closely related to the nitrate specific vulnerability map and therefore the highest weight 5 was assigned to this layer within this layer three main groups were defined and rated natural areas forest grassland and wetland characterized by a low natural load of nitrate rate 1 cultivated areas rate 5 in the 2000 land use map where additional inputs of nitrate are related to the fertilization of the crops and urbanized areas rate 9 where the main sources of nitrate are the untreated waste waters and the open defecation table 3 differently from previous groundwater vulnerability assessments developed in other countries e g busico et al 2017b persaud and levison 2021 alam et al 2014 stigter et al 2005 we proposed a smaller rating of the agricultural areas in fact the available data on the fertilizer consumption world bank 2022 highlight a lower use of fertilizers in nigeria compared to other areas of africa or in different continents table 4 looking in detail at the fertilizer consumption trend table s2 a significant increase in fertilization is visible between 2000 5 3 kg ha of arable land and 2018 19 7 kg ha of arable land different rates were assigned to the cultivated lands in 2000 rate 5 and 2020 rate 6 in order to account for this increase in fertilizer use the resulting drastic lu maps of 2000 and 2020 are reported in fig 6a and b 4 2 hydrogeochemistry the samples collected during the 2021 campaign show a dominance of ca mg hco3 facies fig s4 a synthesis of the hydrochemical results for the groundwater samples is reported in table 5 nitrate concentrations in groundwater range from 0 2 to 294 5 mg l average 56 2 mg l standard deviation 77 4 n 39 with 33 of the wells n 15 exceeding the statutory limit for drinking water 50 mg l world health organization 2017 5 discussion basement aquifers are generally classified as a two layer system comprising of the fractured bedrock overlain by a weathered regolith sequence bianchi et al 2020 the focus of the present study is that the base of the regolith is the more productive layer more exploited by the population the drastic map fig 5 can only provide a physically based characterization of the aquifer and its intrinsic capacity to be contaminated the simplified model reported in fig 7a highlights the contamination pathways in the natural environment according to the hydrogeological settings described in the study area section additionally the comparison between land use maps of abuja fct in 2000 and 2020 fig 6a and b allows us to constrain the specific vulnerability to nitrate contamination induced by both agricultural and domestic activities the rapid population expansion registered in nigeria reflects both the urban sprawling of the urban settlements and the expansion of small villages throughout the region fig 3 in most cases the fast urbanization is not associated with the realization of adequate systems for the collection and treatment of liquid and solid waste which are therefore often dispersed in the natural environment aniekwe and igu 2019 in addition excavations of the ground surface may remove the lower permeability soil layer reducing the depth to groundwater d layer and eventually increasing the intrinsic vulnerability of the aquifer this effect may also be indirectly induced by the installation of sewage systems which may accidentally act as a source of nitrate being located close to the saturated portion of the aquifer fig 7b at the same time the increased extension of urbanized areas reduces the possibility of water infiltration and therefore the local net recharge consequently the higher amount of surface runoff may be a new pathway for contamination of surface waters in the absence of adequate collection and treatment systems fig 7b additional fast pathways for local groundwater contamination may also be the wells themselves like groundwater from shallow permeable lenses polluted surface waters may in fact be conveyed in the borehole and thus eventually directly reach the water table more detailed information on the human activities in urban areas may allow for a more accurate estimation of the pollution loads as tested by dumedah et al 2021 the aforementioned impacts of land use changes on aquifer vulnerability are already absorbable from the specific vulnerability analyses in the drastic lu 2020 map very low to low vulnerability classes are attributed to parts of abaji kwali gwagwalada and kuje these areas were mainly covered by grasslands in 2000 but over the years they have been converted to agricultural lands this change affects the vulnerability to nitrate of all agricultural areas due to both plowing which may improve soil permeability and dispersion of fertilizers fig 7c although the current impact of fertilization seems to be moderate world bank 2022 the rapid increase observed over the last 20 years 400 and the ongoing development of the fertilizer industry to cope with the global food crisis should be taken into account in future regional planning a comparison with the current state of nitrate contamination in groundwater and the 2020 drastic lu is shown in fig 8 at present 53 of the sampled wells with nitrate concentration exceeding the statutory limits for drinking water 50 mg l world health organization 2017 are located in very high vulnerable zones and 13 in high vulnerable zones taking into account the 2020 land use map there is a strong relationship between no3 and urban peri urban areas where 87 of wells with nitrate concentration exceeding the statutory limits for drinking water are located contrary to the more widespread hypothesis that nitrate contamination is essentially associated with agricultural practices this can be induced by several processes i local impact of point source pollution of domestic e g informal settlements open defecation or industrial origin ii nitrogen legacy associated to previous land use e g urban settlements erected on land previously used for agricultural purposes iii a mix of both results of the present study show that the contaminated groundwater samples located in the medium low vulnerability areas are generally located near small villages suggesting the possible contribution of domestic activities rather than the sole impact of the widespread use of fertilizers regardless of the cause which is the subject of an ongoing study on groundwater geochemistry focused on environmental isotopes δ2hh2o δ18oh2o δ15nno3 δ18ono3 this process cannot be underestimated especially if the wells are used for drinking consumption only 20 of the study area is equipped with improved domestic water supply jimoh and wojuola 2009 as for the wells located in areas classified as medium to high vulnerability but not exceeding the nitrate drinking water limits it will be crucial to identify the possible nitrate sources in order to prevent future higher contamination in these vulnerable areas the possible occurrence of denitrification in these areas therefore resulting in low nitrate concentrations will be verified with future studies of nitrate isotopes δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 validating the vulnerability assessment with land use change and nitrate concentration made it possible to highlight how in a relatively vulnerable context from a geological point of view the impact of anthropogenic activities especially in view of the predicted population growth may significantly alter aquifer vulnerability this may lead to possible dangerous effects on the environment and population moreover the latter is not well prepared to manage possible restrictions on groundwater use the primary source for domestic and agricultural purposes therefore the results of the present study represent an important starting point for raising awareness of the need for environmental planning in the region and for coping with environmental changes in a timely manner the paucity of hydrogeochemical hydrogeological and detailed land use data for the study area is a great limitation for developing future scenarios on groundwater contamination therefore a priority for local water managers should be to set up a monitoring network to track the evolution of chemical water properties this would allow them to balance the need to ensure that the growing population of the region will meet the goals living in sustainable urban settlements sdg 11 united nations high commissioner for refugees 2017 achieving zero hunger sdg 2 and having access to safe drinking water sdg 6 6 conclusions like many other countries worldwide nigeria is experiencing rapid population growth with serious repercussions on groundwater quality and population wellbeing the population increase led to the rapid expansion of previously existing urban settlements and to the creation of new ones the increase in food demand boosted the conversion of grassland into cultivated areas both land use changes potentially exacerbate groundwater quality and quantity issues in the region in this context the drastic model was applied to assess the intrinsic vulnerability of abuja fct the results were integrated with the representation of land use in 2000 and 2020 in order to define the specific vulnerability to nitrate and to map its variation over the last 20 years a comparison with the results of a hydrogeochemical assessment carried out in 2020 highlighted that most of the contaminated waters were collected in urbanized areas both in major cities as well as in small villages although the possible mixing with agriculturally contaminated waters is under investigation results provide an important basis to support the sustainable development of the region providing information to managers and policy makers relative to the current state of aquifer vulnerability and insights into possible contamination drivers as previously mentioned the paucity of data does not allow for a complete assessment but there are some valuable results that can respond to the current needs of the local population as highlighted by re et al 2018 and by re et al 2022 it is often the case that while the scientific community is focused on providing the most complete information based on long term monitoring and assessments business as usual actions often associated to population growth water demand increase and recurrent droughts extreme events keep degrading the studied system therefore preliminary results represent a valuable support to inform local populations about the quality of local water resources and policy makers about the priority actions to undertake future research development will focus on specific vulnerability mapping in the region and on the identification of the main sources of nitrate pollution using a multi tracer approach and include more specific details of the urban activities in order to reduce the uncertainty about specific vulnerability we will perform calibration and validation of the rates and weights of the drastic lu once the extensive monitoring that is currently underway has finished and we have a robust monitoring dataset with more detailed information about land use including agricultural and human activities finally besides its impact on intrinsic groundwater vulnerability land use change should also be addressed in terms of internal migrations from rural to urban areas this is common practice in many areas worldwide international organization for migration 2016 as cities are generally considered more attractive due to a broader job market as a result of these internal migrations it is not only rural lands that are abandoned but cities get overcrowded eventually exacerbating ongoing urban sprawling and there is even more pressure on ground water resources and competition on their use kammoun et al 2018 limited access to safe water supply may increase conflicts due to the vertical among different uses e g domestic industrial and agricultural and horizontal among households sharing the same water sources competition on water use sunkari et al 2021 for this reason it is of paramount importance to integrate both intrinsic and specific vulnerability mapping in regional planning as a useful tool to support long term groundwater protection in areas subject to rapid population growth credit authorship contribution statement mary etuk conceptualization

7925,study region abuja federal capital territory fct nigeria study focus rapid population growth has led to significant land use changes with potential negative impacts on groundwater quality however the lack of understanding of hydrogeological settings often due to limited data availability is one of the main obstacles to sound planning in rapidly changing environments to assess the specific groundwater vulnerability to nitrate a drastic lu model was applied combining the land use data from the last 20 years with the intrinsic aquifer vulnerability this study represents the first attempt to assess aquifer vulnerability in the region new hydrogeological insights for the region results show that the abuja fct has been affected by a dramatic change in land use with an increase in urbanized and agricultural areas and may induce nitrate contamination in groundwater currently several wells in the region are showing nitrate concentrations that exceed the statutory limit for drinking purposes the comparison of drastic lu results with nitrate concentrations shows that the highest concentrations are found in urban peri urban areas although fertilizers are generally considered to be the main source of nitrate contamination these results suggest a possible mixed urban and agricultural pollution origin this investigation therefore represents a starting point for future nitrate monitoring assessments and for supporting decision makers with adequate information for urban planning in view of the expected population growth in the area keywords abuja fct groundwater contamination drastic lu model land use changes nitrate contamination 1 introduction the overall impact of climate change on groundwater resources in africa is expected to be relatively smaller than the non climatic drivers such as population and urbanization growth macdonald and calow 2009 carter and parker 2009 macdonald et al 2009 niang et al 2014 and references therein taylor et al 2009 since the 1950s the urban population in africa has experienced a rapid twenty fold increase ranging from 27 million in 1950 to 567 million people in 2020 due to high population growth urban sprawling and the reclassification of rural settlements oecd swac 2020 in nigeria the urban population has experienced a rapid rise over the last fifty years and is expected to grow from the current 170 million people to more than 300 million within the next 30 years bloch et al 2015 as a result in 2050 nigeria will become the country with the second largest urban population after india opoko and oluwatayo 2014 in abuja the capital and eighth most populous city in the country population growth is basically driven by political economic and social drivers a population growth of about 400 between 2000 and 2020 has been reported un desa 2022 clearly such rapid and significant changes cannot fail to have serious repercussions on the natural environment and on the resources that are necessary to support population growth as far as water resources are concerned on a national scale groundwater supplies nearly 73 of the drinking purposes in rural areas and 45 in urban ones japan international cooperation agency 2014 with some cities being totally dependent on groundwater for their water supply consequently increasing pressure is exerted on groundwater resources both in terms of abstraction to supply domestic and industrial needs and in terms of contaminant loads oni et al 2019 in abuja city recent investigations enoguanbhor et al 2019 2020 showed an increase in urban built up areas of nearly 20 times in 40 years from 1 8 in 1987 to 19 in 2017 with the largest observed transition featuring urban growth in place of vegetation a similar trend can be observed in other countries in africa and worldwide de la barrera and henríquez 2017 gao and o neill 2020 hassan 2017 and will have inevitable social and economic consequences potentially contributing to an increase in both water scarcity and water quality degradation abubakar 2014 therefore in view of the ongoing and future changes it is of paramount importance to assess the vulnerability status of groundwater resources i e the potential for seepage and diffusion of contaminants from the soil surface into the groundwater system oroji 2018 and to apply this information to future development plans given the possible co existence of multiple contamination sources and the potential increase in contaminant loads due to population growth the understanding of groundwater intrinsic vulnerability defined by the inherent hydrogeological and geological characteristics that determine the susceptibility of groundwater to contamination by human activities doerfliger et al 1999 barbulescu 2020 is a fundamental prerequisite for more advanced assessments and planning in addition it may serve as a reference for subsequent research targeted to assessing specific aquifer vulnerability many approaches are used for estimating groundwater vulnerability they may be divided into three types i the index overlay aller et al 1987 civita and de maio 1994 doerfliger et al 1999 2021 ii statistical burkart et al 1999 johnson and belitz 2009 teso et al 1996 troiano et al 1997 and iii process based anane et al 2013 connell and van den daele 2003 guekie simo et al 2013 milnes 2011 zhang et al 2013 the choice of method is largely dependent on the scale of the study the type of aquifer data availability and in the case of specific vulnerability assessment the pollutant type the index overlay method is the most widely used due to its simplicity clarity and limited data requirement it integrates several factors that control the migration of contaminants into the saturated zone but its major limitation is the assumption of uniform rates of nominal values over an area therefore results should be used with caution on a local scale especially in areas with high geological variability and complex structures despite this limitation the method represents an excellent basis for providing policy makers with a rapid appraisal of the state of an area among index overlay methods the drastic depth to water net recharge aquifer media soil media topography impact of vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity aller et al 1987 model is the most widely used for groundwater vulnerability mapping and it has been modified by several authors to fit the specific needs of different study areas jimeneze madrid et al 2013 malakootian and nozari 2020 saha and alam 2014 singh et al 2015 zhou et al 2010 lad et al 2019 khosravi et al 2018 the drastic model has previously been applied in groundwater vulnerability assessment in several parts of nigeria oke 2020 ahmed et al 2017 ekwere and edet 2017 george 2021 hamza et al 2017 ibe et al 2001 ojuri and bankole 2013 the present study reports its application to the aquifer in abuja federal capital territory fct i e the administrative region in central nigeria that includes abuja city where there is a lack of hydrogeological and groundwater vulnerability assessments in the study area as in other parts of sub saharan africa groundwater abstraction and the placement of sewage systems are often indiscriminate and unregulated even where responsible government agencies exist leading to the use of poorly structured and poorly maintained facilities and inappropriate siting of anthropogenic sources of contaminations relative to water sources ekwere and edet 2017 this study aims at forestalling the possible negative impact of groundwater deterioration associated with an increase in anthropogenic pressure with special attention to nitrate contamination as one of the main threats in the region dan hassan et al 2012 by mapping out the intrinsic aquifer vulnerability of the abuja fct aquifer and assessing the specific vulnerability associated with land use changes compared to field data on no3 concentrations this valuable but currently lacking information will aid the sustainable development of the area as well as groundwater management policies in one of the fastest growing cities in sub saharan africa abubakar 2014 2 study area abuja fct is located in north central nigeria it approximately lies between longitudes 6 46 and 7 37 e and latitudes 8 21 and 9 18 n it covers an area of approximately 8000 km² with a mean elevation of 476 m above sea level ngdpr 2020 fig 1 geologically the study area belongs to the western province of the basement complex the observed tectonic structures are n s to nne ssw trending resulting from the pan african orogeny which involved the collision between the west african craton and pan african mobile belts alagbe 1979 crystalline and sedimentary rocks extensively outcrop in the study area representing 85 and 15 respectively these rocks can be divided into four main groups dada 2008 the migmatite gneiss units pan african to eburnean of the crystalline basement constitute the most widespread rock type in the area the metasediments upper proterozoic consist of amphibolite schist phyllites quartzites and serpentinites they have low grade metasediment dominated belts n s trending the older granites late proterozoic are the deep seated usually concordant or semi concordant granites of the basement complex the sedimentary units are deposited in the bida basin upper cretaceous a sequence of alluvial to marine deposits ranging from clay to gravel rahaman et al 2019 the sedimentary deposits directly covering the basement units filled the tectonically controlled bida basin the thickness of this unit ranges between 900 and 2000 m and it extensively outcrops in the sw section of the study area in addition alluvial deposits are located along the river courses they are made up of heterometric loss deposits from clay to gravel with a thickness that depends on the depositional capability of each river in tropical africa the hydrogeological conceptual model is usually schematically divided into two main layers a weathered regolith layer and the underlying crystalline bedrock chilton and foster 1995 bianchi et al 2020 proposed a more detailed hydrogeological model composed of five layers defined as follows 1 residual soil this layer often comprises ferralitic soils with laterite pisoliths with a thickness of a few meters even though the presence of laterite may enhance its permeability the overall permeability of this layer is low due to the high clay content 2 upper saprolite this layer is rich in secondary clay minerals with a thickness ranging from a few to tens of meters its permeability is very low hence this layer is not suitable for groundwater abstraction 3 lower saprolite this layer is similar to the upper saprolite but with a higher percentage of primary minerals in direct relationship with its depth its permeability also increases with depth reaching its maximum values at the base of the lower saprolite layer 4 saprock this is a fractured layer with a thickness of up to ten meters covering the fresh rock basement this layer is characterized by a good permeability decreasing with depth toward the unfractured basement 5 fresh rock low fractured rocks the permeability of this layer is assumed to be mainly representative of the rock matrix the main aquifer layers in the area are the lower saprolite layer and the underlying saprock fig 2 which have sufficient permeability to support successful boreholes for small scale village water supply the groundwater discharge direction of the regolith aquifer is mainly from ne to sw indicating that the aquifer is strictly influenced by its surface morphology groundwater flows toward gaining streams supporting the base flow of the rivers the aquifer hosted in the fresh rock basement is characterized by secondary permeability depending on the frequency and magnitude of rocks fractures this aquifer is usually characterized by low productivity there is no large difference on the regolith derived from the different crystalline units however some evidence should be considered weathered crystalline and coarse grain rocks such as gneiss and migmatite evolved in sandy deposits argillaceous meta sediment rocks more likely weather into clayey and low permeability units the thickness of the regolith layer is highly variable within the basin ranging up to tens of meters dan hassan 2015 the shallow aquifers are mainly exploited by rural communities using hand dug wells with a depth of approximately 10 m the study area lies in the tropical sudan savannah region of nigeria the vegetation is forest and savannah mostly comprised of woody plants agbelade et al 2017 the temperature is usually between 18 c and 37 c the harmattan wind a dust laden continental tropical air mass from the sahara desert prevails throughout the period the rainy season is between april and october with most of the precipitation occurring in august or september jimoh and wojuola 2009 the mean annual precipitation in the area is approximately 1200 mm fct handbook 1994 despite the amount of annual precipitation the tropical temperatures are reflected in high evapotranspiration rates which account for the major water loss the mean recharge rate estimated in nigeria is lower than 15 of the total rainfall japan international cooperation agency 2014 with small differences in each catchment ashaolu et al 2020 3 materials and methods 3 1 vulnerability maps the drastic index overlay model was used to define the most vulnerable zones in abuja fct this model is a probabilistic representation of nominal values of surface and subsurface features that control the aquifer vulnerability the drastic index model is based on seven parameters which indicate possible groundwater contamination aller et al 1987 depth to groundwater d net recharge r aquifer media a soil media s the impact of vadose zone i and hydraulic conductivity c in addition the land use maps from 2000 and 2020 were included in the elaboration of drastic lu maps these maps reflect the specific vulnerability to nitrates according to the different land uses and the variation of the anthropic pressure over the last 20 years all the drastic layers have been categorized with different rates and weight values the data used and their references are listed in table 1 discrete data usually have a scattered distribution additionally environmental data usually show a higher degree of similarity and correlation when the observation points are close together than when they are far apart showing both random and regional trend distributions we applied the ordinary kriging geostatistical technique in arcgis 10 8 1 to assess the spatial variability of each variable a variogram was elaborated to estimate the parameter distributions between the observation points the final vulnerability index of the drastic model consists of a linear combination of the seven parameters each multiplied by a corresponding weight in the elaboration of the specific vulnerability maps the land use layer lu was included in the elaboration vulnerability drastic d w d r r w r r a w a r s w s r t w t r i w i r c w c r lu w lu r where d r a s t i and c are the abbreviations of the seven hydrogeological parameters lu corresponds to the land use map r and w define parameters rating and weight respectively the chosen rates and weight for each parameter are mostly based on aller et al 1987 the detailed description of each layer is reported below 3 1 1 depth to static water level d d is the depth to static water level which describes the thickness of the unsaturated zone that a pollutant has to travel through to reach the water table from the surface it is the vertical distance from the ground surface to the saturated zone of the phreatic aquifer the depth to ground water has direct impacts on the degree of attenuation of the contaminant the aquifer vulnerability has an inverse relationship with depth to static water level d was calculated as the difference between the surface elevation and the groundwater level measured in 141 wells locations in fig s1 the available data were previously explored in a q q plot diagram to identify and discard the points that did not belong to the investigated aquifer 3 1 2 net recharge r the net recharge r is the quantity of water that infiltrates from the surface toward the aquifer r is just a fraction of the rainfall p as most of the water is lost due to the evapotranspiration et and surface runoff sr processes r p et sr long term climatic data were acquired from the national centers for environmental prediction climate forecast system reanalysis 2021 provides data on rainfall and temperature between 1979 and 2013 at a horizontal resolution of 0 5 twenty five weather points covering the abuja fct area were used in this study fig s2 cumulate p and the mean temperature tm were calculated for each weather point once a year and then spatialized using ordinary kriging the yearly et was calculated by applying the turc s formula et 0 0133 t m t m 15 r s 50 where rs is the incoming shortwave solar radiation using the raster calculator tool direct quantification of the surface runoff was not possible due to the lack of reliable hydrographic data within the study area the mean sr was then estimated according to the runoff rate sr p 100 reported by japan international cooperation agency 2014 for the abuja fct catchment the mean r was then calculated from the yearly r values r is responsible for contaminant conveyance to the aquifer and its lateral movements areas with higher r are expected to be more vulnerable 3 1 3 aquifer media a aquifer media refers to the structural texture of consolidated or unconsolidated rock materials that serve as aquifer the aquifer media information was extracted from a geological map of abuja fct despite the limited differences that are expected to be inside the regolith deposits we decided to distinguish the aquifer media according to the underlying parental material the similar ratings between the crystalline rocks demonstrate these limited differences 3 1 4 soil media s this is defined as the uppermost portion of the vadose zone characterized by significant biological activity anane et al 2013 it has the potential to adsorb and attenuate surface and near surface derived pollutants the soil media was defined from the soil map of nigeria it was reclassified and rated into two subclasses silt loam and silt clay 3 1 5 topographic map t topographic refers to the slope and slope variability of the land surface anane et al 2013 and it affects the velocity of surface runoff this map was realized from the data of the shuttle radar topography mission srtm the topography of the study area was classified into four subclasses 3 1 6 impact of vadose zone i the vadose zone is defined as the zone above the water table and is generally unsaturated or discontinuously saturated aller et al 1987 the vadose zone media and its permeability determine the nature of attenuation processes between the topsoil and the water table the layer was computed using the geologic map of the area 3 1 7 hydraulic conductivity c hydraulic conductivity refers to the ability of an aquifer to transmit water and control the rate of groundwater flow it determines the migration velocity of pollutants thereby controlling residence time and attenuation potential high conductivity values will be associated with higher vulnerability the hydraulic conductivity map was realized using the permeability data obtained by pumping tests performed on the same wells used for the elaboration of the d layer rural water supply program china fgn 2006 fig s1 discrete data were interpolated in arcgis 10 8 1 to create the layer 3 1 8 land use lu maps representing the land use in 2000 fig 3a and in 2020 fig 3b were included in the elaboration in order to evaluate the variation of the anthropic pressure in the study area the maps provide information of the extension of built up areas cultivated lands and natural areas forest and grassland with a cell resolution of 30 m higher details of cultivations or type of land properties e g residential commercial are not currently available the increase of the population between 2000 and 2020 is directly reflected in the increase of the built up areas from 2 to 7 table 2 at the same time the higher food demand also drives the spread of cultivated lands which increased from 19 to 47 of the study area table 2 the urban and agricultural expansion mainly affected the grassland areas 30 whereas the extension of forest cover seems to be almost stable 3 2 field activities between march and april 2021 46 groundwater samples were collected in abuja fct fig s3 detail in table s1 from private and public boreholes and hand dug wells ph and electrical conductivity with automatic compensation to 25 c were measured in the field using portable probes hanna equipment h198191 chemical analyses were performed at the centre national de l energie des sciences et des techniques nuclaires cnesten in rabat morocco major elements were analyzed by ion chromatography on unacidified hco3 cl no3 and so4 2 and acidified na k mg2 and ca2 samples all samples were filtered in the field using 0 45 µm minisart sterile cellulose acetate membrane filters and then an aliquot was acidified 1 with ultra pure merck hno3 all reported water analyses show charge balances of less than 5 4 results 4 1 drastic and drastic lu maps the rates and weights assigned to each parameter are reported in table 3 the rates vary from 1 to 10 while the weights range from 1 to 5 with higher values describing greater susceptibility to pollution except for values of depth to water table and topography which have an inverse relationship with vulnerability the depths to groundwater in the study area range between 5 5 and 12 5 m they are grouped into three classes 5 5 7 5 m 7 5 10 m and 10 0 12 5 m table 3 the lowest depth range is mainly defined around bwari in the central part of the municipal council area and southern parts of abaji and kwali fig 4a the principal source of groundwater recharge is the local precipitation which infiltrates into the ground and percolates toward the water table the recharge also plays an important role in the nitrate contamination process being the main vehicle for leaching and transport of contaminants toward the aquifer the estimated mean recharge was grouped into five 5 classes table 3 the highest recharge values were defined in the bwari and municipal area council the estimated recharge progressively decreases moving toward south west the lowest recharge values were expected around the kwali and abaji areas fig 4b the regolith aquifer is mostly constituted by weathered deposits of migmatite gneiss and schist and metasediments covering more than 80 of the study area a very limited section 5 corresponds to the granitic units in the western sector of bwari and municipal at the niger state border rates 3 and 4 were respectively assigned to the regolith deriving from these units which are characterized by similar hydrogeological features fig 4c sedimentary units are mostly present in southwestern parts of abaji kwali and kuje covering 12 of the study area a higher rate was assigned to these units 6 the soil may have a noteworthy impact on the ability of pollutants to migrate toward the vadose zone due to attenuation filtration biodegradation sorption and volatilization processes the predominant soil type in the area is silty clay covering 80 and was thus assigned the rating of 3 fig 4d it has a very high attenuation ability approximately 20 of the study area is covered by silty loam soil type with a rating of 4 the topography represented in the study area was classified into three classes fig 4e the topography map indicates that the slope distribution of the study area is steep in the eastern parts of the study area along the mountain range and gentler along the western parts the impact of the vadose zone is an important variable in the estimation of vulnerability the data used to define the impact of vadose is the same as that used for the aquifer media crystalline basement rocks comprising of migmatites were assigned a rating of 3 schist and meta sediments were assigned a rating of 4 and granite was assigned a rating of 5 sandstone and river alluvium deposits were assigned a rating of 6 fig 4f hydraulic conductivity determines the migration velocity of pollutants and hence the residence time and attenuation potential high conductivity values will be associated with higher contamination risk the hydraulic conductivity in the study area was grouped into four classes fig 4g the permeability values range between 0 57 and 2 16 m d in agreement with the interval reported in jimoh and wojuola 2009 the narrow range of the hydraulic conductivity values reflects the small variability of the characteristics of the saprolite deposits the seven layers were combined to form the drastic intrinsic vulnerability model of the abuja fct area the vulnerability values range between 77 and 134 fig 5 the five vulnerability classes very low low medium high and very high are defined on the basis of the geometrical interval classification on arcgis based on this classification the bwari abuja municipal and the southwestern parts of abaji are characterized by very high to high vulnerability land use was considered to be closely related to the nitrate specific vulnerability map and therefore the highest weight 5 was assigned to this layer within this layer three main groups were defined and rated natural areas forest grassland and wetland characterized by a low natural load of nitrate rate 1 cultivated areas rate 5 in the 2000 land use map where additional inputs of nitrate are related to the fertilization of the crops and urbanized areas rate 9 where the main sources of nitrate are the untreated waste waters and the open defecation table 3 differently from previous groundwater vulnerability assessments developed in other countries e g busico et al 2017b persaud and levison 2021 alam et al 2014 stigter et al 2005 we proposed a smaller rating of the agricultural areas in fact the available data on the fertilizer consumption world bank 2022 highlight a lower use of fertilizers in nigeria compared to other areas of africa or in different continents table 4 looking in detail at the fertilizer consumption trend table s2 a significant increase in fertilization is visible between 2000 5 3 kg ha of arable land and 2018 19 7 kg ha of arable land different rates were assigned to the cultivated lands in 2000 rate 5 and 2020 rate 6 in order to account for this increase in fertilizer use the resulting drastic lu maps of 2000 and 2020 are reported in fig 6a and b 4 2 hydrogeochemistry the samples collected during the 2021 campaign show a dominance of ca mg hco3 facies fig s4 a synthesis of the hydrochemical results for the groundwater samples is reported in table 5 nitrate concentrations in groundwater range from 0 2 to 294 5 mg l average 56 2 mg l standard deviation 77 4 n 39 with 33 of the wells n 15 exceeding the statutory limit for drinking water 50 mg l world health organization 2017 5 discussion basement aquifers are generally classified as a two layer system comprising of the fractured bedrock overlain by a weathered regolith sequence bianchi et al 2020 the focus of the present study is that the base of the regolith is the more productive layer more exploited by the population the drastic map fig 5 can only provide a physically based characterization of the aquifer and its intrinsic capacity to be contaminated the simplified model reported in fig 7a highlights the contamination pathways in the natural environment according to the hydrogeological settings described in the study area section additionally the comparison between land use maps of abuja fct in 2000 and 2020 fig 6a and b allows us to constrain the specific vulnerability to nitrate contamination induced by both agricultural and domestic activities the rapid population expansion registered in nigeria reflects both the urban sprawling of the urban settlements and the expansion of small villages throughout the region fig 3 in most cases the fast urbanization is not associated with the realization of adequate systems for the collection and treatment of liquid and solid waste which are therefore often dispersed in the natural environment aniekwe and igu 2019 in addition excavations of the ground surface may remove the lower permeability soil layer reducing the depth to groundwater d layer and eventually increasing the intrinsic vulnerability of the aquifer this effect may also be indirectly induced by the installation of sewage systems which may accidentally act as a source of nitrate being located close to the saturated portion of the aquifer fig 7b at the same time the increased extension of urbanized areas reduces the possibility of water infiltration and therefore the local net recharge consequently the higher amount of surface runoff may be a new pathway for contamination of surface waters in the absence of adequate collection and treatment systems fig 7b additional fast pathways for local groundwater contamination may also be the wells themselves like groundwater from shallow permeable lenses polluted surface waters may in fact be conveyed in the borehole and thus eventually directly reach the water table more detailed information on the human activities in urban areas may allow for a more accurate estimation of the pollution loads as tested by dumedah et al 2021 the aforementioned impacts of land use changes on aquifer vulnerability are already absorbable from the specific vulnerability analyses in the drastic lu 2020 map very low to low vulnerability classes are attributed to parts of abaji kwali gwagwalada and kuje these areas were mainly covered by grasslands in 2000 but over the years they have been converted to agricultural lands this change affects the vulnerability to nitrate of all agricultural areas due to both plowing which may improve soil permeability and dispersion of fertilizers fig 7c although the current impact of fertilization seems to be moderate world bank 2022 the rapid increase observed over the last 20 years 400 and the ongoing development of the fertilizer industry to cope with the global food crisis should be taken into account in future regional planning a comparison with the current state of nitrate contamination in groundwater and the 2020 drastic lu is shown in fig 8 at present 53 of the sampled wells with nitrate concentration exceeding the statutory limits for drinking water 50 mg l world health organization 2017 are located in very high vulnerable zones and 13 in high vulnerable zones taking into account the 2020 land use map there is a strong relationship between no3 and urban peri urban areas where 87 of wells with nitrate concentration exceeding the statutory limits for drinking water are located contrary to the more widespread hypothesis that nitrate contamination is essentially associated with agricultural practices this can be induced by several processes i local impact of point source pollution of domestic e g informal settlements open defecation or industrial origin ii nitrogen legacy associated to previous land use e g urban settlements erected on land previously used for agricultural purposes iii a mix of both results of the present study show that the contaminated groundwater samples located in the medium low vulnerability areas are generally located near small villages suggesting the possible contribution of domestic activities rather than the sole impact of the widespread use of fertilizers regardless of the cause which is the subject of an ongoing study on groundwater geochemistry focused on environmental isotopes δ2hh2o δ18oh2o δ15nno3 δ18ono3 this process cannot be underestimated especially if the wells are used for drinking consumption only 20 of the study area is equipped with improved domestic water supply jimoh and wojuola 2009 as for the wells located in areas classified as medium to high vulnerability but not exceeding the nitrate drinking water limits it will be crucial to identify the possible nitrate sources in order to prevent future higher contamination in these vulnerable areas the possible occurrence of denitrification in these areas therefore resulting in low nitrate concentrations will be verified with future studies of nitrate isotopes δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 validating the vulnerability assessment with land use change and nitrate concentration made it possible to highlight how in a relatively vulnerable context from a geological point of view the impact of anthropogenic activities especially in view of the predicted population growth may significantly alter aquifer vulnerability this may lead to possible dangerous effects on the environment and population moreover the latter is not well prepared to manage possible restrictions on groundwater use the primary source for domestic and agricultural purposes therefore the results of the present study represent an important starting point for raising awareness of the need for environmental planning in the region and for coping with environmental changes in a timely manner the paucity of hydrogeochemical hydrogeological and detailed land use data for the study area is a great limitation for developing future scenarios on groundwater contamination therefore a priority for local water managers should be to set up a monitoring network to track the evolution of chemical water properties this would allow them to balance the need to ensure that the growing population of the region will meet the goals living in sustainable urban settlements sdg 11 united nations high commissioner for refugees 2017 achieving zero hunger sdg 2 and having access to safe drinking water sdg 6 6 conclusions like many other countries worldwide nigeria is experiencing rapid population growth with serious repercussions on groundwater quality and population wellbeing the population increase led to the rapid expansion of previously existing urban settlements and to the creation of new ones the increase in food demand boosted the conversion of grassland into cultivated areas both land use changes potentially exacerbate groundwater quality and quantity issues in the region in this context the drastic model was applied to assess the intrinsic vulnerability of abuja fct the results were integrated with the representation of land use in 2000 and 2020 in order to define the specific vulnerability to nitrate and to map its variation over the last 20 years a comparison with the results of a hydrogeochemical assessment carried out in 2020 highlighted that most of the contaminated waters were collected in urbanized areas both in major cities as well as in small villages although the possible mixing with agriculturally contaminated waters is under investigation results provide an important basis to support the sustainable development of the region providing information to managers and policy makers relative to the current state of aquifer vulnerability and insights into possible contamination drivers as previously mentioned the paucity of data does not allow for a complete assessment but there are some valuable results that can respond to the current needs of the local population as highlighted by re et al 2018 and by re et al 2022 it is often the case that while the scientific community is focused on providing the most complete information based on long term monitoring and assessments business as usual actions often associated to population growth water demand increase and recurrent droughts extreme events keep degrading the studied system therefore preliminary results represent a valuable support to inform local populations about the quality of local water resources and policy makers about the priority actions to undertake future research development will focus on specific vulnerability mapping in the region and on the identification of the main sources of nitrate pollution using a multi tracer approach and include more specific details of the urban activities in order to reduce the uncertainty about specific vulnerability we will perform calibration and validation of the rates and weights of the drastic lu once the extensive monitoring that is currently underway has finished and we have a robust monitoring dataset with more detailed information about land use including agricultural and human activities finally besides its impact on intrinsic groundwater vulnerability land use change should also be addressed in terms of internal migrations from rural to urban areas this is common practice in many areas worldwide international organization for migration 2016 as cities are generally considered more attractive due to a broader job market as a result of these internal migrations it is not only rural lands that are abandoned but cities get overcrowded eventually exacerbating ongoing urban sprawling and there is even more pressure on ground water resources and competition on their use kammoun et al 2018 limited access to safe water supply may increase conflicts due to the vertical among different uses e g domestic industrial and agricultural and horizontal among households sharing the same water sources competition on water use sunkari et al 2021 for this reason it is of paramount importance to integrate both intrinsic and specific vulnerability mapping in regional planning as a useful tool to support long term groundwater protection in areas subject to rapid population growth credit authorship contribution statement mary etuk conceptualization

7926,study region mond basin comprising 61 aquifers in southern iran study focus new indicators and a framework are presented for quantifying the intensity of groundwater stress by considering hydrogeological and anthropogenic factors including renewable water availability non renewable water storage withdrawal and return flow in contrast to existing methods our proposed indicators consider accumulated historical water stress tolerated by an aquifer during an exploitation period and incorporate groundwater over extraction from both renewable and non renewable storages of aquifers new hydrological insights we assessed the applicability of existing and newly defined groundwater stress indicators on the mond aquifers our results indicate that the proposed approach is able to inform the degree of groundwater stress and identify vulnerable aquifers with high intensity of groundwater stress statistical analysis of long term mean annual groundwater drawdown and groundwater storage confirmed the results of aquifer classification in terms of intensity of groundwater stress finally the response of aquifers in different stages of water stress was evaluated by scenarios of i reduced human induced withdrawal and irrigation return flow and ii increasing recharge these scenario analyses indicate that even up to a 50 reduction in human water use or a 50 increase in recharge does not recover the more severely stressed aquifers to sustainable hydrologic conditions graphical abstract ga1 keywords groundwater stress indicators water security sustainable use 1 introduction water stress negatively impacts populations agriculture and ecosystems and is known as one of the three global risks of the most serious concern according to the world economic forum mirchi et al 2014 wada et al 2014 water stress is typically measured using various metrics such as indicators that estimate water availability wästerström 2016 most assessments of global water stress have focused on surface water by use of indicators developed based on different characteristics like water availability withdrawal or consumption alcamo et al 2003 vörösmarty et al 2005 hoekstra et al 2012 averyt et al 2013 brauman et al 2016 however groundwater stress on aquifers as a globally important water resource has not been sufficiently considered in previous studies groundwater is a crucial resource for current and future generations that provides drinking water to at least 50 of the global population gleeson et al 2020 wwap 2015 however groundwater resources and their flow processes are difficult to observe hence assessing the behavior of a groundwater system and its changes are critical challenges to ensuring the sustainable use of water resources dams et al 2008 therefore mapping groundwater use compared to aquifer recharge is crucial in understanding water resource fragility and sustainable management of aquifers groundwater stress occurs when the water extraction exceeds the recharge to the corresponding aquifer over a given period mueller et al 2015 reduction in groundwater recharge and over exploitation are typical causes of groundwater stress globally groundwater extractions for irrigation are the prime reason for aquifer depletion burek et al 2016 despite some social and economic benefits of over extraction they cannot compensate for the substantial depletion of aquifers that are effectively non renewable on human timescales gleeson et al 2010 to measure groundwater stress exerted on an aquifer few indicators have been explicitly developed including groundwater footprint gleeson et al 2012 groundwater storage change to recharge richey et al 2015 and groundwater development stress alley et al 2018 gleeson and wada 2013 have quantified the distribution and uncertainty of groundwater stress throughout whole nations using multiple data sources they revealed that considering where and to what extent to focus limited research could be very critical in the science based management of resources wada and heinrich 2013 evaluated the water stress in 408 transboundary aquifers by taking into account recharge extraction and environmental flow impacts on groundwater they concluded that a very small percentage of aquifers are under human consumption perez et al 2015 used groundwater sustainability indicators in an area of santa fe province argentina their selected indicators allowed synthesizing the current state of groundwater resources considering three aspects the importance of groundwater as the main source of water supply in the region the abstraction being made of this resource and the natural quality of groundwater using the indicators of groundwater abstraction they demonstrated that the recharge rate is not sufficient to meet the current demand in the area weiskel et al 2007 presented a general framework for quantifying anthropogenic influences on groundwater budgets based on normalized human outflows and inflows of aquifers their procedure was applied by ashraf et al 2017 for selected aquifers in the usa germany and iran to characterize major causes of groundwater stress they quantified the effect of various human withdrawal scenarios on the groundwater resources to assess how the rate of human water abstraction could change flow regimes from human dominated to natural dominated in the studied aquifers many aquifers suffer from groundwater depletion particularly in semi arid and arid regions therefore it is essential to have some metrics and indicators for characterizing stressed aquifers and for comparing the level of stress of different aquifers in a basin however few water stress assessments have focused on groundwater as a source of water although groundwater is of global increasing importance for water supply wada et al 2012 therefore it is of utmost importance to improve our spatiotemporal knowledge of groundwater stress to characterize and better understand the groundwater status for developing an answer to which aquifers are under threat of stress and required more preserving which will be applicable to the basin or large scale generally previous studies are limited in comparing groundwater withdrawal or consumption with annual recharge to the aquifer as an indicator of renewability however in the cases where extraction from an aquifer significantly exceeds renewability extracted groundwater is mainly supplied from non renewable storage of the aquifer previously published indicators ignore this over exploitation from the non renewable storage of aquifers in addition they neglect the accumulative impacts of over extraction during a given exploitation period preferably estimated since predevelopment time therefore this work aims to quantify groundwater stress in aquifers by developing new indicators and frameworks that consider over exploitation from both renewable and non renewable storage of aquifers during a period of interest such indicators can support the sustainable management of groundwater by comparison prioritization and characterization of aquifers of a basin or a region in terms of the intensity of groundwater stress water use regime and water budget conditions we assess the applicability of conventional and newly proposed indicators for 61 aquifers of the mond basin located in the semi arid to the arid area of southern iran with a mean annual precipitation of about 300 mm in the mond basin groundwater is the major water resource moreover there is good availability of groundwater budget data to evaluate the methodology we believe that our approach provides a more reliable and accurate interpretation of the groundwater stress than has been available to date because it combines some improvements over previous studies considering renewable storage along with non renewable storage an explicit combination of different indicators and framework results with statistical methods to achieve the goal 2 methodology 2 1 calculation of groundwater budget over a period of interest a groundwater budget is based on the principle that water inflows and outflows of an aquifer are balanced by a change in groundwater storage a groundwater budget is therefore expressed as 1 inflow recharge outflow discharge change in storage the recharge and discharge terms in eq 1 can be expressed in more detail as components of eq 2 recharge includes such components as diffuse recharge from precipitation rp recharge from surface water rs subsurface inflow from adjacent aquifers rgw and total return flow hin from irrigation industrial and domestic uses the discharge components include evapotranspiration from groundwater det discharge from the aquifer to surface water ds and adjacent aquifers dgw and withdrawals hout for agricultural industrial and municipal uses fig 1 δs is the change in storage of the aquifer rp rs rgw hin det ds dgw hout δs 2 therefore determining the groundwater budget of an aquifer is complicated because it depends on various factors to accurately estimate the net surplus or deficit in water storage of the given aquifer weiskel et al 2007 developed an approach to quantify direct human hydrologic interactions by analyzing the water budget of aquifers including human withdrawals hout and return flows hin by combining natural recharge components as total natural recharge rt and discharge components as total discharge dt in the governing water balance eq 2 the equation can be written as follows 3 rt hin dt hout δs fn where rt is total natural recharge to the aquifer from precipitation surface water and adjacent aquifers dt is total natural discharge from the aquifer to surface water and adjacent aquifers as well as evapotranspiration δs is changing in storage and fn is a total net flux of groundwater of the aquifer weiskel et al 2007 introduced normalized human inflow and outflow respectively hin and hout by dividing the human withdrawals hout and return flows hin by the net flux which provides a contribution of human inflows and outflows to total flux 4 hin hin fn 5 hout hout fn an approach was provided by weiskel et al 2007 to characterize different types of human water use regimes and how they affect water balances in a hydrologic unit this indicator represents the relative magnitude of human water withdrawals and returns flow versus natural flows through a water system which states what portion of extracted water from a given aquifer belongs to the direct impact of human activity including withdrawals and return flows the water use intensity indicator wui is derived from normalized human withdrawals h out and normalized human return h in as follows 6 wui hin h out 2 2 2 calculation and development of groundwater stress indicators 2 2 1 conventional groundwater stress indicators the development of indicators for assessing groundwater stress has to follow a process of scientific research that considers the different characteristics and trends of the various users of groundwater systems in a simplified and understandable way the indicators have to be based on measurable or observable data relevant to the different components of the water budgets of aquifers they also have to take into account the accumulated states of selected quantitative parameters including renewable and non renewable groundwater storage total groundwater withdrawal total return flow groundwater consumption natural recharge and exploitable groundwater resources table 1 in order to investigate interpret and compare the intensity of groundwater stress in hydrological basins three previously introduced groundwater stress indicators are presented in table 2 these conventional indicators compare either groundwater withdrawal wtr raskin et al 1997 or consumption ctr hoekstra et al 2012 with annual recharge to the aquifer as renewable availability in contrast the wte indicator vrba et al 2006 compares the withdrawal to exploitable groundwater the amount of water that can be annually abstracted from a given aquifer under current socio economic constraints and ecological conditions 2 2 2 newly proposed groundwater stress indicators the published indicators are useful to indicate the general current groundwater stress of aquifers but they ignore historical water stress induced to the aquifers and any encroachment on non renewable storage over their exploitation period therefore to consider the non renewable storage of an aquifer during the period of interest five new indicators and a 2 d groundwater stress framework are developed for the first time in this work 2 2 3 withdrawal to natural recharge withdrawal to natural recharge wtnr is calculated similarly to wtr raskin et al 1997 but wtnr compares the withdrawal to the natural recharge defined as the recharge from precipitation surface water and adjacent aquifers ashraf et al 2017 table 2 this indicator makes it possible to assess the condition of aquifers by ignoring the return flow to the aquifer as a recharge component which typically leads to a deterioration of the groundwater quality compared to natural recharge water quality of irrigation return flow substantially decrease due to evaporation and also dissolving soil minerals and agricultural amendments such as fertilizers since recharging of low quality irrigation return flow leads to deteriorating water quality of the aquifer it has been ignored from the recharge rate of the aquifer 2 2 4 renewable storage extraction the indicator for renewable storage extraction rse is defined as the ratio of the difference between the renewable storage and the withdrawal over the renewable storage of an aquifer table 2 this indicator can also be calculated as 1 wtr negative values of rse indicate an extraction from non renewable storage of the aquifer for instance an rse of 0 20 means a volume equal to 20 of the annual renewable storage of the aquifer is over extraction occurring from non renewable storage on the other hand positive values of rse indicate no encroachment on the non renewable storage of the aquifer the rse indicator can be calculated as an annual ratio for each year or as an average ratio over a given period of aquifer exploitation 2 2 5 non renewable storage extraction the new indicator for non renewable storage extraction nse has been introduced here to measure the accumulative impact of over extraction over a given exploitation period preferably since predevelopment time any volume of groundwater over extraction excess to renewable availability of an aquifer is supplied from non renewable storage that generally was recharged over thousands of years successive over exploitation of renewable availability of groundwater leads to cumulative depletion in the storage of non renewable water which is a serious threat to long term sustainable water management and the security of an area bierkens and wada 2019 the major characteristic of the nse indicator is to show the cumulative depletion of non renewable water over the exploitation period the indicator is defined as the ratio of the accumulated difference between renewable storage and extraction during a period of interest δt compared to the non renewable storage of the aquifer at the beginning of the extraction period table 2 negative values of nse show that there is an over extraction of groundwater affecting the non renewable resources and leading to declines in water levels for instance a calculated nse of 0 20 for a given aquifer indicates that in addition to the annual withdrawal of renewable storage from the aquifer the non renewable storage of the aquifer has decreased by 20 over the period of interest 2 2 6 environmental renewable and non renewable storage extraction considering socio economic and ecological constraints for extractions of aquifers we can define environmental or more conservative versions of the rse and nse indicators respectively environmental renewable storage extraction erse and environmental non renewable storage extraction ense table 2 the proposed formula for these two new indicators is similar to rse and nse respectively but renewable storage minus the withdrawals in the numerator are replaced by environmental extraction or exploitable water availability minus withdrawals 2 2 7 groundwater stress framework weiskel et al 2007 proposed a two dimensional framework to quantify direct human hydrologic interactions and anthropogenic stresses on aquifers by plotting relative magnitudes of normalized human withdrawals hout versus return flows hin based on the intensity of normalized human withdrawal and return flow of aquifers their proposed framework characterizes four domains of possible water use regimes of a hydrologic system return flow dominated human flow dominated natural flow dominated and withdrawal dominated fig 2a however weiskels s framework neglects the response of aquifers in terms of water balance and changes in the storage of aquifers they studied the status of given aquifers just by considering the impact of anthropogenic activity regardless of cumulative depletion in the storage of non renewable water which is a serious threat to long term sustainable water management and preservation of water resources to integrate the impact of human activity human flow or natural flow dominated with the hydrological response of aquifers in the period of interest indicated by changes in storage depleting or recharging conditions a new framework that plots the indicator of non renewable storage extraction nse vs water use intensity wui is proposed here water use intensity calculated as the average of hout and hin varies from zero natural dominated flow regime to 1 human dominated flow regime and indicates the relative magnitude of human versus natural dominated flow regime through an aquifer system weiskel et al 2007 nse evaluates the condition of non renewable storage of aquifers during the period of interest negative values of nse lower half of the diagram indicate aquifers with depleting flow regimes while positive values upper half of the diagram display aquifers with recharging flow regimes fig 2b for instance nse values of 0 25 and 0 15 indicate that the cumulative net recharge renewable storage minus withdrawal compared to the non renewable storage respectively decreased by 25 and increased by 15 therefore the right half of the nse wui framework with wui values higher than 0 5 displays aquifers with human flow dominated water use regimes in which withdrawals and return flows dominate the overall water balance four hydrogeological domains of flow regimes can be characterized in the nse wui framework fig 2b i natural flow dominated recharging regime wui 0 5 and nse 0 ii natural flow dominated depleting regime wui 0 5 and nse 0 iii human flow dominated depleting regime wui 0 5 and nse 0 iv human flow dominated recharging regime wui 0 5 and nse 0 2 3 agglomerative hierarchical clustering ahc agglomerative hierarchical clustering ahc is the bottom up type of hierarchical clustering that has been widely used for classifying objects in clusters based on their similarity tiouiouine et al 2020 this technique begins by placing each data object as an individual cluster and then progressively merging until one large cluster containing all objects is formed rochman et al 2022 the progressive grouping of the data makes it possible to gain an idea of an optimal number of clusters when the number of clusters is unknown before analysis in this study ahc will be performed on the results of the indicators employing the euclidean distance as similarity measurement and ward s method as the agglomeration method to prioritize and classify the aquifers of the given study area 2 4 data collection and application of proposed indicators in a selected basin to evaluate the applicability of the conventional and newly proposed indicators of groundwater stress the mond basin for which sufficient data is available was selected fig 3 the basin extending over 47 800 km2 is located in the south central part of iran and has an arid and semi arid climate with an average annual precipitation of about 300 mm the main river draining the basin is the mond river which discharges into the persian gulf the mond basin includes 61 alluvial plains surrounded by high mountains of the zagros mountains range the alluvial plains comprise alluvial aquifers mostly bounded by impermeable or permeable geological formations of surrounding anticlines the subsurface hydraulic connectivity of the alluvial aquifers with surrounding mountains has been considered in water budget calculations as groundwater subsurface inflow rgw from or outflow dgw to adjacent aquifers the geometry of the aquifers including their area and thickness has been characterized using geophysical studies and exploratory drilling parab fars consulting engineering company 2015 the area and thickness of the aquifers vary between 3 4 and 722 7 km2 and between 25 and 300 m respectively the boundaries between neighboring pre defined aquifers are typically mountains of impervious or karstic formations that have not been depicted in fig 3 for simplification of the map however hydraulic connections and rates of groundwater recharge or discharge across the boundaries of the aquifers have been considered in the detailed calculations of the water budget of the alluvial aquifers parab fars consulting engineering company carried out hydrogeological studies to characterize the 61 aquifers of the mond basin parab 2015 they estimated the recharge and discharge components of these aquifers for 10 years from 2000 to 2011 using data provided by fars regional water authority details are provided in the supplementary information a 1 data used generally include monthly precipitation and evaporation data of 185 climatological stations observed streamflow of 32 hydrometric stations hydrogeological data including groundwater levels aquifer properties anthropogenic groundwater exploitation volumes from more than 800 observation wells and 27 000 water resource points wells qanats and springs we then applied their collected and estimated recharge and discharge components of the water budget to compute and evaluate changes in water storage for each of the 61 aquifers of the mond basin during the study period using eq 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater regimes and stress 3 1 1 groundwater budget of studied aquifers to characterize groundwater regimes of the mond basin aquifers the water balance of each aquifer was evaluated based on eq 2 using recharge and discharge components of the water budget calculated by parab 2015 the water budget components include recharge from precipitation rp recharge from adjacent aquifers rgw recharge from surface water systems rs and total return flow to the aquifer hin as the recharge components and groundwater evapotranspiration det groundwater discharge to adjacent aquifers dgw surface water systems ds and aquifer withdrawal hout as the discharge components descriptive statistics of the water balance components have been summarized in table 3 the total outflow of the aquifers of the mond basin generally exceeds their total inflow i e aquifers with declining aquifer storage δs 0 during the period of interest table 3 indicates that the major components of aquifer recharge and discharge are groundwater inflow rgw and withdrawal hout respectively the last row in table 3 reports the total annual value of water balance components for the entire mond basin the contribution of each component to the total recharge and the total discharge of the aquifers of the basin is illustrated in fig 4 groundwater recharge from adjacent aquifers 58 of total recharge and human withdrawal 93 of total discharge are the dominant components of aquifers inflow and outflow respectively 3 1 2 groundwater stress in the study area three conventional indicators of groundwater stress in addition to the five new proposed indicators including wtnr rse nse erse and ense listed in table 2 were calculated for 61 aquifers of the mond basin figs 5 and 6 and fig a 3 table 4 provides descriptive statistics of the calculated indicators the result of the prioritization concerning relative groundwater stress of the mond basin aquifers based on estimated indicators is given in table a 3 it should be noted that the threshold has been defined according to the critical levels for each indicator the threshold level of indicators wtr ctr wte and wtnr represents the level at which water withdrawal or consumption the numerator equals water availability the dominator therefore the value greater than one represents over exploitation and groundwater stress to the given aquifer when the numerator and denominator in indicators wtr ctr wte and wtnr are around equal the aquifer is on the verge of stress in the newly defined indicators rse nse erse and ense the nominator is calculated by subtracting withdrawal from water availability renewable storage therefore the value of 0 is considered as the threshold value and indicators vary between 1 and 1 in which the positive and negative values indicate stress and no stress in aquifers respectively the framework of normalized withdrawal vs normalized return flow fig 7a indicates that most of the aquifers of the mond basin have hout values higher than 0 75 this shows that these aquifers were exploited at very high rates during the period of interest such that withdrawal comprises more than 75 of the total outflow of the water balance of the aquifer for some heavily pumped aquifers of the mond basin hout is even close to 1 which shows a purely withdrawal dominated flow regime where essentially withdrawal comprises almost all outflow from the system on the other hand all aquifers of the mond basin have hin less than 0 5 which shows that extracted water from the system was essentially captured for human use and natural recharge dominated the inflows of the aquifers the framework of non renewable storage extraction vs water use intensity nse wui for the 61 aquifers of the mond basin is illustrated in fig 7b the results indicate that 37 aquifers plot in zone iii suggests a human flow dominated depleting regime i e these aquifers suffer from groundwater stress and a major portion of withdrawals are extracted from non renewable storage of the aquifers additionally it can be concluded that the major reason for depleting regime of these aquifers is human withdrawal not natural reasons like meteorological drought during the study period thirteen aquifers of the mond basin plot in zone i in which the aquifers have a natural flow dominated recharging regime these aquifers have not been under water stress the natural flow regime wui 0 5 in these aquifers suggests that net accretion in non renewable storage of these aquifers is mainly due to low human induced impacts eight aquifers of the mond basin plot in domain iv indicate a human flow dominated recharging regime although these aquifers have not yet been identified as under groundwater stress and depletion of non renewable storage this is probably due to significant irrigation return flows this may lead to water quality deterioration by recharge of low quality return flows a few of the mond aquifers plot close to the center of the framework which shows that these aquifers are not under severe stress and are in equilibrium in terms of the water balance for the period of interest 3 2 how to prioritize groundwater stressed aquifers appropriate selection of indicators and consequently prioritization of aquifers in terms of groundwater stress is an important task to support decision making for planning and executing any regional or local scale sustainable water management programs the prioritization of stressed aquifers based on individual indicators might lead to different results and create confusion for decision makers figs 5 and 6 the different outcomes occur because the indicators consider various hydrogeological parameters including over extraction from renewable availability non renewable storage share of withdrawal and return flow in water budget water consumption and environmental aspects therefore to achieve an all including classification of the aquifers in terms of groundwater stress by considering all indicators together we suggest using the statistical technique of agglomerative hierarchical clustering ahc to prioritize the aquifers ahc is a successive agglomerative clustering method that uses euclidian dissimilarities between the objects to group them we applied the ahc method to the results of several indicators and two frameworks to evaluate the intensity of water stress in 61 aquifers of the mond basin this technique categorized the aquifers of the mond basin into four classes of groundwater stress intensity the centroid values of each stress class are reported in table 5 class c1 comprises 18 low stressed aquifers with recharging or in balance water budget conditions classes c2 and c3 include 32 medium stressed and eight highly stressed aquifers respectively class c4 includes only the dahkuieh aquifer and has the highest level of stress indicators the volume of withdrawal in this aquifer is close to three times more than its renewable availability and therefore 30 of the non renewable storage of the aquifer has been exploited during the period of interest we refer to such disastrous groundwater stress condition that is associated with substantial overexploitation from non renewable aquifer storage as a bankruptcy the spatial distribution of each class is illustrated in fig 8 the figure illustrates a trend of increasing groundwater stress from the west to the east in the mond basin the two most likely causes of this trend are annual rainfall depth as an important source of renewable recharge water significantly decreases from the west 600 mm a to the east 200 mm a in the basin in addition to overexploitation in a given subbasin at the downstream area the withdrawal of surface and groundwater at upstream sections of the basin also leads to successive adverse impacts on the aquifers of the eastern downstream section by removing part of receiving surface or and groundwater recharge to evaluate the suitability of the prioritization of the aquifers in four different classes of groundwater stress we used the rate of change in mean groundwater storage and groundwater drawdown of the aquifers in the period of interest as factors for comparing the classes table 6 summarizes the descriptive statistical analysis results of groundwater drawdown and storage change for the four classes the results indicate a general increasing trend in negative values of groundwater drawdown and storage change i e an increasing trend from the c1 low stress class to the c4 aquifer bankruptcy class fig 9 mean values of storage change are 1 69 4 83 5 05 and 5 42 million cubic meters per year mcm yr in low medium high and bankruptcy classes of stress respectively i e the intensity of groundwater stress increases as the storage change increases the long term average groundwater drawdown in aquifers of different classes was also compared the results indicate mean drawdowns of 0 52 0 91 and 1 46 m yr for the classes of the low medium and high stress levels respectively unfortunately sufficient water level data throughout the study period is not available for the dahkuyeh aquifer to describe the bankruptcy water stress furthermore to confirm the classification of the aquifers in four groundwater stress intensities an analysis of variance one way anova test was performed on the results of the prioritization kaufmann and schering 2007 the anova test results indicate an alpha 0 05 for both parameters of storage change and groundwater drawdown therefore there are significant differences between the four water stress classes with a 95 confidence limit based on the long term annual groundwater drawdown and change in aquifers storage table 7 3 3 how does a reduction of withdrawal and increasing recharge affect groundwater stress to explore the impact of human induced stresses withdrawals and return flow on the groundwater system under different stress conditions hypothetical simple water management scenarios are used to analyze the sensitivity of the aquifers to changes in anthropogenic withdrawals and return flows ashraf et al 2017 the scenarios consider i reducing human withdrawals hout from and return flow hin to the aquifers and ii increasing recharge i e by the implementation of artificial recharge projects to the aquifer ranging from 10 to 50 of the initial values applied in each case to understand how a wide range of anthropogenic changes could affect the status of the aquifer to evaluate the results of the scenarios on the stress intensity of the mond basin aquifers they were applied to one representative aquifer per stress class baghan low stress dasht e afzar medium stress khormayek high stress and dahkuieh bankruptcy the positions of the class centroids have been illustrated as red triangles on the two dimensional frameworks in fig 7 fig 10a indicates that reducing anthropogenic influences by decreasing withdrawals and return flows results in a shift of the baghan aquifer towards the left side of hout hin framework but not sufficient to change the flow regime of the aquifer from a withdrawal dominated to natural dominated for the three other aquifers of the mond basin especially dahkuieh up to a 50 reduction in human withdrawal and return flow does not cause any noticeable decrease in stress levels of these aquifers because human withdrawals comprise a very large portion of the total discharge of these aquifers hout calculated as dividing withdrawal by total discharge changes only slightly by decreasing hout in the case of scenario ii increasing recharge from 10 to 50 of the initial values indicates that applying this scenario does not shift the status of aquifers in hout hin framework fig 10 a the scenarios of human impact reduction and increasing recharge were also applied to the newly proposed framework of nse wui fig 10b this framework indicates the dual effect of human impact on aquifer storage availability and human water use intensity the results indicate that reducing the anthropogenic impacts change the depleting regime of the khormayek and dasht e afzar aquifers to recharging but still human flow dominated regime in the case of the dahkuieh aquifer a reduction in withdrawal and return flow of up to 50 cannot even shift a depleting regime to a recharging regime fig 10b therefore even up to 50 reducing human water use does not always remediate the aquifer regime condition on the other hand all aquifers indicate slight movement on the framework in response to the scenario of increasing recharge it should be noted that more than 50 reduction in hout and hin is very challenging and almost irrealistic to achieve however these numbers provide a rough idea about the level of anthropogenic influence and the resulting deviation from the natural system 3 4 evaluation of framework and indicators understanding if groundwater is sustainably managed is crucially important to avoid imposing more stress and external pressures on aquifers richey et al 2015 the current study aimed to develop a new approach for quantifying the intensity of groundwater stress using a new framework and indicators in order to provide the most appropriate and effective plan for sustainable use of groundwater it is attempted to assess the water stress of aquifers by accounting for non renewable groundwater resources socio economic and ecological constraints and differentiation between human driven and natural flows considering the accumulative impacts of over extraction from non renewable storage of aquifers during a given exploitation period as an irreversible process which has not been accounted for in previous studies hoekstra et al 2012 richey et al 2015 perez et al 2015 brauman et al 2016 can lead to a more efficient definition of groundwater stress finally prioritization and comparison of aquifers make it possible to define and preserve aquifers with more severe stress in a basin or larger scale region the methodology proposed here leads to creating groundwater stress maps by employing statistical techniques and bringing different results together that help to enhance the interpretation of large scale areas by providing a general overview of the groundwater resource condition therefore broadly applying this approach in groundwater stressed areas would help assess the level of groundwater sustainability and prevent future groundwater crises however this research had limitations like accessing the groundwater budget data and uncertainty in estimating their components which stems from complications and limitations in knowledge of groundwater systems and the application of empirical methods in some cases due to lack of sufficient information since the uncertainty in estimating the components of the groundwater budget is undeniable inherit developing indicators must be accompanied by uncertainty depending on data reliability and methods applied this issue arises especially when the volumetric aspect has been considered to develop indicators like conventional and newly developed indicators to reduce the uncertainty caused by estimating volumetric parameters in future research further tries will be done to examine groundwater stress in terms of the metric dimension which help to more accurate data and reduce this uncertainty of groundwater stress 4 conclusion describing the level of groundwater stress in aquifers by indicators is a valuable approach for decision makers to understand the status of groundwater systems and better use and manage groundwater in the future therefore five new groundwater stress indicators and a framework for quantifying the intensity of groundwater stress have been developed to characterize stress intensity in aquifers better the results obtained from available and newly introduced stress indicators and frameworks in conjunction with the agglomerative hierarchical clustering help to comprehensively classify and prioritize aquifers by considering the intensity of human impact storage availability depleting or recharging and dominant flow regime natural or human flow dominated the applicability of the proposed approach was evaluated on 61 aquifers of the mond basin the mean annual groundwater level data and groundwater storage variation along with anova statistics confirmed the suitability of the newly proposed approach for the classification of aquifers in terms of groundwater stress applying different scenarios of i reduction in human induced components of the water budget withdrawal and return flow and ii increasing recharge on the mond basin aquifers indicates that not only reduction of human water use but also increasing of recharge to aquifers up to 50 does not necessarily lead to sustainable hydrologic conditions especially for aquifers in highly stressed or bankruptcy situations this highlights the negative nonreversible impacts of groundwater over exploitation and emphasizes the need for more careful water management to prevent long term threats to water security in basins credit authorship contribution statement all authors contributed to the design implementation of the research the analysis of the results and the

7926,study region mond basin comprising 61 aquifers in southern iran study focus new indicators and a framework are presented for quantifying the intensity of groundwater stress by considering hydrogeological and anthropogenic factors including renewable water availability non renewable water storage withdrawal and return flow in contrast to existing methods our proposed indicators consider accumulated historical water stress tolerated by an aquifer during an exploitation period and incorporate groundwater over extraction from both renewable and non renewable storages of aquifers new hydrological insights we assessed the applicability of existing and newly defined groundwater stress indicators on the mond aquifers our results indicate that the proposed approach is able to inform the degree of groundwater stress and identify vulnerable aquifers with high intensity of groundwater stress statistical analysis of long term mean annual groundwater drawdown and groundwater storage confirmed the results of aquifer classification in terms of intensity of groundwater stress finally the response of aquifers in different stages of water stress was evaluated by scenarios of i reduced human induced withdrawal and irrigation return flow and ii increasing recharge these scenario analyses indicate that even up to a 50 reduction in human water use or a 50 increase in recharge does not recover the more severely stressed aquifers to sustainable hydrologic conditions graphical abstract ga1 keywords groundwater stress indicators water security sustainable use 1 introduction water stress negatively impacts populations agriculture and ecosystems and is known as one of the three global risks of the most serious concern according to the world economic forum mirchi et al 2014 wada et al 2014 water stress is typically measured using various metrics such as indicators that estimate water availability wästerström 2016 most assessments of global water stress have focused on surface water by use of indicators developed based on different characteristics like water availability withdrawal or consumption alcamo et al 2003 vörösmarty et al 2005 hoekstra et al 2012 averyt et al 2013 brauman et al 2016 however groundwater stress on aquifers as a globally important water resource has not been sufficiently considered in previous studies groundwater is a crucial resource for current and future generations that provides drinking water to at least 50 of the global population gleeson et al 2020 wwap 2015 however groundwater resources and their flow processes are difficult to observe hence assessing the behavior of a groundwater system and its changes are critical challenges to ensuring the sustainable use of water resources dams et al 2008 therefore mapping groundwater use compared to aquifer recharge is crucial in understanding water resource fragility and sustainable management of aquifers groundwater stress occurs when the water extraction exceeds the recharge to the corresponding aquifer over a given period mueller et al 2015 reduction in groundwater recharge and over exploitation are typical causes of groundwater stress globally groundwater extractions for irrigation are the prime reason for aquifer depletion burek et al 2016 despite some social and economic benefits of over extraction they cannot compensate for the substantial depletion of aquifers that are effectively non renewable on human timescales gleeson et al 2010 to measure groundwater stress exerted on an aquifer few indicators have been explicitly developed including groundwater footprint gleeson et al 2012 groundwater storage change to recharge richey et al 2015 and groundwater development stress alley et al 2018 gleeson and wada 2013 have quantified the distribution and uncertainty of groundwater stress throughout whole nations using multiple data sources they revealed that considering where and to what extent to focus limited research could be very critical in the science based management of resources wada and heinrich 2013 evaluated the water stress in 408 transboundary aquifers by taking into account recharge extraction and environmental flow impacts on groundwater they concluded that a very small percentage of aquifers are under human consumption perez et al 2015 used groundwater sustainability indicators in an area of santa fe province argentina their selected indicators allowed synthesizing the current state of groundwater resources considering three aspects the importance of groundwater as the main source of water supply in the region the abstraction being made of this resource and the natural quality of groundwater using the indicators of groundwater abstraction they demonstrated that the recharge rate is not sufficient to meet the current demand in the area weiskel et al 2007 presented a general framework for quantifying anthropogenic influences on groundwater budgets based on normalized human outflows and inflows of aquifers their procedure was applied by ashraf et al 2017 for selected aquifers in the usa germany and iran to characterize major causes of groundwater stress they quantified the effect of various human withdrawal scenarios on the groundwater resources to assess how the rate of human water abstraction could change flow regimes from human dominated to natural dominated in the studied aquifers many aquifers suffer from groundwater depletion particularly in semi arid and arid regions therefore it is essential to have some metrics and indicators for characterizing stressed aquifers and for comparing the level of stress of different aquifers in a basin however few water stress assessments have focused on groundwater as a source of water although groundwater is of global increasing importance for water supply wada et al 2012 therefore it is of utmost importance to improve our spatiotemporal knowledge of groundwater stress to characterize and better understand the groundwater status for developing an answer to which aquifers are under threat of stress and required more preserving which will be applicable to the basin or large scale generally previous studies are limited in comparing groundwater withdrawal or consumption with annual recharge to the aquifer as an indicator of renewability however in the cases where extraction from an aquifer significantly exceeds renewability extracted groundwater is mainly supplied from non renewable storage of the aquifer previously published indicators ignore this over exploitation from the non renewable storage of aquifers in addition they neglect the accumulative impacts of over extraction during a given exploitation period preferably estimated since predevelopment time therefore this work aims to quantify groundwater stress in aquifers by developing new indicators and frameworks that consider over exploitation from both renewable and non renewable storage of aquifers during a period of interest such indicators can support the sustainable management of groundwater by comparison prioritization and characterization of aquifers of a basin or a region in terms of the intensity of groundwater stress water use regime and water budget conditions we assess the applicability of conventional and newly proposed indicators for 61 aquifers of the mond basin located in the semi arid to the arid area of southern iran with a mean annual precipitation of about 300 mm in the mond basin groundwater is the major water resource moreover there is good availability of groundwater budget data to evaluate the methodology we believe that our approach provides a more reliable and accurate interpretation of the groundwater stress than has been available to date because it combines some improvements over previous studies considering renewable storage along with non renewable storage an explicit combination of different indicators and framework results with statistical methods to achieve the goal 2 methodology 2 1 calculation of groundwater budget over a period of interest a groundwater budget is based on the principle that water inflows and outflows of an aquifer are balanced by a change in groundwater storage a groundwater budget is therefore expressed as 1 inflow recharge outflow discharge change in storage the recharge and discharge terms in eq 1 can be expressed in more detail as components of eq 2 recharge includes such components as diffuse recharge from precipitation rp recharge from surface water rs subsurface inflow from adjacent aquifers rgw and total return flow hin from irrigation industrial and domestic uses the discharge components include evapotranspiration from groundwater det discharge from the aquifer to surface water ds and adjacent aquifers dgw and withdrawals hout for agricultural industrial and municipal uses fig 1 δs is the change in storage of the aquifer rp rs rgw hin det ds dgw hout δs 2 therefore determining the groundwater budget of an aquifer is complicated because it depends on various factors to accurately estimate the net surplus or deficit in water storage of the given aquifer weiskel et al 2007 developed an approach to quantify direct human hydrologic interactions by analyzing the water budget of aquifers including human withdrawals hout and return flows hin by combining natural recharge components as total natural recharge rt and discharge components as total discharge dt in the governing water balance eq 2 the equation can be written as follows 3 rt hin dt hout δs fn where rt is total natural recharge to the aquifer from precipitation surface water and adjacent aquifers dt is total natural discharge from the aquifer to surface water and adjacent aquifers as well as evapotranspiration δs is changing in storage and fn is a total net flux of groundwater of the aquifer weiskel et al 2007 introduced normalized human inflow and outflow respectively hin and hout by dividing the human withdrawals hout and return flows hin by the net flux which provides a contribution of human inflows and outflows to total flux 4 hin hin fn 5 hout hout fn an approach was provided by weiskel et al 2007 to characterize different types of human water use regimes and how they affect water balances in a hydrologic unit this indicator represents the relative magnitude of human water withdrawals and returns flow versus natural flows through a water system which states what portion of extracted water from a given aquifer belongs to the direct impact of human activity including withdrawals and return flows the water use intensity indicator wui is derived from normalized human withdrawals h out and normalized human return h in as follows 6 wui hin h out 2 2 2 calculation and development of groundwater stress indicators 2 2 1 conventional groundwater stress indicators the development of indicators for assessing groundwater stress has to follow a process of scientific research that considers the different characteristics and trends of the various users of groundwater systems in a simplified and understandable way the indicators have to be based on measurable or observable data relevant to the different components of the water budgets of aquifers they also have to take into account the accumulated states of selected quantitative parameters including renewable and non renewable groundwater storage total groundwater withdrawal total return flow groundwater consumption natural recharge and exploitable groundwater resources table 1 in order to investigate interpret and compare the intensity of groundwater stress in hydrological basins three previously introduced groundwater stress indicators are presented in table 2 these conventional indicators compare either groundwater withdrawal wtr raskin et al 1997 or consumption ctr hoekstra et al 2012 with annual recharge to the aquifer as renewable availability in contrast the wte indicator vrba et al 2006 compares the withdrawal to exploitable groundwater the amount of water that can be annually abstracted from a given aquifer under current socio economic constraints and ecological conditions 2 2 2 newly proposed groundwater stress indicators the published indicators are useful to indicate the general current groundwater stress of aquifers but they ignore historical water stress induced to the aquifers and any encroachment on non renewable storage over their exploitation period therefore to consider the non renewable storage of an aquifer during the period of interest five new indicators and a 2 d groundwater stress framework are developed for the first time in this work 2 2 3 withdrawal to natural recharge withdrawal to natural recharge wtnr is calculated similarly to wtr raskin et al 1997 but wtnr compares the withdrawal to the natural recharge defined as the recharge from precipitation surface water and adjacent aquifers ashraf et al 2017 table 2 this indicator makes it possible to assess the condition of aquifers by ignoring the return flow to the aquifer as a recharge component which typically leads to a deterioration of the groundwater quality compared to natural recharge water quality of irrigation return flow substantially decrease due to evaporation and also dissolving soil minerals and agricultural amendments such as fertilizers since recharging of low quality irrigation return flow leads to deteriorating water quality of the aquifer it has been ignored from the recharge rate of the aquifer 2 2 4 renewable storage extraction the indicator for renewable storage extraction rse is defined as the ratio of the difference between the renewable storage and the withdrawal over the renewable storage of an aquifer table 2 this indicator can also be calculated as 1 wtr negative values of rse indicate an extraction from non renewable storage of the aquifer for instance an rse of 0 20 means a volume equal to 20 of the annual renewable storage of the aquifer is over extraction occurring from non renewable storage on the other hand positive values of rse indicate no encroachment on the non renewable storage of the aquifer the rse indicator can be calculated as an annual ratio for each year or as an average ratio over a given period of aquifer exploitation 2 2 5 non renewable storage extraction the new indicator for non renewable storage extraction nse has been introduced here to measure the accumulative impact of over extraction over a given exploitation period preferably since predevelopment time any volume of groundwater over extraction excess to renewable availability of an aquifer is supplied from non renewable storage that generally was recharged over thousands of years successive over exploitation of renewable availability of groundwater leads to cumulative depletion in the storage of non renewable water which is a serious threat to long term sustainable water management and the security of an area bierkens and wada 2019 the major characteristic of the nse indicator is to show the cumulative depletion of non renewable water over the exploitation period the indicator is defined as the ratio of the accumulated difference between renewable storage and extraction during a period of interest δt compared to the non renewable storage of the aquifer at the beginning of the extraction period table 2 negative values of nse show that there is an over extraction of groundwater affecting the non renewable resources and leading to declines in water levels for instance a calculated nse of 0 20 for a given aquifer indicates that in addition to the annual withdrawal of renewable storage from the aquifer the non renewable storage of the aquifer has decreased by 20 over the period of interest 2 2 6 environmental renewable and non renewable storage extraction considering socio economic and ecological constraints for extractions of aquifers we can define environmental or more conservative versions of the rse and nse indicators respectively environmental renewable storage extraction erse and environmental non renewable storage extraction ense table 2 the proposed formula for these two new indicators is similar to rse and nse respectively but renewable storage minus the withdrawals in the numerator are replaced by environmental extraction or exploitable water availability minus withdrawals 2 2 7 groundwater stress framework weiskel et al 2007 proposed a two dimensional framework to quantify direct human hydrologic interactions and anthropogenic stresses on aquifers by plotting relative magnitudes of normalized human withdrawals hout versus return flows hin based on the intensity of normalized human withdrawal and return flow of aquifers their proposed framework characterizes four domains of possible water use regimes of a hydrologic system return flow dominated human flow dominated natural flow dominated and withdrawal dominated fig 2a however weiskels s framework neglects the response of aquifers in terms of water balance and changes in the storage of aquifers they studied the status of given aquifers just by considering the impact of anthropogenic activity regardless of cumulative depletion in the storage of non renewable water which is a serious threat to long term sustainable water management and preservation of water resources to integrate the impact of human activity human flow or natural flow dominated with the hydrological response of aquifers in the period of interest indicated by changes in storage depleting or recharging conditions a new framework that plots the indicator of non renewable storage extraction nse vs water use intensity wui is proposed here water use intensity calculated as the average of hout and hin varies from zero natural dominated flow regime to 1 human dominated flow regime and indicates the relative magnitude of human versus natural dominated flow regime through an aquifer system weiskel et al 2007 nse evaluates the condition of non renewable storage of aquifers during the period of interest negative values of nse lower half of the diagram indicate aquifers with depleting flow regimes while positive values upper half of the diagram display aquifers with recharging flow regimes fig 2b for instance nse values of 0 25 and 0 15 indicate that the cumulative net recharge renewable storage minus withdrawal compared to the non renewable storage respectively decreased by 25 and increased by 15 therefore the right half of the nse wui framework with wui values higher than 0 5 displays aquifers with human flow dominated water use regimes in which withdrawals and return flows dominate the overall water balance four hydrogeological domains of flow regimes can be characterized in the nse wui framework fig 2b i natural flow dominated recharging regime wui 0 5 and nse 0 ii natural flow dominated depleting regime wui 0 5 and nse 0 iii human flow dominated depleting regime wui 0 5 and nse 0 iv human flow dominated recharging regime wui 0 5 and nse 0 2 3 agglomerative hierarchical clustering ahc agglomerative hierarchical clustering ahc is the bottom up type of hierarchical clustering that has been widely used for classifying objects in clusters based on their similarity tiouiouine et al 2020 this technique begins by placing each data object as an individual cluster and then progressively merging until one large cluster containing all objects is formed rochman et al 2022 the progressive grouping of the data makes it possible to gain an idea of an optimal number of clusters when the number of clusters is unknown before analysis in this study ahc will be performed on the results of the indicators employing the euclidean distance as similarity measurement and ward s method as the agglomeration method to prioritize and classify the aquifers of the given study area 2 4 data collection and application of proposed indicators in a selected basin to evaluate the applicability of the conventional and newly proposed indicators of groundwater stress the mond basin for which sufficient data is available was selected fig 3 the basin extending over 47 800 km2 is located in the south central part of iran and has an arid and semi arid climate with an average annual precipitation of about 300 mm the main river draining the basin is the mond river which discharges into the persian gulf the mond basin includes 61 alluvial plains surrounded by high mountains of the zagros mountains range the alluvial plains comprise alluvial aquifers mostly bounded by impermeable or permeable geological formations of surrounding anticlines the subsurface hydraulic connectivity of the alluvial aquifers with surrounding mountains has been considered in water budget calculations as groundwater subsurface inflow rgw from or outflow dgw to adjacent aquifers the geometry of the aquifers including their area and thickness has been characterized using geophysical studies and exploratory drilling parab fars consulting engineering company 2015 the area and thickness of the aquifers vary between 3 4 and 722 7 km2 and between 25 and 300 m respectively the boundaries between neighboring pre defined aquifers are typically mountains of impervious or karstic formations that have not been depicted in fig 3 for simplification of the map however hydraulic connections and rates of groundwater recharge or discharge across the boundaries of the aquifers have been considered in the detailed calculations of the water budget of the alluvial aquifers parab fars consulting engineering company carried out hydrogeological studies to characterize the 61 aquifers of the mond basin parab 2015 they estimated the recharge and discharge components of these aquifers for 10 years from 2000 to 2011 using data provided by fars regional water authority details are provided in the supplementary information a 1 data used generally include monthly precipitation and evaporation data of 185 climatological stations observed streamflow of 32 hydrometric stations hydrogeological data including groundwater levels aquifer properties anthropogenic groundwater exploitation volumes from more than 800 observation wells and 27 000 water resource points wells qanats and springs we then applied their collected and estimated recharge and discharge components of the water budget to compute and evaluate changes in water storage for each of the 61 aquifers of the mond basin during the study period using eq 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater regimes and stress 3 1 1 groundwater budget of studied aquifers to characterize groundwater regimes of the mond basin aquifers the water balance of each aquifer was evaluated based on eq 2 using recharge and discharge components of the water budget calculated by parab 2015 the water budget components include recharge from precipitation rp recharge from adjacent aquifers rgw recharge from surface water systems rs and total return flow to the aquifer hin as the recharge components and groundwater evapotranspiration det groundwater discharge to adjacent aquifers dgw surface water systems ds and aquifer withdrawal hout as the discharge components descriptive statistics of the water balance components have been summarized in table 3 the total outflow of the aquifers of the mond basin generally exceeds their total inflow i e aquifers with declining aquifer storage δs 0 during the period of interest table 3 indicates that the major components of aquifer recharge and discharge are groundwater inflow rgw and withdrawal hout respectively the last row in table 3 reports the total annual value of water balance components for the entire mond basin the contribution of each component to the total recharge and the total discharge of the aquifers of the basin is illustrated in fig 4 groundwater recharge from adjacent aquifers 58 of total recharge and human withdrawal 93 of total discharge are the dominant components of aquifers inflow and outflow respectively 3 1 2 groundwater stress in the study area three conventional indicators of groundwater stress in addition to the five new proposed indicators including wtnr rse nse erse and ense listed in table 2 were calculated for 61 aquifers of the mond basin figs 5 and 6 and fig a 3 table 4 provides descriptive statistics of the calculated indicators the result of the prioritization concerning relative groundwater stress of the mond basin aquifers based on estimated indicators is given in table a 3 it should be noted that the threshold has been defined according to the critical levels for each indicator the threshold level of indicators wtr ctr wte and wtnr represents the level at which water withdrawal or consumption the numerator equals water availability the dominator therefore the value greater than one represents over exploitation and groundwater stress to the given aquifer when the numerator and denominator in indicators wtr ctr wte and wtnr are around equal the aquifer is on the verge of stress in the newly defined indicators rse nse erse and ense the nominator is calculated by subtracting withdrawal from water availability renewable storage therefore the value of 0 is considered as the threshold value and indicators vary between 1 and 1 in which the positive and negative values indicate stress and no stress in aquifers respectively the framework of normalized withdrawal vs normalized return flow fig 7a indicates that most of the aquifers of the mond basin have hout values higher than 0 75 this shows that these aquifers were exploited at very high rates during the period of interest such that withdrawal comprises more than 75 of the total outflow of the water balance of the aquifer for some heavily pumped aquifers of the mond basin hout is even close to 1 which shows a purely withdrawal dominated flow regime where essentially withdrawal comprises almost all outflow from the system on the other hand all aquifers of the mond basin have hin less than 0 5 which shows that extracted water from the system was essentially captured for human use and natural recharge dominated the inflows of the aquifers the framework of non renewable storage extraction vs water use intensity nse wui for the 61 aquifers of the mond basin is illustrated in fig 7b the results indicate that 37 aquifers plot in zone iii suggests a human flow dominated depleting regime i e these aquifers suffer from groundwater stress and a major portion of withdrawals are extracted from non renewable storage of the aquifers additionally it can be concluded that the major reason for depleting regime of these aquifers is human withdrawal not natural reasons like meteorological drought during the study period thirteen aquifers of the mond basin plot in zone i in which the aquifers have a natural flow dominated recharging regime these aquifers have not been under water stress the natural flow regime wui 0 5 in these aquifers suggests that net accretion in non renewable storage of these aquifers is mainly due to low human induced impacts eight aquifers of the mond basin plot in domain iv indicate a human flow dominated recharging regime although these aquifers have not yet been identified as under groundwater stress and depletion of non renewable storage this is probably due to significant irrigation return flows this may lead to water quality deterioration by recharge of low quality return flows a few of the mond aquifers plot close to the center of the framework which shows that these aquifers are not under severe stress and are in equilibrium in terms of the water balance for the period of interest 3 2 how to prioritize groundwater stressed aquifers appropriate selection of indicators and consequently prioritization of aquifers in terms of groundwater stress is an important task to support decision making for planning and executing any regional or local scale sustainable water management programs the prioritization of stressed aquifers based on individual indicators might lead to different results and create confusion for decision makers figs 5 and 6 the different outcomes occur because the indicators consider various hydrogeological parameters including over extraction from renewable availability non renewable storage share of withdrawal and return flow in water budget water consumption and environmental aspects therefore to achieve an all including classification of the aquifers in terms of groundwater stress by considering all indicators together we suggest using the statistical technique of agglomerative hierarchical clustering ahc to prioritize the aquifers ahc is a successive agglomerative clustering method that uses euclidian dissimilarities between the objects to group them we applied the ahc method to the results of several indicators and two frameworks to evaluate the intensity of water stress in 61 aquifers of the mond basin this technique categorized the aquifers of the mond basin into four classes of groundwater stress intensity the centroid values of each stress class are reported in table 5 class c1 comprises 18 low stressed aquifers with recharging or in balance water budget conditions classes c2 and c3 include 32 medium stressed and eight highly stressed aquifers respectively class c4 includes only the dahkuieh aquifer and has the highest level of stress indicators the volume of withdrawal in this aquifer is close to three times more than its renewable availability and therefore 30 of the non renewable storage of the aquifer has been exploited during the period of interest we refer to such disastrous groundwater stress condition that is associated with substantial overexploitation from non renewable aquifer storage as a bankruptcy the spatial distribution of each class is illustrated in fig 8 the figure illustrates a trend of increasing groundwater stress from the west to the east in the mond basin the two most likely causes of this trend are annual rainfall depth as an important source of renewable recharge water significantly decreases from the west 600 mm a to the east 200 mm a in the basin in addition to overexploitation in a given subbasin at the downstream area the withdrawal of surface and groundwater at upstream sections of the basin also leads to successive adverse impacts on the aquifers of the eastern downstream section by removing part of receiving surface or and groundwater recharge to evaluate the suitability of the prioritization of the aquifers in four different classes of groundwater stress we used the rate of change in mean groundwater storage and groundwater drawdown of the aquifers in the period of interest as factors for comparing the classes table 6 summarizes the descriptive statistical analysis results of groundwater drawdown and storage change for the four classes the results indicate a general increasing trend in negative values of groundwater drawdown and storage change i e an increasing trend from the c1 low stress class to the c4 aquifer bankruptcy class fig 9 mean values of storage change are 1 69 4 83 5 05 and 5 42 million cubic meters per year mcm yr in low medium high and bankruptcy classes of stress respectively i e the intensity of groundwater stress increases as the storage change increases the long term average groundwater drawdown in aquifers of different classes was also compared the results indicate mean drawdowns of 0 52 0 91 and 1 46 m yr for the classes of the low medium and high stress levels respectively unfortunately sufficient water level data throughout the study period is not available for the dahkuyeh aquifer to describe the bankruptcy water stress furthermore to confirm the classification of the aquifers in four groundwater stress intensities an analysis of variance one way anova test was performed on the results of the prioritization kaufmann and schering 2007 the anova test results indicate an alpha 0 05 for both parameters of storage change and groundwater drawdown therefore there are significant differences between the four water stress classes with a 95 confidence limit based on the long term annual groundwater drawdown and change in aquifers storage table 7 3 3 how does a reduction of withdrawal and increasing recharge affect groundwater stress to explore the impact of human induced stresses withdrawals and return flow on the groundwater system under different stress conditions hypothetical simple water management scenarios are used to analyze the sensitivity of the aquifers to changes in anthropogenic withdrawals and return flows ashraf et al 2017 the scenarios consider i reducing human withdrawals hout from and return flow hin to the aquifers and ii increasing recharge i e by the implementation of artificial recharge projects to the aquifer ranging from 10 to 50 of the initial values applied in each case to understand how a wide range of anthropogenic changes could affect the status of the aquifer to evaluate the results of the scenarios on the stress intensity of the mond basin aquifers they were applied to one representative aquifer per stress class baghan low stress dasht e afzar medium stress khormayek high stress and dahkuieh bankruptcy the positions of the class centroids have been illustrated as red triangles on the two dimensional frameworks in fig 7 fig 10a indicates that reducing anthropogenic influences by decreasing withdrawals and return flows results in a shift of the baghan aquifer towards the left side of hout hin framework but not sufficient to change the flow regime of the aquifer from a withdrawal dominated to natural dominated for the three other aquifers of the mond basin especially dahkuieh up to a 50 reduction in human withdrawal and return flow does not cause any noticeable decrease in stress levels of these aquifers because human withdrawals comprise a very large portion of the total discharge of these aquifers hout calculated as dividing withdrawal by total discharge changes only slightly by decreasing hout in the case of scenario ii increasing recharge from 10 to 50 of the initial values indicates that applying this scenario does not shift the status of aquifers in hout hin framework fig 10 a the scenarios of human impact reduction and increasing recharge were also applied to the newly proposed framework of nse wui fig 10b this framework indicates the dual effect of human impact on aquifer storage availability and human water use intensity the results indicate that reducing the anthropogenic impacts change the depleting regime of the khormayek and dasht e afzar aquifers to recharging but still human flow dominated regime in the case of the dahkuieh aquifer a reduction in withdrawal and return flow of up to 50 cannot even shift a depleting regime to a recharging regime fig 10b therefore even up to 50 reducing human water use does not always remediate the aquifer regime condition on the other hand all aquifers indicate slight movement on the framework in response to the scenario of increasing recharge it should be noted that more than 50 reduction in hout and hin is very challenging and almost irrealistic to achieve however these numbers provide a rough idea about the level of anthropogenic influence and the resulting deviation from the natural system 3 4 evaluation of framework and indicators understanding if groundwater is sustainably managed is crucially important to avoid imposing more stress and external pressures on aquifers richey et al 2015 the current study aimed to develop a new approach for quantifying the intensity of groundwater stress using a new framework and indicators in order to provide the most appropriate and effective plan for sustainable use of groundwater it is attempted to assess the water stress of aquifers by accounting for non renewable groundwater resources socio economic and ecological constraints and differentiation between human driven and natural flows considering the accumulative impacts of over extraction from non renewable storage of aquifers during a given exploitation period as an irreversible process which has not been accounted for in previous studies hoekstra et al 2012 richey et al 2015 perez et al 2015 brauman et al 2016 can lead to a more efficient definition of groundwater stress finally prioritization and comparison of aquifers make it possible to define and preserve aquifers with more severe stress in a basin or larger scale region the methodology proposed here leads to creating groundwater stress maps by employing statistical techniques and bringing different results together that help to enhance the interpretation of large scale areas by providing a general overview of the groundwater resource condition therefore broadly applying this approach in groundwater stressed areas would help assess the level of groundwater sustainability and prevent future groundwater crises however this research had limitations like accessing the groundwater budget data and uncertainty in estimating their components which stems from complications and limitations in knowledge of groundwater systems and the application of empirical methods in some cases due to lack of sufficient information since the uncertainty in estimating the components of the groundwater budget is undeniable inherit developing indicators must be accompanied by uncertainty depending on data reliability and methods applied this issue arises especially when the volumetric aspect has been considered to develop indicators like conventional and newly developed indicators to reduce the uncertainty caused by estimating volumetric parameters in future research further tries will be done to examine groundwater stress in terms of the metric dimension which help to more accurate data and reduce this uncertainty of groundwater stress 4 conclusion describing the level of groundwater stress in aquifers by indicators is a valuable approach for decision makers to understand the status of groundwater systems and better use and manage groundwater in the future therefore five new groundwater stress indicators and a framework for quantifying the intensity of groundwater stress have been developed to characterize stress intensity in aquifers better the results obtained from available and newly introduced stress indicators and frameworks in conjunction with the agglomerative hierarchical clustering help to comprehensively classify and prioritize aquifers by considering the intensity of human impact storage availability depleting or recharging and dominant flow regime natural or human flow dominated the applicability of the proposed approach was evaluated on 61 aquifers of the mond basin the mean annual groundwater level data and groundwater storage variation along with anova statistics confirmed the suitability of the newly proposed approach for the classification of aquifers in terms of groundwater stress applying different scenarios of i reduction in human induced components of the water budget withdrawal and return flow and ii increasing recharge on the mond basin aquifers indicates that not only reduction of human water use but also increasing of recharge to aquifers up to 50 does not necessarily lead to sustainable hydrologic conditions especially for aquifers in highly stressed or bankruptcy situations this highlights the negative nonreversible impacts of groundwater over exploitation and emphasizes the need for more careful water management to prevent long term threats to water security in basins credit authorship contribution statement all authors contributed to the design implementation of the research the analysis of the results and the

7927,study region the upper hanjiang river basin which is a crucial water source for the middle route of the south to north water diversion project in china study focus this paper attempts to present a new integrated model for optimal water resources allocation in a typical river basin in this model the complex adaptive system framework is applied at the macro level and the system dynamics simulates the inner response of water user agent at the micro level and china s 3 redlines water policy is considered in the optimal module new hydrological insights for the region an integrated model is proposed for optimal water resources allocation of the upper hanjiang river basin in the planning years 2025 and 2030 and the nsga ii algorithm is executed to obtain the pareto optimal solution set for the optimal allocation of water resources the results show that there is a significant competitive relationship between environmental objective and economic objective water resources tend to flow to industrial water user agent driven by the adaptation to economic objective to agricultural water user agent and municipal water user agent driven by the adaptation to environmental objective which can be used for decision making and provide guidance for further development of water resources allocation keywords complex adaptive system agent based modeling system dynamics the upper hanjiang river basin 1 introduction as the source of life and prosperity water resources have always played a crucial role in human society grey and sadoff 2007 due to social development and unevenly distributed precipitation water resources security has become the pivotal issue all over the world particularly in many water shortage countries davidsen et al 2015 where competing demands among water users remain an issue grey and sadoff 2007 zhang et al 2019 therefore it is an urgent task to determine more complex and adaptive approaches to ensure that water resources can be allocated and utilized properly ni et al 2014 due to the existence of dynamic interactions and adaptations between water resources and related socio economic and environmental areas the water resources allocation faces a number of significant challenges as it has to contend with a variety of problems including population economy environment ecology and policy etc zhou et al 2015a various frameworks have been applied to analyze such multi level and complex systems it is worth mentioning that the complex adaptive system cas as one of the effective ones has attracted extensive attention in the last two decades agha hoseinali shirazi 2021 agent based modeling abm is a common simulation method which is available to explore the non linear adaptive interactions inherent to a cas galán et al 2009 and is widely considered in water resources management zhao et al 2004 applied abm to water resources allocation model and analyzed the water transfer situation and utilization benefit of the western route of water diversion project from south china to north in china galán et al 2009 used abm as a tool to think with to integrate and adapt different social sub models in an abm including technological and opinion diffusion water consumption and urban dynamics giacomoni and berglund 2015 applied abm as a policy maker model for urban water resources sustainability lin et al 2020 used abm for the water depot based water allocation system which has allocated large amounts of freshwater during shale oil development activities the cas method can capture the key attributes of governance institutions adaptability to changing circumstances and multi level interactions at the macro level however due to its desirable property to accommodate to the new environment it is difficult for them to control and predict simultaneously pahl wostl 2009 to adapt water demand water consumers are assigned rules based on the input from the policy that was determined by river basin authority however our knowledge about the internal logic of adaptive water demands is still quite limited existing simulation models typically consider water demands as static parameters that are exogenous to the water resources system while this hypothesis may neglect significant interactions and dynamics between demand side and its external environment house peters and chang 2011 kanta et al 2014 system dynamics sd which has strength in that it can solve practical problems related to dynamics nonlinearity and uncertainty ali et al 2019 yang et al 2019 wang et al 2021 can be used to investigate the behavior of complex systems over time by transforming the whole system into an interconnected series of stocks and flows making them affect each other through feedback loops zomorodian et al 2018 sd can be used to simulate the effects of strategies proposed by river basin authority stave 2003 stave 2003 applied a sd method to analyze the effects of policies on water supply and demand dawadi and ahmad 2012 developed a sd model to evaluate the impacts of climate change on the streamflow and water resources in the colorado river basin dhungel and fiedler 2014 focused on finding the water price elasticity by using sd to investigate the influence of individual variables on the final price elasticity of water demand ravar et al 2020 developed the sd model based on water food energy nexus approach to simulate the effectiveness of water and energy consumption management and environmental protection policies in urban industrial and agricultural sectors naderi et al 2021 used historical data to conduct quantitative sd simulation of water resources system in qazvin plain iran the study demonstrated the impacts of anticipated dynamics of integrated water and energy sectors under the policy scenario for the next 20 years precise and perfect water resources management is required in order to meet demands exerted by the sustainable development of economic and ecological communities kanta et al 2014 in this case chinese government has attached great importance to the development of water resources management elaborating the most stringent water management plan in its document no 1 of 2011 known as 3 redlines water policy this policy aims to control redlines consisting of total water use water pollution and water use efficiency to ensure water sustainability the 3 redlines water policy has been fully implemented since 2012 and has been set the target on a national and on the regional scales for 2030 as well as phased target for 2015 2020 the indicators phased targets of this policy can be seen in table 1 these policies will be beneficial to water security and protect the ecological environment liu et al 2013 qin et al 2015 to achieve rational allocation of water resources under china s water policies an integrated model that combines cas and sd theories is proposed for optimal water resources allocation of the upper hanjiang river basin uhrb and china s 3 redlines water policy is considered in the optimal module the remainder of this paper was organized as follows section 2 describes the details of the integrated model proposed in this study in section 3 the case study of the uhrb is described the results and analysis of applying the methodology to the uhrb are included in section 4 and the conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 combination of cas and sd cas and sd each with their benefits and drawbacks have been used to complicated nonlinear and adaptive systems in fact the two theories have a great similarity and overlap in theoretical foundations and research fields although the mechanisms of the two modeling methods are different they can complement each other in the study of complex systems the combination of two methods can achieve a more powerful approach ding et al 2018 the combination of two theories has been discussed in many studies jo et al 2015 martin and schlüter 2015 zhou et al 2015a jo et al 2015 illustrated that the combination of abm and sd can be categorized into three types namely independent model connected model and intertwined model of which the last one is the most widely used ding et al 2018 suggested two options to combine abm and sd 1 abm method based on sd sd is applied to model a certain number of objects on the macro level inside which agents are modeled based on abm 2 sd method based on abm in this approach abm is used on the macro level and sd is used on the micro level sd allows analyzing the modeled system at a high level of abstraction where multi level interactions are always ignored the cas method can capture the key attributes of governance institutions adaptability to changing circumstances and multi level interactions at the macro level however due to its desirable property to accommodate to the new environment it is difficult for them to control and predict simultaneously pahl wostl 2009 in abm since the behavior of most agents is determined by a complex set of if then rules and their relationships belong to an unknown black box the description of the rules set is either too simple to show the characteristics of the system comprehensively or too complex to quantify the benefit results sd a policy based methodology is fundamentally used to understand policy decisions and feedbacks and applicable to evaluate the effects of policy changes on a system based on the understanding of the nature of dynamics sd demonstrates the rules of agent s behaviors in terms of interactive numerous variables and their function relationships due to their complementary strengths the combination idea proposed in this paper is to embed the sd model into the abm the sd model is joined in the stimulus response model which is the agent s basic behavior model as shown in fig 1 where interaction of agents is modeled based on abm at the macro level while internal logic is simulated based on sd at the micro level 2 2 cas framework for water allocation the water allocation system is simulated as a cas consisting of administrative agent water user agents and intermediary agent water user agents include agricultural water user agent awua industrial water user agent iwua domestic water user agent dwua municipal water user agent mwua and ecological user water agent ewua these agents locate at different levels as shown in fig 2 the details of evolution mechanism for this system are expressed as follows 1 the uppermost is administrative agent representing river basin authority which is simulated to formulate economic and population development goals as well as controlling the quality of the ecological environment of the basin administrative agent weighs the amount of benefits of many objectives and chooses water allocation strategies in terms of optimal module then all the decided planning strategies will be communicated to water user agent 2 water user agents located in the middle level after received the planning strategies their inner stimulus response based on sd model will be triggered immediately water demand is predicted according to economy and population development plans and the simulation results will be fed back to the upper level administrative agent as reference for decision making production activities are also conducted by water user agents following water allocation strategies and adaptive information will be transmitted to intermediary agent 3 the bottom level intermediary agent computes the amount of benefits actually produced by the adaptive behavior of water user agents including positive benefits such as population industrial and agricultural products as well as negative benefits such as the total amount of domestic and industrial sewage the information will be fed back to administrative agent at the top level for decision making 4 administrative agent considers all the feedback to optimize the following planning strategies ultimately the maximum comprehensive benefit of the basin is achieved through the adaptive behavior of the agents at each level 2 3 sd model for adaptive water demands in fact water resources system is always in the dynamic external environment predictions based on mathematical methods can only extend or reproduce water demand change through historical data trend based on the historical data system dynamic establishes relationship between various agents as well as considers the influence of external factors such as policy adjustment at the same time and gets dynamic simulation which is closer to the actual situation in this paper the water demand model was proposed based on the system dynamic to predict the water demands in the planning years causal loop diagram presents how various variables in the system affect each other as well as portrays whether the relationships are positive or negative fig 3 shows the causal loop diagram for water demand model as economy and society keep developing the need to generate more benefits drives the industry and agriculture to consume more water resources while the increase in population also requires more water consumption for domestic ultimately the total water demand will increase when the development and utilization of water resources reach saturation competitive water will be produced among various water user agents and the economic social and ecological environment will also be restricted under the synergy of this positive and negative feedback water resources economic society and ecosystems fluctuate one after another and will eventually develop in concert according to the fig 3 the variables of the sd model for adaptive water demand in the uhrb is further selected and distinguished 1 industrial water user agent the industrial water demand is determined by its water use efficiency and development rate both of them are decided by administrative agent the inner stimulus response is shown in fig 4 1 i w d w q i v a i v a where iwd is the industrial water demand iva is the industrial value added wqiva is the water quota per 10 000 yuan rmb of iva 2 agricultural water user agent irrigation water accounts for a large proportion of the agricultural water demand and it is calculated by irrigated area and water quota of irrigation the administrative agent decides irrigated area ratio water quota of irrigation and irrigation water ratio 2 a w d i w i w r 3 i w w q i i a 4 i a a l a i a r where awd is the agricultural water demand iw is the irrigation water iwr is the irrigation water ratio wqi is the water quota of irrigation ia is the irrigated area ala is the arable land area and iar is the irrigated area ratio 3 domestic water user agent gross domestic product gdp reflects the prosperity of a city and the living level of its residents which affects the domestic water demand there is an s curve relationship between gdp and domestic water quotas 5 d w d w c p d w q 6 w c p w c p r p where dwd is the domestic water demand wcp is the water consumption population dwq is the domestic water quota wcpr is the water consumption population ratio and p is the population 4 municipal water user agent municipal water demand is closely related to population and the water quota is decided by the administrative agent 7 m w d m w q p where mwd is the municipal water demand and mwq is the municipal water quota 5 ecological water user agent the historical data of outer river ecological water demand shows little fluctuation during 2006 2018 and its proportion in the total water demand is also small with a maximum value of 0 11 108 m³ in all four cities thus the consumption of ecological water agent is determined directly by the administrative agent 2 4 optimal module 2 4 1 multi objective functions the adaptive behavior of agents is driven by co benefits and trade offs among the various objectives and these multi objective functions can be expressed as follows 1 economic objective function gdp is a standard measure of the added value created by productive socio economic activities in a watershed or region and is applied to quantify economic benefits the economic objective function that maximizes the gdp can be expressed in eq 8 8 f 1 x max k 1 k g d p k where f 1 x is the economic objective function g d p k is the gdp of kth subarea 2 social objective function keeping a balance between water supply and demand is critical to social stability therefore water resources allocation should strive for social equality d exelle et al 2012 senantea et al 2014 van et al 2015 the gini coefficient is widely used to measure inequality and has been introduced to denote the equity of water resources allocation yang and zhang 2015 zhou et al 2015a hu et al 2016 population and gdp are essential indicator attributes of urban development these two gini coefficients are selected to seek equity in the water allocation gini coefficient between population and water consumption g i n i p is defined as follows 9 g i n i p 1 k 1 k r w u k r w u k 1 r p k r p k 1 where the rwu is the cumulative percentage of water consumption and rp is the cumulative percentage of population gini coefficient between gdp and water consumption g i n i g d p is defined as follows 10 g i n i g d p 1 k 1 k r w u k r w u k 1 r g k r g k 1 where rg is the cumulative percentage of gdp the social objective function minimizing the integrated gini coefficient igc of g i n i p and g i n i g d p is shown in eq 11 11 f 2 x minigc m i n 0 5 g i n i p 0 5 g i n i g d p 3 environmental objective function chinese government realizes that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets acting on this understanding the government implements the 3 redlines water policy with strict limits on the total amount of wastewater discharged into the rivers the environmental objective function minimizing the total amount of sewage tos is shown as below 12 f 3 x min k 1 k p w l k p w i k where f 3 x is the environmental objective function p w l k is the domestic sewage of kth subarea and p w i k is the industrial sewage of kth subarea multi objective functions can be determined as follows 13 f x f 1 x f 2 x f 3 x 2 4 2 constraints optimization constraints are defined with respect to the water supply capacity and political factors the former requires that the amount of water allocated is limited to the amount of water available in the basin the latter means that the total water use and water use efficiency of the subarea comply with the 3 redlines water policy water use efficiency including daily domestic water consumption per capita water consumption per 10 000 yuan rmb of gdp and average irrigation water per hectare of farmland is fully considered in the sd model for water demand prediction in other words the predicted water demand is an implicit constraint of water use efficiency the domestic water user agent and ecological water user agent are given priority the remaining water is allocated to the other three sectors including municipal water user agent agricultural water user agent and industrial water user agent 2 4 3 optimal algorithm as mentioned the optimal allocation of water resources is actually a multi objective optimization problem in order to balance the benefit of each goal and solve the problem of reasonable allocation of water resources a multi objective model was developed and a high performance multi objective algorithm called the nsga ii deb 2002 was used to solve the optimization model the nsga ii is the most widely used optimization algorithm which has been proved to be able to solve multi objective problems well by obtaining approximately optimal diversified and uniformly distributed pareto solutions more details about the nsga ii can be seen in deb s 2000 paper the specific process is addressed below 1 generate an initial parent population p0 randomly each individual in p0 was divided into different ranks by sorting and selecting based on the non dominant level 2 select a new parent population p1 by an elitism sort and then after crossover and mutation child population q1 is generated 3 the parent population p1 combined with the child population q1 to form a new population r1 non dominated sorting and crowded distance sorting was applied to r1 and all individuals in r1 were assigned the fitness values 4 a new parent population p2 was generated by selecting individuals with higher fitness through elite ranking 5 this process is repeated until the stop criterion is reached finally the individual whose parent ranked first in pmax was pareto optimal solution 3 case study 3 1 study area the hanjiang river originates in shaanxi province with a mainstream of 925 km length and a catchment area of 95 200 km2 the upper hanjiang river basin uhrb divided by danjiangkou reservoir is densely populated with tributaries such as the bao river the xun river the du river and the dan river etc the uhrb has abundant water resources and is a crucial water source for the middle route of the south to north water diversion project snwdp however as the water demand within the basin keeps increasing along with the water supply pressure for inter basin water transfer optimization of water allocation for the uhrb has become a societal priority it is necessary to fully consider various demands including social economic and ecological in the optimal water resources allocation for the uhrb which have different impacts on water resources and are mutually restrictive generally in order to maximize the economic benefit it can lead to unfair distribution of water between users and adverse impact on the environment therefore it will be important to determine a reasonable water resources management plan to balance the benefit of the social economic and ecological simultaneously figs 5 8 3 2 generalization of the water allocation system and reservoir regulation as shown in fig 9 the uhrb covers four major cities including hanzhong city ankang city shangluo city and shiyan city and four subareas are divided according to the administrative division of those cities characteristics of the four subareas are shown in table 2 moreover the sections of hanzhong ankang baihe huanglongtan and huangjiagang are selected as the control sections the four subareas take water from the control sections of the mainstream of the hanjiang river and its tributaries while the middle route of snwdp takes water from the danjiangkou reservoir the generalization of the water allocation system for the uhrb is shown in fig 10 with the functions of water storage water discharge water supply and power generation reservoirs can directly regulate the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources in the basin which is a reliable engineering tool for the administrative agent in implementing water resources decisions after meeting its own water level and flow constraints the reservoir regulates the discharge to meet the water withdrawal needs of the subareas and the middle route of snwdp as shown in figs 11 and 12 when the water volume of the control section is insufficient to meet the inner river ecological water demand or the water withdrawal demand the upstream reservoir needs to increase the discharge to replenish the water volume and if the water demand still cannot be met until the most upstream reservoir subsides to the dead level it needs to be fed back to the administrative agent 3 3 model inputs the hydrology and reservoir parameter inner river ecological water demand water withdrawal of the middle route of snwdp and predicted results of water demand are required for the inputs of integrated model 3 3 1 hydrology and reservoir parameter the hydrologic scenarios of the planning periods can be obtained by two commonly used approaches one is the historical reappearance method based on the hypothesis that the historical hydrologic scenarios will reappear in the planning years zhou et al 2015b the other one is the projection of future scenarios under different climate change scenarios as proposed in ipcc s report cao et al 2021 in this paper the hydrologic scenarios of the planning periods are set by historical reappearance method which means the runoff data in a typical year will represent the runoff scenarios in the planning years according to statistics during the period of 1956 2016 the average annual precipitation in the uhrb was 867 mm deng et al 2019 while the average precipitation in 2012 was 835 mm since the precipitation in 2012 was close to the average value 2012 was selected as a typical year and its runoff process was chosen as the model input the initial reservoir capacity was adopted as the water level in early january 2012 and the characteristics of the reservoirs is shown in table 3 3 3 2 inner river ecological water demand tennant 1976 proposed a simple and effective methodology for calculating inner river ecological water demand without on site measurements the tenant method in which a certain percentage of average annual flow is taken as the ecological flow tian et al 2010 is adopted to determine inner river ecological water demand of each sections 40 of average annual flow is taken as the ecological flow during the flood season while the percentage for non flood season is 20 the calculated results are shown in table 4 3 3 3 water withdrawal of the middle route of snwdp the middle route of snwdp is a strategic multidecade infrastructure project undertaken by china she et al 2017 starting at danjiangkou reservoir in hanjiang river and ending at beijing and tianjin the water resources are transferred to beijing tianjin and cities in hebei henan and hubei provinces chen et al 2007 the project has already been operated to divert water since 2014 with multi year average water withdrawal of about 9 5 billion m³ and monthly water withdrawal is shown in fig 12 3 4 constraints as mentioned the optimization constraints are defined with respect to the water supply capacity and political factors under the 3 redlines water policy as shown in fig 10 the four subareas take water from the control sections of the mainstream of the hanjiang river and its tributaries on the one hand the total water supply from each source to the four cities should not exceed the available water supply from this source on the other hand the total water use and water use efficiency of the subareas should comply with the 3 redlines water policy the target values are extracted from report on comprehensive planning of main stream of hanjiang river while some present values are already within the redlines in this case the present value is taken as the constraint in the planning years the present value and target value of these indicators are shown in the table 5 4 results 4 1 predicted results of water demands the industrial agricultural domestic municipal and ecological water demands were predicted by the proposed sd model the ecological water demand here refers to the outer river ecological water demand it can be seen from the historical data that the variation range and proportion of ecological water demand are small while the maximum values of the four cities in the past years are all 0 11 108 m³ therefore this value is taken as the outer river ecological water demand of the four cities in the planning years 2025 and 2030 which will not be tested in this paper 2006 2017 was taken as the historical period 2018 was used as the test period as well as 2025 and 2030 were used as the prediction period relative error was used as a test index for model checking analysis green and stephenson 1986 generally speaking the relative error within 10 indicates that the model is applicable the calculated results are shown in table 6 it can be seen that the relative errors of all variables in the four cities are within 5 which is within the allowable error range therefore it can be considered that the simulation results of the water demands are consistent with the actual situation and meet the prediction accuracy thus the model is taken to predict the water demands of the uhrb in the planning years 2025 and 2030 the predicted results are shown in table 7 4 2 gaming relationship between different objectives due to ongoing conflict among different objectives it is a challenging task to simultaneously optimize multiple objectives hu et al 2016 in order to obtain the pareto optimal solution for water resources allocation of the uhrb in the planning years 2025 and 2030 a high performance multi objective algorithm called the nsga ii is executed in this study on the one hand the pareto optimal solution sets can provide more optional solutions for decision makers and on the other hand they can also show more game information of the multi objective optimization problems based on the obtained pareto optimal solution sets the game process among the objectives is drawn in figs 13 and 14 to figs 15 and 16 a significant competitive relationship between environmental objective and economic objective can be found in fig 14 the economic development of the uhrb mainly relies on industrial and agricultural production activities and the industrial production will generate a large amount of industrial sewage which poses a severe threat to the environment therefore when the allocation plan is to achieve a higher gdp the tos also increases on the contrary when the allocation plan tends to achieve better environmental objective the achievement of economic objective will decrease the game process among social goals economic goals and environmental goals is shown in figs 15 and 16 with the increase of igc the total values of gdp and tos show a downward trend the lower the overall gini coefficient it demonstrated that the distribution of water resources is biased towards developed cities with high gdp and large populations water use efficiency is closely related to urban development specifically the higher the city development the higher the water use efficiency and unit water use efficiency therefore when the allocation of water resources tends to be fair that is the lower igc the higher gdp and the tos will be produced within the basin when the allocation of water resources tends to be unfair the higher igc the gdp and tos will decrease the pareto solutions provide multiple design schemes with different target preferences for decision makers specifically the economic objective of the pareto optimal solution for 2025 is in a range of 459 394 billion yuan rmb to 859 486 billion yuan rmb while the gdp for the 2030 pareto optimal solution ranges from 806 333 billion yuan rmb to 1091 086 billion yuan rmb the social objective varies from 0 161 and 0 287 in 2025 as for 2030 it is between 0 141 and 0 225 in 2030 the gdp of the uhrb is higher than that in 2025 and the igc is lower than that in 2025 indicating that compared with 2025 the economy is more developed and water resources are more equitably allocated in 2030 which is consistent with the direction of social development progress 4 3 allocation scheme preference and adaptability analysis the flow of water resources in various regions and sectors is mainly driven by the macro control of the administrative agent and the adaptability the control information of the administrative agent is represented by the pareto optimal solution set and the objective function is the mathematical embodiment of the adaptability according to the previous analysis it is clear that the volume of water resources will flow to the more developed cities driven by the degree of adaptation to the social objective furthermore the reasonable optimal strategies should be determined to choose the final allocation scheme from the pareto optimal solution set according to different development targets the fluctuation of social objective is in a small range with the igc all less than 0 3 which means that there is good equity across the allocation options however water conflicts between the economy and the environment have been severe zhang et al 2019 therefore from the two focuses of economic and environmental objectives three allocation schemes were selected from each of the pareto optimal solution set for 2025 and 2030 a total of 12 schemes and the location of each scheme in the pareto optimal solution set is shown in fig 14 the benefits of multiple objectives achieved by each scheme are shown in table 9 where s denotes allocation schemes of the short term planning year 2025 and l denotes that of the long term planning year 2030 schemes 1 3 focus on environmental objective and schemes 4 6 focus on the economic objective the results of water resources allocation for each preferred scheme are as follows for the short term planning year 2025 it is shown that the values of tos increase with gdp increasing from schemes s1 to s6 as well as the values of igc change in a small range with gdp increasing from schemes s1 to s6 specifically the gdp values of schemes s1 s6 are increase from 4921 08 to 8559 67 with change amplitude 74 and the tos of schemes s1 s6 increase from 4 50 to 7 64 with change amplitude 70 it indicates that there is a strong competitive relationship between economic objective and environmental objective on the other hand it can be seen from fig 17 that for the four cities the volume of water allocated to industrial water user agent in schemes s4 s6 is overall higher than that of s1 s3 while the trend for the volume of water allocated to agricultural water user agent and municipal water user agent is the opposite for the long term planning year 2030 similarly it can be seen that the values of tos increase with gdp increasing from scheme s1 to s6 as well as the values of igc show a fluctuant decrease in a small range with gdp increasing from scheme l1 to l6 specifically the gdp values of schemes l1 l6 are increase from 8332 63 to 10 910 86 with change amplitude 31 and the tos of schemes s1 s6 increase from 7 47 to 9 55 with change amplitude 28 on the other hand it can be seen from fig 17 that for the four cities the volume of water allocated to industrial water user agent in schemes l4 l6 is overall higher than that of l1 l3 while the trend for the volume of water allocated to agricultural water user agent and municipal water user agent is the opposite that is when the selected scheme focuses on economic objective the water allocation will favor industrial water user agent while when the selected scheme focuses on environmental objective the water allocation will favor agricultural water user agent and municipal water user agent for the uhrb industry is the dominant factor in gdp growth and it will also cause more sewage to be discharged it is reasonable to some extent that limited water resources are firstly suited to improving human life and sustaining the necessary industries which may have more added value than agricultural products hanasaki et al 2018 in a nutshell water resources flow to industrial water user agent driven by the adaptation to economic objective to agricultural water user agent and municipal water user agent driven by the adaptation to environmental objective and to more developed cities driven by the adaptation to social objective 5 conclusions in this study an integrated model for optimal water resources allocation was proposed due to complementary strengths of the cas and sd the sd model is embedded into the cas framework and the sd model is joined in the stimulus response model which is the abm the water allocation system is simulated as cas consisting of administrative agent water user agents located at different levels interaction of agents is modeled based on abm at the macro level while internal logic is simulated based on sd at the micro level to evaluate the effect of policy changes on water demand the 3 redlines water policies were fully considered in the optimal module where the total water usage and water use efficiency redlines were set as constraints with water pollution redline as objective function the model was applied to the uhrb a crucial water source for the middle route of snwdp the nsga ii algorithm is executed to obtain the pareto optimal solution set for the optimal allocation of water resources in the planning years 2025 and 2030 on the one hand the pareto optimal solution set can provide more optional solutions for decision makers and on the other hand it can also show more game information of the multi objective optimization problem based on the obtained pareto optimal solution set the game relationship between each of two objectives is explored there is a significant competitive relationship between environmental objective and economic objective and there is a certain synergy relationship between social objective and economic objective from the two focuses of economic and environmental objectives a total of 12 schemes were selected from each of the pareto optimal solution set for 2025 and 2030 according to the results of water resources allocation for those 12 preferred schemes we can conclude that water resources flow to industrial water user agent driven by the adaptation to economic objective to agricultural water user agent and municipal water user agent driven by the adaptation to environmental objective and to more developed cities driven by the adaptation to social objective credit authorship contribution statement baowei yan conceptualization investigation supervision writing review editing funding

7927,study region the upper hanjiang river basin which is a crucial water source for the middle route of the south to north water diversion project in china study focus this paper attempts to present a new integrated model for optimal water resources allocation in a typical river basin in this model the complex adaptive system framework is applied at the macro level and the system dynamics simulates the inner response of water user agent at the micro level and china s 3 redlines water policy is considered in the optimal module new hydrological insights for the region an integrated model is proposed for optimal water resources allocation of the upper hanjiang river basin in the planning years 2025 and 2030 and the nsga ii algorithm is executed to obtain the pareto optimal solution set for the optimal allocation of water resources the results show that there is a significant competitive relationship between environmental objective and economic objective water resources tend to flow to industrial water user agent driven by the adaptation to economic objective to agricultural water user agent and municipal water user agent driven by the adaptation to environmental objective which can be used for decision making and provide guidance for further development of water resources allocation keywords complex adaptive system agent based modeling system dynamics the upper hanjiang river basin 1 introduction as the source of life and prosperity water resources have always played a crucial role in human society grey and sadoff 2007 due to social development and unevenly distributed precipitation water resources security has become the pivotal issue all over the world particularly in many water shortage countries davidsen et al 2015 where competing demands among water users remain an issue grey and sadoff 2007 zhang et al 2019 therefore it is an urgent task to determine more complex and adaptive approaches to ensure that water resources can be allocated and utilized properly ni et al 2014 due to the existence of dynamic interactions and adaptations between water resources and related socio economic and environmental areas the water resources allocation faces a number of significant challenges as it has to contend with a variety of problems including population economy environment ecology and policy etc zhou et al 2015a various frameworks have been applied to analyze such multi level and complex systems it is worth mentioning that the complex adaptive system cas as one of the effective ones has attracted extensive attention in the last two decades agha hoseinali shirazi 2021 agent based modeling abm is a common simulation method which is available to explore the non linear adaptive interactions inherent to a cas galán et al 2009 and is widely considered in water resources management zhao et al 2004 applied abm to water resources allocation model and analyzed the water transfer situation and utilization benefit of the western route of water diversion project from south china to north in china galán et al 2009 used abm as a tool to think with to integrate and adapt different social sub models in an abm including technological and opinion diffusion water consumption and urban dynamics giacomoni and berglund 2015 applied abm as a policy maker model for urban water resources sustainability lin et al 2020 used abm for the water depot based water allocation system which has allocated large amounts of freshwater during shale oil development activities the cas method can capture the key attributes of governance institutions adaptability to changing circumstances and multi level interactions at the macro level however due to its desirable property to accommodate to the new environment it is difficult for them to control and predict simultaneously pahl wostl 2009 to adapt water demand water consumers are assigned rules based on the input from the policy that was determined by river basin authority however our knowledge about the internal logic of adaptive water demands is still quite limited existing simulation models typically consider water demands as static parameters that are exogenous to the water resources system while this hypothesis may neglect significant interactions and dynamics between demand side and its external environment house peters and chang 2011 kanta et al 2014 system dynamics sd which has strength in that it can solve practical problems related to dynamics nonlinearity and uncertainty ali et al 2019 yang et al 2019 wang et al 2021 can be used to investigate the behavior of complex systems over time by transforming the whole system into an interconnected series of stocks and flows making them affect each other through feedback loops zomorodian et al 2018 sd can be used to simulate the effects of strategies proposed by river basin authority stave 2003 stave 2003 applied a sd method to analyze the effects of policies on water supply and demand dawadi and ahmad 2012 developed a sd model to evaluate the impacts of climate change on the streamflow and water resources in the colorado river basin dhungel and fiedler 2014 focused on finding the water price elasticity by using sd to investigate the influence of individual variables on the final price elasticity of water demand ravar et al 2020 developed the sd model based on water food energy nexus approach to simulate the effectiveness of water and energy consumption management and environmental protection policies in urban industrial and agricultural sectors naderi et al 2021 used historical data to conduct quantitative sd simulation of water resources system in qazvin plain iran the study demonstrated the impacts of anticipated dynamics of integrated water and energy sectors under the policy scenario for the next 20 years precise and perfect water resources management is required in order to meet demands exerted by the sustainable development of economic and ecological communities kanta et al 2014 in this case chinese government has attached great importance to the development of water resources management elaborating the most stringent water management plan in its document no 1 of 2011 known as 3 redlines water policy this policy aims to control redlines consisting of total water use water pollution and water use efficiency to ensure water sustainability the 3 redlines water policy has been fully implemented since 2012 and has been set the target on a national and on the regional scales for 2030 as well as phased target for 2015 2020 the indicators phased targets of this policy can be seen in table 1 these policies will be beneficial to water security and protect the ecological environment liu et al 2013 qin et al 2015 to achieve rational allocation of water resources under china s water policies an integrated model that combines cas and sd theories is proposed for optimal water resources allocation of the upper hanjiang river basin uhrb and china s 3 redlines water policy is considered in the optimal module the remainder of this paper was organized as follows section 2 describes the details of the integrated model proposed in this study in section 3 the case study of the uhrb is described the results and analysis of applying the methodology to the uhrb are included in section 4 and the conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 combination of cas and sd cas and sd each with their benefits and drawbacks have been used to complicated nonlinear and adaptive systems in fact the two theories have a great similarity and overlap in theoretical foundations and research fields although the mechanisms of the two modeling methods are different they can complement each other in the study of complex systems the combination of two methods can achieve a more powerful approach ding et al 2018 the combination of two theories has been discussed in many studies jo et al 2015 martin and schlüter 2015 zhou et al 2015a jo et al 2015 illustrated that the combination of abm and sd can be categorized into three types namely independent model connected model and intertwined model of which the last one is the most widely used ding et al 2018 suggested two options to combine abm and sd 1 abm method based on sd sd is applied to model a certain number of objects on the macro level inside which agents are modeled based on abm 2 sd method based on abm in this approach abm is used on the macro level and sd is used on the micro level sd allows analyzing the modeled system at a high level of abstraction where multi level interactions are always ignored the cas method can capture the key attributes of governance institutions adaptability to changing circumstances and multi level interactions at the macro level however due to its desirable property to accommodate to the new environment it is difficult for them to control and predict simultaneously pahl wostl 2009 in abm since the behavior of most agents is determined by a complex set of if then rules and their relationships belong to an unknown black box the description of the rules set is either too simple to show the characteristics of the system comprehensively or too complex to quantify the benefit results sd a policy based methodology is fundamentally used to understand policy decisions and feedbacks and applicable to evaluate the effects of policy changes on a system based on the understanding of the nature of dynamics sd demonstrates the rules of agent s behaviors in terms of interactive numerous variables and their function relationships due to their complementary strengths the combination idea proposed in this paper is to embed the sd model into the abm the sd model is joined in the stimulus response model which is the agent s basic behavior model as shown in fig 1 where interaction of agents is modeled based on abm at the macro level while internal logic is simulated based on sd at the micro level 2 2 cas framework for water allocation the water allocation system is simulated as a cas consisting of administrative agent water user agents and intermediary agent water user agents include agricultural water user agent awua industrial water user agent iwua domestic water user agent dwua municipal water user agent mwua and ecological user water agent ewua these agents locate at different levels as shown in fig 2 the details of evolution mechanism for this system are expressed as follows 1 the uppermost is administrative agent representing river basin authority which is simulated to formulate economic and population development goals as well as controlling the quality of the ecological environment of the basin administrative agent weighs the amount of benefits of many objectives and chooses water allocation strategies in terms of optimal module then all the decided planning strategies will be communicated to water user agent 2 water user agents located in the middle level after received the planning strategies their inner stimulus response based on sd model will be triggered immediately water demand is predicted according to economy and population development plans and the simulation results will be fed back to the upper level administrative agent as reference for decision making production activities are also conducted by water user agents following water allocation strategies and adaptive information will be transmitted to intermediary agent 3 the bottom level intermediary agent computes the amount of benefits actually produced by the adaptive behavior of water user agents including positive benefits such as population industrial and agricultural products as well as negative benefits such as the total amount of domestic and industrial sewage the information will be fed back to administrative agent at the top level for decision making 4 administrative agent considers all the feedback to optimize the following planning strategies ultimately the maximum comprehensive benefit of the basin is achieved through the adaptive behavior of the agents at each level 2 3 sd model for adaptive water demands in fact water resources system is always in the dynamic external environment predictions based on mathematical methods can only extend or reproduce water demand change through historical data trend based on the historical data system dynamic establishes relationship between various agents as well as considers the influence of external factors such as policy adjustment at the same time and gets dynamic simulation which is closer to the actual situation in this paper the water demand model was proposed based on the system dynamic to predict the water demands in the planning years causal loop diagram presents how various variables in the system affect each other as well as portrays whether the relationships are positive or negative fig 3 shows the causal loop diagram for water demand model as economy and society keep developing the need to generate more benefits drives the industry and agriculture to consume more water resources while the increase in population also requires more water consumption for domestic ultimately the total water demand will increase when the development and utilization of water resources reach saturation competitive water will be produced among various water user agents and the economic social and ecological environment will also be restricted under the synergy of this positive and negative feedback water resources economic society and ecosystems fluctuate one after another and will eventually develop in concert according to the fig 3 the variables of the sd model for adaptive water demand in the uhrb is further selected and distinguished 1 industrial water user agent the industrial water demand is determined by its water use efficiency and development rate both of them are decided by administrative agent the inner stimulus response is shown in fig 4 1 i w d w q i v a i v a where iwd is the industrial water demand iva is the industrial value added wqiva is the water quota per 10 000 yuan rmb of iva 2 agricultural water user agent irrigation water accounts for a large proportion of the agricultural water demand and it is calculated by irrigated area and water quota of irrigation the administrative agent decides irrigated area ratio water quota of irrigation and irrigation water ratio 2 a w d i w i w r 3 i w w q i i a 4 i a a l a i a r where awd is the agricultural water demand iw is the irrigation water iwr is the irrigation water ratio wqi is the water quota of irrigation ia is the irrigated area ala is the arable land area and iar is the irrigated area ratio 3 domestic water user agent gross domestic product gdp reflects the prosperity of a city and the living level of its residents which affects the domestic water demand there is an s curve relationship between gdp and domestic water quotas 5 d w d w c p d w q 6 w c p w c p r p where dwd is the domestic water demand wcp is the water consumption population dwq is the domestic water quota wcpr is the water consumption population ratio and p is the population 4 municipal water user agent municipal water demand is closely related to population and the water quota is decided by the administrative agent 7 m w d m w q p where mwd is the municipal water demand and mwq is the municipal water quota 5 ecological water user agent the historical data of outer river ecological water demand shows little fluctuation during 2006 2018 and its proportion in the total water demand is also small with a maximum value of 0 11 108 m³ in all four cities thus the consumption of ecological water agent is determined directly by the administrative agent 2 4 optimal module 2 4 1 multi objective functions the adaptive behavior of agents is driven by co benefits and trade offs among the various objectives and these multi objective functions can be expressed as follows 1 economic objective function gdp is a standard measure of the added value created by productive socio economic activities in a watershed or region and is applied to quantify economic benefits the economic objective function that maximizes the gdp can be expressed in eq 8 8 f 1 x max k 1 k g d p k where f 1 x is the economic objective function g d p k is the gdp of kth subarea 2 social objective function keeping a balance between water supply and demand is critical to social stability therefore water resources allocation should strive for social equality d exelle et al 2012 senantea et al 2014 van et al 2015 the gini coefficient is widely used to measure inequality and has been introduced to denote the equity of water resources allocation yang and zhang 2015 zhou et al 2015a hu et al 2016 population and gdp are essential indicator attributes of urban development these two gini coefficients are selected to seek equity in the water allocation gini coefficient between population and water consumption g i n i p is defined as follows 9 g i n i p 1 k 1 k r w u k r w u k 1 r p k r p k 1 where the rwu is the cumulative percentage of water consumption and rp is the cumulative percentage of population gini coefficient between gdp and water consumption g i n i g d p is defined as follows 10 g i n i g d p 1 k 1 k r w u k r w u k 1 r g k r g k 1 where rg is the cumulative percentage of gdp the social objective function minimizing the integrated gini coefficient igc of g i n i p and g i n i g d p is shown in eq 11 11 f 2 x minigc m i n 0 5 g i n i p 0 5 g i n i g d p 3 environmental objective function chinese government realizes that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets acting on this understanding the government implements the 3 redlines water policy with strict limits on the total amount of wastewater discharged into the rivers the environmental objective function minimizing the total amount of sewage tos is shown as below 12 f 3 x min k 1 k p w l k p w i k where f 3 x is the environmental objective function p w l k is the domestic sewage of kth subarea and p w i k is the industrial sewage of kth subarea multi objective functions can be determined as follows 13 f x f 1 x f 2 x f 3 x 2 4 2 constraints optimization constraints are defined with respect to the water supply capacity and political factors the former requires that the amount of water allocated is limited to the amount of water available in the basin the latter means that the total water use and water use efficiency of the subarea comply with the 3 redlines water policy water use efficiency including daily domestic water consumption per capita water consumption per 10 000 yuan rmb of gdp and average irrigation water per hectare of farmland is fully considered in the sd model for water demand prediction in other words the predicted water demand is an implicit constraint of water use efficiency the domestic water user agent and ecological water user agent are given priority the remaining water is allocated to the other three sectors including municipal water user agent agricultural water user agent and industrial water user agent 2 4 3 optimal algorithm as mentioned the optimal allocation of water resources is actually a multi objective optimization problem in order to balance the benefit of each goal and solve the problem of reasonable allocation of water resources a multi objective model was developed and a high performance multi objective algorithm called the nsga ii deb 2002 was used to solve the optimization model the nsga ii is the most widely used optimization algorithm which has been proved to be able to solve multi objective problems well by obtaining approximately optimal diversified and uniformly distributed pareto solutions more details about the nsga ii can be seen in deb s 2000 paper the specific process is addressed below 1 generate an initial parent population p0 randomly each individual in p0 was divided into different ranks by sorting and selecting based on the non dominant level 2 select a new parent population p1 by an elitism sort and then after crossover and mutation child population q1 is generated 3 the parent population p1 combined with the child population q1 to form a new population r1 non dominated sorting and crowded distance sorting was applied to r1 and all individuals in r1 were assigned the fitness values 4 a new parent population p2 was generated by selecting individuals with higher fitness through elite ranking 5 this process is repeated until the stop criterion is reached finally the individual whose parent ranked first in pmax was pareto optimal solution 3 case study 3 1 study area the hanjiang river originates in shaanxi province with a mainstream of 925 km length and a catchment area of 95 200 km2 the upper hanjiang river basin uhrb divided by danjiangkou reservoir is densely populated with tributaries such as the bao river the xun river the du river and the dan river etc the uhrb has abundant water resources and is a crucial water source for the middle route of the south to north water diversion project snwdp however as the water demand within the basin keeps increasing along with the water supply pressure for inter basin water transfer optimization of water allocation for the uhrb has become a societal priority it is necessary to fully consider various demands including social economic and ecological in the optimal water resources allocation for the uhrb which have different impacts on water resources and are mutually restrictive generally in order to maximize the economic benefit it can lead to unfair distribution of water between users and adverse impact on the environment therefore it will be important to determine a reasonable water resources management plan to balance the benefit of the social economic and ecological simultaneously figs 5 8 3 2 generalization of the water allocation system and reservoir regulation as shown in fig 9 the uhrb covers four major cities including hanzhong city ankang city shangluo city and shiyan city and four subareas are divided according to the administrative division of those cities characteristics of the four subareas are shown in table 2 moreover the sections of hanzhong ankang baihe huanglongtan and huangjiagang are selected as the control sections the four subareas take water from the control sections of the mainstream of the hanjiang river and its tributaries while the middle route of snwdp takes water from the danjiangkou reservoir the generalization of the water allocation system for the uhrb is shown in fig 10 with the functions of water storage water discharge water supply and power generation reservoirs can directly regulate the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources in the basin which is a reliable engineering tool for the administrative agent in implementing water resources decisions after meeting its own water level and flow constraints the reservoir regulates the discharge to meet the water withdrawal needs of the subareas and the middle route of snwdp as shown in figs 11 and 12 when the water volume of the control section is insufficient to meet the inner river ecological water demand or the water withdrawal demand the upstream reservoir needs to increase the discharge to replenish the water volume and if the water demand still cannot be met until the most upstream reservoir subsides to the dead level it needs to be fed back to the administrative agent 3 3 model inputs the hydrology and reservoir parameter inner river ecological water demand water withdrawal of the middle route of snwdp and predicted results of water demand are required for the inputs of integrated model 3 3 1 hydrology and reservoir parameter the hydrologic scenarios of the planning periods can be obtained by two commonly used approaches one is the historical reappearance method based on the hypothesis that the historical hydrologic scenarios will reappear in the planning years zhou et al 2015b the other one is the projection of future scenarios under different climate change scenarios as proposed in ipcc s report cao et al 2021 in this paper the hydrologic scenarios of the planning periods are set by historical reappearance method which means the runoff data in a typical year will represent the runoff scenarios in the planning years according to statistics during the period of 1956 2016 the average annual precipitation in the uhrb was 867 mm deng et al 2019 while the average precipitation in 2012 was 835 mm since the precipitation in 2012 was close to the average value 2012 was selected as a typical year and its runoff process was chosen as the model input the initial reservoir capacity was adopted as the water level in early january 2012 and the characteristics of the reservoirs is shown in table 3 3 3 2 inner river ecological water demand tennant 1976 proposed a simple and effective methodology for calculating inner river ecological water demand without on site measurements the tenant method in which a certain percentage of average annual flow is taken as the ecological flow tian et al 2010 is adopted to determine inner river ecological water demand of each sections 40 of average annual flow is taken as the ecological flow during the flood season while the percentage for non flood season is 20 the calculated results are shown in table 4 3 3 3 water withdrawal of the middle route of snwdp the middle route of snwdp is a strategic multidecade infrastructure project undertaken by china she et al 2017 starting at danjiangkou reservoir in hanjiang river and ending at beijing and tianjin the water resources are transferred to beijing tianjin and cities in hebei henan and hubei provinces chen et al 2007 the project has already been operated to divert water since 2014 with multi year average water withdrawal of about 9 5 billion m³ and monthly water withdrawal is shown in fig 12 3 4 constraints as mentioned the optimization constraints are defined with respect to the water supply capacity and political factors under the 3 redlines water policy as shown in fig 10 the four subareas take water from the control sections of the mainstream of the hanjiang river and its tributaries on the one hand the total water supply from each source to the four cities should not exceed the available water supply from this source on the other hand the total water use and water use efficiency of the subareas should comply with the 3 redlines water policy the target values are extracted from report on comprehensive planning of main stream of hanjiang river while some present values are already within the redlines in this case the present value is taken as the constraint in the planning years the present value and target value of these indicators are shown in the table 5 4 results 4 1 predicted results of water demands the industrial agricultural domestic municipal and ecological water demands were predicted by the proposed sd model the ecological water demand here refers to the outer river ecological water demand it can be seen from the historical data that the variation range and proportion of ecological water demand are small while the maximum values of the four cities in the past years are all 0 11 108 m³ therefore this value is taken as the outer river ecological water demand of the four cities in the planning years 2025 and 2030 which will not be tested in this paper 2006 2017 was taken as the historical period 2018 was used as the test period as well as 2025 and 2030 were used as the prediction period relative error was used as a test index for model checking analysis green and stephenson 1986 generally speaking the relative error within 10 indicates that the model is applicable the calculated results are shown in table 6 it can be seen that the relative errors of all variables in the four cities are within 5 which is within the allowable error range therefore it can be considered that the simulation results of the water demands are consistent with the actual situation and meet the prediction accuracy thus the model is taken to predict the water demands of the uhrb in the planning years 2025 and 2030 the predicted results are shown in table 7 4 2 gaming relationship between different objectives due to ongoing conflict among different objectives it is a challenging task to simultaneously optimize multiple objectives hu et al 2016 in order to obtain the pareto optimal solution for water resources allocation of the uhrb in the planning years 2025 and 2030 a high performance multi objective algorithm called the nsga ii is executed in this study on the one hand the pareto optimal solution sets can provide more optional solutions for decision makers and on the other hand they can also show more game information of the multi objective optimization problems based on the obtained pareto optimal solution sets the game process among the objectives is drawn in figs 13 and 14 to figs 15 and 16 a significant competitive relationship between environmental objective and economic objective can be found in fig 14 the economic development of the uhrb mainly relies on industrial and agricultural production activities and the industrial production will generate a large amount of industrial sewage which poses a severe threat to the environment therefore when the allocation plan is to achieve a higher gdp the tos also increases on the contrary when the allocation plan tends to achieve better environmental objective the achievement of economic objective will decrease the game process among social goals economic goals and environmental goals is shown in figs 15 and 16 with the increase of igc the total values of gdp and tos show a downward trend the lower the overall gini coefficient it demonstrated that the distribution of water resources is biased towards developed cities with high gdp and large populations water use efficiency is closely related to urban development specifically the higher the city development the higher the water use efficiency and unit water use efficiency therefore when the allocation of water resources tends to be fair that is the lower igc the higher gdp and the tos will be produced within the basin when the allocation of water resources tends to be unfair the higher igc the gdp and tos will decrease the pareto solutions provide multiple design schemes with different target preferences for decision makers specifically the economic objective of the pareto optimal solution for 2025 is in a range of 459 394 billion yuan rmb to 859 486 billion yuan rmb while the gdp for the 2030 pareto optimal solution ranges from 806 333 billion yuan rmb to 1091 086 billion yuan rmb the social objective varies from 0 161 and 0 287 in 2025 as for 2030 it is between 0 141 and 0 225 in 2030 the gdp of the uhrb is higher than that in 2025 and the igc is lower than that in 2025 indicating that compared with 2025 the economy is more developed and water resources are more equitably allocated in 2030 which is consistent with the direction of social development progress 4 3 allocation scheme preference and adaptability analysis the flow of water resources in various regions and sectors is mainly driven by the macro control of the administrative agent and the adaptability the control information of the administrative agent is represented by the pareto optimal solution set and the objective function is the mathematical embodiment of the adaptability according to the previous analysis it is clear that the volume of water resources will flow to the more developed cities driven by the degree of adaptation to the social objective furthermore the reasonable optimal strategies should be determined to choose the final allocation scheme from the pareto optimal solution set according to different development targets the fluctuation of social objective is in a small range with the igc all less than 0 3 which means that there is good equity across the allocation options however water conflicts between the economy and the environment have been severe zhang et al 2019 therefore from the two focuses of economic and environmental objectives three allocation schemes were selected from each of the pareto optimal solution set for 2025 and 2030 a total of 12 schemes and the location of each scheme in the pareto optimal solution set is shown in fig 14 the benefits of multiple objectives achieved by each scheme are shown in table 9 where s denotes allocation schemes of the short term planning year 2025 and l denotes that of the long term planning year 2030 schemes 1 3 focus on environmental objective and schemes 4 6 focus on the economic objective the results of water resources allocation for each preferred scheme are as follows for the short term planning year 2025 it is shown that the values of tos increase with gdp increasing from schemes s1 to s6 as well as the values of igc change in a small range with gdp increasing from schemes s1 to s6 specifically the gdp values of schemes s1 s6 are increase from 4921 08 to 8559 67 with change amplitude 74 and the tos of schemes s1 s6 increase from 4 50 to 7 64 with change amplitude 70 it indicates that there is a strong competitive relationship between economic objective and environmental objective on the other hand it can be seen from fig 17 that for the four cities the volume of water allocated to industrial water user agent in schemes s4 s6 is overall higher than that of s1 s3 while the trend for the volume of water allocated to agricultural water user agent and municipal water user agent is the opposite for the long term planning year 2030 similarly it can be seen that the values of tos increase with gdp increasing from scheme s1 to s6 as well as the values of igc show a fluctuant decrease in a small range with gdp increasing from scheme l1 to l6 specifically the gdp values of schemes l1 l6 are increase from 8332 63 to 10 910 86 with change amplitude 31 and the tos of schemes s1 s6 increase from 7 47 to 9 55 with change amplitude 28 on the other hand it can be seen from fig 17 that for the four cities the volume of water allocated to industrial water user agent in schemes l4 l6 is overall higher than that of l1 l3 while the trend for the volume of water allocated to agricultural water user agent and municipal water user agent is the opposite that is when the selected scheme focuses on economic objective the water allocation will favor industrial water user agent while when the selected scheme focuses on environmental objective the water allocation will favor agricultural water user agent and municipal water user agent for the uhrb industry is the dominant factor in gdp growth and it will also cause more sewage to be discharged it is reasonable to some extent that limited water resources are firstly suited to improving human life and sustaining the necessary industries which may have more added value than agricultural products hanasaki et al 2018 in a nutshell water resources flow to industrial water user agent driven by the adaptation to economic objective to agricultural water user agent and municipal water user agent driven by the adaptation to environmental objective and to more developed cities driven by the adaptation to social objective 5 conclusions in this study an integrated model for optimal water resources allocation was proposed due to complementary strengths of the cas and sd the sd model is embedded into the cas framework and the sd model is joined in the stimulus response model which is the abm the water allocation system is simulated as cas consisting of administrative agent water user agents located at different levels interaction of agents is modeled based on abm at the macro level while internal logic is simulated based on sd at the micro level to evaluate the effect of policy changes on water demand the 3 redlines water policies were fully considered in the optimal module where the total water usage and water use efficiency redlines were set as constraints with water pollution redline as objective function the model was applied to the uhrb a crucial water source for the middle route of snwdp the nsga ii algorithm is executed to obtain the pareto optimal solution set for the optimal allocation of water resources in the planning years 2025 and 2030 on the one hand the pareto optimal solution set can provide more optional solutions for decision makers and on the other hand it can also show more game information of the multi objective optimization problem based on the obtained pareto optimal solution set the game relationship between each of two objectives is explored there is a significant competitive relationship between environmental objective and economic objective and there is a certain synergy relationship between social objective and economic objective from the two focuses of economic and environmental objectives a total of 12 schemes were selected from each of the pareto optimal solution set for 2025 and 2030 according to the results of water resources allocation for those 12 preferred schemes we can conclude that water resources flow to industrial water user agent driven by the adaptation to economic objective to agricultural water user agent and municipal water user agent driven by the adaptation to environmental objective and to more developed cities driven by the adaptation to social objective credit authorship contribution statement baowei yan conceptualization investigation supervision writing review editing funding

7928,study region tawaramoto town nara prefecture japan study focus in japan steep topography and humid climate make the country vulnerable to flooding and the importance of the flood mitigation function of rice paddy fields has been emphasized the paddy field dam project is being promoted to enhance the flood mitigation function by installing a runoff control plate in a drainage box however there are a few studies that have examined the effects of differences in rainfall patterns and rainfall intensity on the function of paddy field dam by examining possible future rainfall patterns we generated simulated rainfall patterns from the probability rainfall intensity formula and from the stochastic analysis of historical rainfall data for each rainfall scale we investigated the relationship between rainfall characteristics and the function of the runoff control plate new hydrological insight when different rainfall patterns simulated using stochastic methods were input to the model the peak ponding depth and difference in peak ponding depth compared to paddy plot without runoff control plate might be larger than when the unimodal rainfall with the almost same 24 h rainfall were input if the rainfall scale and hourly peak rainfall are determined we can estimate the possible range of the peak discharge mitigation rate and the difference in the peak ponding depth between the plot with and without the runoff control plate keywords rice paddy plot runoff control plate flood mitigation rainfall pattern 1 introduction in recent years several studies have shown that the frequency of extremely heavy rainfall events has been increasing under climate change min et al 2011 global warming affects rainfall at the spatial and temporal scale given that convection is enhanced under warmer conditions increasing the amount of water vapor pulled in from the surrounding environment westra et al 2014 similar relationships have also been observed in studies using climate models at mesoscales including at the regional level attema et al 2014 according to the latest intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc report the increase in the frequency of heavy rainfall is estimated to accelerate with increasing global warming as a global trend with 10 and 50 year return period rainfall events approximately double and triple respectively for 4 c of warming ipcc 2021 li et al 2021 flooding is the most common natural disaster in both developed and developing countries damage caused by flooding is one of the most costly and dangerous hazards and therefore has become a marked social concern ahern et al 2005 knapp et al 2008 hallegatte et al 2013 westra et al 2014 some studies have predicted changes in flooding due to climate change on a global scale milly et al 2002 hirabayashi et al 2008 hirabayashi et al 2013 predicted global flood risk for the end of this century based on the outputs of 11 climate models and demonstrated a substantial increase in flood frequency in some regions for the period from 1980 to 2011 reported flood losses adjusted for inflation have increased from an average of 7 billion per year in the 1980 s to 24 billion per year from 2001 to 2011 kundzewicz et al 2013 likewise in monsoon asia considered the most vulnerable region worldwide to flooding there are indications that the frequency and intensity of flooding may increase in the future with serious damage to human lives infrastructure and rice yield a major crop mirza 2011 auffhammer et al 2012 loo et al 2015 in japan the steep topography and humid climate with frequent typhoons make the country particularly vulnerable to flooding japan has been addressing flood control issues on long timescales takahasi and uitto 2004 the cost of flood damage caused by extreme rainfall with various return periods was estimated using numerical simulation and was found to increase nearly linearly with increases in extreme precipitation because of japan s topography kazama et al 2009 in recent years river flooding caused by heavy rains in western japan in 2018 and the kyushu region in 2020 resulted in severe human and property damage during the heavy rainfall event in western japan in 2018 1316 mm of precipitation was recorded over 72 h in the area that received the highest rainfall and 231 people were killed or went missing ushiyama et al 2019 during the heavy rainfall event in 2020 497 mm of precipitation was recorded in 24 h in the area that received the heaviest rainfall and 67 people were killed or missing in the kumamoto prefecture in the kyushu region japan cabinet office government of japan 2021 conventional flood protection and mitigation require the construction of hard infrastructure wheater 2006 however in japan the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism mlit has promoted a policy of river basin disaster resilience and sustainability by all in which all the stakeholders involved work together to mitigate flood damage in the whole basin besides conventional flood control measures previously conducted in fields related to agriculture retarding basins reservoirs and agricultural land could be used for flood control mlit 2021 in 2021 the government approved a law on these policies similar initiatives are known as catchment based flood management cbfm and natural flood management nfm in the uk nfm has been defined in many ways in literature lane 2017 the essence of the concept is to apply general flood management and hydrological principles holistically to develop techniques that replicate or enhance natural processes and demonstrably reduce the flood risk at all scales within a basin cooper et al 2021 in this framework offline storage areas are most effective at reducing local flood peaks for a small flash event in a small rural catchment and peak flow could be reduced by over 30 at downstream receptors nicholson et al 2020 catchment scale tree planning and in channel woody debris lead to modest mitigation of downstream flows this attenuation has been shown to influence not only the duration but also the timing of outfall inundation ferguson and fenner 2020 however while the participation and support of multiple stakeholders in the upper basin and local communities are essential for the success of nfm projects some stakeholders represented by farmers and landowners have a more cautious view of these changes howgate and kenyon 2009 bark et al 2021 rice paddy fields and irrigation and drainage activities have multiple functions such as production eco environmental and living associated functions kim et al 2006 huang et al 2006 matsuno et al 2006 in multifunctionality in paddy fields the flood mitigation function has been attracting attention as a method of reducing flood damage in the basin by using agricultural land enclosed by footpaths for flooding when large precipitation events occur paddy fields store rainwater temporarily and gradually discharge it downstream reducing direct runoff in taiwan substantial increases in runoff and decreases in groundwater recharge occur following conversion of rice paddy fields for other uses wu et al 2001 an approach used to improve the flood mitigation function of rice paddy areas is the paddy field dam project the main aim of this project is to reduce peak discharge from the paddy fields by controlling the water discharged during heavy rainfall events in the paddy field dam project a runoff control plate with an opening smaller than the original outlet in the drainage box is installed by narrowing the outlet for water drainage from the paddy plot storage can be increased and peak runoff can be reduced however the paddy ponding depth is easily increased when paddy field dams are constructed if the ponding depth increases and water overflows from the levees the possibility of levee collapse increases as water overflow is one of the most common causes of levee collapse mihara et al 1994 the submergence of rice plants during growth can reduce yield kotera et al 2005 kotera and nawata 2007 minakawa et al 2016 therefore the relevant indicator is important for assessing the yield of paddy cultivation many studies have evaluated the beneficial effects of paddy field dams in japan the peak discharge mitigation effects of the runoff control plate have been examined at the plot level yoshikawa et al 2009a kobayashi et al 2021 and district level yoshikawa et al 2009b 2010a miyazu et al 2012 the effects of different runoff control plate shapes on mitigation of peak discharge have also been investigated yoshikawa et al 2010b takeda and asaoka 2018 an economic evaluation of implementing the paddy field dam project has also been conducted yoshikawa et al 2011a miyazu et al 2013 oishi et al 2019 yoshikawa et al 2009a used center and backward concentrated wave patterns obtained from probability rainfall intensity formula to study the functions of runoff plates they reported that the effects of runoff control plates which can increase peak discharge mitigation and ponding depth differ within the same paddy plot based on rainfall pattern and rainfall intensity however the extent of this variation under various rainfall patterns is not clear kato and satoh 2002 investigated effects of peak flow mitigation of agricultural reservoirs during flood using several actual and stochastic rainfall waveforms and found that the effects were more variable when actual rainfall waves were used in the model however the effect of peak discharge mitigation and the degree of increase in peak ponding depth changes with the rainfall pattern in paddy field dam are not clear a recent study examined the effects of differences in various rainfall patterns and rainfall intensity on the function of paddy field dam by examining possible future rainfall scenarios minakawa and miyazu 2022 evaluated the effects of runoff control plate peak discharge mitigation rate and difference in peak ponding depth on a paddy plot using simulated rainfall generated by the method minakawa et al 2014 described in section 3 2 however minakawa and miyazu 2022 evaluated only the ensemble mean as a representative value for a given rainfall intensity and the distribution of rainfall was not considered hence other factors such as the occurrence of some rainfall pattern which can result in a greater increase in ponding depth were difficult to assess the present study aimed to clarify the range of effects and impacts of all possible rainfall patterns on the peak discharge mitigation rate as well as on the increase in paddy ponding depth it would be useful to clarify the effects in a single rice paddy plot to provide the potential flood mitigation effect and the potential rice inundation risk at the regional level in this study we assessed the flood mitigation function of a paddy plot with various simulated rainfall patterns we developed the discharge model to evaluate the discharge mitigation function of the runoff control plate an initial set of rainfall patterns was generated from the probability rainfall intensity formula for the study area we created 10 50 and 100 year return period simulated rainfall events with a single peak for each event we created three rainfall events with forward concentrated peak position 0 0 central concentrated peak position 0 5 and backward concentrated peak position 1 0 wave patterns and input them in the discharge model we conducted sensitivity analysis of the discharge model parameters for each rainfall pattern and examined other factors on these parameters a second set of rainfall patterns were generated stochastically from observed rainfall data using the method proposed by minakawa et al 2014 the method used for reproducing heavy rainfall is based on the monte carlo method which can generate simulated heavy rainfall that reproduces the wave patterns of previously recorded heavy rainfall events we created 1000 rainfall patterns for 100 150 and 200 mm d 1 for each rainfall scale we investigated the relationship between each rainfall characteristic and the functions of the runoff control plate and finally estimated the possible range of the functions 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydrological observations in the research plot a paddy plot in tawaramoto town nara prefecture japan in the yamato river basin 34 5440 n 135 8074 e was selected as the study site fig 1 in the yamato river basin 158 tributary rivers gather in a radial pattern and join within the basin to form the yamato river the yamato river basin is surrounded by mountains and is a typical low lying area with depressions in the plains where rainwater pools because of these topographical features a typhoon that hit the nara prefecture in august 1982 caused flooding below floor level in over 10 000 houses nara prefecture 2018a therefore some parts of the region are already working on the paddy field dam project with a focus on regional flood control we conducted temporal hydrological observations on the paddy plot short side 10 9 m long side 104 5 m 1 drainage box where a runoff control plate had been installed the cross sectional structure of the drainage box with the runoff control plate is shown in fig 2 the depth of the paddy pond and the water in the drainage box the depth upstream and downstream of the runoff control plate in the plot were measured precipitation values were converted to 5 min intervals by bisecting the 10 min interval precipitation values from the amedas automated meteorological data acquisition system tawaramoto station which is 2 km away from the study site the paddy ponding depth and the water depth in the drainage box were measured at 5 min intervals with an accuracy of 1 mm using capacitance type water gauges wt hr intech instruments ltd the discharge from the drainage box was equal to the discharge from the opening in the runoff control plate and was calculated from the difference in the water level upstream and downstream of the runoff control plate and the structure of the drainage box and the submerged opening in the runoff control plate the discharge from the submerged opening is expressed hydraulically in eq 1 1 q c a orif 2 g h where q is discharge m 3 s 1 c is the discharge coefficient a orif is the cross sectional area of the opening on the runoff control plate m2 g is the acceleration of gravity 9 81 m s 2 h is the difference in the water level between the upstream and downstream of the runoff control plate m when the water level downstream from the runoff control plate is lower than the top of the opening a orif in eq 1 is the cross sectional area where the opening is submerged in the water downstream of the runoff control plate the value of the discharge coefficient c was set to 0 6 based on the results of a calibration experiment in which several known constant flow rates entered the drainage box using a pump 2 2 discharge model of a paddy plot with a runoff control plate 2 2 1 discharge from the paddy plot into the drainage box as a model for the runoff from the paddy plot into the drainage box we constructed a hydrological model that accounts for the temporal runoff and infiltration based on the water balance the structure of the model is shown in fig 3 evapotranspiration was not included in the model because it would not have played a substantial role during a short rainfall event there was no inflow such as irrigation water or flood water to the plot other than rainfall this model could also estimate the discharge from the paddy plot where a runoff control plate had not been installed hereafter called plot without runoff control plate the calculation time interval was set to 1 s and the water balance was calculated for each time step to update the depth of the paddy pond the calculations are given in eqs 2 4 2 q 1 a h 1 z 3 2 3 i b h 1 4 d h 1 dt p i q 1 where q 1 is the discharge mm s 1 a is the parameter for runoff over the weir plate mm 1 2 s 1 h 1 is the paddy ponding depth on the soil surface mm z is the height of the weir plate height from the soil surface to the top of the weir plate mm i is the infiltration rate mm s 1 b is the parameter for infiltration s 1 and p is the amount of precipitation mm s 1 given that the overflow from the weir plate in the paddy plot could be assumed to be the overflow from a simplistic rectangular weir the exponent of eq 2 was set to 3 2 q 1 i and p in eqs 2 4 can be expressed in the unit of m 3 s 1 by multiplying by the plot area a plot m2 and applying the appropriate unit conversion the a and b parameters were identified so the observed discharge from the plot and the calculated discharge using the model were fitted during the period when the runoff from the paddy plot to the drainage box was equal to the water discharged from the drainage box into the drainage channel 2 2 2 discharge model of a paddy plot with a runoff control plate the effect of peak discharge mitigation in the paddy plot where the runoff control plate has been installed hereafter called plot with runoff control plate was evaluated by inputting the simulated rainfall into the discharge model as shown in section 3 we constructed the hydrological model to account for the effect of the runoff control plate in the drainage box as shown in fig 4 as parameters related to the drainage box q 2 is the discharge through the opening m 3 s 1 h 2 is the height from the center of the opening to the water level upstream of the runoff control plate m and h is the height from the center of the opening to the top of the weir plate m for calculating the discharge from the drainage box cases a and b are classified according to the water depth in the drainage box a when h 2 h the upstream water level of the runoff control plate is lower than the top of the weir plate until the upstream water level in the drainage box overflows from the top of the weir plate the relationship between the runoff q 1 from the plot to the drainage box and the discharge q 2 from the drainage box is expressed by eq 5 5 q 1 s d h 2 dt q 2 where s is the bottom area upstream of the runoff control plate the first term right is less than 1 of the second term right because s is relatively low 1 6 10 2 m2 for simplicity the first term on the right was ignored here therefore the discharge q 2 per calculation time step when h 2 h is given in eq 6 6 q 2 q 1 the water depth h 2 in the drainage box at each calculation time step was calculated as follows considering the effect of submerged discharge in the drainage box with the runoff control plate fig 4 the water running over the weir plate falls to the upstream side of the runoff control plate moves to the downstream side through the opening and discharges into the drainage channel through the pipe in the drainage box the cross sectional area of the opening a orif is less than the cross sectional area of the pipe a pipe so the discharge from the drainage box is defined by the size of the opening eq 7 7 q 3 q 2 q 3 was calculated with the assumption that the outlet pipe is a weir in line with the method proposed by yoshikawa et al 2011b we conducted a calibration experiment using a pump for the water to flow into a drainage box at several known constant flow rates with a runoff coefficient for the drainage pipe of 0 64 this value was close to the runoff coefficient of 0 62 obtained by yoshikawa et al 2011b for a similar pipe eq 8 was obtained from eqs 1 and 7 8 q 3 q 2 c a hole 2 g h 2 h 3 therefore if h 3 and q 3 or q 2 are known h 2 can be found and the relationship between discharge q 2 q 3 and h 2 is obtained therefore h 2 was successively updated according to q 1 at each calculation time step b when h 2 h the water level upstream of the runoff control plate is higher than the top of the weir plate when the water level upstream of the runoff control plate rises above the top of the weir plate then the water surface in the paddy and the drainage box are linked here the change in the water depth in the drainage box at each calculation step is expressed by eq 9 9 a plot s d h 2 dt a plot d h 2 dt p i q 2 and h 2 was updated successively according to this equation similar to the method described above s was assumed to be negligible in eq 9 because it was relatively low compared to the area of the plot a plot the discharge q 2 from the drainage box was obtained from the relationship between the discharge q 2 and h 2 by switching between the above two cases according to the water depth h 2 in the drainage box we calculated the discharge from the plot with the runoff control plate the actual height the two cases switch might be several centimeters higher than h but for simplicity this analysis assumes that the switch occurs at the height of h we have confirmed that this has little effect on the results 2 3 simulation using the discharge model 2 3 1 parameter identification for the discharge model the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 was used as an index to show concordance between the observed discharge and the simulated discharge from the discharge model nse is expressed by eq 10 10 nse 1 i 1 n ob s i si m i 2 i 1 n ob s i obs 2 and is widely used to describe the accuracy of hydrological models therefore it was used to identify the model parameters in this equation obs i and s im i are the observed and simulated values at time step i respectively n is the total number of time steps and o b s is the average of the observed values during the calculation period the a and b parameters of the model were identified so the observed discharge and ponding depth and the simulated discharge and ponding depth would be fitted when the water level upstream of the runoff control plate was lower than the top of the weir plate during the selected precipitation event the selected precipitation events for parameter identification were event 1 00 00 july 6 2020 15 00 july 7 2020 total precipitation 52 5 mm 5 min maximum precipitation 2 00 mm and event 2 7 00 july 7 2021 19 00 july 8 2021 total precipitation 81 5 mm 5 min maximum precipitation 2 25 mm given that z is expressed as the weir height we used the actual weir height measured with a ruler several days before the two precipitation events as the value for z the a and b parameters were adjusted so the observed discharge and the ponding depth and the simulated discharge and ponding depth were matched during the two precipitation events using the sce ua method duan et al 1992 2 3 2 simulation conditions the same simulated rainfall was input in the parameterized discharge model in the plot with and without the runoff control plate and the output results for the plot with and without the runoff control plate were compared and the effect of the runoff control plate was evaluated the simulated input rainfall that was input in the model is described in section 3 the conditions set for the simulation using simulated rainfall have been described subsequently a the plot area for 1 drainage box weir width 31 8 cm was set at 1130 m2 this simulation was based on the plot area of the research field and the number of drainage boxes one drainage box per paddy plot with an area of approximately 1130 m2 b the ponding depth has not exceeded the top of the runoff control plate and the height of the levee the discharge analysis in the model was conducted for one plot in this simulation it was assumed that the ponding depth did not exceed the height of the levee and there was no overflow beyond the levees the top of the runoff control plate was also assumed to be high enough and there was no overflow from the top of the runoff control plate c the weir height is the value at event 1 described in section 2 3 1 and the initial ponding depth is fixed at the weir height the height of the weir plate and the ponding depth at the beginning of rainfall vary according to the precipitation events in this simulation the height of the weir plate was set to the value for event 1 130 mm the initial ponding depth was also fixed at the height of the weir plate 130 mm thus there was no space for precipitation to pool in the paddy plot at the beginning of the simulation 3 rainfall patterns input in the discharge model 3 1 simulated rainfall patterns generated from the probability rainfall intensity formula the rainfall patterns input in the discharge model were decided based on the probability rainfall intensity formula of nara prefecture japan and the method of generating probability rainfall used in river flood control projects and the design standards to regulate reservoirs for disaster prevention nara prefecture 2018b sato 1987 we created 10 50 and 100 year return period simulated rainfall events with a single peak and for each event we created three rainfall events with forward concentrated peak position 0 0 central concentrated peak position 0 5 and backward concentrated peak position 1 0 wave patterns given that for the technical standards for the paddy field dam project in nara prefecture japan nara prefecture 2018c a standard duration of 24 h was used for the planned rainfall the duration of the simulated rainfall generated in this simulation was also set to 24 h the probability rainfall intensity formula for nara prefecture japan and the characteristics of the simulated rainfall are shown in table 1 3 2 simulated rainfall patterns generated from the probabilistic statistical method minakawa et al 2014 developed a method for reproducing heavy rainfall events which reproduces the wave patterns of previously recorded heavy rainfall events based on the monte carlo method using this method as a reference simulated rainfall patterns were created the methods described below are not all the same as those of minakawa et al 2014 the flowchart to generate the simulated rainfall patterns is shown in fig 5 3 2 1 preparation for a simulated heavy rainfall event the precipitation data observed at the amedas tawaramoto station every 10 min for 27 years from january 1994 to december 2020 were used the duration of heavy rainfall was set at 24 h which is the same as the duration of the planned rainfall described in section 3 1 a rainfall threshold was set and events exceeding the threshold were extracted as heavy rainfall we extracted 80 heavy rainfall events 2 96 events per year on average over 27 years by setting the threshold for heavy rainfall at 50 mm d 1 the rainfall scale generated was fixed at 100 150 and 200 mm d 1 for each rainfall scale 1000 heavy rainfall events were generated the gumbel distribution was applied to the annual maximum daily rainfall data observed at the amedas tawaramoto station over the last 40 years and the return periods for each rainfall scale were estimated to be 4 18 and 86 years respectively because the probability rainfall intensity formula used in section 3 1 is for nara prefecture not for tawaramoto town the estimated return period for each rainfall scale differs slightly from the return period for the unimodal rainfall produced in section 3 1 3 2 2 determination of the distribution ratio to the hourly rainfall the total rainfall was distributed to the 10 min rainfall for the 1000 heavy rains generated for each rainfall event the 10 min rainfall values were calculated by multiplying the total rainfall by the distribution ratio of each time step the length of one array was 144 24 h duration 10 min intervals the distribution ratio d t at time step t was the value of 0 1 obtained according to the beta distribution the parameters of the beta distribution were determined by trial and the shape of the distribution was exponential so that the rainfall intensity distribution obtained was close to the observed distribution this was because the intensity distribution of short duration rainfall during heavy rainfall can be approximated using an exponential distribution in this study the rainfall scale was fixed at 100 150 and 200 mm d 1 therefore the intensity distribution was close to that of the observed rainfall which was extended to each rainfall scale for extending the observed rainfall the actual rainfall is sometimes extended to equal the planned rainfall for river flood control planning and the extension ratio should be limited to approximately 2 0 we extracted 17 12 and 9 observed rainfall events by limiting the extension ratio of 0 80 1 25 0 56 1 80 and 0 48 2 10 at the rainfall scale of 100 150 and 200 mm d 1 respectively fig 6 shows the distribution of the 10 min rainfall occurrence for each rainfall scale for the extended observed rainfall and the simulated rainfall events the distributed rainfall arrays were reordered to match the autocorrelation coefficient of the simulated rainfall patterns to that of the observed rainfall patterns for this purpose a quasi rainfall array x was generated assuming the elements of the array were x i i 1 2 144 the values were determined using exponential distribution eq 12 12 f x i u i 1 exp λ x i where λ is the scale parameter of the exponential distribution this value represents the inverse of the expected value of the distribution by definition first x 1 was a randomly selected value from the 144 rainfall values to be sorted u 1 was in the range 0 1 we needed to consider the correlation of x 2 with x 1 where we could determine the value of u 2 considering the correlation with u 1 and then x 2 could be determined by eq 12 the value of u 2 was assumed to follow a triangular distribution with u 1 as the most frequent value and the minimum value l tri and maximum value r tri as the values obtained from eq 13 l tri max 0 u 1 w 13 r tri min 0 u 1 w the parameter w was determined by trial and error so that the autocorrelation coefficient of the final quasi rainfall array was a good fit for the autocorrelation coefficient of the observed rainfall events after generating the quasi rainfall values the distributed rainfall values were reordered so the rank order of the distributed rainfall array would be the same as the rank order of the quasi rainfall array the autocorrelation coefficients for the observed rainfall and the simulated rainfall were calculated and compared given that the autocorrelation coefficients were different for each event we calculated them individually for each event and the average of the whole was the representative value the correlogram for the observed and simulated heavy rainfall series for each rainfall scale is shown in fig 7 the parameter w was determined with the importance that the autocorrelation coefficient of the simulated rainfall should be fitted to the autocorrelation coefficient of the observed rainfall when the lag time was low these results demonstrated that generated rainfall represents the autocorrelation coefficient of the observed rainfall at each rainfall scale 4 results and discussion 4 1 parameter identification results for the discharge model parameters a and b in the discharge model in fig 3 were identified so the observed and calculated discharge and ponding depth would match each other during the event 1 and event 2 precipitation events shown in section 2 3 1 for the analysis the units of parameters a and b are expressed in mm 1 2 5 min 1 and 5 min 1 respectively therefore for identifying the parameters a 4 80 10 3 mm 1 2 5 min 1 and b 4 87 10 5 5 min 1 applying an appropriate unit conversion to parameter a and converting it to the unit system of the runoff coefficient c rect in the rectangular weir formula eq 14 14 q c rect b h 3 2 we obtained c rect 1 80 this value does not differ substantially from the value of c rect 1 90 from the study by yoshikawa et al 2009a in this equation b is the width of the weir plate m and h is the overflow depth m the parameter z was set at z 130 mm for event 1 and z 147 mm for event 2 to match the actual height of the weir plate during the precipitation events fig 8 shows the time changes for the observed discharge and the calculated discharge for both precipitation events using the discharge model the nse calculated from the temporal observed and calculated discharge for both events was nse 0 83 for event 1 and nse 0 93 for event 2 nse is considered a good fit for hydrological models with a value 0 70 moriashi et al 2015 thus the model could effectively reproduce the actual discharge process from the paddy plot event 1 shows a brief increase in discharge at 13 20 on july 6 but no substantial rainfall was observed at the amedas tawaramoto station however the observed ponding depth substantially increased indicating that highly localized rainfall occurred around the study plot the model could not reproduce this discharge fig 8 also shows the temporal changes in the observed and depth during both precipitation events the error was evaluated by the rmse which is expressed with eq 15 15 rmse i 1 n ob s i si m i 2 n the rmse for both precipitation events was 1 7 mm for event 1 and 3 6 mm for event 2 with a slightly higher value for event 2 with consistent trends therefore the discharge model was used after the parameter identification to simulate the different input rainfall patterns 4 2 inputting the rainfall patterns generated by the probability rainfall intensity formula for each simulation the calculation time was set to 48 h and a unimodal rainfall pattern was set to the first 24 h fig 9 shows the temporal change in the discharge from the plot with and without the control plate under the unimodal rainfall patterns generated according to the method described in section 3 1 this figure represents results for forward central and backward concentrated rainfall with a 50 year return period input in the model the results of the other rainfall patterns input in the discharge model are summarized in table 2 the peak discharge mitigation rate is defined by eq 16 16 ρ 1 q p dam q p norm where r is the peak discharge mitigation rate q p dam is the peak discharge from the plot with the runoff control plate and q p norm is the peak discharge from the plot without the runoff control plate the difference in the peak ponding depth between the plot with and without the runoff control plate is defined by eq 17 17 δ h p dam h p norm where d is the difference in the peak ponding depth between the plot with and without the runoff control plate h p dam is the peak ponding depth of the plot with the discharge control pate h p norm is the peak ponding depth of the plot without the runoff control plate this is an indicator of the extent to which the peak ponding depth increases when the runoff control plate is installed compared to when no plate is installed these results showed that for each return period the peak discharge mitigation rates for center and backward concentrated precipitation events were similar and higher than the peak discharge mitigation rate for forward concentrated precipitation events this may be due to center and backward concentrated rainfall patterns contributing more to the peak discharge from the paddy plot without the runoff control plate than for the forward concentrated rainfall pattern the difference in the peak ponding depth was slightly larger for the input of centralized rainfall than for the input of forward and backward concentrated rainfall with a difference of 17 2 mm for the 100 year return period centralized rainfall this could be due to the centralized rainfall pattern having a larger amount of precipitation near the peak precipitation which increases the ponding depth more than the forward and backward concentrated rainfall patterns 4 3 sensitivity analysis for model parameters and initial ponding depth the function of the runoff control plate is influenced by the characteristics of the plots and the ponding depth at the start of the rainfall we conducted sensitivity analysis to determine how the peak discharge mitigation rate changes with the input rainfall return period and the peak location when the model parameters a b the height of the weir plate z and the initial ponding depth h init were changed the parameters were based on those obtained in section 4 1 the value of parameter z was used for event 1 and the targeted parameters were changed the initial ponding depth was fixed at the value of parameter z and the discharge delay due to the room for precipitation to pool was not considered an initial condition fig 10 shows the change in the peak discharge mitigation rate for input of nine types of rainfall with different return periods and peak locations when the parameters a b z and h init were changed the meaning of parameter a is a factor that defines the amount of discharge over the weir plate of the drainage box in the actual plot because the larger a is the larger the discharge when the overflow depth is equal the width of the weir plate installed in the drainage box the runoff coefficient of the weir plate and the slope toward the paddy plot outlet are considered the main factors parameter a was changed in the range of 2 5 10 3 6 5 10 3 mm 1 2 5 min 1 if we convert to the unit system of the runoff coefficient c rect in eq 14 the range of c rect is 0 94 2 44 for each rainfall input to the model the larger the value of parameter a the larger the peak discharge mitigation rate the difference in the peak discharge mitigation rate became smaller as the value of parameter a increased when both forward and backward concentrated rainfall patterns were entered in the discharge model for the same return period rainfall the meaning of parameter b is the infiltration rate of the plot parameter b varied in the range of 0 0 1 0 10 3 5 min 1 from eq 3 this corresponds to an infiltration rate of 0 0 43 2 mm d 1 in a plot where the ponding depth is always maintained at 150 mm for each rainfall input in the model the peak discharge mitigation rate decreased as the value of parameter b increased change in the peak discharge mitigation rate with the change in parameter b was small and almost constant for each rainfall the meaning of parameter z is the length from the surface of the plot to the top of the weir plate parameter z was changed from 0 to 150 mm this is zero for the non irrigation period when the weir plate was not installed and is the height of the weir plate installed by farmers for the irrigation period the initial ponding depth h init was fixed to the value of parameter z for each rainfall input to the model the peak discharge mitigation rate decreased as the value of parameter z increased change in the peak discharge mitigation rate with the change in parameter z was small as resulted from the sensitivity analysis for parameter b the initial ponding depth h init at the beginning of the rainfall changed from 0 to 130 mm the value of the 130 mm is the value of parameter z in event 1 when the 100 year return period center and backward concentrated rainfall patterns were input in the model the peak discharge mitigation rate was almost constant regardless of h init however when other rainfall patterns were entered the discharge mitigation rate in the plot with the runoff control plate increased as h init increased these results indicate that the peak discharge mitigation rate changes depending on the characteristics of the paddy plot with the runoff control plate the return period and the peak location of the rainfall events 4 4 inputting simulated rainfall patterns generated from the probabilistic statistical method a total of 3000 simulated rainfall events were generated for three rainfall scales of 100 150 and 200 mm d 1 1000 events for each scale the discharge mitigation rate the peak ponding depth in the plot with and without the runoff control plate and the difference between them were investigated the calculation time was 72 h and simulated rainfall was entered in the first 24 h fig 11 shows the distribution of the peak discharge mitigation rate for the plot with the runoff control plate and the difference in the peak ponding depth between the plot with and without the runoff control plate for each rainfall scale the distribution shape was shown using a violin plot which is a combination of line segments showing the maximum median and minimum values dots showing mean values and a histogram the distribution of the peak discharge mitigation ratio showed that the maximum minimum median and mean values of the peak discharge mitigation ratio increased with increasing rainfall and the range of the peak discharge mitigation ratio decreased the relationship between the rainfall scale and the difference in the peak ponding depth in the plot with and without the runoff control plate showed that the maximum median and mean values for the difference in the peak ponding depth increased as the rainfall scale increased and the range of the difference in the peak ponding depth increased minakawa and miyazu 2022 only assessed the mean values however the results of the present study suggest that the mean value for each rainfall pattern did not necessarily coincide with the mode and median of the distribution the frequency distribution of the peak ponding depth for each rainfall scale in the plot with and without the runoff control plate is shown in fig 12 these histograms showed that the distribution shifted toward the higher peak ponding depth with the increase of the rainfall scale in both the plots with and without the runoff control plate as the rainfall scale increased the distribution shifted more toward the larger peak ponding depth in the plot with and without the runoff control plate and the difference in the peak ponding depth between them became greater when carrying out the paddy field dam project it is important to maintain and manage the storage function of rice paddy fields to make the runoff control plate effective yoshikawa and tsubaki 2016 results obtained from the simulations indicate that the peak ponding depth will be less than 260 mm even during large rainfall events the possibility of overflow from the levees is small if the levee height is greater than 260 mm in this study area fig 13 shows a scatter plot of the hourly peak rainfall on the horizontal axis and the peak discharge mitigation rate on the vertical axis for 1000 simulated rainfall events generated at each of the three rainfall scales 3000 events the results of using unimodal rainfall patterns with three 50 year return periods total rainfall 215 mm d 1 hourly peak precipitation 69 5 mm h 1 in the model are also represented in fig 13 the range of the peak discharge mitigation rate shifts higher as the rainfall scale increases the range of hourly peak precipitation distribution shifts higher as the rainfall scale increases despite slight differences in daily precipitation compared to 200 mm d 1 the results for unimodal rainfall especially backward concentrated rainfall input to the model were located at the top of the distribution of dots in fig 13 fig 14 shows a scatter plot of the hourly peak rainfall on the horizontal axis and the difference in the peak ponding depth in the plot with and without the runoff control plate on the vertical axis the results of using three forward center and backward concentrated 50 year return period unimodal rainfall patterns total rainfall 215 mm d 1 hourly peak precipitation 69 5 mm h 1 in the model are also shown in fig 14 the range of the difference in the peak ponding depth between the plot with and without the runoff control plate becomes wider as the rainfall scale increases when the three unimodal rainfall patterns were used in the model the differences observed in peak ponding depth between the plots with and without control plate were all situated at the bottom of the distribution of dots in fig 14 as shown in table 2 and figs 11 12 and 14 when the simulated rainfall patterns created by the method of minakawa et al 2014 were input to the model the peak ponding depth and the difference in peak ponding depth might be larger than when the unimodal rainfall waveform with the same 24 h rainfall were input in paddy plot without control plate therefore it would be inadequate to consider only unimodal rainfall pattern when considering the risk of levee collapse and yield reduction associated with increased ponding depths due to use of control plates 4 5 relationship between the peak rainfall and the effects of the runoff control plate figs 13 and 14 indicate that the dots are concentrated and distributed within a limited range respectively for example fig 13 shows that the dots are concentrated inside the area bounded by the curve that rises from approximately 40 mm hourly peak rainfall and approximately follows the lower side of the distribution the curve that rises from approximately 20 mm hourly peak rainfall and approximately follows the upper side of the distribution and the horizontal axis from these results it was considered possible to estimate the degree of the peak discharge mitigation rate and the difference in the peak ponding depth in the plot with and without the runoff control plate based on the rainfall scale and the hourly peak rainfall the peak discharge mitigation rate curve is defined as the lower limit curve and the difference in the peak ponding depth is defined as the upper limit curve the peak discharge mitigation rate is expressed by eq 16 because q p dam in eq 16 is almost constant the value of q p norm contributes the most to the peak discharge mitigation rate and the smaller the value of q p norm the smaller the peak discharge mitigation rate the larger the value of q p norm the larger the peak discharge mitigation rate for a set of rainfall patterns with a determined hourly peak rainfall at each rainfall scale the peak discharge mitigation rate when the pattern with the lowest rainfall contributes to the peak discharge is input in the discharge model is drawn as the lower limit curve while changing the hourly peak rainfall when the rainfall patterns with the highest rainfall contributing to the peak discharge are input in the discharge model the peak discharge mitigation rate is drawn as the upper limit curve while changing the hourly peak precipitation based on this hypothesis the rainfall pattern that forms the curve close to the lower limit concentrates the peak rainfall in the first hour while the rainfall pattern that forms the curve close to the upper limit continues the peak rainfall for rainfall scale hourly peak precipitation hours if the hourly peak rainfall is 50 mm for a rainfall scale of 200 mm the rainfall pattern that forms a curve close to the lower limit is considered the result from concentrating the peak rainfall of 50 mm in the first hour and distributing 150 mm over the remaining 23 h however we assumed that 150 mm of precipitation could be freely distributed so as not to contribute to the peak discharge in the remaining 23 h and it was expected that the rainfall pattern that forms the curve close to the lower limit could be approximated by the rainfall pattern with the peak rainfall of 50 mm concentrated only in the first hour the rainfall pattern that forms the curve close to the upper limit was expected to be approximated to the rainfall pattern with the peak rainfall of 50 mm h 1 which continued for 4 h for each rainfall scale the rainfall pattern that forms a curve close to the lower limit and a curve close to the upper limit is generated by changing the hourly peak rainfall from 20 mm to the value of each rainfall scale by 1 mm the curves drawn from the lower and upper limits are shown in fig 15 according to this figure the distribution plotted for each rainfall scale is concentrated in the area bounded by the lower and upper curves indicating that the hypothesis is valid fig 16 also shows a figure drawn by superimposing the lower and upper limit curves in fig 14 in this figure the distribution plotted on each rainfall scale is concentrated in the area surrounded by the lower limit curve and the upper limit curve however it can be seen that no dots are present near the upper limit curve which implies that the probability of a rainfall event with such results is extremely low further probabilistic analyses can be undertaken to narrow this range in future in summary if the rainfall scale and the hourly peak rainfall are determined the possible range of the peak discharge mitigation rate and the difference in the peak ponding depth between the plot with and without the runoff control plate can be estimated 5 conclusions we developed a discharge model to evaluate the discharge mitigation function of the runoff control plate and compared the results when inputting various rainfall patterns the main conclusions of the present study are summarized below i the peak discharge mitigation rate and difference in peak ponding depth changed depending on the characteristics of the paddy plot with the runoff control plate the return period and the peak location of the rainfall the difference in the peak discharge mitigation rate between the forward and backward concentrated rainfall input in the discharge model for the same return period rainfall became smaller as the value of parameter a the weir width installed in the drainage box the runoff coefficient of the weir plate and the slope of the rice paddy plot to the outlet increased ii when the simulated rainfall patterns created by stochastic method were input to the model the peak ponding depth and the difference in peak ponding depth compared to paddy plot without runoff control plate might be larger than when the unimodal rainfall waveform with the almost same 24 h rainfall were input the possible range of the peak discharge mitigation rate in the plot with the runoff control plate and the difference in the peak ponding depth between the plot with and without the runoff control plate can be estimated if the rainfall scale and the hourly peak rainfall are determined in the future the model developed in this study which can calculate the water balance of the plot with the runoff control plate will be incorporated into a model that can perform district level inundation analysis to quantitatively evaluate the effects of runoff control plates when various rainfall patterns occur in districts with different land uses various rainfall patterns were created based on the rainfall data observed in the past in this study to verify the effects of the runoff control plate when entering expected future rainfall under climate change we will use the output results from the global climate model to examine the role of agricultural land in basin level flood control

7928,study region tawaramoto town nara prefecture japan study focus in japan steep topography and humid climate make the country vulnerable to flooding and the importance of the flood mitigation function of rice paddy fields has been emphasized the paddy field dam project is being promoted to enhance the flood mitigation function by installing a runoff control plate in a drainage box however there are a few studies that have examined the effects of differences in rainfall patterns and rainfall intensity on the function of paddy field dam by examining possible future rainfall patterns we generated simulated rainfall patterns from the probability rainfall intensity formula and from the stochastic analysis of historical rainfall data for each rainfall scale we investigated the relationship between rainfall characteristics and the function of the runoff control plate new hydrological insight when different rainfall patterns simulated using stochastic methods were input to the model the peak ponding depth and difference in peak ponding depth compared to paddy plot without runoff control plate might be larger than when the unimodal rainfall with the almost same 24 h rainfall were input if the rainfall scale and hourly peak rainfall are determined we can estimate the possible range of the peak discharge mitigation rate and the difference in the peak ponding depth between the plot with and without the runoff control plate keywords rice paddy plot runoff control plate flood mitigation rainfall pattern 1 introduction in recent years several studies have shown that the frequency of extremely heavy rainfall events has been increasing under climate change min et al 2011 global warming affects rainfall at the spatial and temporal scale given that convection is enhanced under warmer conditions increasing the amount of water vapor pulled in from the surrounding environment westra et al 2014 similar relationships have also been observed in studies using climate models at mesoscales including at the regional level attema et al 2014 according to the latest intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc report the increase in the frequency of heavy rainfall is estimated to accelerate with increasing global warming as a global trend with 10 and 50 year return period rainfall events approximately double and triple respectively for 4 c of warming ipcc 2021 li et al 2021 flooding is the most common natural disaster in both developed and developing countries damage caused by flooding is one of the most costly and dangerous hazards and therefore has become a marked social concern ahern et al 2005 knapp et al 2008 hallegatte et al 2013 westra et al 2014 some studies have predicted changes in flooding due to climate change on a global scale milly et al 2002 hirabayashi et al 2008 hirabayashi et al 2013 predicted global flood risk for the end of this century based on the outputs of 11 climate models and demonstrated a substantial increase in flood frequency in some regions for the period from 1980 to 2011 reported flood losses adjusted for inflation have increased from an average of 7 billion per year in the 1980 s to 24 billion per year from 2001 to 2011 kundzewicz et al 2013 likewise in monsoon asia considered the most vulnerable region worldwide to flooding there are indications that the frequency and intensity of flooding may increase in the future with serious damage to human lives infrastructure and rice yield a major crop mirza 2011 auffhammer et al 2012 loo et al 2015 in japan the steep topography and humid climate with frequent typhoons make the country particularly vulnerable to flooding japan has been addressing flood control issues on long timescales takahasi and uitto 2004 the cost of flood damage caused by extreme rainfall with various return periods was estimated using numerical simulation and was found to increase nearly linearly with increases in extreme precipitation because of japan s topography kazama et al 2009 in recent years river flooding caused by heavy rains in western japan in 2018 and the kyushu region in 2020 resulted in severe human and property damage during the heavy rainfall event in western japan in 2018 1316 mm of precipitation was recorded over 72 h in the area that received the highest rainfall and 231 people were killed or went missing ushiyama et al 2019 during the heavy rainfall event in 2020 497 mm of precipitation was recorded in 24 h in the area that received the heaviest rainfall and 67 people were killed or missing in the kumamoto prefecture in the kyushu region japan cabinet office government of japan 2021 conventional flood protection and mitigation require the construction of hard infrastructure wheater 2006 however in japan the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism mlit has promoted a policy of river basin disaster resilience and sustainability by all in which all the stakeholders involved work together to mitigate flood damage in the whole basin besides conventional flood control measures previously conducted in fields related to agriculture retarding basins reservoirs and agricultural land could be used for flood control mlit 2021 in 2021 the government approved a law on these policies similar initiatives are known as catchment based flood management cbfm and natural flood management nfm in the uk nfm has been defined in many ways in literature lane 2017 the essence of the concept is to apply general flood management and hydrological principles holistically to develop techniques that replicate or enhance natural processes and demonstrably reduce the flood risk at all scales within a basin cooper et al 2021 in this framework offline storage areas are most effective at reducing local flood peaks for a small flash event in a small rural catchment and peak flow could be reduced by over 30 at downstream receptors nicholson et al 2020 catchment scale tree planning and in channel woody debris lead to modest mitigation of downstream flows this attenuation has been shown to influence not only the duration but also the timing of outfall inundation ferguson and fenner 2020 however while the participation and support of multiple stakeholders in the upper basin and local communities are essential for the success of nfm projects some stakeholders represented by farmers and landowners have a more cautious view of these changes howgate and kenyon 2009 bark et al 2021 rice paddy fields and irrigation and drainage activities have multiple functions such as production eco environmental and living associated functions kim et al 2006 huang et al 2006 matsuno et al 2006 in multifunctionality in paddy fields the flood mitigation function has been attracting attention as a method of reducing flood damage in the basin by using agricultural land enclosed by footpaths for flooding when large precipitation events occur paddy fields store rainwater temporarily and gradually discharge it downstream reducing direct runoff in taiwan substantial increases in runoff and decreases in groundwater recharge occur following conversion of rice paddy fields for other uses wu et al 2001 an approach used to improve the flood mitigation function of rice paddy areas is the paddy field dam project the main aim of this project is to reduce peak discharge from the paddy fields by controlling the water discharged during heavy rainfall events in the paddy field dam project a runoff control plate with an opening smaller than the original outlet in the drainage box is installed by narrowing the outlet for water drainage from the paddy plot storage can be increased and peak runoff can be reduced however the paddy ponding depth is easily increased when paddy field dams are constructed if the ponding depth increases and water overflows from the levees the possibility of levee collapse increases as water overflow is one of the most common causes of levee collapse mihara et al 1994 the submergence of rice plants during growth can reduce yield kotera et al 2005 kotera and nawata 2007 minakawa et al 2016 therefore the relevant indicator is important for assessing the yield of paddy cultivation many studies have evaluated the beneficial effects of paddy field dams in japan the peak discharge mitigation effects of the runoff control plate have been examined at the plot level yoshikawa et al 2009a kobayashi et al 2021 and district level yoshikawa et al 2009b 2010a miyazu et al 2012 the effects of different runoff control plate shapes on mitigation of peak discharge have also been investigated yoshikawa et al 2010b takeda and asaoka 2018 an economic evaluation of implementing the paddy field dam project has also been conducted yoshikawa et al 2011a miyazu et al 2013 oishi et al 2019 yoshikawa et al 2009a used center and backward concentrated wave patterns obtained from probability rainfall intensity formula to study the functions of runoff plates they reported that the effects of runoff control plates which can increase peak discharge mitigation and ponding depth differ within the same paddy plot based on rainfall pattern and rainfall intensity however the extent of this variation under various rainfall patterns is not clear kato and satoh 2002 investigated effects of peak flow mitigation of agricultural reservoirs during flood using several actual and stochastic rainfall waveforms and found that the effects were more variable when actual rainfall waves were used in the model however the effect of peak discharge mitigation and the degree of increase in peak ponding depth changes with the rainfall pattern in paddy field dam are not clear a recent study examined the effects of differences in various rainfall patterns and rainfall intensity on the function of paddy field dam by examining possible future rainfall scenarios minakawa and miyazu 2022 evaluated the effects of runoff control plate peak discharge mitigation rate and difference in peak ponding depth on a paddy plot using simulated rainfall generated by the method minakawa et al 2014 described in section 3 2 however minakawa and miyazu 2022 evaluated only the ensemble mean as a representative value for a given rainfall intensity and the distribution of rainfall was not considered hence other factors such as the occurrence of some rainfall pattern which can result in a greater increase in ponding depth were difficult to assess the present study aimed to clarify the range of effects and impacts of all possible rainfall patterns on the peak discharge mitigation rate as well as on the increase in paddy ponding depth it would be useful to clarify the effects in a single rice paddy plot to provide the potential flood mitigation effect and the potential rice inundation risk at the regional level in this study we assessed the flood mitigation function of a paddy plot with various simulated rainfall patterns we developed the discharge model to evaluate the discharge mitigation function of the runoff control plate an initial set of rainfall patterns was generated from the probability rainfall intensity formula for the study area we created 10 50 and 100 year return period simulated rainfall events with a single peak for each event we created three rainfall events with forward concentrated peak position 0 0 central concentrated peak position 0 5 and backward concentrated peak position 1 0 wave patterns and input them in the discharge model we conducted sensitivity analysis of the discharge model parameters for each rainfall pattern and examined other factors on these parameters a second set of rainfall patterns were generated stochastically from observed rainfall data using the method proposed by minakawa et al 2014 the method used for reproducing heavy rainfall is based on the monte carlo method which can generate simulated heavy rainfall that reproduces the wave patterns of previously recorded heavy rainfall events we created 1000 rainfall patterns for 100 150 and 200 mm d 1 for each rainfall scale we investigated the relationship between each rainfall characteristic and the functions of the runoff control plate and finally estimated the possible range of the functions 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydrological observations in the research plot a paddy plot in tawaramoto town nara prefecture japan in the yamato river basin 34 5440 n 135 8074 e was selected as the study site fig 1 in the yamato river basin 158 tributary rivers gather in a radial pattern and join within the basin to form the yamato river the yamato river basin is surrounded by mountains and is a typical low lying area with depressions in the plains where rainwater pools because of these topographical features a typhoon that hit the nara prefecture in august 1982 caused flooding below floor level in over 10 000 houses nara prefecture 2018a therefore some parts of the region are already working on the paddy field dam project with a focus on regional flood control we conducted temporal hydrological observations on the paddy plot short side 10 9 m long side 104 5 m 1 drainage box where a runoff control plate had been installed the cross sectional structure of the drainage box with the runoff control plate is shown in fig 2 the depth of the paddy pond and the water in the drainage box the depth upstream and downstream of the runoff control plate in the plot were measured precipitation values were converted to 5 min intervals by bisecting the 10 min interval precipitation values from the amedas automated meteorological data acquisition system tawaramoto station which is 2 km away from the study site the paddy ponding depth and the water depth in the drainage box were measured at 5 min intervals with an accuracy of 1 mm using capacitance type water gauges wt hr intech instruments ltd the discharge from the drainage box was equal to the discharge from the opening in the runoff control plate and was calculated from the difference in the water level upstream and downstream of the runoff control plate and the structure of the drainage box and the submerged opening in the runoff control plate the discharge from the submerged opening is expressed hydraulically in eq 1 1 q c a orif 2 g h where q is discharge m 3 s 1 c is the discharge coefficient a orif is the cross sectional area of the opening on the runoff control plate m2 g is the acceleration of gravity 9 81 m s 2 h is the difference in the water level between the upstream and downstream of the runoff control plate m when the water level downstream from the runoff control plate is lower than the top of the opening a orif in eq 1 is the cross sectional area where the opening is submerged in the water downstream of the runoff control plate the value of the discharge coefficient c was set to 0 6 based on the results of a calibration experiment in which several known constant flow rates entered the drainage box using a pump 2 2 discharge model of a paddy plot with a runoff control plate 2 2 1 discharge from the paddy plot into the drainage box as a model for the runoff from the paddy plot into the drainage box we constructed a hydrological model that accounts for the temporal runoff and infiltration based on the water balance the structure of the model is shown in fig 3 evapotranspiration was not included in the model because it would not have played a substantial role during a short rainfall event there was no inflow such as irrigation water or flood water to the plot other than rainfall this model could also estimate the discharge from the paddy plot where a runoff control plate had not been installed hereafter called plot without runoff control plate the calculation time interval was set to 1 s and the water balance was calculated for each time step to update the depth of the paddy pond the calculations are given in eqs 2 4 2 q 1 a h 1 z 3 2 3 i b h 1 4 d h 1 dt p i q 1 where q 1 is the discharge mm s 1 a is the parameter for runoff over the weir plate mm 1 2 s 1 h 1 is the paddy ponding depth on the soil surface mm z is the height of the weir plate height from the soil surface to the top of the weir plate mm i is the infiltration rate mm s 1 b is the parameter for infiltration s 1 and p is the amount of precipitation mm s 1 given that the overflow from the weir plate in the paddy plot could be assumed to be the overflow from a simplistic rectangular weir the exponent of eq 2 was set to 3 2 q 1 i and p in eqs 2 4 can be expressed in the unit of m 3 s 1 by multiplying by the plot area a plot m2 and applying the appropriate unit conversion the a and b parameters were identified so the observed discharge from the plot and the calculated discharge using the model were fitted during the period when the runoff from the paddy plot to the drainage box was equal to the water discharged from the drainage box into the drainage channel 2 2 2 discharge model of a paddy plot with a runoff control plate the effect of peak discharge mitigation in the paddy plot where the runoff control plate has been installed hereafter called plot with runoff control plate was evaluated by inputting the simulated rainfall into the discharge model as shown in section 3 we constructed the hydrological model to account for the effect of the runoff control plate in the drainage box as shown in fig 4 as parameters related to the drainage box q 2 is the discharge through the opening m 3 s 1 h 2 is the height from the center of the opening to the water level upstream of the runoff control plate m and h is the height from the center of the opening to the top of the weir plate m for calculating the discharge from the drainage box cases a and b are classified according to the water depth in the drainage box a when h 2 h the upstream water level of the runoff control plate is lower than the top of the weir plate until the upstream water level in the drainage box overflows from the top of the weir plate the relationship between the runoff q 1 from the plot to the drainage box and the discharge q 2 from the drainage box is expressed by eq 5 5 q 1 s d h 2 dt q 2 where s is the bottom area upstream of the runoff control plate the first term right is less than 1 of the second term right because s is relatively low 1 6 10 2 m2 for simplicity the first term on the right was ignored here therefore the discharge q 2 per calculation time step when h 2 h is given in eq 6 6 q 2 q 1 the water depth h 2 in the drainage box at each calculation time step was calculated as follows considering the effect of submerged discharge in the drainage box with the runoff control plate fig 4 the water running over the weir plate falls to the upstream side of the runoff control plate moves to the downstream side through the opening and discharges into the drainage channel through the pipe in the drainage box the cross sectional area of the opening a orif is less than the cross sectional area of the pipe a pipe so the discharge from the drainage box is defined by the size of the opening eq 7 7 q 3 q 2 q 3 was calculated with the assumption that the outlet pipe is a weir in line with the method proposed by yoshikawa et al 2011b we conducted a calibration experiment using a pump for the water to flow into a drainage box at several known constant flow rates with a runoff coefficient for the drainage pipe of 0 64 this value was close to the runoff coefficient of 0 62 obtained by yoshikawa et al 2011b for a similar pipe eq 8 was obtained from eqs 1 and 7 8 q 3 q 2 c a hole 2 g h 2 h 3 therefore if h 3 and q 3 or q 2 are known h 2 can be found and the relationship between discharge q 2 q 3 and h 2 is obtained therefore h 2 was successively updated according to q 1 at each calculation time step b when h 2 h the water level upstream of the runoff control plate is higher than the top of the weir plate when the water level upstream of the runoff control plate rises above the top of the weir plate then the water surface in the paddy and the drainage box are linked here the change in the water depth in the drainage box at each calculation step is expressed by eq 9 9 a plot s d h 2 dt a plot d h 2 dt p i q 2 and h 2 was updated successively according to this equation similar to the method described above s was assumed to be negligible in eq 9 because it was relatively low compared to the area of the plot a plot the discharge q 2 from the drainage box was obtained from the relationship between the discharge q 2 and h 2 by switching between the above two cases according to the water depth h 2 in the drainage box we calculated the discharge from the plot with the runoff control plate the actual height the two cases switch might be several centimeters higher than h but for simplicity this analysis assumes that the switch occurs at the height of h we have confirmed that this has little effect on the results 2 3 simulation using the discharge model 2 3 1 parameter identification for the discharge model the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 was used as an index to show concordance between the observed discharge and the simulated discharge from the discharge model nse is expressed by eq 10 10 nse 1 i 1 n ob s i si m i 2 i 1 n ob s i obs 2 and is widely used to describe the accuracy of hydrological models therefore it was used to identify the model parameters in this equation obs i and s im i are the observed and simulated values at time step i respectively n is the total number of time steps and o b s is the average of the observed values during the calculation period the a and b parameters of the model were identified so the observed discharge and ponding depth and the simulated discharge and ponding depth would be fitted when the water level upstream of the runoff control plate was lower than the top of the weir plate during the selected precipitation event the selected precipitation events for parameter identification were event 1 00 00 july 6 2020 15 00 july 7 2020 total precipitation 52 5 mm 5 min maximum precipitation 2 00 mm and event 2 7 00 july 7 2021 19 00 july 8 2021 total precipitation 81 5 mm 5 min maximum precipitation 2 25 mm given that z is expressed as the weir height we used the actual weir height measured with a ruler several days before the two precipitation events as the value for z the a and b parameters were adjusted so the observed discharge and the ponding depth and the simulated discharge and ponding depth were matched during the two precipitation events using the sce ua method duan et al 1992 2 3 2 simulation conditions the same simulated rainfall was input in the parameterized discharge model in the plot with and without the runoff control plate and the output results for the plot with and without the runoff control plate were compared and the effect of the runoff control plate was evaluated the simulated input rainfall that was input in the model is described in section 3 the conditions set for the simulation using simulated rainfall have been described subsequently a the plot area for 1 drainage box weir width 31 8 cm was set at 1130 m2 this simulation was based on the plot area of the research field and the number of drainage boxes one drainage box per paddy plot with an area of approximately 1130 m2 b the ponding depth has not exceeded the top of the runoff control plate and the height of the levee the discharge analysis in the model was conducted for one plot in this simulation it was assumed that the ponding depth did not exceed the height of the levee and there was no overflow beyond the levees the top of the runoff control plate was also assumed to be high enough and there was no overflow from the top of the runoff control plate c the weir height is the value at event 1 described in section 2 3 1 and the initial ponding depth is fixed at the weir height the height of the weir plate and the ponding depth at the beginning of rainfall vary according to the precipitation events in this simulation the height of the weir plate was set to the value for event 1 130 mm the initial ponding depth was also fixed at the height of the weir plate 130 mm thus there was no space for precipitation to pool in the paddy plot at the beginning of the simulation 3 rainfall patterns input in the discharge model 3 1 simulated rainfall patterns generated from the probability rainfall intensity formula the rainfall patterns input in the discharge model were decided based on the probability rainfall intensity formula of nara prefecture japan and the method of generating probability rainfall used in river flood control projects and the design standards to regulate reservoirs for disaster prevention nara prefecture 2018b sato 1987 we created 10 50 and 100 year return period simulated rainfall events with a single peak and for each event we created three rainfall events with forward concentrated peak position 0 0 central concentrated peak position 0 5 and backward concentrated peak position 1 0 wave patterns given that for the technical standards for the paddy field dam project in nara prefecture japan nara prefecture 2018c a standard duration of 24 h was used for the planned rainfall the duration of the simulated rainfall generated in this simulation was also set to 24 h the probability rainfall intensity formula for nara prefecture japan and the characteristics of the simulated rainfall are shown in table 1 3 2 simulated rainfall patterns generated from the probabilistic statistical method minakawa et al 2014 developed a method for reproducing heavy rainfall events which reproduces the wave patterns of previously recorded heavy rainfall events based on the monte carlo method using this method as a reference simulated rainfall patterns were created the methods described below are not all the same as those of minakawa et al 2014 the flowchart to generate the simulated rainfall patterns is shown in fig 5 3 2 1 preparation for a simulated heavy rainfall event the precipitation data observed at the amedas tawaramoto station every 10 min for 27 years from january 1994 to december 2020 were used the duration of heavy rainfall was set at 24 h which is the same as the duration of the planned rainfall described in section 3 1 a rainfall threshold was set and events exceeding the threshold were extracted as heavy rainfall we extracted 80 heavy rainfall events 2 96 events per year on average over 27 years by setting the threshold for heavy rainfall at 50 mm d 1 the rainfall scale generated was fixed at 100 150 and 200 mm d 1 for each rainfall scale 1000 heavy rainfall events were generated the gumbel distribution was applied to the annual maximum daily rainfall data observed at the amedas tawaramoto station over the last 40 years and the return periods for each rainfall scale were estimated to be 4 18 and 86 years respectively because the probability rainfall intensity formula used in section 3 1 is for nara prefecture not for tawaramoto town the estimated return period for each rainfall scale differs slightly from the return period for the unimodal rainfall produced in section 3 1 3 2 2 determination of the distribution ratio to the hourly rainfall the total rainfall was distributed to the 10 min rainfall for the 1000 heavy rains generated for each rainfall event the 10 min rainfall values were calculated by multiplying the total rainfall by the distribution ratio of each time step the length of one array was 144 24 h duration 10 min intervals the distribution ratio d t at time step t was the value of 0 1 obtained according to the beta distribution the parameters of the beta distribution were determined by trial and the shape of the distribution was exponential so that the rainfall intensity distribution obtained was close to the observed distribution this was because the intensity distribution of short duration rainfall during heavy rainfall can be approximated using an exponential distribution in this study the rainfall scale was fixed at 100 150 and 200 mm d 1 therefore the intensity distribution was close to that of the observed rainfall which was extended to each rainfall scale for extending the observed rainfall the actual rainfall is sometimes extended to equal the planned rainfall for river flood control planning and the extension ratio should be limited to approximately 2 0 we extracted 17 12 and 9 observed rainfall events by limiting the extension ratio of 0 80 1 25 0 56 1 80 and 0 48 2 10 at the rainfall scale of 100 150 and 200 mm d 1 respectively fig 6 shows the distribution of the 10 min rainfall occurrence for each rainfall scale for the extended observed rainfall and the simulated rainfall events the distributed rainfall arrays were reordered to match the autocorrelation coefficient of the simulated rainfall patterns to that of the observed rainfall patterns for this purpose a quasi rainfall array x was generated assuming the elements of the array were x i i 1 2 144 the values were determined using exponential distribution eq 12 12 f x i u i 1 exp λ x i where λ is the scale parameter of the exponential distribution this value represents the inverse of the expected value of the distribution by definition first x 1 was a randomly selected value from the 144 rainfall values to be sorted u 1 was in the range 0 1 we needed to consider the correlation of x 2 with x 1 where we could determine the value of u 2 considering the correlation with u 1 and then x 2 could be determined by eq 12 the value of u 2 was assumed to follow a triangular distribution with u 1 as the most frequent value and the minimum value l tri and maximum value r tri as the values obtained from eq 13 l tri max 0 u 1 w 13 r tri min 0 u 1 w the parameter w was determined by trial and error so that the autocorrelation coefficient of the final quasi rainfall array was a good fit for the autocorrelation coefficient of the observed rainfall events after generating the quasi rainfall values the distributed rainfall values were reordered so the rank order of the distributed rainfall array would be the same as the rank order of the quasi rainfall array the autocorrelation coefficients for the observed rainfall and the simulated rainfall were calculated and compared given that the autocorrelation coefficients were different for each event we calculated them individually for each event and the average of the whole was the representative value the correlogram for the observed and simulated heavy rainfall series for each rainfall scale is shown in fig 7 the parameter w was determined with the importance that the autocorrelation coefficient of the simulated rainfall should be fitted to the autocorrelation coefficient of the observed rainfall when the lag time was low these results demonstrated that generated rainfall represents the autocorrelation coefficient of the observed rainfall at each rainfall scale 4 results and discussion 4 1 parameter identification results for the discharge model parameters a and b in the discharge model in fig 3 were identified so the observed and calculated discharge and ponding depth would match each other during the event 1 and event 2 precipitation events shown in section 2 3 1 for the analysis the units of parameters a and b are expressed in mm 1 2 5 min 1 and 5 min 1 respectively therefore for identifying the parameters a 4 80 10 3 mm 1 2 5 min 1 and b 4 87 10 5 5 min 1 applying an appropriate unit conversion to parameter a and converting it to the unit system of the runoff coefficient c rect in the rectangular weir formula eq 14 14 q c rect b h 3 2 we obtained c rect 1 80 this value does not differ substantially from the value of c rect 1 90 from the study by yoshikawa et al 2009a in this equation b is the width of the weir plate m and h is the overflow depth m the parameter z was set at z 130 mm for event 1 and z 147 mm for event 2 to match the actual height of the weir plate during the precipitation events fig 8 shows the time changes for the observed discharge and the calculated discharge for both precipitation events using the discharge model the nse calculated from the temporal observed and calculated discharge for both events was nse 0 83 for event 1 and nse 0 93 for event 2 nse is considered a good fit for hydrological models with a value 0 70 moriashi et al 2015 thus the model could effectively reproduce the actual discharge process from the paddy plot event 1 shows a brief increase in discharge at 13 20 on july 6 but no substantial rainfall was observed at the amedas tawaramoto station however the observed ponding depth substantially increased indicating that highly localized rainfall occurred around the study plot the model could not reproduce this discharge fig 8 also shows the temporal changes in the observed and depth during both precipitation events the error was evaluated by the rmse which is expressed with eq 15 15 rmse i 1 n ob s i si m i 2 n the rmse for both precipitation events was 1 7 mm for event 1 and 3 6 mm for event 2 with a slightly higher value for event 2 with consistent trends therefore the discharge model was used after the parameter identification to simulate the different input rainfall patterns 4 2 inputting the rainfall patterns generated by the probability rainfall intensity formula for each simulation the calculation time was set to 48 h and a unimodal rainfall pattern was set to the first 24 h fig 9 shows the temporal change in the discharge from the plot with and without the control plate under the unimodal rainfall patterns generated according to the method described in section 3 1 this figure represents results for forward central and backward concentrated rainfall with a 50 year return period input in the model the results of the other rainfall patterns input in the discharge model are summarized in table 2 the peak discharge mitigation rate is defined by eq 16 16 ρ 1 q p dam q p norm where r is the peak discharge mitigation rate q p dam is the peak discharge from the plot with the runoff control plate and q p norm is the peak discharge from the plot without the runoff control plate the difference in the peak ponding depth between the plot with and without the runoff control plate is defined by eq 17 17 δ h p dam h p norm where d is the difference in the peak ponding depth between the plot with and without the runoff control plate h p dam is the peak ponding depth of the plot with the discharge control pate h p norm is the peak ponding depth of the plot without the runoff control plate this is an indicator of the extent to which the peak ponding depth increases when the runoff control plate is installed compared to when no plate is installed these results showed that for each return period the peak discharge mitigation rates for center and backward concentrated precipitation events were similar and higher than the peak discharge mitigation rate for forward concentrated precipitation events this may be due to center and backward concentrated rainfall patterns contributing more to the peak discharge from the paddy plot without the runoff control plate than for the forward concentrated rainfall pattern the difference in the peak ponding depth was slightly larger for the input of centralized rainfall than for the input of forward and backward concentrated rainfall with a difference of 17 2 mm for the 100 year return period centralized rainfall this could be due to the centralized rainfall pattern having a larger amount of precipitation near the peak precipitation which increases the ponding depth more than the forward and backward concentrated rainfall patterns 4 3 sensitivity analysis for model parameters and initial ponding depth the function of the runoff control plate is influenced by the characteristics of the plots and the ponding depth at the start of the rainfall we conducted sensitivity analysis to determine how the peak discharge mitigation rate changes with the input rainfall return period and the peak location when the model parameters a b the height of the weir plate z and the initial ponding depth h init were changed the parameters were based on those obtained in section 4 1 the value of parameter z was used for event 1 and the targeted parameters were changed the initial ponding depth was fixed at the value of parameter z and the discharge delay due to the room for precipitation to pool was not considered an initial condition fig 10 shows the change in the peak discharge mitigation rate for input of nine types of rainfall with different return periods and peak locations when the parameters a b z and h init were changed the meaning of parameter a is a factor that defines the amount of discharge over the weir plate of the drainage box in the actual plot because the larger a is the larger the discharge when the overflow depth is equal the width of the weir plate installed in the drainage box the runoff coefficient of the weir plate and the slope toward the paddy plot outlet are considered the main factors parameter a was changed in the range of 2 5 10 3 6 5 10 3 mm 1 2 5 min 1 if we convert to the unit system of the runoff coefficient c rect in eq 14 the range of c rect is 0 94 2 44 for each rainfall input to the model the larger the value of parameter a the larger the peak discharge mitigation rate the difference in the peak discharge mitigation rate became smaller as the value of parameter a increased when both forward and backward concentrated rainfall patterns were entered in the discharge model for the same return period rainfall the meaning of parameter b is the infiltration rate of the plot parameter b varied in the range of 0 0 1 0 10 3 5 min 1 from eq 3 this corresponds to an infiltration rate of 0 0 43 2 mm d 1 in a plot where the ponding depth is always maintained at 150 mm for each rainfall input in the model the peak discharge mitigation rate decreased as the value of parameter b increased change in the peak discharge mitigation rate with the change in parameter b was small and almost constant for each rainfall the meaning of parameter z is the length from the surface of the plot to the top of the weir plate parameter z was changed from 0 to 150 mm this is zero for the non irrigation period when the weir plate was not installed and is the height of the weir plate installed by farmers for the irrigation period the initial ponding depth h init was fixed to the value of parameter z for each rainfall input to the model the peak discharge mitigation rate decreased as the value of parameter z increased change in the peak discharge mitigation rate with the change in parameter z was small as resulted from the sensitivity analysis for parameter b the initial ponding depth h init at the beginning of the rainfall changed from 0 to 130 mm the value of the 130 mm is the value of parameter z in event 1 when the 100 year return period center and backward concentrated rainfall patterns were input in the model the peak discharge mitigation rate was almost constant regardless of h init however when other rainfall patterns were entered the discharge mitigation rate in the plot with the runoff control plate increased as h init increased these results indicate that the peak discharge mitigation rate changes depending on the characteristics of the paddy plot with the runoff control plate the return period and the peak location of the rainfall events 4 4 inputting simulated rainfall patterns generated from the probabilistic statistical method a total of 3000 simulated rainfall events were generated for three rainfall scales of 100 150 and 200 mm d 1 1000 events for each scale the discharge mitigation rate the peak ponding depth in the plot with and without the runoff control plate and the difference between them were investigated the calculation time was 72 h and simulated rainfall was entered in the first 24 h fig 11 shows the distribution of the peak discharge mitigation rate for the plot with the runoff control plate and the difference in the peak ponding depth between the plot with and without the runoff control plate for each rainfall scale the distribution shape was shown using a violin plot which is a combination of line segments showing the maximum median and minimum values dots showing mean values and a histogram the distribution of the peak discharge mitigation ratio showed that the maximum minimum median and mean values of the peak discharge mitigation ratio increased with increasing rainfall and the range of the peak discharge mitigation ratio decreased the relationship between the rainfall scale and the difference in the peak ponding depth in the plot with and without the runoff control plate showed that the maximum median and mean values for the difference in the peak ponding depth increased as the rainfall scale increased and the range of the difference in the peak ponding depth increased minakawa and miyazu 2022 only assessed the mean values however the results of the present study suggest that the mean value for each rainfall pattern did not necessarily coincide with the mode and median of the distribution the frequency distribution of the peak ponding depth for each rainfall scale in the plot with and without the runoff control plate is shown in fig 12 these histograms showed that the distribution shifted toward the higher peak ponding depth with the increase of the rainfall scale in both the plots with and without the runoff control plate as the rainfall scale increased the distribution shifted more toward the larger peak ponding depth in the plot with and without the runoff control plate and the difference in the peak ponding depth between them became greater when carrying out the paddy field dam project it is important to maintain and manage the storage function of rice paddy fields to make the runoff control plate effective yoshikawa and tsubaki 2016 results obtained from the simulations indicate that the peak ponding depth will be less than 260 mm even during large rainfall events the possibility of overflow from the levees is small if the levee height is greater than 260 mm in this study area fig 13 shows a scatter plot of the hourly peak rainfall on the horizontal axis and the peak discharge mitigation rate on the vertical axis for 1000 simulated rainfall events generated at each of the three rainfall scales 3000 events the results of using unimodal rainfall patterns with three 50 year return periods total rainfall 215 mm d 1 hourly peak precipitation 69 5 mm h 1 in the model are also represented in fig 13 the range of the peak discharge mitigation rate shifts higher as the rainfall scale increases the range of hourly peak precipitation distribution shifts higher as the rainfall scale increases despite slight differences in daily precipitation compared to 200 mm d 1 the results for unimodal rainfall especially backward concentrated rainfall input to the model were located at the top of the distribution of dots in fig 13 fig 14 shows a scatter plot of the hourly peak rainfall on the horizontal axis and the difference in the peak ponding depth in the plot with and without the runoff control plate on the vertical axis the results of using three forward center and backward concentrated 50 year return period unimodal rainfall patterns total rainfall 215 mm d 1 hourly peak precipitation 69 5 mm h 1 in the model are also shown in fig 14 the range of the difference in the peak ponding depth between the plot with and without the runoff control plate becomes wider as the rainfall scale increases when the three unimodal rainfall patterns were used in the model the differences observed in peak ponding depth between the plots with and without control plate were all situated at the bottom of the distribution of dots in fig 14 as shown in table 2 and figs 11 12 and 14 when the simulated rainfall patterns created by the method of minakawa et al 2014 were input to the model the peak ponding depth and the difference in peak ponding depth might be larger than when the unimodal rainfall waveform with the same 24 h rainfall were input in paddy plot without control plate therefore it would be inadequate to consider only unimodal rainfall pattern when considering the risk of levee collapse and yield reduction associated with increased ponding depths due to use of control plates 4 5 relationship between the peak rainfall and the effects of the runoff control plate figs 13 and 14 indicate that the dots are concentrated and distributed within a limited range respectively for example fig 13 shows that the dots are concentrated inside the area bounded by the curve that rises from approximately 40 mm hourly peak rainfall and approximately follows the lower side of the distribution the curve that rises from approximately 20 mm hourly peak rainfall and approximately follows the upper side of the distribution and the horizontal axis from these results it was considered possible to estimate the degree of the peak discharge mitigation rate and the difference in the peak ponding depth in the plot with and without the runoff control plate based on the rainfall scale and the hourly peak rainfall the peak discharge mitigation rate curve is defined as the lower limit curve and the difference in the peak ponding depth is defined as the upper limit curve the peak discharge mitigation rate is expressed by eq 16 because q p dam in eq 16 is almost constant the value of q p norm contributes the most to the peak discharge mitigation rate and the smaller the value of q p norm the smaller the peak discharge mitigation rate the larger the value of q p norm the larger the peak discharge mitigation rate for a set of rainfall patterns with a determined hourly peak rainfall at each rainfall scale the peak discharge mitigation rate when the pattern with the lowest rainfall contributes to the peak discharge is input in the discharge model is drawn as the lower limit curve while changing the hourly peak rainfall when the rainfall patterns with the highest rainfall contributing to the peak discharge are input in the discharge model the peak discharge mitigation rate is drawn as the upper limit curve while changing the hourly peak precipitation based on this hypothesis the rainfall pattern that forms the curve close to the lower limit concentrates the peak rainfall in the first hour while the rainfall pattern that forms the curve close to the upper limit continues the peak rainfall for rainfall scale hourly peak precipitation hours if the hourly peak rainfall is 50 mm for a rainfall scale of 200 mm the rainfall pattern that forms a curve close to the lower limit is considered the result from concentrating the peak rainfall of 50 mm in the first hour and distributing 150 mm over the remaining 23 h however we assumed that 150 mm of precipitation could be freely distributed so as not to contribute to the peak discharge in the remaining 23 h and it was expected that the rainfall pattern that forms the curve close to the lower limit could be approximated by the rainfall pattern with the peak rainfall of 50 mm concentrated only in the first hour the rainfall pattern that forms the curve close to the upper limit was expected to be approximated to the rainfall pattern with the peak rainfall of 50 mm h 1 which continued for 4 h for each rainfall scale the rainfall pattern that forms a curve close to the lower limit and a curve close to the upper limit is generated by changing the hourly peak rainfall from 20 mm to the value of each rainfall scale by 1 mm the curves drawn from the lower and upper limits are shown in fig 15 according to this figure the distribution plotted for each rainfall scale is concentrated in the area bounded by the lower and upper curves indicating that the hypothesis is valid fig 16 also shows a figure drawn by superimposing the lower and upper limit curves in fig 14 in this figure the distribution plotted on each rainfall scale is concentrated in the area surrounded by the lower limit curve and the upper limit curve however it can be seen that no dots are present near the upper limit curve which implies that the probability of a rainfall event with such results is extremely low further probabilistic analyses can be undertaken to narrow this range in future in summary if the rainfall scale and the hourly peak rainfall are determined the possible range of the peak discharge mitigation rate and the difference in the peak ponding depth between the plot with and without the runoff control plate can be estimated 5 conclusions we developed a discharge model to evaluate the discharge mitigation function of the runoff control plate and compared the results when inputting various rainfall patterns the main conclusions of the present study are summarized below i the peak discharge mitigation rate and difference in peak ponding depth changed depending on the characteristics of the paddy plot with the runoff control plate the return period and the peak location of the rainfall the difference in the peak discharge mitigation rate between the forward and backward concentrated rainfall input in the discharge model for the same return period rainfall became smaller as the value of parameter a the weir width installed in the drainage box the runoff coefficient of the weir plate and the slope of the rice paddy plot to the outlet increased ii when the simulated rainfall patterns created by stochastic method were input to the model the peak ponding depth and the difference in peak ponding depth compared to paddy plot without runoff control plate might be larger than when the unimodal rainfall waveform with the almost same 24 h rainfall were input the possible range of the peak discharge mitigation rate in the plot with the runoff control plate and the difference in the peak ponding depth between the plot with and without the runoff control plate can be estimated if the rainfall scale and the hourly peak rainfall are determined in the future the model developed in this study which can calculate the water balance of the plot with the runoff control plate will be incorporated into a model that can perform district level inundation analysis to quantitatively evaluate the effects of runoff control plates when various rainfall patterns occur in districts with different land uses various rainfall patterns were created based on the rainfall data observed in the past in this study to verify the effects of the runoff control plate when entering expected future rainfall under climate change we will use the output results from the global climate model to examine the role of agricultural land in basin level flood control

7929,study region this study is focused on 6 catchments in tunisia in north africa under a semi arid climate where daily river discharge and precipitation observations are available between 1992 and 2006 study focus the distributed hydrological model lisflood has been compared with a lumped model gr4j to reproduce river runoff and floods using observed rainfall interpolated from rain gauges and from the era5 reanalysis new hydrological insights for the region under study lisflood and gr4j with their default parameters have little skill in tunisia but when calibrated both hydrological models provide similar performance to reproduce river discharge with a mean kge of 0 65 for gr4j driven by observed rainfall and 0 59 with era5 and similarly a mean kge of 0 59 for lisflood driven by observed rainfall and 0 48 with era5 all model simulations perform very similarly using either observed rainfall data from rain gauges interpolated over the basins or era5 rainfall indicating its value as an alternative to observations in data scarce areas such as tunisia the development of regional databases of river discharge observations in north africa could allow the calibration of such hydrological models on a larger scale for operational flood modeling and forecasting keywords floods tunisia lisflood efas gr4j era5 1 introduction floods are the most common natural hazard as such flood affected 23 of the world s population during the 1995 2005 period with disproportionally high impacts on the poorest and most vulnerable countries notably in africa douglas et al 2008 jongman 2018 tramblay et al 2020 tunisia like the rest of the mediterranean countries regularly experiences severe flooding caused by intense rainfall events which result in significant material losses as well as casualties llasat et al 2010 while these floods have severe consequences in terms of casualties and economic losses an increase in the vulnerability to these episodes has been observed mainly attributed to urban development and land use change zahar et al 2008 fehri 2014 loudyi and kantoush 2020 dahri and abida 2020 flood related losses can be mitigated through effective flood forecasting and early warning mechanisms that provide additional preparation time prior to a flood event thiemig et al 2011 cools et al 2016 which allows the timely implementation of flood mitigating measures such as securing assets and evacuating people in europe flood forecasting and early warning is primarily addressed at national and regional level through their own systems and tools which are complemented at european scale since 2005 by the european flood awareness system efas bartholmes et al 2009 thielen et al 2009 efas is europe s overarching flood forecasting and monitoring system operated since 2012 under the copernicus emergency management service its global extension the global flood awareness system glofas alfieri et al 2013 harrigan et al 2020 aims at providing such flood forecasting and monitoring capabilities at global scale using a similar setup to efas but using era5 hersbach et al 2020 based on the open source https ec jrc github io lisflood lisflood model van der knijff et al 2010 efas and glofas are supporting national and regional authorities responsible for flood risk management with a wide range of constantly updated early flood forecast information for a fast and dynamic situational awareness on possible flood risks for the next 10 efas and 30 glofas days in addition efas also supports the eu civil protection mechanism through providing daily an overview across europe and neighboring countries on currently observed and forecasted flood events for an improved and coordinated emergency response at european level even though being a pan european system efas covers the northern part of africa and produces daily hydrological predictions for riverine and flash floods and hence might be suitable for supporting the tunisian authorities with early flood risk information however the predictive capacity of efas or glofas for that particular area is unknown as the lack of available hydrological data river discharge and precipitation data mostly allows neither the calibration of lisflood nor the validation of the current uncalibrated performance over those areas complicating matters the tunisian river basins are also relatively small as the majority of mediterranean basins merheb et al 2016 compared to the spatial resolution of large scale models that could limit the model s capacity to correctly represent the dynamics of the hydrological response global hydrological models ghms such as lisflood are designed to be implemented in all the possible hydrological regimes by including a variety of relevant runoff generating processes archfield et al 2015 bierkens 2015 sood and smakhtin 2015 trigg et al 2016 kauffeldt et al 2016 but they still need to be evaluated at the basin scale to assess their accuracy since there are no in situ observations of precipitation or river discharge in tunisia currently available to the efas or glofas frameworks there is a strong need to validate the hydrological simulations against observed discharge data to evaluate their current capacity to reproduce floods prior to using those for flood forecasting in an operational environment bernhofen et al 2018 trigg et al 2016 a very important question would be to know how effective the model could be when driven by the recent era5 reanalysis in place of observed rainfall since era5 has demonstrated good capabilities for hydrological modeling in different regions of the world and in particular semi arid ones bandara et al 2021 bandhauer et al 2022 jiang et al 2021 reder and rianna 2021 tarek et al 2021 in this context the objective of the present study is to evaluate the feasibility of flood modeling in tunisia using era5 rainfall as input as a preliminary step towards the implementation of efas glofas in this region this is done based on a set of 6 basins comparing uncalibrated as well as calibrated simulations of the lisflood distributed model and the gr4j lumped model perrin et al 2003 these two models are compared herein to evaluate the sensitivity of the results to two different hydrological model structures both models are forced with observed precipitation and era5 to investigate the suitability of using a global reanalysis dataset providing precipitation and temperature in place of observations an aspect which is of particular interest for hydrological modeling in data scarce areas the questions addressed in the present study are i what is the performance of the hydrological models to reproduce daily discharge dynamics with era5 compared to using observed precipitation ii are the hydrological models able to simulate the occurrence and the magnitude of high flows 2 study area and datasets for this study six tunisian catchments were selected fig 1 based on catchment size discharge data and rain gauge data availability as well as length of the hydrological record and data quality the main characteristics of these catchments are summarized in table 1 they are all located in northern and central parts of tunisia with semi arid conditions characterized by low annual rainfall and high evapotranspiration that are typical of mediterranean catchments of north africa there is a gradient in aridity from north to south with the hathob hc and merguellil mh basins being the two most arid ones holding the largest proportion of zero flow days there is a marked seasonality of precipitation and surface runoff with a rainy season during winter months and a dry season spanning during summer months with high evapotranspiration rates consequently all basins are intermittent except basin 2 the medjerda river mj which is the only perennial river in tunisia only two basins are impacted by dams the medjerda mj spanning across algeria and tunisia with the ain dalia dam in algeria controlling 6 of basin area and the basin of joumine at mateur jm where the joumine dam controls 40 of basin area the discharge data used in this study was obtained from the sierem database dieulin et al 2019 although the available record starts in the 1950 s most stations present limited and discontinuous discharge time series thus the discharge data availability defined the study period which runs from january 1991 to september 2006 the year 1991 being used for model spin up despite a careful selection of the discharge dataset from the available stations in tunisia the discharge time series present some gaps as it is often the case in data scarce areas in particular the missing data represents up to 40 of daily data in joumine at jebel antra jj and melah at ouchtata mo thus the evaluation is performed over a smaller number of years for these stations it should be noted that the highest frequency of missing data is reported during summer and early autumn the driest months of the year when runoff usually ceases two different daily precipitation datasets were used to force the hydrological models i precipitation observations from 960 rain gauges with data from 1975 to 2006 obtained from the database of the direction générale des resources en eau dgre of tunisia and ii the era5 precipitation product available from 1979 to present with a spatial resolution of 30 km the rain gauge data used here was previously used to produce precipitation maps over tunisia tramblay et al 2019 and therefore was already quality checked the precipitation observations were interpolated using inverse distance weighting to generate a 5 km gridded daily precipitation dataset the era5 rainfall was re gridded to the same 5 km grid using a bilinear interpolation although the two hydrological models were implemented with the same rainfall inputs there are slight differences in the data processing to adapt it to the structure of each of the models in the case of gr4j the interpolated observed precipitation and era5 were averaged for each catchment to obtain its daily areal value in contrast for the lisflood implementation the model was run using the distributed rainfall at 5 km in the particular case of the medjerda mj basin that originates in algeria 40 of catchment area since no rain gauges in algeria were available for this study observed rainfall is only computed with rain gauges in tunisia a comparison of the observed and era5 rainfall over the basins is provided in fig 2 in terms of seasonal rainfall era5 overestimate rainfall compared to observations on average 15 in particular in september and may in terms of extremes rainfall events above the 95th percentile also display higher values for era5 33 compared to rain gauges data however this comparison remains hampered by the lack of homogeneity of the rain gauge network in terms of spatial but also temporal coverage due to missing data for some stations and time periods the temperature data used is the daily era5 temperature hersbach et al 2020 in the absence of meteorological stations with data available in the implementation of the gr4j model it was used to calculate daily potential evapotranspiration pet through the hargreaves formula hargreaves and samani 1985 with daily minimum and maximum temperatures that proved to be efficient in north africa er raki et al 2010 for lisflood the evapotranspiration inputs were calculated through the lisvap model van der knijff 2010 that rely on the penman monteith formulation computed with era5 data the updated documentation and source code of this model can be found with the current model documentation under https ec jrc github io lisflood lisvap even if the two models do not share the same computation of pet this should not influence the results given the very small influence of the pet formulation in water limited regions such as tunisia dakhlaoui et al 2020 3 hydrological models 3 1 lisflood lisflood is a spatially distributed rainfall runoff and channel routing model de roo et al 2000 van der knijff et al 2010 given that lisflood was originally developed to model large european rivers it is based on raster files in order to simplify the management of large datasets lisflood requires a large number of static inputs that describe the physical properties of the catchments e g land cover leaf area index channel and soil properties etc and it is driven by the dynamic inputs which are the meteorological forcing that is the precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration time series as lisflood is open source its source code can be found with the updated model documentation and user guide under https github com ec jrc lisflood code the standard setup of lisflood is made of three different components i a three layer soil water balance ii subsurface and groundwater flow and iii routing of surface runoff one interesting characteristic of this model is that conceptualization is a hybrid between physically based and conceptual model on one hand the processes involved in the soil module are reproduced by solving the corresponding governing equations as it is characteristic of the physically based models on the other hand the groundwater and subsurface component is constituted by two sequential reservoirs with a similar structure to those of the conceptual models this standard setup of the model with split routing is used in this study the processes are simulated cell by cell and include snow melting interception infiltration preferential flow groundwater flow lateral flow and surface runoff the lisflood setup as used in efas has 14 parameters left to determine through calibration however given the scope of the present study the parameters related to snow melting floodplains lakes and reservoirs were excluded thus the lisflood structure presented above leaves a total of 8 parameters to be determined through calibration 1 xinanjiang exponential xi controls the infiltration capacity 2 power preferential flow pf determines which proportion of precipitation bypasses the soil and goes directly to the water table 3 upper zone time constant uz determines the residence time of the upper groundwater reservoir or fast response of the system 4 groundwater percolation perc that is the maximum percolation rate from the upper to lower groundwater zone 5 lower groundwater zone time constant lz equivalent to the uz in this case controls the residence time of the lower reservoir and consequently the slow response of the system 6 manning multiplier man is applied to the manning roughness coefficient to fine tune the timing of the channel routing 7 ground water loss gwloss parameter the maximum loss rate out of lower groundwater zone 8 lower zone threshold lzthreshold parameter a threshold to stop outflow from lower groundwater zone to the channel 3 2 gr4j gr4j perrin et al 2003 is a lumped conceptual rainfall runoff hydrological model this model was chosen since it proved to be efficient to reproduce river discharge in different basins of tunisia dakhlaoui et al 2017 2019 due to its simplicity low data requirements and parsimonious structure the conceptualization of the model is based on two sequential reservoirs that mimic the runoff generation processes at catchment scale the first reservoir simulates the soil moisture budget from the input time series evaporation e and precipitation p the amount of moisture retained by the soil is controlled by the parameter x1 which is a threshold representing the maximum storage capacity of the soil reservoir s the water outgoing this reservoir is split in two flows a fast flow representing the short time response of the catchment and a slow flow which represents the slow response of the system and goes into the second deposit the fraction of flow going to the second reservoir is determined by the parameter x2 which is the groundwater exchange coefficient as in the first reservoir the second deposit has a threshold value that represents the maximum amount of water that can be held in it r and it s defined by the parameter x3 finally the routing time of both flows fast and slow is established by a unit hydrograph whose time base corresponds to the last parameter x4 table 3 in this way the flow going into the second reservoir has a routing time equal to the unit hydrograph time base uh1 whereas the routing time of the flow contributing directly to the streamflow is two times the unit hydrograph time base uh2 4 methods 4 1 model calibration strategies in an initial run the two models lisflood and gr4j are set up with their default parametrization ie the default values of the model parameter for each model in table 2 for lisflood and table 3 for gr4j and forced once with era5 and once with the interpolated aggregated observed precipitation the aim of this exercise is threefold 1 to evaluate their capacity to reproduce the general hydrological conditions in an uncalibrated state 2 to establish a baseline performance that allows us to assess the improvement brought through calibration and 3 to compare the influence of the precipitation input on model performance after establishing a baseline performance both models are calibrated for that the input datasets are divided into nine years for calibration january 1992 to august 2001 and five validation years august 2001 to august 2006 the data in 1991 is used for the model warm up and therefore not used to compute the scores since the lisflood model code for calibration is based on the deap algorithm fortin et al 2012 maier et al 2014 hirpa et al 2018 for consistency we applied the same algorithm for gr4j calibration so the results can be compared see hirpa et al 2018 section 3 1 for full details about the algorithm implementation hydrologic models are typically calibrated through the use of objective functions the most common being the nash sutcliffe efficiency criterion nash and sutcliffe 1970 however given the potential limitations of this metric gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 the kling gupta efficiency score kge is considered herein for model calibration notably because the kge is a linear combination of three components of the modeling error the pearson correlation coefficient the bias ratio and variability ratio between observed qo and simulated qs runoff 1 kge 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 α 1 2 2 with r cov q o q s σ qo 2 σ qs 2 α σ qs σ qo β q s q o consequently the calibration was performed using the kge as an objective function proven to be efficient to reproduce peak flows and mean annual regime mizukami et al 2019 for lisflood the parameter ranges are the same as applied in the calibration of efas in the case of gr4j the parameter range used during calibration and the initial run are those presented in perrin et al 2003 4 2 skill scores for high runoff events the model s ability to reproduce flood events is evaluated by three skill scores the probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and heidke skill score hss wilks 2019 to compute these scores all events above the 95th percentile of daily discharge computed over the whole period have been extracted from observations and also model simulations the 95th percentiles have been computed only for discharge value above 0 5 m3 s 1 to not bias the detection of high runoff events towards smaller values since intermittent rivers frequently have zeros flow values for each model simulation the thresholds ie the 95th percentiles to extract the events are redefined to avoid the effects of model bias on the detection of flood events by doing so this evaluation is fully consistent with the event detection done in efas and glofas bartholmes et al 2009 as explained in thielen et al 2009 there are two main motivations to use this approach first the absence of detailed information about small scale river regulation small dams water uptakes for irrigation that cannot be modelled inducing bias on simulated discharge second the limited accuracy of meteorological measurements notably precipitation that could lead to large discrepancies between modelled and observed discharge 3 pod a a c 4 far b a b 5 hss ad bc a c c d a b b d 2 where a is the hit rate the events correctly modelled b the false alarms events modelled but not observed c the missed events observed events not modelled and d the correct negative that can be obtained from a contingency table in addition to these scores quantile quantile plots a graphical method for comparing two probability distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other were used to compare the distributions of high runoff events to detect potential biases due to the rainfall input or the hydrological model 4 3 hydrological consistency of the simulations several studies have described a number of hydrological signatures that can be incorporated into the hydrologic modeling process to evaluate the hydrological consistency of the simulations beyond the use of standard verification scores such those aforementioned there are two main ways in which these hydrological signatures can be used to improve the hydrological consistency of the simulations 1 to compare and identify the most adequate model structure for a given catchment or to evaluate the suitability of a single model and 2 to include them in the calibration process as a part of a multi objective calibration approach mcmillan et al 2017 mcmillan 2020 gnann et al 2021 in the present study four hydrological signatures tailored to describe flood related processes have been used to compare the hydrological consistency of the simulations generated by lisflood and gr4j with a focus on extremes for this purpose the toolbox presented in gnann et al 2021 has been used to compute hydrological signatures from daily discharge that describe several components of the hydrological response typical of these semi arid basins 1 the richard baker flashiness index fi that quantifies the response time of runoff after the onset of a rainfall event and the return to base flow conditions baker et al 2004 2 peak distribution pd that shows whether the peak discharges are of equal height it is computed as the slope between the 10th and 50th of a flow duration curve constructed by only considering hydrograph peaks euser et al 2013 3 rising limb density rld is a descriptor of the hydrograph shape and smoothness without consideration for the flow magnitude thus describing the flashiness of the catchment response it is computed as the ratio between the number of rising limbs and the total amount of timesteps the hydrograph is rising sawicz et al 2011 so it is equivalent to the inverse of the mean time to peak 4 variability index vi the standard deviation of the common logarithms of discharge determined at 10 intervals from 10 to 90 of the cumulative frequency distribution estrany et al 2010 5 results 5 1 model performance without calibration this first evaluation represents a benchmark to test whether the models without calibration could be useful for hydrological modeling and notably the detection of high flow events during the full period with observed data in general the performance with uncalibrated models is not satisfactory and highly dependent on the basins fig 3 for example in joumine at mateur jm joumine at jbel antra jj or melah mo basins the simulations with lisflood and gr4j produce kge close or above 0 3 while for the other basins the performances are very low with kge close to zero model bias as shown on fig 3 is very strong with either an over or underestimation of runoff yet for most simulations the kge is larger than 0 41 that is the value corresponding to a mean flow benchmark knoben et al 2019 nevertheless the correlations between observed and simulated flows exceed 0 5 in 4 of the 6 basins due to the strong streamflow seasonality typical of semi arid basins the weakest performances in terms of kge and hss are observed for basins mh and hc the most arid ones with very low pod and high far the pod scores can reach 0 5 especially for basins of joumine at mateur jm medjerda mj joumine at jebel antra jj and melah mo interestingly for the smallest basin joumine at jebel antra jj the pod is reaching values close to 0 8 with lisflood driven by observed rainfall and gr4j driven by era5 proving that the un calibrated setup is efficient to detect floods in this basin no significant differences are observed between the lisflood and gr4j models nor between the use of observed precipitation or era5 with performance varying greatly from one catchment to another when looking at the daily discharge values above the 95th percentile all the simulations strongly underestimate the flow values results not shown these results indicate that the simulations without model calibration are strongly biased and cannot be used for flood event detection in most cases 5 2 model calibration and validation after model calibration as shown on fig 4 considering observed rainfall or era5 we obtained slightly better performances with gr4j driven by observed rainfall mean kge 0 65 or era5 mean kge 0 59 rather than with lisflood driven by observed rainfall mean kge 0 59 or era5 mean kge 0 48 the highest kge values are obtained in 4 out of 6 basins with the combination of gr4j with observed rainfall mj mh hc jj mo a similar difference between the two models efficiency is obtained in terms of correlations however less differences are found between the two hydrological models for pod or hss scores indicating a similar performance to reproduce high runoff events for instance very similar pod scores are observed between lisflood and gr4j driven by observations mean pod of 0 41 and 0 45 respectively or era5 0 36 and 0 4 respectively however the far is very high for 3 basins mh jj mo notably with lisflood driven by era5 yielding low hss scores it should be noted that acceptable kge scores do not warrant a good detection capability in terms of skills scores for flood detection that are low for three basins out of six in terms of flood magnitude the quantile quantile plots fig 5 show that all models once calibrated are able to reproduce the distribution of daily discharge events above the 95th percentile except for the hathob hc and melah mo basins there are no striking differences between simulations with observed rainfall or era5 except for the medjerda mj basin where the best reproduction of threshold exceedances is obtained with lisflood driven by observed rainfall and joumine at jebel antra jj with the best simulations are those of lisflood driven by observed rainfall or era5 during the validation we observed very strong differences among basins fig 6 the mean kge is equal to 0 32 with lisflood and 0 2 with gr4j when using observed rainfall 0 26 and 0 24 with era5 but average performance could be misleading here due to the large differences between basins it should be noted that these scores remain quite low due to the short period of validation in a context of a strong interannual variability of precipitation and runoff in these semi arid environments better performances are achieved in terms of pod with lisflood mean pod 0 45 using observed rainfall and 0 4 with era5 than with gr4j pod 0 43 and 0 35 with observed rainfall or era5 respectively on the contrary the correlation between observed and simulated runoff remains above 0 5 except for the melah mo basin overall the only basin with acceptable performances in validation with the two hydrological models and rainfall inputs is the medjerda mj being the largest one in the sample considered herein in the only basin with the presence of a dam significantly influencing river flow joumine at mateur jm we note a relatively weak performance in terms of kge but performances similar to the other basins for the detection of floods the hydrographs of the jm basin show the effect of dam regulation notably between 1998 and 2001 as shown in supplementary materials figures for the high runoff events magnitude fig 7 there are more differences between the different rainfall inputs during validation than calibration but overall the quantile quantile plots of fig 7 indicate that for most basins the runoff events above the 95th percentile are not well reproduced in validation the best results are obtained for the medjerda mj with simulations driven by observed rainfall closer to observations than simulations driven by era5 the difference between the two hydrological models appears small here suggesting that the rainfall input has the largest influence on the results 5 3 model ability to reproduce hydrological signatures the hydrological signatures computed with observed daily discharge data reveal the difference in terms of runoff response across the basins fig 8 for instance the two signatures indicative of the flashiness response the flashiness index and the rising limb density are the highest for the two southernmost basins merguellil mh and hathob hc that are the most arid and intermittent basins this reveals that in these two basins the hydrograph shapes are less smooth than in northern tunisia with shorter response time of runoff after a rainfall event explaining the lower efficiency of hydrological models there for the peak distribution the values are rather homogeneous in the different basins with the highest value for the smallest basin joumine at jebel antra jj lisflood and gr4j tend to underestimate the flashiness index and the rising limb density when driven by observed or era5 rainfall fig 8 but these differences to reproduce the different hydrological signatures are to a large extent dependent on the catchment characteristics a distinct behavior is observed for the two most arid basins with different reproduction of the signatures with different combinations of models and rainfall inputs this is most notably the case for the flashiness index and rising limb density in basins 3 and 4 the peak distribution in basin 3 the variability index is generally the worst reproduced signature in all the basins on the contrary the flashiness index and rising limb density signatures are best reproduced with mean absolute errors less than 0 5 overall no striking differences in the ability of lisflood and gr4j to reproduce the hydrological signatures using observed or era5 rainfall is found focusing on the independent validation period it is shown in fig 8 that lisflood driven by rain gauge data outperforms the same model driven by era5 for all signatures whereas with gr4j era5 driven simulations outperform those driven by observations in 3 out of 4 signatures 6 discussion hydrological modeling in tunisia is challenging due to the data availability and data quality issues as for many semi arid regions the performance of hydrological models is usually low due to the strong interannual variability of runoff generation but also the observational limitations in the context of a high spatial variability of rainfall inputs mcintyre and al qurashi 2009 notably dryland hydrology is characterized by strong threshold effects that may require specific hydrological model structures cudennec et al 2007 wheater et al 2007 sumi et al 2022 accounting for the non linearity in the storage discharge relationship jothityangkoon et al 2001 huang et al 2016 lahmers et al 2019 the influence of the seasonal variability of vegetation cover on interception and soil crusting wheater et al 2007 bouvier et al 2018 landscape variability and lateral redistribution processes that could reduce runoff volumes güntner and bronstert 2004 and transmission losses within the channel beds goodrich et al 1997 because of its conceptual nature the gr4j model could not be easily modified to represent these processes however given the modular structure of lisflood the current model structure used in efas could be adapted to include the relevant processes following some field based validation of the main components that would be required an additional issue stems from the available data to perform a model evaluation as in the present work with the daily time step of discharge data being suboptimal to analyze flood dynamics several studies observed a fast decay of soil saturation following rainfall events indicating hourly time step data better suited for this type of analysis in semi arid basins el khalki et al 2020 this may be the cause for the low scores on flood detection pod and hss in the present study most moderate to small flood events may last only a few hours and not span over days therefore their detection using daily data is challenging however if daily data are already rare and difficult to obtain instantaneous flow data are even rarer the conclusions of the present work and others on the same topic are a strong incentive for the development of river discharge databases at the national regional and continental levels to foster the development of flood warning systems such as efas or glofas as shown in the present study the rainfall provided by the era5 reanalysis could provide a reliable alternative in place of observed rain gauge data provided that discharge data would be available for model calibration there is indeed a crucial need for good quality river discharge data beven et al 2020 crochemore et al 2020 that also cover a variety of different regions do et al 2018 tramblay et al 2021 to be used for the validation of hydrological simulations with ghms such as lisflood while about two thirds of hydrological data from observational networks in developing countries are reported to be in declining conditions dixon et al 2020 there are some ongoing initiatives for data rescue such as the world meteorological organization s global hydrometry support facility or the global flood partnership alfieri et al 2021 that is regrouping a community of both researchers and practitioners from various countries to develop modeling strategies to reduce flood risks while it is obvious that it is not possible to adopt the same modeling strategy in data poor and data rich regions where hydrological models can be calibrated with observations in a large number of basins the present study illustrates the potential of using a ghm for flood risk management at catchment scale in a developing country to overcome the limitations linked to the lack of discharge data for calibrating the models over large regions the regionalization of the ghms parameter could provide pre determined parameter values adapted to ungauged basins in different regions beck et al 2020 ma et al 2021 however any regionalization attempt requires river discharge data quality on a large number of catchments to constitute a statistically significant group of donor basins from which we can transfer the parameters to ungauged basins as recent studies suggest these approaches could be applied on worldwide databases of basin properties taking benefits of the recent developments in machine learning techniques feng et al 2021 ma et al 2021 7 summary and conclusions in this study two models with very different structures were compared to reproduce river runoff and floods for a set of tunisian basins the distributed lisflood model used in the efas and glofas and the lumped gr4j model the performance of the two hydrological models tested in ungauged basins was assessed through their application with default parameter values to mimic the absence of discharge data for calibration showing little skill without calibration the calibration process has been proven to greatly enhance the performance of the two hydrological models the comparison of the performance of lisflood and gr4j after calibration shows that both models have similar skill in determining whether a flood event will occur results also showed little effects of the precipitation input on the simulated discharge the differences of the simulated quantiles of the observation driven models and the era5 driven models are very similar it should be noted that the different evaluation scores remained low as is often the case in semi arid and arid basins characterized by a strong variability of precipitation and runoff in these basins flood hydrographs have a reduced or no base flow contribution and most of the streamflow is constituted by the direct surface runoff largely influenced by the infiltration capacity of the soil the reproduction of the hydrological behavior of these rivers is still challenging often requiring sub daily data for model calibration and evaluation results of the present study demonstrate that era5 data could provide a valuable alternative to observed precipitation as long as there is available river discharge data to calibrate the hydrological model parameters this is especially important when the modeling results are intended to be used for water resources management at catchment or regional scales rather than an assessment at global scale as data availability conditions the modeling approach in tunisia and in most developing countries the main scientific question to address is no longer which model better represents the extreme flows but rather which modeling strategy can best reproduce floods for a maximum number of basins while requiring a minimum amount of data in other words the question to be answered in the future is how to apply such models regionally given the available data to implement efficient regional flood warning and forecasting systems such as efas or glofas credit authorship contribution statement elia cantoni conceptualization

7929,study region this study is focused on 6 catchments in tunisia in north africa under a semi arid climate where daily river discharge and precipitation observations are available between 1992 and 2006 study focus the distributed hydrological model lisflood has been compared with a lumped model gr4j to reproduce river runoff and floods using observed rainfall interpolated from rain gauges and from the era5 reanalysis new hydrological insights for the region under study lisflood and gr4j with their default parameters have little skill in tunisia but when calibrated both hydrological models provide similar performance to reproduce river discharge with a mean kge of 0 65 for gr4j driven by observed rainfall and 0 59 with era5 and similarly a mean kge of 0 59 for lisflood driven by observed rainfall and 0 48 with era5 all model simulations perform very similarly using either observed rainfall data from rain gauges interpolated over the basins or era5 rainfall indicating its value as an alternative to observations in data scarce areas such as tunisia the development of regional databases of river discharge observations in north africa could allow the calibration of such hydrological models on a larger scale for operational flood modeling and forecasting keywords floods tunisia lisflood efas gr4j era5 1 introduction floods are the most common natural hazard as such flood affected 23 of the world s population during the 1995 2005 period with disproportionally high impacts on the poorest and most vulnerable countries notably in africa douglas et al 2008 jongman 2018 tramblay et al 2020 tunisia like the rest of the mediterranean countries regularly experiences severe flooding caused by intense rainfall events which result in significant material losses as well as casualties llasat et al 2010 while these floods have severe consequences in terms of casualties and economic losses an increase in the vulnerability to these episodes has been observed mainly attributed to urban development and land use change zahar et al 2008 fehri 2014 loudyi and kantoush 2020 dahri and abida 2020 flood related losses can be mitigated through effective flood forecasting and early warning mechanisms that provide additional preparation time prior to a flood event thiemig et al 2011 cools et al 2016 which allows the timely implementation of flood mitigating measures such as securing assets and evacuating people in europe flood forecasting and early warning is primarily addressed at national and regional level through their own systems and tools which are complemented at european scale since 2005 by the european flood awareness system efas bartholmes et al 2009 thielen et al 2009 efas is europe s overarching flood forecasting and monitoring system operated since 2012 under the copernicus emergency management service its global extension the global flood awareness system glofas alfieri et al 2013 harrigan et al 2020 aims at providing such flood forecasting and monitoring capabilities at global scale using a similar setup to efas but using era5 hersbach et al 2020 based on the open source https ec jrc github io lisflood lisflood model van der knijff et al 2010 efas and glofas are supporting national and regional authorities responsible for flood risk management with a wide range of constantly updated early flood forecast information for a fast and dynamic situational awareness on possible flood risks for the next 10 efas and 30 glofas days in addition efas also supports the eu civil protection mechanism through providing daily an overview across europe and neighboring countries on currently observed and forecasted flood events for an improved and coordinated emergency response at european level even though being a pan european system efas covers the northern part of africa and produces daily hydrological predictions for riverine and flash floods and hence might be suitable for supporting the tunisian authorities with early flood risk information however the predictive capacity of efas or glofas for that particular area is unknown as the lack of available hydrological data river discharge and precipitation data mostly allows neither the calibration of lisflood nor the validation of the current uncalibrated performance over those areas complicating matters the tunisian river basins are also relatively small as the majority of mediterranean basins merheb et al 2016 compared to the spatial resolution of large scale models that could limit the model s capacity to correctly represent the dynamics of the hydrological response global hydrological models ghms such as lisflood are designed to be implemented in all the possible hydrological regimes by including a variety of relevant runoff generating processes archfield et al 2015 bierkens 2015 sood and smakhtin 2015 trigg et al 2016 kauffeldt et al 2016 but they still need to be evaluated at the basin scale to assess their accuracy since there are no in situ observations of precipitation or river discharge in tunisia currently available to the efas or glofas frameworks there is a strong need to validate the hydrological simulations against observed discharge data to evaluate their current capacity to reproduce floods prior to using those for flood forecasting in an operational environment bernhofen et al 2018 trigg et al 2016 a very important question would be to know how effective the model could be when driven by the recent era5 reanalysis in place of observed rainfall since era5 has demonstrated good capabilities for hydrological modeling in different regions of the world and in particular semi arid ones bandara et al 2021 bandhauer et al 2022 jiang et al 2021 reder and rianna 2021 tarek et al 2021 in this context the objective of the present study is to evaluate the feasibility of flood modeling in tunisia using era5 rainfall as input as a preliminary step towards the implementation of efas glofas in this region this is done based on a set of 6 basins comparing uncalibrated as well as calibrated simulations of the lisflood distributed model and the gr4j lumped model perrin et al 2003 these two models are compared herein to evaluate the sensitivity of the results to two different hydrological model structures both models are forced with observed precipitation and era5 to investigate the suitability of using a global reanalysis dataset providing precipitation and temperature in place of observations an aspect which is of particular interest for hydrological modeling in data scarce areas the questions addressed in the present study are i what is the performance of the hydrological models to reproduce daily discharge dynamics with era5 compared to using observed precipitation ii are the hydrological models able to simulate the occurrence and the magnitude of high flows 2 study area and datasets for this study six tunisian catchments were selected fig 1 based on catchment size discharge data and rain gauge data availability as well as length of the hydrological record and data quality the main characteristics of these catchments are summarized in table 1 they are all located in northern and central parts of tunisia with semi arid conditions characterized by low annual rainfall and high evapotranspiration that are typical of mediterranean catchments of north africa there is a gradient in aridity from north to south with the hathob hc and merguellil mh basins being the two most arid ones holding the largest proportion of zero flow days there is a marked seasonality of precipitation and surface runoff with a rainy season during winter months and a dry season spanning during summer months with high evapotranspiration rates consequently all basins are intermittent except basin 2 the medjerda river mj which is the only perennial river in tunisia only two basins are impacted by dams the medjerda mj spanning across algeria and tunisia with the ain dalia dam in algeria controlling 6 of basin area and the basin of joumine at mateur jm where the joumine dam controls 40 of basin area the discharge data used in this study was obtained from the sierem database dieulin et al 2019 although the available record starts in the 1950 s most stations present limited and discontinuous discharge time series thus the discharge data availability defined the study period which runs from january 1991 to september 2006 the year 1991 being used for model spin up despite a careful selection of the discharge dataset from the available stations in tunisia the discharge time series present some gaps as it is often the case in data scarce areas in particular the missing data represents up to 40 of daily data in joumine at jebel antra jj and melah at ouchtata mo thus the evaluation is performed over a smaller number of years for these stations it should be noted that the highest frequency of missing data is reported during summer and early autumn the driest months of the year when runoff usually ceases two different daily precipitation datasets were used to force the hydrological models i precipitation observations from 960 rain gauges with data from 1975 to 2006 obtained from the database of the direction générale des resources en eau dgre of tunisia and ii the era5 precipitation product available from 1979 to present with a spatial resolution of 30 km the rain gauge data used here was previously used to produce precipitation maps over tunisia tramblay et al 2019 and therefore was already quality checked the precipitation observations were interpolated using inverse distance weighting to generate a 5 km gridded daily precipitation dataset the era5 rainfall was re gridded to the same 5 km grid using a bilinear interpolation although the two hydrological models were implemented with the same rainfall inputs there are slight differences in the data processing to adapt it to the structure of each of the models in the case of gr4j the interpolated observed precipitation and era5 were averaged for each catchment to obtain its daily areal value in contrast for the lisflood implementation the model was run using the distributed rainfall at 5 km in the particular case of the medjerda mj basin that originates in algeria 40 of catchment area since no rain gauges in algeria were available for this study observed rainfall is only computed with rain gauges in tunisia a comparison of the observed and era5 rainfall over the basins is provided in fig 2 in terms of seasonal rainfall era5 overestimate rainfall compared to observations on average 15 in particular in september and may in terms of extremes rainfall events above the 95th percentile also display higher values for era5 33 compared to rain gauges data however this comparison remains hampered by the lack of homogeneity of the rain gauge network in terms of spatial but also temporal coverage due to missing data for some stations and time periods the temperature data used is the daily era5 temperature hersbach et al 2020 in the absence of meteorological stations with data available in the implementation of the gr4j model it was used to calculate daily potential evapotranspiration pet through the hargreaves formula hargreaves and samani 1985 with daily minimum and maximum temperatures that proved to be efficient in north africa er raki et al 2010 for lisflood the evapotranspiration inputs were calculated through the lisvap model van der knijff 2010 that rely on the penman monteith formulation computed with era5 data the updated documentation and source code of this model can be found with the current model documentation under https ec jrc github io lisflood lisvap even if the two models do not share the same computation of pet this should not influence the results given the very small influence of the pet formulation in water limited regions such as tunisia dakhlaoui et al 2020 3 hydrological models 3 1 lisflood lisflood is a spatially distributed rainfall runoff and channel routing model de roo et al 2000 van der knijff et al 2010 given that lisflood was originally developed to model large european rivers it is based on raster files in order to simplify the management of large datasets lisflood requires a large number of static inputs that describe the physical properties of the catchments e g land cover leaf area index channel and soil properties etc and it is driven by the dynamic inputs which are the meteorological forcing that is the precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration time series as lisflood is open source its source code can be found with the updated model documentation and user guide under https github com ec jrc lisflood code the standard setup of lisflood is made of three different components i a three layer soil water balance ii subsurface and groundwater flow and iii routing of surface runoff one interesting characteristic of this model is that conceptualization is a hybrid between physically based and conceptual model on one hand the processes involved in the soil module are reproduced by solving the corresponding governing equations as it is characteristic of the physically based models on the other hand the groundwater and subsurface component is constituted by two sequential reservoirs with a similar structure to those of the conceptual models this standard setup of the model with split routing is used in this study the processes are simulated cell by cell and include snow melting interception infiltration preferential flow groundwater flow lateral flow and surface runoff the lisflood setup as used in efas has 14 parameters left to determine through calibration however given the scope of the present study the parameters related to snow melting floodplains lakes and reservoirs were excluded thus the lisflood structure presented above leaves a total of 8 parameters to be determined through calibration 1 xinanjiang exponential xi controls the infiltration capacity 2 power preferential flow pf determines which proportion of precipitation bypasses the soil and goes directly to the water table 3 upper zone time constant uz determines the residence time of the upper groundwater reservoir or fast response of the system 4 groundwater percolation perc that is the maximum percolation rate from the upper to lower groundwater zone 5 lower groundwater zone time constant lz equivalent to the uz in this case controls the residence time of the lower reservoir and consequently the slow response of the system 6 manning multiplier man is applied to the manning roughness coefficient to fine tune the timing of the channel routing 7 ground water loss gwloss parameter the maximum loss rate out of lower groundwater zone 8 lower zone threshold lzthreshold parameter a threshold to stop outflow from lower groundwater zone to the channel 3 2 gr4j gr4j perrin et al 2003 is a lumped conceptual rainfall runoff hydrological model this model was chosen since it proved to be efficient to reproduce river discharge in different basins of tunisia dakhlaoui et al 2017 2019 due to its simplicity low data requirements and parsimonious structure the conceptualization of the model is based on two sequential reservoirs that mimic the runoff generation processes at catchment scale the first reservoir simulates the soil moisture budget from the input time series evaporation e and precipitation p the amount of moisture retained by the soil is controlled by the parameter x1 which is a threshold representing the maximum storage capacity of the soil reservoir s the water outgoing this reservoir is split in two flows a fast flow representing the short time response of the catchment and a slow flow which represents the slow response of the system and goes into the second deposit the fraction of flow going to the second reservoir is determined by the parameter x2 which is the groundwater exchange coefficient as in the first reservoir the second deposit has a threshold value that represents the maximum amount of water that can be held in it r and it s defined by the parameter x3 finally the routing time of both flows fast and slow is established by a unit hydrograph whose time base corresponds to the last parameter x4 table 3 in this way the flow going into the second reservoir has a routing time equal to the unit hydrograph time base uh1 whereas the routing time of the flow contributing directly to the streamflow is two times the unit hydrograph time base uh2 4 methods 4 1 model calibration strategies in an initial run the two models lisflood and gr4j are set up with their default parametrization ie the default values of the model parameter for each model in table 2 for lisflood and table 3 for gr4j and forced once with era5 and once with the interpolated aggregated observed precipitation the aim of this exercise is threefold 1 to evaluate their capacity to reproduce the general hydrological conditions in an uncalibrated state 2 to establish a baseline performance that allows us to assess the improvement brought through calibration and 3 to compare the influence of the precipitation input on model performance after establishing a baseline performance both models are calibrated for that the input datasets are divided into nine years for calibration january 1992 to august 2001 and five validation years august 2001 to august 2006 the data in 1991 is used for the model warm up and therefore not used to compute the scores since the lisflood model code for calibration is based on the deap algorithm fortin et al 2012 maier et al 2014 hirpa et al 2018 for consistency we applied the same algorithm for gr4j calibration so the results can be compared see hirpa et al 2018 section 3 1 for full details about the algorithm implementation hydrologic models are typically calibrated through the use of objective functions the most common being the nash sutcliffe efficiency criterion nash and sutcliffe 1970 however given the potential limitations of this metric gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 the kling gupta efficiency score kge is considered herein for model calibration notably because the kge is a linear combination of three components of the modeling error the pearson correlation coefficient the bias ratio and variability ratio between observed qo and simulated qs runoff 1 kge 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 α 1 2 2 with r cov q o q s σ qo 2 σ qs 2 α σ qs σ qo β q s q o consequently the calibration was performed using the kge as an objective function proven to be efficient to reproduce peak flows and mean annual regime mizukami et al 2019 for lisflood the parameter ranges are the same as applied in the calibration of efas in the case of gr4j the parameter range used during calibration and the initial run are those presented in perrin et al 2003 4 2 skill scores for high runoff events the model s ability to reproduce flood events is evaluated by three skill scores the probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and heidke skill score hss wilks 2019 to compute these scores all events above the 95th percentile of daily discharge computed over the whole period have been extracted from observations and also model simulations the 95th percentiles have been computed only for discharge value above 0 5 m3 s 1 to not bias the detection of high runoff events towards smaller values since intermittent rivers frequently have zeros flow values for each model simulation the thresholds ie the 95th percentiles to extract the events are redefined to avoid the effects of model bias on the detection of flood events by doing so this evaluation is fully consistent with the event detection done in efas and glofas bartholmes et al 2009 as explained in thielen et al 2009 there are two main motivations to use this approach first the absence of detailed information about small scale river regulation small dams water uptakes for irrigation that cannot be modelled inducing bias on simulated discharge second the limited accuracy of meteorological measurements notably precipitation that could lead to large discrepancies between modelled and observed discharge 3 pod a a c 4 far b a b 5 hss ad bc a c c d a b b d 2 where a is the hit rate the events correctly modelled b the false alarms events modelled but not observed c the missed events observed events not modelled and d the correct negative that can be obtained from a contingency table in addition to these scores quantile quantile plots a graphical method for comparing two probability distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other were used to compare the distributions of high runoff events to detect potential biases due to the rainfall input or the hydrological model 4 3 hydrological consistency of the simulations several studies have described a number of hydrological signatures that can be incorporated into the hydrologic modeling process to evaluate the hydrological consistency of the simulations beyond the use of standard verification scores such those aforementioned there are two main ways in which these hydrological signatures can be used to improve the hydrological consistency of the simulations 1 to compare and identify the most adequate model structure for a given catchment or to evaluate the suitability of a single model and 2 to include them in the calibration process as a part of a multi objective calibration approach mcmillan et al 2017 mcmillan 2020 gnann et al 2021 in the present study four hydrological signatures tailored to describe flood related processes have been used to compare the hydrological consistency of the simulations generated by lisflood and gr4j with a focus on extremes for this purpose the toolbox presented in gnann et al 2021 has been used to compute hydrological signatures from daily discharge that describe several components of the hydrological response typical of these semi arid basins 1 the richard baker flashiness index fi that quantifies the response time of runoff after the onset of a rainfall event and the return to base flow conditions baker et al 2004 2 peak distribution pd that shows whether the peak discharges are of equal height it is computed as the slope between the 10th and 50th of a flow duration curve constructed by only considering hydrograph peaks euser et al 2013 3 rising limb density rld is a descriptor of the hydrograph shape and smoothness without consideration for the flow magnitude thus describing the flashiness of the catchment response it is computed as the ratio between the number of rising limbs and the total amount of timesteps the hydrograph is rising sawicz et al 2011 so it is equivalent to the inverse of the mean time to peak 4 variability index vi the standard deviation of the common logarithms of discharge determined at 10 intervals from 10 to 90 of the cumulative frequency distribution estrany et al 2010 5 results 5 1 model performance without calibration this first evaluation represents a benchmark to test whether the models without calibration could be useful for hydrological modeling and notably the detection of high flow events during the full period with observed data in general the performance with uncalibrated models is not satisfactory and highly dependent on the basins fig 3 for example in joumine at mateur jm joumine at jbel antra jj or melah mo basins the simulations with lisflood and gr4j produce kge close or above 0 3 while for the other basins the performances are very low with kge close to zero model bias as shown on fig 3 is very strong with either an over or underestimation of runoff yet for most simulations the kge is larger than 0 41 that is the value corresponding to a mean flow benchmark knoben et al 2019 nevertheless the correlations between observed and simulated flows exceed 0 5 in 4 of the 6 basins due to the strong streamflow seasonality typical of semi arid basins the weakest performances in terms of kge and hss are observed for basins mh and hc the most arid ones with very low pod and high far the pod scores can reach 0 5 especially for basins of joumine at mateur jm medjerda mj joumine at jebel antra jj and melah mo interestingly for the smallest basin joumine at jebel antra jj the pod is reaching values close to 0 8 with lisflood driven by observed rainfall and gr4j driven by era5 proving that the un calibrated setup is efficient to detect floods in this basin no significant differences are observed between the lisflood and gr4j models nor between the use of observed precipitation or era5 with performance varying greatly from one catchment to another when looking at the daily discharge values above the 95th percentile all the simulations strongly underestimate the flow values results not shown these results indicate that the simulations without model calibration are strongly biased and cannot be used for flood event detection in most cases 5 2 model calibration and validation after model calibration as shown on fig 4 considering observed rainfall or era5 we obtained slightly better performances with gr4j driven by observed rainfall mean kge 0 65 or era5 mean kge 0 59 rather than with lisflood driven by observed rainfall mean kge 0 59 or era5 mean kge 0 48 the highest kge values are obtained in 4 out of 6 basins with the combination of gr4j with observed rainfall mj mh hc jj mo a similar difference between the two models efficiency is obtained in terms of correlations however less differences are found between the two hydrological models for pod or hss scores indicating a similar performance to reproduce high runoff events for instance very similar pod scores are observed between lisflood and gr4j driven by observations mean pod of 0 41 and 0 45 respectively or era5 0 36 and 0 4 respectively however the far is very high for 3 basins mh jj mo notably with lisflood driven by era5 yielding low hss scores it should be noted that acceptable kge scores do not warrant a good detection capability in terms of skills scores for flood detection that are low for three basins out of six in terms of flood magnitude the quantile quantile plots fig 5 show that all models once calibrated are able to reproduce the distribution of daily discharge events above the 95th percentile except for the hathob hc and melah mo basins there are no striking differences between simulations with observed rainfall or era5 except for the medjerda mj basin where the best reproduction of threshold exceedances is obtained with lisflood driven by observed rainfall and joumine at jebel antra jj with the best simulations are those of lisflood driven by observed rainfall or era5 during the validation we observed very strong differences among basins fig 6 the mean kge is equal to 0 32 with lisflood and 0 2 with gr4j when using observed rainfall 0 26 and 0 24 with era5 but average performance could be misleading here due to the large differences between basins it should be noted that these scores remain quite low due to the short period of validation in a context of a strong interannual variability of precipitation and runoff in these semi arid environments better performances are achieved in terms of pod with lisflood mean pod 0 45 using observed rainfall and 0 4 with era5 than with gr4j pod 0 43 and 0 35 with observed rainfall or era5 respectively on the contrary the correlation between observed and simulated runoff remains above 0 5 except for the melah mo basin overall the only basin with acceptable performances in validation with the two hydrological models and rainfall inputs is the medjerda mj being the largest one in the sample considered herein in the only basin with the presence of a dam significantly influencing river flow joumine at mateur jm we note a relatively weak performance in terms of kge but performances similar to the other basins for the detection of floods the hydrographs of the jm basin show the effect of dam regulation notably between 1998 and 2001 as shown in supplementary materials figures for the high runoff events magnitude fig 7 there are more differences between the different rainfall inputs during validation than calibration but overall the quantile quantile plots of fig 7 indicate that for most basins the runoff events above the 95th percentile are not well reproduced in validation the best results are obtained for the medjerda mj with simulations driven by observed rainfall closer to observations than simulations driven by era5 the difference between the two hydrological models appears small here suggesting that the rainfall input has the largest influence on the results 5 3 model ability to reproduce hydrological signatures the hydrological signatures computed with observed daily discharge data reveal the difference in terms of runoff response across the basins fig 8 for instance the two signatures indicative of the flashiness response the flashiness index and the rising limb density are the highest for the two southernmost basins merguellil mh and hathob hc that are the most arid and intermittent basins this reveals that in these two basins the hydrograph shapes are less smooth than in northern tunisia with shorter response time of runoff after a rainfall event explaining the lower efficiency of hydrological models there for the peak distribution the values are rather homogeneous in the different basins with the highest value for the smallest basin joumine at jebel antra jj lisflood and gr4j tend to underestimate the flashiness index and the rising limb density when driven by observed or era5 rainfall fig 8 but these differences to reproduce the different hydrological signatures are to a large extent dependent on the catchment characteristics a distinct behavior is observed for the two most arid basins with different reproduction of the signatures with different combinations of models and rainfall inputs this is most notably the case for the flashiness index and rising limb density in basins 3 and 4 the peak distribution in basin 3 the variability index is generally the worst reproduced signature in all the basins on the contrary the flashiness index and rising limb density signatures are best reproduced with mean absolute errors less than 0 5 overall no striking differences in the ability of lisflood and gr4j to reproduce the hydrological signatures using observed or era5 rainfall is found focusing on the independent validation period it is shown in fig 8 that lisflood driven by rain gauge data outperforms the same model driven by era5 for all signatures whereas with gr4j era5 driven simulations outperform those driven by observations in 3 out of 4 signatures 6 discussion hydrological modeling in tunisia is challenging due to the data availability and data quality issues as for many semi arid regions the performance of hydrological models is usually low due to the strong interannual variability of runoff generation but also the observational limitations in the context of a high spatial variability of rainfall inputs mcintyre and al qurashi 2009 notably dryland hydrology is characterized by strong threshold effects that may require specific hydrological model structures cudennec et al 2007 wheater et al 2007 sumi et al 2022 accounting for the non linearity in the storage discharge relationship jothityangkoon et al 2001 huang et al 2016 lahmers et al 2019 the influence of the seasonal variability of vegetation cover on interception and soil crusting wheater et al 2007 bouvier et al 2018 landscape variability and lateral redistribution processes that could reduce runoff volumes güntner and bronstert 2004 and transmission losses within the channel beds goodrich et al 1997 because of its conceptual nature the gr4j model could not be easily modified to represent these processes however given the modular structure of lisflood the current model structure used in efas could be adapted to include the relevant processes following some field based validation of the main components that would be required an additional issue stems from the available data to perform a model evaluation as in the present work with the daily time step of discharge data being suboptimal to analyze flood dynamics several studies observed a fast decay of soil saturation following rainfall events indicating hourly time step data better suited for this type of analysis in semi arid basins el khalki et al 2020 this may be the cause for the low scores on flood detection pod and hss in the present study most moderate to small flood events may last only a few hours and not span over days therefore their detection using daily data is challenging however if daily data are already rare and difficult to obtain instantaneous flow data are even rarer the conclusions of the present work and others on the same topic are a strong incentive for the development of river discharge databases at the national regional and continental levels to foster the development of flood warning systems such as efas or glofas as shown in the present study the rainfall provided by the era5 reanalysis could provide a reliable alternative in place of observed rain gauge data provided that discharge data would be available for model calibration there is indeed a crucial need for good quality river discharge data beven et al 2020 crochemore et al 2020 that also cover a variety of different regions do et al 2018 tramblay et al 2021 to be used for the validation of hydrological simulations with ghms such as lisflood while about two thirds of hydrological data from observational networks in developing countries are reported to be in declining conditions dixon et al 2020 there are some ongoing initiatives for data rescue such as the world meteorological organization s global hydrometry support facility or the global flood partnership alfieri et al 2021 that is regrouping a community of both researchers and practitioners from various countries to develop modeling strategies to reduce flood risks while it is obvious that it is not possible to adopt the same modeling strategy in data poor and data rich regions where hydrological models can be calibrated with observations in a large number of basins the present study illustrates the potential of using a ghm for flood risk management at catchment scale in a developing country to overcome the limitations linked to the lack of discharge data for calibrating the models over large regions the regionalization of the ghms parameter could provide pre determined parameter values adapted to ungauged basins in different regions beck et al 2020 ma et al 2021 however any regionalization attempt requires river discharge data quality on a large number of catchments to constitute a statistically significant group of donor basins from which we can transfer the parameters to ungauged basins as recent studies suggest these approaches could be applied on worldwide databases of basin properties taking benefits of the recent developments in machine learning techniques feng et al 2021 ma et al 2021 7 summary and conclusions in this study two models with very different structures were compared to reproduce river runoff and floods for a set of tunisian basins the distributed lisflood model used in the efas and glofas and the lumped gr4j model the performance of the two hydrological models tested in ungauged basins was assessed through their application with default parameter values to mimic the absence of discharge data for calibration showing little skill without calibration the calibration process has been proven to greatly enhance the performance of the two hydrological models the comparison of the performance of lisflood and gr4j after calibration shows that both models have similar skill in determining whether a flood event will occur results also showed little effects of the precipitation input on the simulated discharge the differences of the simulated quantiles of the observation driven models and the era5 driven models are very similar it should be noted that the different evaluation scores remained low as is often the case in semi arid and arid basins characterized by a strong variability of precipitation and runoff in these basins flood hydrographs have a reduced or no base flow contribution and most of the streamflow is constituted by the direct surface runoff largely influenced by the infiltration capacity of the soil the reproduction of the hydrological behavior of these rivers is still challenging often requiring sub daily data for model calibration and evaluation results of the present study demonstrate that era5 data could provide a valuable alternative to observed precipitation as long as there is available river discharge data to calibrate the hydrological model parameters this is especially important when the modeling results are intended to be used for water resources management at catchment or regional scales rather than an assessment at global scale as data availability conditions the modeling approach in tunisia and in most developing countries the main scientific question to address is no longer which model better represents the extreme flows but rather which modeling strategy can best reproduce floods for a maximum number of basins while requiring a minimum amount of data in other words the question to be answered in the future is how to apply such models regionally given the available data to implement efficient regional flood warning and forecasting systems such as efas or glofas credit authorship contribution statement elia cantoni conceptualization
