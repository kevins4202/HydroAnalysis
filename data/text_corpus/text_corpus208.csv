1040,concerns on the environmental disruption and ecosystem degradation due to the biological invasions are growing with far reaching consequences for the resilience of recipient ecosystems while numerous studies mostly emphasized the negative impacts of invasive species on native species at a single time point there is a lack of knowledge whether and how the invasion impacts vary with time here we provide an empirical study on stage dependent invasive impacts in an intertidal seagrass habitat zostera japonica which is undergoing invasion of an invasive cordgrass spartina alterniflora combining results from field surveys and experiments suggested that impacts of cordgrass on seedling establishment of native seagrass species shift from facilitation at the initial stage of invasion to inhibition at the later stage when the invasive cordgrass become densely vegetated causing density dependent effects in addition at the later stage patch expansion of cordgrass triggered degradation of seagrass dominant habitats showing the remnant patches of seagrass dominant habitat have a strong patch size dependent effect with an optimal patch size of 8 m2 and 1 5 cm detritus to the establishment of seagrass seedlings these stage dependent effects strongly linked to water movement and sedimentation rate both of them are modified by the abundance of the invasive cordgrass and patch formation through transforming native seagrass habitat with invasion our findings highlight the importance of unraveling stage dependent impacts for assessing the consequences of biological invasion on native ecosystems degradation keywords seagrass ecosystem degradation saltmarsh cordgrass ecosystem engineer facilitation density dependent effect patch size dependent effect 1 introduction biological invasions have been recognized as a vital driver of community organization and ecosystem functioning bellard et al 2016 byun et al 2018 lampert et al 2014 mounting evidence has reported that many invasive species function as ecosystem engineers that modify the community structure by altering physical and or biological system properties such as nutrient cycling productivity hydrology particle flux and habitat degradation lampert et al 2014 mack et al 2000 one of the most relevant issues in invasion ecology is to understand how such habitat modification by invasive species affect the resilience of recipient ecosystems bellard et al 2016 latombe et al 2017 oliver et al 2015 valiente banuet et al 2015 van kleunen et al 2015 since functional traits associated with ecosystem engineering of invasive plants often differ in space and time bouma et al 2016 clark and johnston 2011 koch et al 2009 their ability to modify the invaded habitats may be stage dependent alp et al 2016 kröel dulay et al 2015 yet there is still a lack of understanding on whether and how the temporal variation in habitat modification by the invasive organisms may affect the performance of native species and the resilience of the invaded ecosystems intertidal ecosystems are rated as one of the most threatened ecosystems hu et al 2015 möller et al 2014 zhu et al 2016 yet are among the most vulnerable habitats to species invasion lampert et al 2014 neira et al 2006 ecosystem engineering ability of invasive organisms in intertidal environments such as salt marsh plants oysters and mussels is often related to their capacity of reducing hydrodynamic energy duarte et al 2013 the efficiency in energy dissipation by intertidal vegetation is governed by plant functional traits such as stem density height and stiffness bouma et al 2009 these traits often change over time at different life stages which can result in temporal shifts in the capacity of wave dissipation bouma et al 2009 studies on cordgrass spartina a well known invasive plant species in coastal environments show that sparse and flexible shoots contribute less to wave attenuation than dense and stiffer stems bouma et al 2009 hill and roberts 2017 möller et al 2014 paul et al 2012 lampert et al 2014 yang and guo 2018 for invasive plant engineers such as cordgrass their habitat modifying capacity may shift as the invasive community grows intensively and extensively throughout the course of invasion although increasing emphasis on the importance of spatial and temporal variability of invasive processes in structuring the invaded habitats bruno et al 2017 theoharides and dukes 2007 vilà et al 2011 few field measurements and manipulative experiments have been undertaken to thoroughly link invasion processes and pattern to the community dynamic of the native plants bruno et al 2017 van kleunen et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 therefore knowledge on stage dependent effects of the invasive plant engineer would enhance our understanding of variations in habitats modification and native ecosystem degradation during invasive processes seagrasses are critically important ecosystems that are experiencing degradation at very high and accelerating rates worldwide statton et al 2017 trevathan tackett et al 2018 while studies show that large scale seagrass distribution is at times associated with cordgrass spartina in the coastal areas bouma et al 2005 the potential for habitat modification of spartina to drive their co occurrence as well as their correlative changes has been largely unsolved although a number of studies have showed the distribution and productivity of seagrass are dynamically regulated by a combination of abiotic i e tidal inundation sediment composition water availability and biotic i e top down control interspecific competition factors bruno et al 2017 in coastal ecosystems stresses by hydrodynamic forces such as wave energy and current velocity play a dominant role in the establishment survival and expansion of plants bouma et al 2009 gaertner et al 2014 katsanevakis et al 2016 south et al 2016 experimental and observational studies have demonstrated small scale negative and large scale positive relationships between invasive and native plants respectively bruno et al 2017 this discrepancy is often ascribed to trait based habitat modifications of plant and communities such as stem stiffness shoot density patch size and shapes bouma et al 2009 it is noteworthy that these trait dependences of invasive species can interact with local conditions to modify the type and magnitude of impacts over time therefore incorporating stage dependent effects will be crucial to determine their relative importance of habitat modifying ability on seagrass systems over time intertidal coastal seagrass ecosystem with expansion of cordgrass spartina invasion offers an excellent model system to perform comparative analysis on its impacts on seagrass ecosystem degradation in the yellow river delta to test our hypothesis we performed both in situ manipulative experiments and surveys to examine the influence of spartina shoot density and remnant habitat patches of seagrass on water flow and sedimentation and their links to the establishment of seagrass seedlings see fig 1 for a conceptual diagram depicting the invasion impacts varying with stages we hypothesized that habitat modifying effects varying with invasion stage depend on the density of spartina second we hypothesized that spatial occupation of cordgrass patches divides the original seagrass beds into patches in different sizes therefore establishment of seagrass seedlings within the remnant patches of seagrass habitats can be patch size dependent third we expected that density and patch dependent of habitat modifying effects can be partly explained by the changes of water flow and sedimentation our study will provide empirical evidence that habitat modifying invasive cordgrass would cause both positive and negative effects on seagrass seedlings varying with invasion stages and depending on their ability to alter the habitats therefore our study may provide general knowledge on identifying stage dependent response and resilience of native ecosystems to invasive ecosystem engineers and thereby is of importance to guide ecosystem based management conservation and restoration 2 materials and methods 2 1 study system and species this study was conducted at an exposed tidal saltmarsh wetland in the yellow river estuary northern china n 37 50 51 e 119 6 2 the climate is temperate monsoonal with an average annual precipitation of 537 3 mm and an average annual temperature of 12 88 c he et al 2017 at the study site tides are irregular semidiurnal with an average tidal amplitude of 1 5 m to 2 5 m in the study site densely vegetaged seagrass zostera japonica was once the habitat forming species however recent years it is being invaded by a saltmarsh plant a kind of cordgrass spartina alterniflora large areas invaded by the cordgrass which would previously have been native seagrass and saltmarsh or unvegetated mudflats he et al 2012 the dominant seagrass beds have been significantly modified by the expansion of the cordgrass resulting in mosaic landscape this mosaic includes extensive shallow healthy seagrass beds sandy unvegetated areas deeper water mixes of sand and sparse seagrass sparse patchy and band cordgrass and intertidal mud flats see fig 2 the invaded areas with vegetated cordgrasses tend to have soft clay dominated sediments with high organic content and high accumulated plant detritus see also fig 2 at low tide the zone co occurence by seagrass and cordgarss was directly exposed to the air in china spartina alterniflora is becoming increasingly common and is at the early stage of invasion he et al 2012 resulting in many negative ecological impacts thus having been listed as one of the 16 most notorious invasive species in china zhang et al 2018 we chose such a study system because annual expansion of cordgrass has created moasic patterns of both seagrass and cordgrass therefore our study site contains a range of seagrass habitat configurations from large continuous healthy areas of seagrass to areas with isolated seagrass patches surrounded by cordgarss such an intertidal landscape which originally dominated by seagrass and now is undergoing fast invasion of cordgrass provids an exceptional opportunity to test the potential effects of invading process on seagrass beds this is because the invasion impacts of cordgrass on seagrass habitats through habitat modifications may differ in a number of important aspects including both biological and physical factors therefore the interrelatedness of physical factors such as wave current flow and sedimentation rate and biological factors such as density of seagrass and cordgrass could provide correlative and mechanistic relationships 2 2 field survey design and methods we used a space for time substitution methodology to investigate stage dependent invasion impacts of cordgrass spartina alterniflora on the seagrass seeedlings zostera japonica prior to setting up our sampling plan we initially characterized the range of density of cordgrass that distributed in the seagrass beds we found three kinds of context dependent sampling zones defined by the presence and absence of cordgrass we initiated transect sampling spanning the 3 zones representing different invading stages from the seaward uninvaded seagrass site i e pre or no invasion landward to the large densely vegetated patches i e post invasion and remnant seagrass patches surrounded by vegetated cordgrass patches i e ongoing invasion following these defined sampling zones we determined seagrass seedling density in early april 2018 we randomly counted the density of cordgrass of each zone with a 1 m2 quadrat then to define the invasion pattern with three kinds of habitats for knowing cordgrass invasion impacts thus our experimental sites consisted of 1 patches of vegetated cordgrass with different density 2 remnant patches of seagrass habitat of varying sizes 3 seaward healthy seagrass habitats with absence of cordgrass see fig 2 to investigate both the magnitude and the potential mechanisms of influence of cordgrass on water flow and sedimentation rate herein means tiny plant detritus thickness we established their correlations with seagrass seedlings we adopted both measurements and manipulative approaches to know the difference of physical factors among different defined habitats in this study taken together the resulting data on sedimentation rate and chalk block dissolution provide potential mechanistic looking at changes induced by different invading stages 2 3 density dependent effects of cordgrass on seagrass seedlings to understand whether the invasion impacts could vary with invasion processes density dependent changes of habitat modification was determined by establishing the relationship between density of cordgrass and seagrass seedlings we counted the density of cordgrass at low tide when the seagrasses were matured on august 12th 2017 n 15 separate patches sampled patches were at least 20 m apart horizontally within each patch we randomly placed a single 1 m2 quadrat to count the shoot density of cordgrass and within the quadrat then randomly counted the density of adult seagrass with a 0 5 m2 quadrat once finished the counting we marked this area for knowing the further impacts on the seagrass seedlings next year in early april 2018 we quantified the number of seedlings using a 0 5 0 5 m quadrat at each former marked area at low tide 2 4 patch size dependent effects of remnant seagrass habitat on seagrass seedlings to understand whether the remnant patches of seagrass divided by the expasion of cordgrass can be an important determinant influencing the establishment of seagrass seedlings we expected that the remnant seagrass patches impact on seagrass seedlings could be patch size dependent to document rates of seedling recruitment we counted seedlings after most seeds had germinated in the above defined habitats in early april 2018 seagrass seedlings were counted with randomly placing quadrats 0 5 m2 among different patch sizes of remnant seagrass habitat with the area about 1 2 4 6 9 16 25 and 100 m2 at low tide generally representing a natural gradient in early april 2018 2 5 measurement of water flow standing plant shoots density is commonly used as a potential indicator for reflecting primary production and is a function that links to sedimentation and wave attenuation we tested time integrated water flow at each location to see if cordgrass attenuate water flow in turn to affect sedimentation that might contibute to the spatial variations in recruitment of seagrass seedlings in the early spring we experimentally deployed a magnesium calcite chalk block to compare water movement among each above defined habitats thus representing an integrated measure of water movement at each location thompson and glenn 1994 chalk blocks were attached to a small piece of galvanized steel mesh 1 cm2 mesh size which was fastened to the substrate with 15 cm bamboo pole for 2 weeks each chalk block was pre weighed and then dried at 40 c to a constant weight after deployment and reweighed so that total mass loss could be calculated 2 6 measurement of sedimentation in our study site tiny plant detritus can be observed see fig 2 the detritus thickness of each zone reflect intensity of hydrodynamic disturbance we measured sedimentation the vertical accumulation of plant detritus by comparing the relative thickness to the ground without any detritus we recorded the detritus thickness at each habitat that was originally marked cordgrass vegetated patch vs remnant seagrass patch vs seaward healthy seagrass habitat in early april 2018 2 7 quantification of rotted seagrass seeds within the sediment in addition to measuring the seedling density we counted seeds in the sediment with different detritus thickness we tested sedimentation impacts on seagrass seeds that were rotten as one of the potential mechanism to explain the difference of the emergence and establishment of the seagrass in april 2018 we counted rotted seeds within the sediment by locating a 10 cm2 mini quadrat we washed samples through a fine sieve 1 mm mesh to reduce the soil bulk brought the retained material back to laboratory then counted seeds of seagrass because seagrass seeds persist for less than one year in the soil these seeds collected represent the current year s production 2 8 statistical analysis we compared seagrass seedling density chalk block dissolution and sedimentation among different habitats with a one way anova and tukey s hsd post hoc comparisons we used both linear and non linear regression of power function with inverse first order to investigate and identify the effect of cordgrass density on adult seagrass and seagrass seedlings linear manners were estimated in models including only linear manners power function with inverse first order manners were tested given linear manners and included in the final models only if they significantly decreased the ratio between residuals and explained variance compared with the linear model analyses were conducted using r 3 4 1 r coreteam 2017 3 results 3 1 segrass seedlings vary with experimental sites seagrass seedling density differed significantly among experimental sites characterized by different habitats we found that in the absence of cordgrass the density of seagrass seedlings was lowest in the early april 2018 with highest density at remnant seagrass patches and with intermediate density at the vegetated areas of cordgrass fig 3 this suggests that habitats with vegetated cordgrass and remnant seagrass patches interspersed within those cordgrass patches generating positive effects on the recruitment of seedlings 3 2 water flow and sedimentation vary with experimental sites cordgrass attenuated water flow significantly creating temperate habitats to the recruitment or growth of seagrass seedlings we found that there was significant difference in chalk block dissolution among habitats fig 4 a chalk block dissolution rate decreased with the increasing density of vegetated cordgrass chalk dissolution rate was lowest within vegetated patches of cordgrass community with intermediate dissolution rate within remnant seagrass patches and with the highest dissolution rate locating at seaward healthy seagrass habitats exposed directly to the tidal water fig 4 a an inverse trend was observed that plant detritus settled on the ground i e sedimentation with a decreasing trend from vegetated patches of cordgrass community remnant seagrass patches and seaward healthy seagrass habitats in sequence fig 4 b our findings suggested that water flow and sedimentation would be vital mechanisms to explain habitats differences modified by cordgrass therefore in turn to affect the emergence and establishment of seagrass seedlings in face of invading processes of cordgrass 3 3 relationship between density of seagrass seedlings and cordgrass density density of seagrass seedlings was significantly related to cordgrass density and the density decreased non linearly with increasing cordgrass density suggesting strong density dependent effects fig 5 this suggested that increased density of vegetated cordgrass in seagrass beds could weaken the positive effects on seagrass seeedlings however this non linear relationship was largely driven by the density dependent effects on water flow and sedimentation across sampling sites fig 6 3 4 patch size dependent effects of remnant seagrass habitat on seagrass seedlings magnitude of positive effects of remnant seagrass patch interspersed within invaded areas on the establishment of seagrass seedlings varies with patch size our results revealed a non linear relationship between remnant seagrass patch size and seedling density fig 7 a showing the relationship had curvature with highest seedling density at patch area of 6 and 9 m2 moreover our results showed that with increasing area of remnant seagrass patch chalk block dissolution presents an increasing trend fig 7 b while the sedimentation presents decreasing trend fig 7 c therefore our results showed that similar decreases in seedlings density tended to have lower sedimentation corresponding to higher water movement and higher sedimentation corresponding lower water movement fig 8 although sedimentation negatively related to water movement an intermediate thickness of the sedimentation resulted in higher establishment of seagrass seedlings fig 8 a and b in addition we found that the number of rotten seeds significantly positively related to the thickness of sedimentation fig 9 suggesting the thicker sedimentation the more rotten seeds within the sediment 4 discussion while many studies mostly emphasized the negative impacts of habitat modifying invasive ecosystem engineers on native habitat forming species at a single time point there is a lack of knowledge on whether the invasion impacts could vary with invasion stages and if so the mechanisms generating shift paradigms between facilitation and inhibition are still unclear bouma et al 2016 byun et al 2018 gaertner et al 2014 here we provided empirical study in an intertidal seagrass system zostera japonica which is undergoing invasion of cordgrass spartina alterniflora to show stage dependent effects relying upon largely their abilities to transform seagrasss habitats by modifying current flow and sedimentation at a initial stage of invasion sparsely vegetated cordgrass facilitated recruitment of seagrass seedlings however at a later stage densely vegetated cordgrass inhibited the growth of seagrases seedlings apart from density dependent effects the remnant patches of seagrass dominant habitat have a strong patch size dependent effect on the establishment of seagrass seedlings in the early spring showing an optimal patch size of 8 m2 and 1 5 cm detritus thickness moreover our findings showed that the thick sediment can lead to more rotten seeds potentially decreaing the germination rate and emergence of seagrass seedlings complementing the long interest in relative importance of top down i e alteration of food webs by exploitation and bottom up forcing i e nutrient pollution a parallel line of research has focused on biological invasion as an important driver of seagrass ecosystem structure and functioning thomsen et al 2011 habitat modification of invasive species as the most frequently documented mechanism reflects the drastic changes in invaded habitats but is often highly variable in space and time leading to ecological unpredictability with either positive or negtaive consequences bruno et al 2017 our findings revealed that invasion impacts of spartina on the seagrass seedlings can change over time leading to the shift of positive and negative impacts with invasion these could be explained by the mortality or lower establishement of seagrass seedlings due to physical stress for example higher water flow and wave energy hill and roberts 2017 maestre et al 2003 this is consistent with the ecosystem engineering concept claiming that habitat modification by autogenic ecosystem engineering depends both on organism structure and on prevailing abiotic conditions also described as context dependency chen et al 2016 neira et al 2006 therefore identifying stage dependent invasion impacts with both facilitation and inhibition will be crucial to determine their relative importance of habitat modifying ability on seagrass systems over time outcomes of ecosystem engineering may be facilitative or inhibitive depending on prevailing abiotic conditions that change with time bruno et al 2017 rupprecht et al 2015 our study found that higher density of seagrass seedlings at the places with sparsely vegetated cordgrass and remanant patches of the seagrass beds compared to the seaward uninvaded areas this suggests that initial and later invasion of spartina can facilitate the establishment of seagrass seedlings but the facilitaion decrease with increasing of density of spartina a typical characteristic of invasion expansion the seaward habitats located at the wave exposed sites experiencing more frequently hydrodynamic disturbance to shock the sediment may result in damage to seedlings or influencing settlement of seagrass seeds pereda briones et al 2018 ruesink 2018 our results showed that the areas with presence of spartina density dependent trait of community level drives its ecosystem engineering ability by ameliorating the hydrodynamic stress and therefore increasing the sedimentation our study added emprical evidence to emphasize the importance of physical characteristics of community structures schwarz et al 2015 south et al 2016 vilà et al 2011 to elucidate the habitat modification of invasive ecosystem engineer over time therefore our study may provide insights to understand the underlining mechanisms that the modifications of morphologic tidal flat alongside the invasion processes resulting in the shift between facilitation and inhibition habitat degradation with diverse remnant patch sizes has been identified to have patch size dependent effects on mediating recolonization rate and recovery of disturbanced community angelini and silliman 2012 bruno and kennedy 2000 livernois et al 2017 we found that patch expansion of spartina creating depressions surrounded the patches led to patch size dependent effects on the seagrass seedlings as the invasion or and expansion induced the significant modifications of remnant patch size number and shoot density over time their influences on hydrodynamic and sedimentation have also changed substantially ruesink 2018 our results showed that habitat modifying cordgrass transformed seagrass dominant habitats into interconnected mosaic markedly alterating water flow and sedimentation revealing the heterogeneity pattern of seagrass seedlings these remnant patches of seagrass habitat without presence of spartina creating size dependent effect on the seagrass seedlings showing a optimal patch size 8 m2 with 1 5 cm detritus thickness that contributes the largest density of seagrass seedlings this is also consistent with the predictions from environment stress models that facilitation can increase the density and distribution of species in stressful environments by reducing abiotic stress bruno et al 2017 he et al 2012 therefore our empical study potentially explains the threshold in facilitation of invasion impact the mechanisms behind patch size dependent of habitat modifying feedback effects of spartina invasion on the native habitat forming seagrass germination of seeds and emergence of seedlings in general suffer greater stress at their early life stage consequently resulting in time delayed and trait based physiological responses to environmental stress bruno et al 2017 gunderson et al 2016 such as later emergence kaminsky et al 2015 tingstad et al 2015 shorter stem crosby et al 2015 and smaller canopy firstater et al 2016 rupprecht et al 2015 our results showed that spartina induced alteration of sedimentation had significant influences on seagrass seed availability to germinate rotten seeds as a proxy and seedlings establishment these results are consistent with those of other submerged species such as zostera marina myriophyllum spicatum and potamogeton malaianus for which burial depth was a significant factor affecting seed germination simpson et al 2018 stafford bell et al 2016 wang et al 2016 although study has showed that greater germination of seeds in fine sediments with high organic matter content compared to coarse sediments jarvis and moore 2015 statton et al 2017 wang et al 2016 our study added evidence that this can be determined by the depth of the sediment organic detritus in our study multiple reasons explained the rotten seeds with increasing thickness of the sediment such as the hypoxia temperature and salinity wang et al 2016 but in our study site increased temperature and higher moisture can be a combined reason together with the positive relationship between sediment thickness and number of rotten seeds the threshold of 1 5 cm sediment we observed in the seedling establishment provides support for threshold responses of seagrass to sedimentation modified by and varied with invasion of spartina understanding the ecological consequences by which non native species become established in invaded habitats is central to formulating effective management responses hastings 2016 nevertheless most studies about the effects of invasive ecosystem engineers have been brief and lack a temporal context alp et al 2016 kröel dulay et al 2015 our study indicates that the size of the invasive species population and environmental factors typically can vary over time therefore the full effects of the invader might not be seen for a considerable time after the initial invasion invasion associated processes such as shifts in the both biotic and abiotic factors can be interdependent and independent contributing to either facilitate or inhibit native species over time bouma et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 zhu et al 2016 although we have recognized time scale effects of invasion process on native foundation species we still lack of a basic understanding of how the biophysical feedback between cordgrass invasion and physically disturbances which might mitigate or exacerbate total ecosystem degradaton in the future therefore it is becoming imperative that experimental studies are needed to manipulate patch size and density of vegetated cordgrass for revealing their influences on expansion and physical modifications of surroundings as well as feedbacks

mechanistic relationships 2 2 field survey design and methods we used a space for time substitution methodology to investigate stage dependent invasion impacts of cordgrass spartina alterniflora on the seagrass seeedlings zostera japonica prior to setting up our sampling plan we initially characterized the range of density of cordgrass that distributed in the seagrass beds we found three kinds of context dependent sampling zones defined by the presence and absence of cordgrass we initiated transect sampling spanning the 3 zones representing different invading stages from the seaward uninvaded seagrass site i e pre or no invasion landward to the large densely vegetated patches i e post invasion and remnant seagrass patches surrounded by vegetated cordgrass patches i e ongoing invasion following these defined sampling zones we determined seagrass seedling density in early april 2018 we randomly counted the density of cordgrass of each zone with a 1 m2 quadrat then to define the invasion pattern with three kinds of habitats for knowing cordgrass invasion impacts thus our experimental sites consisted of 1 patches of vegetated cordgrass with different density 2 remnant patches of seagrass habitat of varying sizes 3 seaward healthy seagrass habitats with absence of cordgrass see fig 2 to investigate both the magnitude and the potential mechanisms of influence of cordgrass on water flow and sedimentation rate herein means tiny plant detritus thickness we established their correlations with seagrass seedlings we adopted both measurements and manipulative approaches to know the difference of physical factors among different defined habitats in this study taken together the resulting data on sedimentation rate and chalk block dissolution provide potential mechanistic looking at changes induced by different invading stages 2 3 density dependent effects of cordgrass on seagrass seedlings to understand whether the invasion impacts could vary with invasion processes density dependent changes of habitat modification was determined by establishing the relationship between density of cordgrass and seagrass seedlings we counted the density of cordgrass at low tide when the seagrasses were matured on august 12th 2017 n 15 separate patches sampled patches were at least 20 m apart horizontally within each patch we randomly placed a single 1 m2 quadrat to count the shoot density of cordgrass and within the quadrat then randomly counted the density of adult seagrass with a 0 5 m2 quadrat once finished the counting we marked this area for knowing the further impacts on the seagrass seedlings next year in early april 2018 we quantified the number of seedlings using a 0 5 0 5 m quadrat at each former marked area at low tide 2 4 patch size dependent effects of remnant seagrass habitat on seagrass seedlings to understand whether the remnant patches of seagrass divided by the expasion of cordgrass can be an important determinant influencing the establishment of seagrass seedlings we expected that the remnant seagrass patches impact on seagrass seedlings could be patch size dependent to document rates of seedling recruitment we counted seedlings after most seeds had germinated in the above defined habitats in early april 2018 seagrass seedlings were counted with randomly placing quadrats 0 5 m2 among different patch sizes of remnant seagrass habitat with the area about 1 2 4 6 9 16 25 and 100 m2 at low tide generally representing a natural gradient in early april 2018 2 5 measurement of water flow standing plant shoots density is commonly used as a potential indicator for reflecting primary production and is a function that links to sedimentation and wave attenuation we tested time integrated water flow at each location to see if cordgrass attenuate water flow in turn to affect sedimentation that might contibute to the spatial variations in recruitment of seagrass seedlings in the early spring we experimentally deployed a magnesium calcite chalk block to compare water movement among each above defined habitats thus representing an integrated measure of water movement at each location thompson and glenn 1994 chalk blocks were attached to a small piece of galvanized steel mesh 1 cm2 mesh size which was fastened to the substrate with 15 cm bamboo pole for 2 weeks each chalk block was pre weighed and then dried at 40 c to a constant weight after deployment and reweighed so that total mass loss could be calculated 2 6 measurement of sedimentation in our study site tiny plant detritus can be observed see fig 2 the detritus thickness of each zone reflect intensity of hydrodynamic disturbance we measured sedimentation the vertical accumulation of plant detritus by comparing the relative thickness to the ground without any detritus we recorded the detritus thickness at each habitat that was originally marked cordgrass vegetated patch vs remnant seagrass patch vs seaward healthy seagrass habitat in early april 2018 2 7 quantification of rotted seagrass seeds within the sediment in addition to measuring the seedling density we counted seeds in the sediment with different detritus thickness we tested sedimentation impacts on seagrass seeds that were rotten as one of the potential mechanism to explain the difference of the emergence and establishment of the seagrass in april 2018 we counted rotted seeds within the sediment by locating a 10 cm2 mini quadrat we washed samples through a fine sieve 1 mm mesh to reduce the soil bulk brought the retained material back to laboratory then counted seeds of seagrass because seagrass seeds persist for less than one year in the soil these seeds collected represent the current year s production 2 8 statistical analysis we compared seagrass seedling density chalk block dissolution and sedimentation among different habitats with a one way anova and tukey s hsd post hoc comparisons we used both linear and non linear regression of power function with inverse first order to investigate and identify the effect of cordgrass density on adult seagrass and seagrass seedlings linear manners were estimated in models including only linear manners power function with inverse first order manners were tested given linear manners and included in the final models only if they significantly decreased the ratio between residuals and explained variance compared with the linear model analyses were conducted using r 3 4 1 r coreteam 2017 3 results 3 1 segrass seedlings vary with experimental sites seagrass seedling density differed significantly among experimental sites characterized by different habitats we found that in the absence of cordgrass the density of seagrass seedlings was lowest in the early april 2018 with highest density at remnant seagrass patches and with intermediate density at the vegetated areas of cordgrass fig 3 this suggests that habitats with vegetated cordgrass and remnant seagrass patches interspersed within those cordgrass patches generating positive effects on the recruitment of seedlings 3 2 water flow and sedimentation vary with experimental sites cordgrass attenuated water flow significantly creating temperate habitats to the recruitment or growth of seagrass seedlings we found that there was significant difference in chalk block dissolution among habitats fig 4 a chalk block dissolution rate decreased with the increasing density of vegetated cordgrass chalk dissolution rate was lowest within vegetated patches of cordgrass community with intermediate dissolution rate within remnant seagrass patches and with the highest dissolution rate locating at seaward healthy seagrass habitats exposed directly to the tidal water fig 4 a an inverse trend was observed that plant detritus settled on the ground i e sedimentation with a decreasing trend from vegetated patches of cordgrass community remnant seagrass patches and seaward healthy seagrass habitats in sequence fig 4 b our findings suggested that water flow and sedimentation would be vital mechanisms to explain habitats differences modified by cordgrass therefore in turn to affect the emergence and establishment of seagrass seedlings in face of invading processes of cordgrass 3 3 relationship between density of seagrass seedlings and cordgrass density density of seagrass seedlings was significantly related to cordgrass density and the density decreased non linearly with increasing cordgrass density suggesting strong density dependent effects fig 5 this suggested that increased density of vegetated cordgrass in seagrass beds could weaken the positive effects on seagrass seeedlings however this non linear relationship was largely driven by the density dependent effects on water flow and sedimentation across sampling sites fig 6 3 4 patch size dependent effects of remnant seagrass habitat on seagrass seedlings magnitude of positive effects of remnant seagrass patch interspersed within invaded areas on the establishment of seagrass seedlings varies with patch size our results revealed a non linear relationship between remnant seagrass patch size and seedling density fig 7 a showing the relationship had curvature with highest seedling density at patch area of 6 and 9 m2 moreover our results showed that with increasing area of remnant seagrass patch chalk block dissolution presents an increasing trend fig 7 b while the sedimentation presents decreasing trend fig 7 c therefore our results showed that similar decreases in seedlings density tended to have lower sedimentation corresponding to higher water movement and higher sedimentation corresponding lower water movement fig 8 although sedimentation negatively related to water movement an intermediate thickness of the sedimentation resulted in higher establishment of seagrass seedlings fig 8 a and b in addition we found that the number of rotten seeds significantly positively related to the thickness of sedimentation fig 9 suggesting the thicker sedimentation the more rotten seeds within the sediment 4 discussion while many studies mostly emphasized the negative impacts of habitat modifying invasive ecosystem engineers on native habitat forming species at a single time point there is a lack of knowledge on whether the invasion impacts could vary with invasion stages and if so the mechanisms generating shift paradigms between facilitation and inhibition are still unclear bouma et al 2016 byun et al 2018 gaertner et al 2014 here we provided empirical study in an intertidal seagrass system zostera japonica which is undergoing invasion of cordgrass spartina alterniflora to show stage dependent effects relying upon largely their abilities to transform seagrasss habitats by modifying current flow and sedimentation at a initial stage of invasion sparsely vegetated cordgrass facilitated recruitment of seagrass seedlings however at a later stage densely vegetated cordgrass inhibited the growth of seagrases seedlings apart from density dependent effects the remnant patches of seagrass dominant habitat have a strong patch size dependent effect on the establishment of seagrass seedlings in the early spring showing an optimal patch size of 8 m2 and 1 5 cm detritus thickness moreover our findings showed that the thick sediment can lead to more rotten seeds potentially decreaing the germination rate and emergence of seagrass seedlings complementing the long interest in relative importance of top down i e alteration of food webs by exploitation and bottom up forcing i e nutrient pollution a parallel line of research has focused on biological invasion as an important driver of seagrass ecosystem structure and functioning thomsen et al 2011 habitat modification of invasive species as the most frequently documented mechanism reflects the drastic changes in invaded habitats but is often highly variable in space and time leading to ecological unpredictability with either positive or negtaive consequences bruno et al 2017 our findings revealed that invasion impacts of spartina on the seagrass seedlings can change over time leading to the shift of positive and negative impacts with invasion these could be explained by the mortality or lower establishement of seagrass seedlings due to physical stress for example higher water flow and wave energy hill and roberts 2017 maestre et al 2003 this is consistent with the ecosystem engineering concept claiming that habitat modification by autogenic ecosystem engineering depends both on organism structure and on prevailing abiotic conditions also described as context dependency chen et al 2016 neira et al 2006 therefore identifying stage dependent invasion impacts with both facilitation and inhibition will be crucial to determine their relative importance of habitat modifying ability on seagrass systems over time outcomes of ecosystem engineering may be facilitative or inhibitive depending on prevailing abiotic conditions that change with time bruno et al 2017 rupprecht et al 2015 our study found that higher density of seagrass seedlings at the places with sparsely vegetated cordgrass and remanant patches of the seagrass beds compared to the seaward uninvaded areas this suggests that initial and later invasion of spartina can facilitate the establishment of seagrass seedlings but the facilitaion decrease with increasing of density of spartina a typical characteristic of invasion expansion the seaward habitats located at the wave exposed sites experiencing more frequently hydrodynamic disturbance to shock the sediment may result in damage to seedlings or influencing settlement of seagrass seeds pereda briones et al 2018 ruesink 2018 our results showed that the areas with presence of spartina density dependent trait of community level drives its ecosystem engineering ability by ameliorating the hydrodynamic stress and therefore increasing the sedimentation our study added emprical evidence to emphasize the importance of physical characteristics of community structures schwarz et al 2015 south et al 2016 vilà et al 2011 to elucidate the habitat modification of invasive ecosystem engineer over time therefore our study may provide insights to understand the underlining mechanisms that the modifications of morphologic tidal flat alongside the invasion processes resulting in the shift between facilitation and inhibition habitat degradation with diverse remnant patch sizes has been identified to have patch size dependent effects on mediating recolonization rate and recovery of disturbanced community angelini and silliman 2012 bruno and kennedy 2000 livernois et al 2017 we found that patch expansion of spartina creating depressions surrounded the patches led to patch size dependent effects on the seagrass seedlings as the invasion or and expansion induced the significant modifications of remnant patch size number and shoot density over time their influences on hydrodynamic and sedimentation have also changed substantially ruesink 2018 our results showed that habitat modifying cordgrass transformed seagrass dominant habitats into interconnected mosaic markedly alterating water flow and sedimentation revealing the heterogeneity pattern of seagrass seedlings these remnant patches of seagrass habitat without presence of spartina creating size dependent effect on the seagrass seedlings showing a optimal patch size 8 m2 with 1 5 cm detritus thickness that contributes the largest density of seagrass seedlings this is also consistent with the predictions from environment stress models that facilitation can increase the density and distribution of species in stressful environments by reducing abiotic stress bruno et al 2017 he et al 2012 therefore our empical study potentially explains the threshold in facilitation of invasion impact the mechanisms behind patch size dependent of habitat modifying feedback effects of spartina invasion on the native habitat forming seagrass germination of seeds and emergence of seedlings in general suffer greater stress at their early life stage consequently resulting in time delayed and trait based physiological responses to environmental stress bruno et al 2017 gunderson et al 2016 such as later emergence kaminsky et al 2015 tingstad et al 2015 shorter stem crosby et al 2015 and smaller canopy firstater et al 2016 rupprecht et al 2015 our results showed that spartina induced alteration of sedimentation had significant influences on seagrass seed availability to germinate rotten seeds as a proxy and seedlings establishment these results are consistent with those of other submerged species such as zostera marina myriophyllum spicatum and potamogeton malaianus for which burial depth was a significant factor affecting seed germination simpson et al 2018 stafford bell et al 2016 wang et al 2016 although study has showed that greater germination of seeds in fine sediments with high organic matter content compared to coarse sediments jarvis and moore 2015 statton et al 2017 wang et al 2016 our study added evidence that this can be determined by the depth of the sediment organic detritus in our study multiple reasons explained the rotten seeds with increasing thickness of the sediment such as the hypoxia temperature and salinity wang et al 2016 but in our study site increased temperature and higher moisture can be a combined reason together with the positive relationship between sediment thickness and number of rotten seeds the threshold of 1 5 cm sediment we observed in the seedling establishment provides support for threshold responses of seagrass to sedimentation modified by and varied with invasion of spartina understanding the ecological consequences by which non native species become established in invaded habitats is central to formulating effective management responses hastings 2016 nevertheless most studies about the effects of invasive ecosystem engineers have been brief and lack a temporal context alp et al 2016 kröel dulay et al 2015 our study indicates that the size of the invasive species population and environmental factors typically can vary over time therefore the full effects of the invader might not be seen for a considerable time after the initial invasion invasion associated processes such as shifts in the both biotic and abiotic factors can be interdependent and independent contributing to either facilitate or inhibit native species over time bouma et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 zhu et al 2016 although we have recognized time scale effects of invasion process on native foundation species we still lack of a basic understanding of how the biophysical feedback between cordgrass invasion and physically disturbances which might mitigate or exacerbate total ecosystem degradaton in the future therefore it is becoming imperative that experimental studies are needed to manipulate patch size and density of vegetated cordgrass for revealing their influences on expansion and physical modifications of surroundings as well as feedbacks

1041,in order to explore the effects of bacteria on the decomposition processes and water environmental conditions we used litter bag method and compare reed litter decomposition rates under different bacillus subtilis addition treatments neither mesh size nor bacterial treatment have significant effects on the decomposition rates in the earlier phase but in last three retrieves the decomposition rates of litter bags with bacillus subtilis addition were significantly p 0 012 higher than that without bacillus subtilis addition treatment as for bacterial influence water parameters aquatic environmental markers ammonia nitrogen nh3 n total phosphorus tp dissolved oxygen do and chemical oxygen demand cod didn t show significant difference between different bacillus subtilis addition treatments the decomposition rates were affected by litter quality and water parameters furthermore the n p and c p ratios of litter were good predictors for litter decomposition our findings suggested that the bacterial inoculation could be an excellent approach to facilitate the decomposition processes and nutrient cycles in the wetland ecosystems but it might require more than 45 days to see the positive effects keywords litter decomposition process bacteria water quality litter quality 1 introduction wetland can provide many ecosystem functions which supported by the web of interacting forces bai et al 2015 bai et al 2012 wetland plant litter decomposition is a part of this web and it can influence many wetland processes zhai et al 2019 wetland litter decomposition consisted of complex physical chemical and biological processes and it is an important aspect in biological and geochemical cycles in wetland ecosystem litter and its decomposition are a nexus that links vegetation and soil and plant litter soil constitute a microscopic ecosystem zhao et al 2015 litter has indispensable functions in maintaining ecosystem productivity carbon fixation and community succession it can improve the physiochemical characteristics and hydrological conditions of soil and improve water quality during decomposition atkinson and cairns 2001 litter decomposition is a process that is often affected by many factors webster and benfield 1986 several studies have shown that litter decomposition in an aquatic environment is affected by nutrients yin et al 2019 rejmánková and sirová 2007 electron acceptor supply li et al 2010 temperature and ph sun et al 2013 stoichiometric ratios of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in litter güsewell and gessner 2009 and metabolic activities of microbiota fonseca et al 2016 litter decomposition rates and nutrient dynamics are affected by litter mass and environmental conditions zhai et al 2019 in contrast litter mass is more correlated with decomposition rate bijayalaxmi devi and yadava 2010 chen et al 2001 decomposition is affected by internal factors gessner and chauvet 1994 such as initial oxygen content lignin

factors findlay et al 2002 and play extremely important roles in the litter decomposition processes currently several studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of the biotic factors such as microorganisms fungi bacteria and soil invertebrates on the decomposition in a wetland ecosystem zhang et al 2019 gingerich et al 2015 rejmánková and sirová 2007 bacteria and fungi produce extracellular enzymes such as celluloses that degrade lignocellulose kuehn et al 2011 thereby affecting litter decomposition rates schimel 2003 previous studies have reported that microbial communities can affect decomposition rate through total phosphorous tp and ammonia nitrogen nh3 n migration between water bodies and litter wu et al 2017 however only a few indoor well controlled simulation studies have been conducted to study the effects of bacteria addition on litter decomposition in this study we employed litter bags with two different mesh sizes and bacillus subtilis as a control treatment to examine the effects of bacteria and different mesh sizes on litter decomposition rates and water parameters the aims of this study are to investigate the effects of adding microorganisms on litter decomposition by examining 1 whether there are differences in litter decomposition rates under different litter bag mesh sizes 2 whether bacteria will affect aquatic environmental markers microbial communities play a major role in decay of litter nutrient chemicals in the aquatic environment and nitrogen n and phosphorus p content have a direct influence on the litter decomposition further the interactions between these factors can reflect the feedback mechanism of litter decomposition toward changes in environmental markers 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials in this study we selected reed litter from the yellow river delta as a study subject to ensure that the litter used in the experiments is from the same source all of the litter was collected from the same region following that the litter was brought back to the laboratory to wash off surface mud before being cut into 10 cm sections and dried to a constant weight at 65 c different mesh size litter bags litter bags were constructed by vinyl coated fiberglass window mesh have long been used to create a micro environment that was different from the external environment and study the role of invertebrate biomass on decomposition using varied mesh sizes litter bags to determine the arthropod effect of animals on litter decomposition rates that exclude animals on the basis of body size the fine mesh had a greater hydrophobic effect easier water entry for the fine than the coarse mesh bags than the coarse mesh and dunking the bags helped remove the effect and the potential bias it created in previous studies litter bag pore sizes were 1 micromesh 0 04 0 2 mm 2 mesomesh 1 3 mm 3 macromesh 4 5 mm ágoston szabó et al 2016 bokhorst and wardle 2013 wang et al 2010 zhai et al 2019 in this study we selected litter bags with fine mesh size 0 2 mm and coarse mesh size 2 8 mm specification of 15 20 cm and were each filled with 10 g of litter 2 2 experimental design in this study all the litter bags were dunked to completely wet the surface and then submerged under water and placed into plastic crate 610 420 195 mm to simulate the decomposition process a layer of 2 cm thick sandy soil was placed at the bottom as the decomposition matrix and the substrate was collected in greenhouse where the experiment conducted each plastic box was seen as a plot and the water level in each plastic box was about 16 cm during all the experiment period next we added the bacillus subtilis culture solution to every box and each treatment was in an independent box to examine the effects of microorganisms on litter decomposition the decomposition box was divided into two groups as shown in figs 1 and 2 one group is the experimental group in which bacillus subtilis was added to the litter bag while the other group is the blank control group two hundred milligrams of bacillus subtilis culture solution gingerich et al 2015 was added to every litter bag in the experimental group with triplicates the litter bags were collected on day 2 4 6 8 10 17 47 77 112 of decomposition process during each retrieve water samples were collected from every decomposition box and brought back along with the litter bags to the laboratory for treatment and analysis mud and other debris were removed from the litter in the litter bag and the litter was washed with deionized water dried at 65 c until at a constant weight and weighed to determine the decomposition rates with the procedures described below the dried litter samples were crushed using a plant pulverizer and passed through a 0 149 mm sieve the stored samples were used for quantitation of total carbon total nitrogen and total phosphorus content the total carbon content in the litter was measured using the potassium dichromate external heating method and the total nitrogen was measured using the kjeldahl method kdy 9830 ketuo digestion was used for total phosphorous measurement and total phosphorus content was measured by vanadate molybdate colorimetry uv 2450 ultraviolet spectrophotometry xiang et al 2015 water temperature ph dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand cod total phosphorous tp and ammonia nitrogen nh3 n were simultaneously monitored in each experimental box these parameters were measured according to the chinese national standard methods state environmental protection administration of china monitoring and analysis methods of water and wastewater fourth ed china zhai et al 2019 in addition ph and water temperature were monitored using a ph meter and a digital thermometer respectively all measurements were taken with three replicates 2 3 date analysis the decomposition rate constant k was obtained using olson s exponential decay model and k was calculated using w t w o e k t in the equation wt is the decomposition residue of the litter after time t d in g w0 is the starting mass of the litter in g k is the decomposition rate constant and t is the decomposition time in days the nutrient accumulation index nai is used to express the accumulation or release of elements during litter decomposition nai mt xt m0 x0 100 zhai et al 2019 in the above equation mt is the dry mass of the litter at time t xt is the element concentration in the litter at time t in g kg m0 is the initial dry mass of the litter and x0 is the initial concentration of the element in litter in g kg when nai 100 the element is released during litter decomposition and when nai 100 the element undergoes net accumulation during litter decomposition in this study all stoichiometric ratios used are molar ratios of elements sigma plot and spss 19 0 were used for organization and analysis of all measurement data means and standard deviations are used to express all statistical data one way anova was performed to test for differences in litter decomposition rates and stoichiometric ratios under different conditions whether bacillus subtilis was added or not two way anova was used to examine whether different litter bag mesh size and bacteria have significant effects on water quality litter decomposition rates and litter stoichiometric ratios 3 results 3 1 dynamic change of litter decomposition rate as shown in fig 2 decomposition rate increases as decomposition time increases only during the last retrieve decomposition rate decreased 0 00262d 1 as decomposition time increased residual content of reed litter gradually decreased after 112 days of decomposition the residual rate decreased from 100 to 52 44 the addition of bacillus subtilis did not show any significant effects on the decomposition rates p 0 326 p 0 05 however in the last three litter bags retrieve the decomposition rates of litter bags with bacillus subtilis added were p 0 012 higher than that without bacillus subtilis treatment our results also suggested that there was no significant difference in litter decomposition rates between litter bags with different mesh sizes p 0 384 p 0 05 in 2nd 4th 8th retrieve days litter decomposition rate was the fastest in fine litter bag without bacillus subtilis added in the 15th 45th 75th retrieve days the decomposition rates of litter were the fastest in fine mesh size litter bags that contained bacillus subtilis in the last 4 retrieves litter decomposition rate was the fastest in the litter bags with bacillus subtilis added whether in coarse or fine mesh size litter bag 3 2 dynamic changes of water parameters during decomposition process the fig 3 showed the dynamic changes in do cod tp and nh3 n during litter decomposition process the concentration of cod tp and nh3 n gradually decreased but do concentration showed fluctuation changes whether in coarse or fine mesh size litter bags if bacillus subtilis added do concentration all raised at first then decreased and ascend at last in the last 6 retrieves in fine litter bags without bacillus subtilis added treatments do concentration showed first decrease and then increase as for coarse litter bags without bacillus subtilis added treatments do concentration showed a cyclic pattern which increased first then decreased during all the decomposition process under coarse litter bag treatment the concentration of tp p 0 001 p 0 001 was significantly higher than that in the without b subtilis added but nh3 n do and cod didn t show significant difference between different bacteria adding treatment the concentration of nh3 n do tp and cod didn t show significant difference between the presence and absence of bacillus subtilis added under fine litter bag treatment 3 3 relationship between stoichiometric ratio c n c p and n p and litter decomposition rate during decomposition process litter c n and c p ratios are common markers of litter decomposition quality and the n p ratio is an important marker for nutrient limit during litter decomposition as shown in the fig 4 the dynamic changes in reed litter nutrients showed a fluctuating variation litter c n showed an increasing trend at the initial stage and reached its peak on day 75 during the last retrieve c n showed a decreasing trend except the treatment of coarse litter bag without bacillus subtilis added under 4 different conditions a marked degree of variation in c p during the entire study period was not observed and c p all exceed 15 n p shows a large fluctuating trend during the entire period and reached its peak on day 75 at the last retrieve n p showed a decreasing trend and lied between 15 and 30 overall litter c n first increased before decreasing while the c p and n p fluctuated 3 4 litter nutrient dynamics and release during decomposition process during the 112 day decomposition period phosphorus concentration in reed litter showed fluctuating changes which appeared as a decrease in the early stage followed by an increase at the later stage fig 5 in this period the maximum phosphorus concentration was 0 7436 g kg and decomposition rate was the highest in the last 4 retrieves in the coarse pore litter bags in which bacillus subtilis was added the range of nitrogen concentration was 3 760 15 125 g kg the changes in carbon concentrations also fluctuated during the entire study period the total carbon content in reed litter first increased with local fluctuations before decreasing at the late stage of decomposition the nai values of nitrogen were lower than 100 and therefore a net release occurred for nitrogen under the 4 treatment conditions the nais of phosphorus all showed a decreasing trend however nai increased during the last retrieve only the first retrieve had an nai greater than 100 for phosphorus and the nai values for all treatment conditions were lower than 100 in subsequent retrieves the nai of carbon was greater than 100 only in the coarse mesh size litter bags in which bacillus subtilis was added 4 discussion 4 1 effect of litter bag mesh size and bacterial addition on decomposition rate our findings suggested that neither mesh size nor bacterial treatment have significant effects on the decomposition rates in this study proportion of mass remaining in the fine mesh x 6 8 se 1 8 and coarse mesh x 6 6 se 1 7 bags was similar p 0 79 p 0 05 different mesh size litter bags have long been used to create a micro environment that was different from the external environment and study the role of invertebrate biomass on decomposition previous studies also have shown that the different litter bag mesh size did not affect litter decomposition rate gingerich et al 2015 zhai et al 2019 a possible reason for this is that minor changes in temperature or water body can result in variability in litter decomposition bokhorst and wardle 2013 and that the effects of bacteria on litter decomposition are small ágoston szabó et al 2016 gingerich et al 2015 during early phases of decomposition it has been found that fungi tend to be dominant and bacteria are important in later stages and bacteria were the primary decomposers during the decay process barik et al 2000 battle and mihuc 2000 microbes colonized the plant litter releasing nutrients and facilitating decomposition once most nutrients have been decomposed and utilized the effect of microbes diminished 4 2 effect of bacterial addition on water parameters the overall changes in dissolved oxygen first increased then decreased and again increased these changes may due to the fluctuations caused by slow oxygen consumption during microbial decomposition of substances that are resistant to degradation battle and mihuc 2000 in the last 4 retrieves except for the last one the dissolved oxygen contents in litter bags with bacteria added were low the reason for this is that bacteria simultaneously consume oxygen in the water body while decomposing litter brock 1984 the dissolved oxygen content in the last retrieve was increased possibly because this experiment was conducted from june to october the last retrieve was in late autumn and the temperature is much lower than june this result a low decomposition rate therefore oxygen consumption from the water body is reduced during decomposition and the dissolved oxygen content is increased under the 4 treatment conditions whether in different mesh size litter bag the addition of bacteria resulted in higher tp content this may be because bacteria can promote litter decomposition to release organic phosphorus and phosphate salt thereby causing tp content to be higher gamage and asaeda 2005 the trend for chemical oxygen demand showed an overall decrease this is possibly because bacillus subtilis can decompose organic matter during decomposition wang 2011 thereby causing cod content to decrease whether litter bag with different mesh size higher nh3 n content was founded in which bacillus subtilis was added this may be because the addition of bacillus subtilis promotes the decomposition of nitrogen containing organic matter causing ammonia nitrogen released from litter to the water body and resulting in a higher ammonia nitrogen content however the bacterial treatment had no significant effects on the water quality parameters in this study including nh3 n tp do and cod one possible reason is that the effect of bacillus subtilis is marginal compared to other factors affecting litter decomposition in addition our study only measured corresponding environmental factors during the retrieve of litter bags and the density of measurement time points are insufficient additionally the retrieve frequency at the start was higher and the effects of bacillus subtilis may not have appeared then therefore we were unable to represent environmental conditions during the various study periods and the effects of bacillus subtilis on water quality are not clear table 1 clearly indicates that water parameters significantly affect the decomposition process based on correlation analyses decomposition rate showed highly significant positive correlation with nh3 n do tp and cod also there was a significant correlation between water parameters nh3 n had a significant positive correlation with do cod and tp p 0 01 and it had a significant negative correlation with cod and tp p 0 01 4 3 correlation between litter nutrient dynamics and water parameters there is a significant correlation between water parameters and litter nutrient dynamics table 2 nh3 n had a significant positive correlation with n nai c nai and p nai p 0 01 and it had a significant negative correlation with n p c p and c n p 0 01 do had a significant positive correlation with cnai p 0 05 cod had a significant positive correlation with c nai p 0 01 and p nai p 0 05 in addition cod had a significant negative correlation with n p c p and c n p 0 01 tp had a significant positive correlation with c nai p nai p 0 01 and n nai p 0 05 and it had a significant negative correlation with c p and c n p 0 01 nh3 n had significant correlations with all the litter nutrient indicators tp concentration had a significant correlation with litter quality stoichiometry about element p this could reflect an important interactive mechanism between hydroperid and processes in nutrient deficient in litter and this might cause nutrient element transfer between aquatic environment and litter plant jia et al 2018 in general the difficulty during the litter decomposition process is initially determined by its chemical composition and its inner biological and physical structure after the bacillus subtilis addition the absorb effect of no3 n and tn transfer from water to plant litter might strengthened the rapid release of organic p and phosphate from the decomposition process resulted in the rapid decrease in tp concentrations in water moreover the higher tp values observed in the added fungi treatments might have been the result of uptake by decomposing bacteria and fungi zhai et al 2019 wu et al 2017 4 4 the effect of litter quality on decomposition rate generally litter decomposition is mainly affected by litter quality nitrogen content phosphorus content lignin content vitamin and hemicellulose content lignin n and c p are markers that are often used to describe litter quality wu et al 2006 wu et al 2017 decomposition rate shows a negative correlation with c n c p and n p and a significantly negative correlation with n p and c p table 3 in our experiment the initial c n of litter is low and c n did not show any significant correlation with decomposition rate during litter decomposition c n may not accurately reflect litter decomposition rate previous studies have shown that the relationship between c n and litter decomposition rate is not significant brinson et al 1981 ouyang et al 2013 however it is generally believed that a higher c n will result in slower litter decomposition elder and mattraw 1984 when c n is very high decomposition rate will decrease aerts and de caluwe 1997 in our experiment decomposition rate showed a significant negative correlation with c p during decomposition c p showed fluctuating changes this may be because phosphorus mainly exists as phosphate ions or compounds and large amounts are released during decomposition and the percentage of p and c in litter fluctuated resulting in changes of c p ratios during decomposition process litter decomposition rate showed a significant negative correlation with n p during decomposition microorganisms need to consume a large amount of adenosine triphosphate atp to generate energy therefore when phosphorus is limited during litter decomposition decomposition rate decreases lin hai et al 2012 in addition to c n and c p the n p ratio of litter can be used to characterize litter decomposition rate many studies have shown that litter decomposition can also be controlled by p related chemicals n p values are important for the short term litter decomposition decomposition was n limited at low n p supply ratios and p limited at high n p supply ratios during n p 14 litter decomposition is affected by p when n p 10 litter decomposition is affected by n aerts et al 1992 güsewell and gessner 2009 compared with nitrogen which is mainly affected by biotic factors phosphorus is mainly affected by both physical and biotic factors güsewell andgessner 2009 in our experiment the initial n p value was 16 25 therefore litter decomposition was not affected by phosphorus supply for microbial nutrient demand in this study litter decomposition rate had a significant positive correlation with p nai and n nai p 0 01 and had a negative correlation with c nai n p had no relationship with n nai n p c p and c n all had significant positive correlations with p nai n nai and c nai 5 conclusions in general litter decomposition rates were much quicker under bacillus subtilis addition treatment in the later part of decomposition phase but litter decomposition rates were similar among different litter bag mesh sizes also the decomposition rate has a positive correlation with water parameters litter quality this correlation ship between litter decomposition rate and water parameters litter quality represents large portions of decomposition dynamic that involves a complex web of interacting forces of which bacterial comprise only a small part though in later phase we found low measurable influence of bacillus subtilis addition on decomposition it is likely that the influence of it was more significant than the link between abiotic factors microbial communities invertebrates and other environmental factors and decomposition rate under various simulating treatments further studies are needed to more assess the relationship between the substantial factors and

1041,in order to explore the effects of bacteria on the decomposition processes and water environmental conditions we used litter bag method and compare reed litter decomposition rates under different bacillus subtilis addition treatments neither mesh size nor bacterial treatment have significant effects on the decomposition rates in the earlier phase but in last three retrieves the decomposition rates of litter bags with bacillus subtilis addition were significantly p 0 012 higher than that without bacillus subtilis addition treatment as for bacterial influence water parameters aquatic environmental markers ammonia nitrogen nh3 n total phosphorus tp dissolved oxygen do and chemical oxygen demand cod didn t show significant difference between different bacillus subtilis addition treatments the decomposition rates were affected by litter quality and water parameters furthermore the n p and c p ratios of litter were good predictors for litter decomposition our findings suggested that the bacterial inoculation could be an excellent approach to facilitate the decomposition processes and nutrient cycles in the wetland ecosystems but it might require more than 45 days to see the positive effects keywords litter decomposition process bacteria water quality litter quality 1 introduction wetland can provide many ecosystem functions which supported by the web of interacting forces bai et al 2015 bai et al 2012 wetland plant litter decomposition is a part of this web and it can influence many wetland processes zhai et al 2019 wetland litter decomposition consisted of complex physical chemical and biological processes and it is an important aspect in biological and geochemical cycles in wetland ecosystem litter and its decomposition are a nexus that links vegetation and soil and plant litter soil constitute a microscopic ecosystem zhao et al 2015 litter has indispensable functions in maintaining ecosystem productivity carbon fixation and community succession it can improve the physiochemical characteristics and hydrological conditions of soil and improve water quality during decomposition atkinson and cairns 2001 litter decomposition is a process that is often affected by many factors webster and benfield 1986 several studies have shown that litter decomposition in an aquatic environment is affected by nutrients yin et al 2019 rejmánková and sirová 2007 electron acceptor supply li et al 2010 temperature and ph sun et al 2013 stoichiometric ratios of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in litter güsewell and gessner 2009 and metabolic activities of microbiota fonseca et al 2016 litter decomposition rates and nutrient dynamics are affected by litter mass and environmental conditions zhai et al 2019 in contrast litter mass is more correlated with decomposition rate bijayalaxmi devi and yadava 2010 chen et al 2001 decomposition is affected by internal factors gessner and chauvet 1994 such as initial oxygen content lignin content the ratio of lignin to nitrogen l n and external factors jackson and vallaire 2007 including water temperature dissolved oxygen hydrological conductivity and ph biotic factors are dominant factors findlay et al 2002 and play extremely important roles in the litter decomposition processes currently several studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of the biotic factors such as microorganisms fungi bacteria and soil invertebrates on the decomposition in a wetland ecosystem zhang et al 2019 gingerich et al 2015 rejmánková and sirová 2007 bacteria and fungi produce extracellular enzymes such as celluloses that degrade lignocellulose kuehn et al 2011 thereby affecting litter decomposition rates schimel 2003 previous studies have reported that microbial communities can affect decomposition rate through total phosphorous tp and ammonia nitrogen nh3 n migration between water bodies and litter wu et al 2017 however only a few indoor well controlled simulation studies have been conducted to study the effects of bacteria addition on litter decomposition in this study we employed litter bags with two different mesh sizes and bacillus subtilis as a control treatment to examine the effects of bacteria and different mesh sizes on litter decomposition rates and water parameters the aims of this study are to investigate the effects of adding microorganisms on litter decomposition by examining 1 whether there are differences in litter decomposition rates under different litter bag mesh sizes 2 whether bacteria will affect aquatic environmental markers microbial communities play a major role in decay of litter nutrient chemicals in the aquatic environment and nitrogen n and phosphorus p content have a direct influence on the litter decomposition further the interactions between these factors can reflect the feedback mechanism of litter decomposition toward changes in environmental markers 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials in this study we selected reed litter from the yellow river delta as a study subject to ensure that the litter used in the experiments is from the same source all of the litter was collected from the same region following that the litter was brought back to the laboratory to wash off surface mud before being cut into 10 cm sections and dried to a constant weight at 65 c different mesh size litter bags litter bags were constructed by vinyl coated fiberglass window mesh have long been used to create a micro environment that was different from the external environment and study the role of invertebrate biomass on decomposition using varied mesh sizes litter bags to determine the arthropod effect of animals on litter decomposition rates that exclude animals on the basis of body size the fine mesh had a greater hydrophobic effect easier water entry for the fine than the coarse mesh bags than the coarse mesh and dunking the bags helped remove the effect and the potential bias it created in previous studies litter bag pore sizes were 1 micromesh 0 04 0 2 mm 2 mesomesh 1 3 mm 3 macromesh 4 5 mm ágoston szabó et al 2016 bokhorst and wardle 2013 wang et al 2010 zhai et al 2019 in this study we selected litter bags with fine mesh size 0 2 mm and coarse mesh size 2 8 mm specification of 15 20 cm and were each filled with 10 g of litter 2 2 experimental design in this study all the litter bags were dunked to completely wet the surface and then submerged under water and placed into plastic crate 610 420 195 mm to simulate the decomposition process a layer of 2 cm thick sandy soil was placed at the bottom as the decomposition matrix and the substrate was collected in greenhouse where the experiment conducted each plastic box was seen as a plot and the water level in each plastic box was about 16 cm during all the experiment period next we added the bacillus subtilis culture solution to every box and each treatment was in an independent box to examine the effects of microorganisms on litter decomposition the decomposition box was divided into two groups as shown in figs 1 and 2 one group is the experimental group in which bacillus subtilis was added to the litter bag while the other group is the blank control group two hundred milligrams of bacillus subtilis culture solution gingerich et al 2015 was added to every litter bag in the experimental group with triplicates the litter bags were collected on day 2 4 6 8 10 17 47 77 112 of decomposition process during each retrieve water samples were collected from every decomposition box and brought back along with the litter bags to the laboratory for treatment and analysis mud and other debris were removed from the litter in the litter bag and the litter was washed with deionized water dried at 65 c until at a constant weight and weighed to determine the decomposition rates with the procedures described below the dried litter samples were crushed using a plant pulverizer and passed through a 0 149 mm sieve the stored samples were used for quantitation of total carbon total nitrogen and total phosphorus content the total carbon content in the litter was measured using the potassium dichromate external heating method and the total nitrogen was measured using the kjeldahl method kdy 9830 ketuo digestion was used for total phosphorous measurement and total phosphorus content was measured by vanadate molybdate colorimetry uv 2450 ultraviolet spectrophotometry xiang et al 2015 water temperature ph dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand cod total phosphorous tp and ammonia nitrogen nh3 n were simultaneously monitored in each experimental box these parameters were measured according to the chinese national standard methods state environmental protection administration of china monitoring and analysis methods of water and wastewater fourth ed china zhai et al 2019 in addition ph and water temperature were monitored using a ph meter and a digital thermometer respectively all measurements were taken with three replicates 2 3 date analysis the decomposition rate constant k was obtained using olson s exponential decay model and k was calculated using w t w o e k t in the equation wt is the decomposition residue of the litter after time t d in g w0 is the starting mass of the litter in g k is the decomposition rate constant and t is the decomposition time in days the nutrient accumulation index nai is used to express the accumulation or release of elements during litter decomposition nai mt xt m0 x0 100 zhai et al 2019 in the above equation mt is the dry mass of the litter at time t xt is the element concentration in the litter at time t in g kg m0 is the initial dry mass of the litter and x0 is the initial concentration of the element in litter in g kg when nai 100 the element is released during litter decomposition and when nai 100 the element undergoes net accumulation during litter decomposition in this study all stoichiometric ratios used are molar ratios of elements sigma plot and spss 19 0 were used for organization and analysis of all measurement data means and standard deviations are used to express all statistical data one way anova was performed to test for differences in litter decomposition rates and stoichiometric ratios under different conditions whether bacillus subtilis was added or not two way anova was used to examine whether different litter bag mesh size and bacteria have significant effects on water quality litter decomposition rates and litter stoichiometric ratios 3 results 3 1 dynamic change of litter decomposition rate as shown in fig 2 decomposition rate increases as decomposition time increases only during the last retrieve decomposition rate decreased 0 00262d 1 as decomposition time increased residual content of reed litter gradually decreased after 112 days of decomposition the residual rate decreased from 100 to 52 44 the addition of bacillus subtilis did not show any significant effects on the decomposition rates p 0 326 p 0 05 however in the last three litter bags retrieve the decomposition rates of litter bags with bacillus subtilis added were p 0 012 higher than that without bacillus subtilis treatment our results also suggested that there was no significant difference in litter decomposition rates between litter bags with different mesh sizes p 0 384 p 0 05 in 2nd 4th 8th retrieve days litter decomposition rate was the fastest in fine litter bag without bacillus subtilis added in the 15th 45th 75th retrieve days the decomposition rates of litter were the fastest in fine mesh size litter bags that contained bacillus subtilis in the last 4 retrieves litter decomposition rate was the fastest in the litter bags with bacillus subtilis added whether in coarse or fine mesh size litter bag 3 2 dynamic changes of water parameters during decomposition process the fig 3 showed the dynamic changes in do cod tp and nh3 n during litter decomposition process the concentration of cod tp and nh3 n gradually decreased but do concentration showed fluctuation changes whether in coarse or fine mesh size litter bags if bacillus subtilis added do concentration all raised at first then decreased and ascend at last in the last 6 retrieves in fine litter bags without bacillus subtilis added treatments do concentration showed first decrease and then increase as for coarse litter bags without bacillus subtilis added treatments do concentration showed a cyclic pattern which increased first then decreased during all the decomposition process under coarse litter bag treatment the concentration of tp p 0 001 p 0 001 was significantly higher than that in the without b subtilis added but nh3 n do and cod didn t show significant difference between different bacteria adding treatment the concentration of nh3 n do tp and cod didn t show significant difference between the presence and absence of bacillus subtilis added under fine litter bag treatment 3 3 relationship between stoichiometric ratio c n c p and n p and litter decomposition rate during decomposition process litter c n and c p ratios are common markers of litter decomposition quality and the n p ratio is an important marker for nutrient limit during litter decomposition as shown in the fig 4 the dynamic changes in reed litter nutrients showed a fluctuating variation litter c n showed an increasing trend at the initial stage and reached its peak on day 75 during the last retrieve c n showed a decreasing trend except the treatment of coarse litter bag without bacillus subtilis added under 4 different conditions a marked degree of variation in c p during the entire study period was not observed and c p all exceed 15 n p shows a large fluctuating trend during the entire period and reached its peak on day 75 at the last retrieve n p showed a decreasing trend and lied between 15 and 30 overall litter c n first increased before decreasing while the c p and n p fluctuated 3 4 litter nutrient dynamics and release during decomposition process during the 112 day decomposition period phosphorus concentration in reed litter showed fluctuating changes which appeared as a decrease in the early stage followed by an increase at the later stage fig 5 in this period the maximum phosphorus concentration was 0 7436 g kg and decomposition rate was the highest in the last 4 retrieves in the coarse pore litter bags in which bacillus subtilis was added the range of nitrogen concentration was 3 760 15 125 g kg the changes in carbon concentrations also fluctuated during the entire study period the total carbon content in reed litter first increased with local fluctuations before decreasing at the late stage of decomposition the nai values of nitrogen were lower than 100 and therefore a net release occurred for nitrogen under the 4 treatment conditions the nais of phosphorus all showed a decreasing trend however nai increased during the last retrieve only the first retrieve had an nai greater than 100 for phosphorus and the nai values for all treatment conditions were lower than 100 in subsequent retrieves the nai of carbon was greater than 100 only in the coarse mesh size litter bags in which bacillus subtilis was added 4 discussion 4 1 effect of litter bag mesh size and bacterial addition on decomposition rate our findings suggested that neither mesh size nor bacterial treatment have significant effects on the decomposition rates in this study proportion of mass remaining in the fine mesh x 6 8 se 1 8 and coarse mesh x 6 6 se 1 7 bags was similar p 0 79 p 0 05 different mesh size litter bags have long been used to create a micro environment that was different from the external environment and study the role of invertebrate biomass on decomposition previous studies also have shown that the different litter bag mesh size did not affect litter decomposition rate gingerich et al 2015 zhai et al 2019 a possible reason for this is that minor changes in temperature or water body can result in variability in litter decomposition bokhorst and wardle 2013 and that the effects of bacteria on litter decomposition are small ágoston szabó et al 2016 gingerich et al 2015 during early phases of decomposition it has been found that fungi tend to be dominant and bacteria are important in later stages and bacteria were the primary decomposers during the decay process barik et al 2000 battle and mihuc 2000 microbes colonized the plant litter releasing nutrients and facilitating decomposition once most nutrients have been decomposed and utilized the effect of microbes diminished 4 2 effect of bacterial addition on water parameters the overall changes in dissolved oxygen first increased then decreased and again increased these changes may due to the fluctuations caused by slow oxygen consumption during microbial decomposition of substances that are resistant to degradation battle and mihuc 2000 in the last 4 retrieves except for the last one the dissolved oxygen contents in litter bags with bacteria added were low the reason for this is that bacteria simultaneously consume oxygen in the water body while decomposing litter brock 1984 the dissolved oxygen content in the last retrieve was increased possibly because this experiment was conducted from june to october the last retrieve was in late autumn and the temperature is much lower than june this result a low decomposition rate therefore oxygen consumption from the water body is reduced during decomposition and the dissolved oxygen content is increased under the 4 treatment conditions whether in different mesh size litter bag the addition of bacteria resulted in higher tp content this may be because bacteria can promote litter decomposition to release organic phosphorus and phosphate salt thereby causing tp content to be higher gamage and asaeda 2005 the trend for chemical oxygen demand showed an overall decrease this is possibly because bacillus subtilis can decompose organic matter during decomposition wang 2011 thereby causing cod content to decrease whether litter bag with different mesh size higher nh3 n content was founded in which bacillus subtilis was added this may be because the addition of bacillus subtilis promotes the decomposition of nitrogen containing organic matter causing ammonia nitrogen released from litter to the water body and resulting in a higher ammonia nitrogen content however the bacterial treatment had no significant effects on the water quality parameters in this study including nh3 n tp do and cod one possible reason is that the effect of bacillus subtilis is marginal compared to other factors affecting litter decomposition in addition our study only measured corresponding environmental factors during the retrieve of litter bags and the density of measurement time points are insufficient additionally the retrieve frequency at the start was higher and the effects of bacillus subtilis may not have appeared then therefore we were unable to represent environmental conditions during the various study periods and the effects of bacillus subtilis on water quality are not clear table 1 clearly indicates that water parameters significantly affect the decomposition process based on correlation analyses decomposition rate showed highly significant positive correlation with nh3 n do tp and cod also there was a significant correlation between water parameters nh3 n had a significant positive correlation with do cod and tp p 0 01 and it had a significant negative correlation with cod and tp p 0 01 4 3 correlation between litter nutrient dynamics and water parameters there is a significant correlation between water parameters and litter nutrient dynamics table 2 nh3 n had a significant positive correlation with n nai c nai and p nai p 0 01 and it had a significant negative correlation with n p c p and c n p 0 01 do had a significant positive correlation with cnai p 0 05 cod had a significant positive correlation with c nai p 0 01 and p nai p 0 05 in addition cod had a significant negative correlation with n p c p and c n p 0 01 tp had a significant positive correlation with c nai p nai p 0 01 and n nai p 0 05 and it had a significant negative correlation with c p and c n p 0 01 nh3 n had significant correlations with all the litter nutrient indicators tp concentration had a significant correlation with litter quality stoichiometry about element p this could reflect an important interactive mechanism between hydroperid and processes in nutrient deficient in litter and this might cause nutrient element transfer between aquatic environment and litter plant jia et al 2018 in general the difficulty during the litter decomposition process is initially determined by its chemical composition and its inner biological and physical structure after the bacillus subtilis addition the absorb effect of no3 n and tn transfer from water to plant litter might strengthened the rapid release of organic p and phosphate from the decomposition process resulted in the rapid decrease in tp concentrations in water moreover the higher tp values observed in the added fungi treatments might have been the result of uptake by decomposing bacteria and fungi zhai et al 2019 wu et al 2017 4 4 the effect of litter quality on decomposition rate generally litter decomposition is mainly affected by litter quality nitrogen content phosphorus content lignin content vitamin and hemicellulose content lignin n and c p are markers that are often used to describe litter quality wu et al 2006 wu et al 2017 decomposition rate shows a negative correlation with c n c p and n p and a significantly

1997 in our experiment decomposition rate showed a significant negative correlation with c p during decomposition c p showed fluctuating changes this may be because phosphorus mainly exists as phosphate ions or compounds and large amounts are released during decomposition and the percentage of p and c in litter fluctuated resulting in changes of c p ratios during decomposition process litter decomposition rate showed a significant negative correlation with n p during decomposition microorganisms need to consume a large amount of adenosine triphosphate atp to generate energy

decomposition rate many studies have shown that litter decomposition can also be controlled by p related chemicals n p values are important for the short term litter decomposition decomposition was n limited at low n p supply ratios and p limited at high n p supply ratios during n p 14 litter decomposition is affected by p when n p 10 litter decomposition is affected by n aerts et al 1992 güsewell and gessner 2009 compared with nitrogen which is mainly affected by biotic factors phosphorus is mainly affected by both physical and biotic factors güsewell andgessner 2009 in our experiment the initial n p value was 16 25 therefore litter decomposition was not affected by phosphorus supply for microbial nutrient demand in this study litter decomposition rate had a significant positive correlation with p nai and n nai p 0 01 and had a negative correlation with c nai n p had no relationship with n nai n p c p and c n all had significant positive correlations with p nai n nai and c

1042,the climate change and urbanization have interacted synergistically to impact the water environment problem of urban lakes in the late twentieth century in this paper an integrated model describing hydrology hydrodynamics and water quality was developed based on swmm and the dem based hydrodynamic and water quality model the tangxun lake was used as a testbed here and the impacts of rainfall intensity and urbanization on lake water quality was discussed through the scenario analysis the results showed that the runoff volume and the pollution load of tn and tp into the tangxun lake increased significantly with the increase of the rainstorm intensity in the prophase rainfall the tp and tn concentration gradually increased the greater the rainstorm intensity was the worse the lake water quality would become while in the late rainfall the lake s water quality improved slightly after the rainstorm the water fluidity in the lake was obviously improved spatially the water flow presented a directional flow from the runoff inlets to the lake outlet and the contaminants gradually diffused from the boundary area to the center of the lake on the other hand with the rapid development of urbanization the runoff depth runoff coefficient and pollutant loads had obviously increased thus the average tn and tp concentration in the lake also increased compared with the early urbanization stage the total pollution loads of tn and tp increased by 53 49t and 8 88t respectively after the 24 hour rainstorm in the late urbanization stage keywords rainfall intensity urbanization water environment non point source pollution model hydrodynamics and water quality model tangxun lake 1 introduction urban lakes have increasingly suffered from a series of environmental problems due to the impact of climate change and urbanization in recent decades wu et al 2014 climate change has been a crucial and practical issue and its negative impacts on the lake s water environment are inevitable larsen et al 2011 mitsch et al 2012 the variations of climatic conditions especially the rainfall process will result in a significant change of lakes hydrodynamic and water environment in addition the urban evolution may have potentially devastating impacts in combination with climate change china is being in the accelerating period of urbanization zhao et al 2016 and will keep up a steady increase in the coming years gu et al 2019 zong et al 2019 the continuous expansion of urban land and the dramatic increase of urban population will lead to a series of social environmental and ecological problems for example the sharp increase in impervious area has changed the urban runoff process and the non point source pollution loads li et al 2017 furthermore with the acceleration of urbanization and industrialization process the volume of industrial wastewater and domestic sewage has increased in an alarming rate posing a serious threat to the lake water environment therefore rainfall intensity and urbanization may be the important reasons for the deterioration of water quality in urban lakes yang et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 but the mechanism of their effects on lake water environment is still unclear eugenio et al 2014 lv et al 2017 the mechanism of rainfall intensity and urbanization affecting the lake water environment is extremely complex and is a multi stage and continuous process zhang et al 2017 in rapidly urbanizing areas increasing impervious surface will accelerate the formation of runoff and the surface runoff scouring will further causes pollutants to enter the lake and causing pollution in urban lakes hallegatte et al 2013 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 in addition variations in the frequency and intensity of rainfall will change the runoff generation in lake basin and then affect the migration and transformation process of non point source pollution resulting in changes in runoff and pollution load into the lake zhang et al 2017 at present some scholars have been carrying out large scale research on the impacts of rainfall and urbanization on the lake water environment and have achieved some results dong 2018 seilheimer et al 2007 zheng et al 2008 chen et al 2016 examined the effects of land use and land cover on water quality using pearson correlation analysis redundancy analysis and multiple regressions and the results showed that impervious surfaces were negatively correlated with water quality pan et al 2014 found that the water environment in the western chaohu lake was deteriorating in the early stage of urbanization while the water environment was promoted with the improvement of urbanization level wang et al 2013 used environmental kuznets curve to fit the relationship between urbanization level and lake water quality indicating that the two mutually restrict and promote each other most of these studies used mathematical statistics to analyze the impact of urbanization on lake water environment the combined impact of rainfall intensity and urbanization on the spatial and temporal distribution of lake water environment still needs further study with the rapid development of numerical simulation technology many scholars have applied it to the simulation of watershed runoff and lake water environment because of its strong physical mechanism this method has become an important and efficient means to study lake water environment cao et al 2015 at present the main urban non point source pollution models include storm water management model swmm storm hspf mouse and dr3m qual etc cui et al 2010 among them the swmm is a dynamic rainfall runoff simulation model used for single event or long term continuous simulation of runoff quantity and quality due to its high computational efficiency and flexible mechanism the model has been widely used for estimating surface runoff and its pollution load in urban areas leite et al 2013 tsihrintzis et al 1998 zeng et al 2017 great progress has been made in the numerical model of lake hydrodynamic and water quality and the widely used models include efdc mike21 ce qual w2 and wasp these model softwares have high simulation accuracy but most of them require a large amount of measured data and the pre processing work is relatively complicated in this paper we selected a dem based two dimensional 2 d hydrodynamic and water quality model to describe the dynamic variation of lake flow field and water quality concentration which used the dem data as computational grid so the preprocessing process can be omitted and then considering the migration and transformation of non point source pollution a combined model of non point source pollution and lake hydrodynamic water quality was established the tangxun lake was used as a testbed here and the response of lake water quality to the rainstorm intensity and urbanization degree was revealed through scenario analysis the results may have important reference value and scientific significance for the water environment management of urban lakes under changing environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the tangxun lake with a surface area of 52 19 km2 and a watershed area of 240 38 km2 is the largest urban lake in china it is a typical subtropics shallow lake with an average water depth of 1 85m it is located between 30 22 30 28 n and 114 18 114 26 e it spans three administrative districts of jiangxia hongshan and donghu high tech development zone in wuhan hubei province the tangxun lake basin consists of 11 lakes including the tangxun lake the

64 9 occurring between april and august in recent years the tangxun lake area has developed rapidly with the development of industry and real estate industry however the large expansion of construction land has greatly changed the structure and function of the lakes ecosystem making the lake s ecological environment unbearable urban development has brought more and more water environmental problems yang et al 2018 yang et al 2019 before 2001 the overall water quality of the tangxun lake was good and could meet or superior grade iii according to the national surface water quality standards of china gb3838 2002 after 2001 the water quality gradually deteriorated to grade iv and was in the mild eutrophication stage after 2014 the water quality further deteriorated to grade v and was in the moderate eutrophication state at present the water quality of the south lake the ye lake and the yezhi lake is worse than grade v which cannot meet the water quality management

including impermeable surface without depression impermeable surface with depression and permeable surface rossman 2009 for the impermeable surface without depression the runoff was obtained after evaporation was deducted from rainfall for the impermeable surface with depression runoff was equal to rainfall minus evaporation and depression for the permeable surface the runoff was obtained after deducting the amount of depression storage evaporation and infiltration the infiltration loss was calculated by horton model hydrological computations in the surface runoff process were based on the theory of non linear reservoirs the flow motion of the pipeline was based on the one dimensional saint venant equations the production and discharge of pollutants were divided into three processes including build up process wash off process and transport process in this paper the exponential function was used as the surface pollutant build up and wash off algorithms of the swmm model the pollutant transport process in the pipeline was simulated by using the fully mixed first order attenuation model 2 4 the 2 d hydrodynamic and water quality model for shallow lakes it is generally assumed that the distribution along the water depth is uniform this paper used the dem based 2 d hydrodynamic and water quality model liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 to describe the dynamic process of lake flow field and water quality concentration the dem rectangular grid was used as the model calculation grid which can be seamlessly coupled with the gis system omitting the pre processing work such as mesh division compared with the traditional body fitted grid and unstructured grid the standardization and modularization of the model was greatly improved zhang et al 2008 1

of tn and tp and s 0 is the external source the model used the finite volume method fvm to discretize the hydrodynamic equation and the water quality equation the alternating direction implicit method adi and the tri diagonal matrix algorithm method tdma were used to solve the equations 2 5 coupled model in this paper the combined model method was adopted to couple the non point source pollution model and the hydrodynamic water quality model so as to build a comprehensive hydrological hydrodynamic water quality mathematical model firstly the simulation of the non point source pollution in the basin was carried out under the driving of meteorological data such as rainfall and evaporation runoff was generated on the surface of the basin then flowed into the rainwater outfalls through the drainage system and eventually into the lake the distribution of rainwater outfalls were shown in fig 1 the outlet discharges and pollutant concentration of the basin can be simulated based on the non point source pollution model then the outlet sections of the basin was corresponding to the boundary grids of the lake using the simulation results of outlet flow and pollutant concentration as the inflow boundary conditions the spatial and temporal distribution of lake water dynamics and water quality can be simulated based on 2 d hydrodynamic and water quality model 3 model setup and validation 3 1 model setup 3 1 1 non point source pollution model considering the characteristics of water catchment and operation rules the catchment scales of the study area can be obtained based on hydrologic analysis the tangxun lake basin was divided into 28 sub catchments with different areas and 24 basin outlets as shown in fig 1 each sub catchment area was a distributed computing unit the runoff of each sub catchment area flowed into the corresponding channel or directly into the lake according to the direction of flow the water flow in the harbour channel was simulated as one dimensional open channel flow in order to reflect the accumulation and scouring process of surface pollutants in different land use types each sub catchment area was divided into five different land use types including agricultural land construction land woodland green land water area and bare land tn and tp were selected as the main pollution factors according to the situation of water quality exceeding the standard in the lake 3 1 2 the 2 d hydrodynamic and water quality model according to the underwater terrain monitoring data of tangxun lake group the dem grid data can be obtained using the kriging interpolation method the meshing generation and initial conditions of the model were described in the previous study yang et al 2018 the boundary conditions included the inputs of the point source and non point source and the outflow boundary the inflow boundary was determined by flow discharge the discharge and concentration of point source pollution depended on the measured data during the simulation period and the discharge and pollutant concentration of non point source pollution were simulated according to the non point source pollution model constructed in section 3 1 1 the simulation results of rainwater outfalls were taken as the input boundary conditions of the 2 d hydrodynamic and water quality model the outflow boundary was determined by water level there was one outlet in tangxun lake and south lake respectively and the water level of outlets was determined according to the measured water level data 3 2 model calibration and verification 3 2 1 swmm calibration and verification the swmm parameters included hydro hydraulic parameters and water quality parameters the hydro hydraulic parameters were firstly calibrated and optimized and then the water quality parameters were adjusted the model was calibrated using measured runoff and outlet water quality concentration from june 16 to july 21 2016 and july 9 to july 10 2017 the model was verified using total runoff and pollution load in 2014 and the accuracy of model simulation was evaluated using relative error coefficient re and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse it was assumed that the rainfall was evenly distributed in each catchment area the rainfall data from june 16 to july 21 2016 of jiangxia station were input into the swmm and the total runoff volume of tangxun lake and south lake was simulated to be 137 6 106m3 and 22 7 106m3 respectively the re of tangxun lake and south lake were 11 9 and 2 5 respectively and the nse were 0 64 and 0 83 respectively the simulated runoff line fitted well with the measured runoff line and the simulated and measured peak value and the occurrence time were in good agreement fig 2 the average re of tn and tp from july 9 to july 10 2017 was 8 1 and 26 1 respectively fig 3 the results of the model hydro hydraulic parameters and water quality parameters were shown in tables 1 and 2 respectively to further verify the reliability of the model the daily rainfall and evaporation data of the jiangxia station in 2014 were used as the input data of the model the measured annual rainfall was 1208 6mm in 2014 and the annual runoff depth of the tangxun lake basin simulated based on swmm was 457 0mm according to the wuhan water resources bulletin the runoff depth in the study area in 2014 was 400 500mm which was consistent with the simulation results the simulated tn and tp loadings of non point source pollution were 486 74t and 36 35t respectively which were close to the 490t and 31 15t obtained in previous research li et al 2016 and the re were 0 7 and 0 2 respectively 3 2 2 the coupled model calibration and verification the hydrodynamic parameters of the model were calibrated using the lake water level data in 2014 and water quality parameters were calibrated by using the measured water quality data of 9 sampling sites fig 1 in february 2014 the results of the calibration parameters in hydrodynamic and water quality model was shown in table 3 the average re of water level tn and tp concentration were 0 2 10 3 and 12 4 respectively and the nse of water level was 0 92 the model was verified by using the measured data of 9 sampling sites in june 2014 in the validation period the simulated concentration of tn and tp reproduced the observed discharge well with the average re of 10 9 and 13 4 respectively fig 4 as a whole these results showed that the coupled model could well simulate the distribution and variation of tn and tp concentration in the lakes 4 results and discussion 4 1 impacts of rainfall intensity on lake water environment 4 1 1 runoff and inflow pollution loads in different rainfall scenarios this paper selected the 24 hour design rainfall with return periods of 1 5 10 and 20 years to analyze the impacts of rainfall intensity on lake water environment and the rainfall process line was shown in fig 5 the runoff and inflow pollution loads under different scenarios were simulated based on swmm table 4 the results indicated that the runoff depth increased obviously with the increase of rainfall intensity the increasing rate of runoff under the rainfall return period of 5 10 and 20 years was 81 2 30 6 and 25 2 respectively indicating that with the increase of return period the improvement rate gradually decreased gradually in addition it can be concluded that the greater the rainfall intensity the larger the inflow pollution loads of tn and tp 4 1 2 response of lake water quality to rainfall intensity the variation of tn and tp concentration in tangxun lake under different rainfall intensity scenarios was simulated based on the coupled model fig 6 the average water quality concentration was obtained by averaging the simulated water quality values of all grid points in the lake it can be seen that within the first 16 hours of rainfall the average tn and tp concentrations in the lake increased slowly and the larger the return period the faster the average concentration increased the average concentration of the lake increased significantly during 16 to 17 hours after 17 hours it decreased slightly under the return period of 20 years p 20 while it remained stable under other return periods under the return period of 1 5 10 and 20 years the average tn concentrations of the tangxun lake were 2 92 mg l 3 10 mg l 3 20 mg l and 3 23 mg l respectively and the average tp concentrations were 0 237 mg l 0 240 mg l 0 244 mg l and 0 251 mg l respectively it indicated that the greater the rainfall intensity the greater the water quality concentration in tangxun lake taking the 24 hour design rainstorm with a return period of 20 years as an example the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of lake s hydrodynamics and water quality were analyzed from the distribution of the lake flow field before and after the rainstorm fig 7 it can be seen that the water flowed slowly before the rainstorm and the velocity of most regions was lower than 0 01m s after the rainstorm the fluidity of the lake water was significantly improved and the flow velocity was greatly increased specifically the inlet outlet and the junction of the east and east lakes had relatively high velocities and the maximum velocity reached 0 58 m s under the influence of rainfall inflow and lake outflow the water flow presented a directional flow from the runoff inlets to the lake outlet the time variations of the spatial distribution of tn and tp in tangxun lake was shown in figs 8 and 9 as can be seen by the figures the pollutants in the basin continued to enter the lake with the continuation of the rainfall duration and the influence range of the lake water environment gradually increased within the first 12 hours of rainfall the concentration of water quality around the inlets increased significantly and the lake branch area was seriously polluted but the water quality in the centre of the lake had little influence after 16 hours of rainfall the polluted area continued to spread into the centre of the lake at this time the rainfall intensity and the concentration of tn and tp in the lake reached the maximum values the water quality in the lake branch area was worse than grade v after 20 hours of rainfall the range of polluted area increased further the water quality in the branch area had improved due to the decrease of inflow runoff concentration after 24 hours of rainfall the concentration of tn and tp in the lake tended to be stable since the inflow into the lake was small 4 2 impacts of urbanization on lake water environment 4 2 1 runoff and inflow pollution loads in different urbanization stages the urbanization development of the tangxun lake area can be divided into three stages the early urbanization stage before 1990 the rapid development stage 1990 2010 and the late urbanization stage after 2010 the rapid development of urbanization has caused significant changes in the characteristics of the underlying surface hou et al 2013 in order to study the response of lake water quality in different stages of urbanization the land use type in 1990 2008 and 2018 representing the early urbanization stage stage i the rapid development stage stage ii and the late urbanization stage stage iii was extracted through the supervised classification method using landsat data table 5 the runoff depth runoff coefficient and inflow pollution loads of tangxun lake basin in three urbanization stages were simulated based on swmm as shown in table 6 in the simulation to avoid the influence of rainfall intensity the input rainfall data in three stages were all 24 hour rainstorm with a return period of 5 years and the rainfall process was shown in fig 5 as was demonstrated in table 6 with the rapid development of urbanization the runoff depth runoff coefficient and pollutant loads had obviously increased compared with stage i the total pollution loads of tn and tp increased by 53 49t and 8 88t respectively after the rainstorm in stage iii the main reason was that the impervious area increased significantly in the late urbanization stage stage iii resulting in a decrease in infiltration volume and an increase in runoff into the lake as a result the wash off effect of runoff enhanced and the total pollution load of the basin increased therefore the development of urbanization not only increased the risk of urban flooding but also aggravated the lakes pollution problems similar results have been found in other studies zhao et al 2016 in the early urbanization stage stage i the tn and tp concentration at the watershed outlets increased slowly during 0 16 hours and then decreased sharply in 17 24 hours fig 10 since the peak rainfall occurred very late and rainfall intensity was small at the beginning of the rainfall there was no obvious first flush effects which was consistent with previous views that the first flush effect of runoff pollution was only observed in the events with the large rainfall intensity early peak rainfall and low initial pollutant concentrations xu et al 2017 in the rapid development stage stage ii and the late urbanization stage stage iii the tn and tp concentration increased rapidly with the continuation of the rainfall duration and reached the first peak in the 8th hour during 9 16 hours the concentration first decreased and then increased to the maximum value after 16 hours the concentration gradually decreased the results indicated that the tn and tp concentration in stage iii changed more intensely than that in stage i and stage ii in the prophase rainfall the tn and tp concentration at the watershed outlets in stage iii was higher than that in stage i and stage ii while in the late rainfall the tn and tp concentration in stage ii exceeded that in stage iii 4 2 2 response of lake water quality to urbanization development in the prophase rainfall the average tn and tp concentration of tangxun lake in stage i ii and iii all increased with the continuation of the rainfall duration and reached the maximum value in the 21th 20th and 18th hour respectively then remained stable fig 11 on the whole with the development of the urbanization the average tn and tp concentration had increased obviously except the tp concentration in stage ii was greater than that in stage iii after 24 hours of rainfall the average tn concentration of the lake increased by 0 61 mg l 0 90 mg l and 0 91 mg l respectively and the average tp concentration of the lake increased by 0 10 mg l 0 15 mg l 0 13 mg l respectively the water quality of the lake deteriorated from grade v to worse than grade v after rainfall the reason for this phenomenon may be the huge phosphorus pollution caused by the large scale use of agricultural fertilizers in the rapid urbanization stage sun et al 2017 5 conclusions and outlooks in this paper a combined model based on swmm and the dem based hydrodynamic water quality was developed to describe the dynamic variation of lake flow field and water quality concentration the combined model took into account the migration and transformation process of non point source pollution which can directly describe the way of non point source pollution entering the lake previous studies have shown that the non point source pollution has become the primary source of water pollution in urban lakes arhonditsis et al 2000 wu et al 2013 yi et al 2017 therefore the treatment of boundary conditions of non point source pollution will affect the simulation accuracy of lake hydrodynamic and water quality the climate change and urbanization have interacted synergistically to impact the water environment problem of urban lakes in the late twentieth century steffen 2001 zhou et al 2015 in this paper we performed the simulations of the non point source pollution and the lakes water quality under four different rainstorm intensity scenarios and three urbanization scenarios and then discussed the impacts of rainfall intensity and urbanization on water quality of urban lakes the simulation results showed that with the increase of the rainstorm intensity the runoff volume and the pollution load of tn and tp into the tangxun lake increased significantly but the improvement rate gradually decreased after the rainstorm the water fluidity in the lake was obviously improved in the prophase rainfall the tp and tn concentration gradually increased the greater the rainstorm intensity was the worse the water quality would become while in the late rainfall the lake s water quality improved slightly therefore rational utilization of rainfall flood resources can effectively improve the hydrodynamic and the water quality of lakes with the development of the urbanization the volume of generated municipal solid waste has increased leading to the deterioration of lake water environment on the other hand the runoff was increasing with development of urbanization because of the expansion of impermeable surface area resulting in the increased risk of urban flood disaster due to the complicated influence mechanism of lake water environment there are still some shortcomings in this paper the model developed in this paper was loose coupled and the runoff and water quality outputs of the swmm were used as the input conditions of the lake model in the simulation process the simulation error of the non point source pollution would accumulate to the simulation of the lake s hydrodynamics and water quality therefore the input parameters of both the swmm and the lake water quality model need to be adjusted repeatedly in future researches a tight coupling model can be adopted to reduce the cumulative error of the model in addition the study in this paper only considers the change of rainfall intensity as a single climatic factor in the future changes of other climatic factors such as temperature illumination and so on can be considered to

1042,the climate change and urbanization have interacted synergistically to impact the water environment problem of urban lakes in the late twentieth century in this paper an integrated model describing hydrology hydrodynamics and water quality was developed based on swmm and the dem based hydrodynamic and water quality model the tangxun lake was used as a testbed here and the impacts of rainfall intensity and urbanization on lake water quality was discussed through the scenario analysis the results showed that the runoff volume and the pollution load of tn and tp into the tangxun lake increased significantly with the increase of the rainstorm intensity in the prophase rainfall the tp and tn concentration gradually increased the greater the rainstorm intensity was the worse the lake water quality would become while in the late rainfall the lake s water quality improved slightly after the rainstorm the water fluidity in the lake was obviously improved spatially the water flow presented a directional flow from the runoff inlets to the lake outlet and the contaminants gradually diffused from the boundary area to the center of the lake on the other hand with the rapid development of urbanization the runoff depth runoff coefficient and pollutant loads had obviously increased thus the average tn and tp concentration in the lake also increased compared with the early urbanization stage the total pollution loads of tn and tp increased by 53 49t and 8 88t respectively after the 24 hour rainstorm in the late urbanization stage keywords rainfall intensity urbanization water environment non point source pollution model hydrodynamics and water quality model tangxun lake 1 introduction urban lakes have increasingly suffered from a series of environmental problems due to the impact of climate change and urbanization in recent decades wu et al 2014 climate change has been a crucial and practical issue and its negative impacts on the lake s water environment are inevitable larsen et al 2011 mitsch et al 2012 the variations of climatic conditions especially the rainfall process will result in a significant change of lakes hydrodynamic and water environment in addition the urban evolution may have potentially devastating impacts in combination with climate change china is being in the accelerating period of urbanization zhao et al 2016 and will keep up a steady increase in the coming years gu et al 2019 zong et al 2019 the continuous expansion of urban land and the dramatic increase of urban population will lead to a series of social environmental and ecological problems for example the sharp increase in impervious area has changed the urban runoff process and the non point source pollution loads li et al 2017 furthermore with the acceleration of urbanization and industrialization process the volume of industrial wastewater and domestic sewage has increased in an alarming rate posing a serious threat to the lake water environment therefore rainfall intensity and urbanization may be the important reasons for the deterioration of water quality in urban lakes yang et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 but the mechanism of their effects on lake water environment is still unclear eugenio et al 2014 lv et al 2017 the mechanism of rainfall intensity and urbanization affecting the lake water environment is extremely complex and is a multi stage and continuous process zhang et al 2017 in rapidly urbanizing areas increasing impervious surface will accelerate the formation of runoff and the surface runoff scouring will further causes pollutants to enter the lake and causing pollution in urban lakes hallegatte et al 2013 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 in addition variations in the frequency and intensity of rainfall will change the runoff generation in lake basin and then affect the migration and transformation process of non point source pollution resulting in changes in runoff and pollution load into the lake zhang et al 2017 at present some scholars have been carrying out large scale research on the impacts of rainfall and urbanization on the lake water environment and have achieved some results dong 2018 seilheimer et al 2007 zheng et al 2008 chen et al 2016 examined the effects of land use and land cover on water quality using pearson correlation analysis redundancy analysis and multiple regressions and the results showed that impervious surfaces were negatively correlated with water quality pan et al 2014 found that the water environment in the western chaohu lake was deteriorating in the early stage of urbanization while the water environment was promoted with the improvement of urbanization level wang et al 2013 used environmental kuznets curve to fit the relationship between urbanization level and lake water quality indicating that the two mutually restrict and promote each other most of these studies used mathematical statistics to analyze the impact of urbanization on lake water environment the combined impact of rainfall intensity and urbanization on the spatial and temporal distribution of lake water environment still needs further study with the rapid development of numerical simulation technology many scholars have applied it to the simulation of watershed runoff and lake water environment because of its strong physical mechanism this method has become an important and efficient means to study lake water environment cao et al 2015 at present the main urban non point source pollution models include storm water management model swmm storm hspf mouse and dr3m qual etc cui et al 2010 among them the swmm is a dynamic rainfall runoff simulation model used for single event or long term continuous simulation of runoff quantity and quality due to its high computational efficiency and flexible mechanism the model has been widely used for estimating surface runoff and its pollution load in urban areas leite et al 2013 tsihrintzis et al 1998 zeng et al 2017 great progress has been made in the numerical model of lake hydrodynamic and water quality and the widely used models include efdc mike21 ce qual w2 and wasp these model softwares have high simulation accuracy but most of them require a large amount of measured data and the pre processing work is relatively complicated in this paper we selected a dem based two dimensional 2 d hydrodynamic and water quality model to describe the dynamic variation of lake flow field and water quality concentration which used the dem data as computational grid so the preprocessing process can be omitted and then considering the migration and transformation of non point source pollution a combined model of non point source pollution and lake hydrodynamic water quality was established the tangxun lake was used as a testbed here and the response of lake water quality to the rainstorm intensity and urbanization degree was revealed through scenario analysis the results may have important reference value and scientific significance for the water environment management of urban lakes under changing environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the tangxun lake with a surface area of 52 19 km2 and a watershed area of 240 38 km2 is the largest urban lake in china it is a typical subtropics shallow lake with an average water depth of 1 85m it is located between 30 22 30 28 n and 114 18 114 26 e it

environmental problems yang et al 2018 yang et al 2019 before 2001 the overall water quality of the tangxun lake was good and could meet or superior grade iii according to the national surface water quality standards of china gb3838 2002 after 2001 the water quality gradually deteriorated to grade iv and was in the mild eutrophication stage after 2014 the water quality further deteriorated to grade v and was in the moderate eutrophication state at present the water quality of the south lake the ye lake and the yezhi lake is worse than grade v which cannot meet the water quality management

the world was selected to simulate the non point source pollution in tangxun lake basin in the swmm model subbasins were divided into three categories according to the permeability of the surface including impermeable surface without depression impermeable surface with depression and permeable surface rossman 2009 for the impermeable surface without depression the runoff was obtained after evaporation was deducted from rainfall for the impermeable surface with depression runoff was equal to rainfall minus evaporation and depression for the permeable surface the runoff was obtained after deducting the amount of depression storage evaporation and infiltration the infiltration loss was calculated by horton model hydrological computations in the surface runoff process were based on the theory of non linear reservoirs the flow motion of the pipeline was based on the one dimensional saint venant equations the production and discharge of pollutants were divided into three processes including build up process wash off process and transport process in this paper the exponential function was used as the surface pollutant build up and wash off algorithms of the swmm model the pollutant transport process in the pipeline was simulated by using the fully mixed first order attenuation model 2 4 the 2 d hydrodynamic and water quality model for shallow lakes it is generally assumed that the distribution along the water depth is uniform this paper used the dem based 2 d hydrodynamic and water quality model liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 to describe the

model and the hydrodynamic water quality model so as to build a comprehensive hydrological hydrodynamic water quality mathematical model firstly the simulation of the non point source pollution in the basin was carried out under the driving of meteorological data such as rainfall and evaporation runoff was generated on the surface of the basin then flowed into the rainwater outfalls through the drainage system and eventually into the lake the distribution of rainwater outfalls were shown in fig 1 the outlet discharges and pollutant concentration of the basin can be simulated based on the non

inflow boundary conditions the spatial and temporal distribution of lake water dynamics and water quality can be simulated based on 2 d hydrodynamic and water quality model 3 model setup and validation 3 1 model setup 3 1 1 non point source pollution model considering the characteristics of water catchment and operation rules the catchment scales of the study area can be obtained based on hydrologic analysis the tangxun lake basin was divided into 28 sub catchments with different areas and 24 basin outlets as shown in fig 1 each sub catchment area was a distributed computing unit the runoff of each sub catchment area flowed into the corresponding channel or directly into the lake according to the direction of flow the water flow in the harbour channel was simulated as one dimensional open channel flow in order to reflect the accumulation and scouring process of surface pollutants in different land use types each sub catchment area was divided into five different land use types including agricultural land construction land woodland green land water area and bare land tn and tp were selected as the main pollution factors according to the situation of water quality

water quality parameters were adjusted the model was calibrated using measured runoff and outlet water quality concentration from june 16 to july 21 2016 and july 9 to july 10 2017 the model was verified using total runoff and pollution load in 2014 and the accuracy of model simulation was evaluated using relative error coefficient re and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse it was assumed that the rainfall was evenly distributed in each catchment area the rainfall data from june 16 to july 21 2016 of jiangxia station were input into the swmm and the total runoff volume of tangxun lake and south lake was simulated to be 137 6 106m3 and 22 7 106m3 respectively the re of tangxun lake and south lake were 11 9 and 2 5 respectively and the nse were 0 64 and 0 83 respectively the simulated runoff line fitted well with the measured runoff line and the simulated and measured peak value and the occurrence time were in good agreement fig 2 the average re of tn and tp from july 9 to july 10 2017 was 8 1 and 26 1 respectively fig 3 the results of the model hydro hydraulic parameters and water quality parameters were shown in tables 1 and 2 respectively to further verify the reliability of the model the daily rainfall and evaporation data of the jiangxia station in 2014 were used as the input data of the model the measured annual rainfall was 1208 6mm in 2014 and the annual runoff depth of the tangxun lake basin simulated based on swmm was 457 0mm according to the wuhan water resources bulletin the runoff depth in the study area in 2014 was 400 500mm which was consistent with the simulation results the simulated tn and tp loadings of non point source pollution were 486 74t and 36 35t respectively which were close to the 490t and 31 15t obtained in previous research li et al 2016 and the re were 0 7 and 0 2 respectively 3 2 2 the coupled model calibration and verification the hydrodynamic parameters of the model were calibrated using the lake water level data in 2014 and water quality parameters were calibrated by using the measured water quality data of 9 sampling sites fig 1 in february 2014 the results of the calibration parameters in hydrodynamic and water quality model was shown in table 3 the average re of water level tn and tp concentration were 0 2 10 3 and 12 4 respectively and the nse of water level was 0 92 the model was verified by using the measured data of 9 sampling sites in june 2014 in the validation period the simulated concentration of tn and tp reproduced the observed discharge well with the average re of 10 9 and 13 4 respectively fig 4 as a whole these results showed that the coupled model could well simulate the distribution and variation of tn and tp concentration in the lakes 4 results and discussion 4 1 impacts of rainfall intensity on lake water environment 4 1 1 runoff and inflow pollution loads in different rainfall scenarios this paper selected the 24 hour design rainfall with return periods of 1 5 10 and 20 years to analyze the impacts of rainfall intensity on lake water environment and the rainfall process line was shown in fig 5 the runoff and inflow pollution loads under different scenarios were simulated based on swmm table 4 the results indicated that the runoff depth increased obviously with the increase of rainfall intensity the increasing rate of runoff under the rainfall return period of 5 10 and 20 years was 81 2 30 6 and 25 2 respectively indicating that with the increase of return period the improvement rate gradually decreased gradually in addition it can be concluded that the greater the rainfall intensity the larger the inflow pollution loads of tn and tp 4 1 2 response of lake water quality to rainfall intensity the variation of tn and tp concentration in tangxun lake under different rainfall intensity scenarios was simulated based on the coupled model fig 6 the average water quality concentration was obtained by averaging the simulated water quality values of all grid points in the lake it can be seen that within the first 16 hours of rainfall the average tn and tp concentrations in the lake increased slowly and the larger the return period the faster the average concentration increased the average concentration of the lake increased significantly during 16 to 17 hours after 17 hours it decreased slightly under the return period of 20 years p 20 while it remained stable under other return periods under the return period of 1 5 10 and 20 years the average tn concentrations of the tangxun lake were 2 92 mg l 3 10 mg l 3 20 mg l and 3 23 mg l respectively and the average tp concentrations were 0 237 mg l 0 240 mg l 0 244 mg l and 0 251 mg l respectively it indicated that the greater the rainfall intensity the greater the water quality concentration in tangxun lake taking the 24 hour design rainstorm with a return period of 20 years as an example the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of lake s hydrodynamics and water quality were analyzed from the distribution of the lake flow field before and after the rainstorm fig 7 it can be seen that the water flowed slowly before the rainstorm and the velocity of most regions was lower than 0 01m s after the rainstorm the fluidity of the lake water was significantly improved and the flow velocity was greatly increased specifically the inlet outlet and the junction of the east and east lakes had relatively high velocities and the maximum velocity reached 0 58 m s under the influence of rainfall inflow and lake outflow the water flow presented a directional flow from the runoff inlets to the lake outlet the time variations of the spatial distribution of tn and tp in tangxun lake was shown in figs 8 and 9 as can be seen by the figures the pollutants in the basin continued to enter the lake with the continuation of the rainfall duration and the influence range of the lake water environment gradually increased within the first 12 hours of rainfall the concentration of water quality around the inlets increased significantly and the lake branch area was seriously polluted but the water quality in the centre of the lake had little influence after 16 hours of rainfall the polluted area continued to spread into the centre of the lake at this time the rainfall intensity and the concentration of tn and tp in the lake reached the maximum values the water quality in the lake branch area was worse than grade v after 20 hours of rainfall the range of polluted area increased further the water quality in the branch area had improved due to the decrease of inflow runoff concentration after 24 hours of rainfall the concentration of tn and tp in the lake tended to be stable since the inflow into the lake was small 4 2 impacts of urbanization on lake water environment 4 2 1 runoff and inflow pollution loads in different urbanization stages the urbanization development of the tangxun lake area can be divided into three stages the early urbanization stage before 1990 the rapid development stage 1990 2010 and the late urbanization stage after 2010 the rapid development of urbanization has caused significant changes in the characteristics of the underlying surface hou et al 2013 in order to study the response of lake water quality in different stages of urbanization the land use type in 1990 2008 and 2018 representing the early urbanization stage stage i the rapid development stage stage ii and the late urbanization stage stage iii was extracted through the supervised classification method using landsat data table 5 the runoff depth runoff coefficient and inflow pollution loads of tangxun lake basin in three urbanization stages were simulated based on swmm as shown in table 6 in the simulation to avoid the influence of rainfall intensity the input rainfall data in three stages were all 24 hour rainstorm with a return period of 5 years and the rainfall process was shown in fig 5 as was demonstrated in table 6 with the rapid development of urbanization the runoff depth runoff coefficient and pollutant loads had obviously increased compared with stage i the total pollution loads of tn and tp increased by 53 49t and 8 88t respectively after the rainstorm in stage iii the main reason was that the impervious area increased significantly in the late urbanization stage stage iii resulting in a decrease in infiltration volume and an increase in runoff into the lake as a result the wash off effect of runoff enhanced and the total pollution load of the basin increased therefore the development of urbanization not only increased the risk of urban flooding but also aggravated the lakes pollution problems similar results have been found in other studies zhao et al 2016 in the early urbanization stage stage i the tn and tp concentration at the watershed outlets increased slowly during 0 16 hours and then decreased sharply in 17 24 hours fig 10 since the peak rainfall occurred very late and rainfall intensity was small at the beginning of the rainfall there was no obvious first flush effects which was consistent with previous views that the first flush effect of runoff pollution was only observed in the events with the large rainfall intensity early peak rainfall and low initial pollutant concentrations xu et al 2017 in the rapid development stage stage ii and the late urbanization stage stage iii the tn and tp concentration increased rapidly with the continuation of the rainfall duration and reached the first peak in the 8th hour during 9 16 hours the concentration first decreased and then increased to the maximum value after 16 hours the concentration gradually decreased the results indicated that the tn and tp concentration in stage iii changed more intensely than that in stage i and stage ii in the prophase rainfall the tn and tp concentration at the watershed outlets in stage iii was higher than that in stage i and stage ii while in the late rainfall the tn and tp concentration in stage ii exceeded that in stage iii 4 2 2 response of lake water quality to urbanization development in the prophase rainfall the average tn and tp concentration of tangxun lake in stage i ii and iii all increased with the continuation of the rainfall duration and reached the maximum value in the 21th 20th and 18th hour respectively then remained stable fig 11 on the whole with the development of the urbanization the average tn and tp concentration had increased obviously except the tp concentration in stage ii was greater than that in stage iii after 24 hours of rainfall the average tn concentration of the lake increased by 0 61 mg l 0 90 mg l and 0 91 mg l respectively and the average tp concentration of the lake increased by 0 10 mg l 0 15 mg l 0 13 mg l respectively the water quality of the lake deteriorated from grade v to worse than grade v after rainfall the reason for this phenomenon may be the huge phosphorus pollution caused by the large scale use of agricultural fertilizers in the rapid urbanization stage sun et al 2017 5 conclusions and outlooks in this paper a combined model based on swmm and the dem based hydrodynamic water quality was developed to describe the dynamic variation of lake flow field and water quality concentration the combined model took into account the migration and transformation process of non point source pollution which can directly describe the way of non point source pollution entering the lake previous studies have shown that the non point source pollution has become the primary source of water pollution in urban lakes arhonditsis et al 2000 wu et al 2013 yi et al 2017 therefore the treatment of boundary conditions of non point source pollution will affect the simulation accuracy of lake hydrodynamic and water quality the climate change and urbanization have interacted synergistically to impact the water environment problem of urban lakes in the late twentieth century steffen 2001 zhou et al 2015 in this paper we performed the simulations of the non point source pollution and the lakes water quality under four different rainstorm intensity scenarios and three urbanization scenarios and then discussed the impacts of rainfall intensity and urbanization on water quality of urban lakes the simulation results showed that with the increase of the rainstorm intensity the runoff volume and the pollution load of tn and tp into the tangxun lake increased significantly but the improvement rate gradually decreased after the rainstorm the water fluidity in the lake was obviously improved in the prophase rainfall the tp and tn concentration gradually increased the greater the rainstorm intensity was the worse the water quality would become while in the late rainfall the lake s water quality improved slightly therefore rational utilization of rainfall flood resources can effectively improve the hydrodynamic and the water quality of lakes with the development of the urbanization the volume of generated municipal solid waste has increased leading to the deterioration of lake water environment on the other hand the runoff was increasing with development of urbanization because of the expansion of impermeable surface area resulting in the increased risk of urban flood disaster due to the complicated influence mechanism of lake water environment there are still some shortcomings in this paper the model developed in this paper was loose coupled and the runoff and water quality outputs of the swmm were used as the input conditions of the lake model in the simulation process the simulation error of the non point source pollution would accumulate to the simulation of the lake s hydrodynamics and water quality therefore the input parameters of both the swmm and the lake water quality model need to be adjusted repeatedly in future researches a tight coupling model can be adopted to reduce the cumulative error of the model in addition the study in this paper only considers the change of rainfall intensity as a single climatic factor in the future changes of other climatic factors such as temperature illumination and so on can be considered to

1043,freshwater influenced wetlands fiw wetlands impacted by both freshwater flooding and underground seawater miw and seawater influenced wetlands siw were chosen as sampling sites to investigate the variations in the soil organic carbon content and stock in wetlands with different hydrologic conditions in the yellow river delta china the results showed that a salinity gradient developed as the hydrologic conditions ranged from freshwater to seawater in 0 50 cm soils the mean values of soil organic carbon soc microbial biomass carbon mbc and readily oxidized organic carbon rooc were higher in fiw and siw than those in miw while the dissolved organic carbon doc showed a higher mean value in miw along the 0 50 cm soil profile soc mbc rooc and doc decreased as the soil depth increased in fiw and siw however in miw soil carbon initially decreased and then increased later the annual mean values of soc in 0 50 cm soils were 6 87 g kg in fiw 4 92 g kg in miw and 5 42 g kg in siw respectively the soil organic carbon density socd values for fiw miw and siw were 4 55 3 26 and 3 84 kg c m2 respectively correlation analysis revealed that soc rooc and doc were significantly

decisively affect global carbon cycling bernal and mitsch 2008 2012 because of their high carbon storage wetlands contribute greatly to climate regulation one of the most important ecosystem services ausseil et al 2015 the carbon storage in wetlands is controlled by several factors including the wetland type the topography and landscape position the hydrologic regime vegetation types temperature and therefore climate soil moisture ph salinity and the morphology of the wetland bernal and mitsch 2008 ju et al 2010 mitsch et al 2013 mizanur rahman et al 2015 coastal wetlands are considered a significant sink for global carbon and recognized as sites for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission offset projects that preserve existing carbon stocks or create new wetlands to increase future sequestration chambers et al 2013 kroeger et al 2017 the high carbon sequestration capacity of coastal wetlands is mainly due to their relatively slow microbial decomposition rate high primary productivity and the ability to trap and bury significant amounts of allochthonous c from terrestrial run off and tidal deposition chambers et al 2013 wang et al 2019 among these variables the hydrologic condition determines the basic wetland structures and functions zedler 2000 besides hydrology determines soil salinity through interactions among tidal inundation precipitation runoff groundwater flow and evapotranspiration white and madsen 2016 soil salinity strongly affects the distribution of vegetation microbial activity soil properties and thus the decomposition of organic matter herbert et al 2015 vegetation types and vegetation functional attributes significantly affect soil carbon stock in mangrove wetlands mizanur rahman et al 2015 thus the effects of hydrologic conditions on soil carbon stocks in wetlands are worth a thorough investigation climate changes are anticipated to profoundly affect wetlands by altering hydrological regimes with high global variability erwin 2009 subsequently the critical functions and services of wetlands including their carbon storage capacity will be affected junk et al 2013 besides sea level rise resulted from by climate warming would severely threaten freshwater wetlands and enlarge the area of saline wetlands moomaw et al 2018 therefore the salinity in wetlands affected by sea level rise would increase inevitably however wetland salinization potentially causes wetland degradation alterations in ecosystem level processes and landscape and final feedback to global climate systems herbert et al 2015 the worldwide degradation and loss of wetlands has caused wetland restoration to be essential and urgent dam et al 2015 the yellow river delta is no exception to serious degradation and loss due to anthropogenic activities and salinization cui et al 2017 so far the main restoration measure adopted by local managers has been the channeling freshwater from the yellow river to the variously degraded wetlands to create freshwater phragmites australis wetlands bai et al 2015 however freshwater wetlands are characterized with both high carbon sequestration and high ch4 emissions in contrast saline wetlands are tidal and feature high rates of net carbon storage and minor ch4 emissions kroeger et al 2017 thus specific restoration measures and management plans should consider these different features erwin 2009 this study chose typical wetlands in the yellow river delta as sampling sites and aimed to compare the organic carbon content and stock of wetlands soils with different hydrologic conditions and to provide guidelines for wetland restoration and management 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area is located in the nature reserve of the yellow river

the mean annual air temperature precipitation and evaporation values are 12 4 c 551 6 mm and 1928 2 mm respectively zhao et al 2015 perpendicular to the north bank of the yellow river three types of wetlands with different hydrologic conditions were chosen as sampling sites in 2014 fig 1 a freshwater influenced wetlands fiw are close to the north bank of the yellow river mainly covered with cattail and a small proportion of phragmites australis and calamagrostis pseudophragmites and affected by freshwater flooding from the water and sediment regulation in the late june or early july since 2002 the wetlands impacted by flooding from both freshwater the water and sediment regulation and underground seawater miw are dominated by phragmites australis tidal seawater and underground seawater influencing wetlands siw are dominated by suaeda salsa and are frequently flooded by tides however fiw and miw are flooded by freshwater at least once a year the distance from fiw miw and siw to the north bank of the yellow river is 20 m 200 m and 700 m respectively fig 1 b besides the mean value of salinity in 0 50 cm soils was significantly higher in miw and siw than in fiw due to the effects of seawater p 0 05 fig 1 b 2 2 sample collection and analysis soil cores were randomly collected at a depth of 0 50 cm with three replicates and sectioned into five soil layers at 10 cm

differences among the three wetlands at all sampling periods p 0 05 fig 3 c the highest and lowest mean values of rooc in the 0 50 cm soils were found in fiw and miw respectively similar to rooc doc showed no significant differences among the three wetlands in spring summer and autumn p 0 05 fig 3 d in winter the doc values in fiw and miw were not significantly different p 0 05 but were significantly higher than doc in siw p 0 05 however the highest mean value of doc in the top 50 cm soils was found in miw on the whole soc in the top 50 cm soils in fiw was significantly higher than that in miw and siw in 2014 with the mean value of 6 87 g kg p 0 05 fig 4 a and the annual mean values of soc in miw and siw were 4 92 g kg and 5 42 g kg respectively as shown in fig 4 b the mbc in fiw and miw were significantly higher than that in siw 187 55 mg kg p 0 05 with the annual mean values of 297 34 mg kg and 281 82 mg kg respectively however rooc and doc showed no significant differences among the three wetlands at the annual scale p 0 05 fig 4 c and d the highest annual mean values of rooc and doc occurred in fiw 142 07 mg kg and miw 10 47 mg kg respectively while the lowest annual mean values of rooc and doc were observed in miw 98 52 mg kg and siw 9 06 mg kg respectively 3 4 profile distributions of soc mbc rooc and doc in the three wetlands the values of soc mbc rooc and doc along soil profiles are illustrated in fig 5 a b c and d respectively soc mbc rooc and doc in fiw and siw generally decreased as soil depth increased with the highest value occurring at the 0 10 cm soil depth in contrast soc mbc rooc and doc in miw initially decreased and then increased later with increasing soil depth the highest values of soil carbon in miw were observed in the 40 50 cm soils horizontally soc and rooc first declined and then increased from the yellow river to the sea whereas doc showed an opposite tendency as for mbc a decreasing trend toward the sea could be observed 3 5 soil carbon stock in the top 50 cm soils of the three wetlands table 2 shows the proportions of mbc rooc and doc in soc in the three wetlands the mbc occupied a higher proportion than rooc and doc did in the three wetlands with the mean percentage of 5 in fiw 6 04 in miw and 4 04 in siw respectively the rooc soc ratio was lower than the mbc soc ratio ranging from 1 to 2 in the three wetlands however the doc soc ratio in the three wetlands was less than 0 5 much lower than the mbc soc and the rooc soc ratios in sum the low percentage of these three labile fractions indicated that soc in the three wetlands was mostly composed of stable carbon the soil organic carbon density socd was used to represent the soil organic carbon stock in this study the soil organic carbon stocks in the upper 50 cm soils in the four sampling periods among the three wetlands are exhibited in fig 6 a as shown in fig 6 a socd in fiw was significantly higher than that in miw p 0 05 and socd in siw was between the socd of fiw and miw socd in fiw miw and siw ranged from 4 24 to 4 87 kg c m2 2 77 to 3 64 kg c m2 and 3 23 to 4 06 kg c m2 respectively surface soils mostly contributed to the total soil carbon stock in the upper 50 cm soils in the three wetlands however the contribution of socd of the 40 50 cm soils to the total socd in miw was higher than those in fiw and siw throughout 2014 socd in fiw was significantly higher comapred with that in miw p 0 05 while socd in siw was not significantly different from socd in fiw and siw p 0 05 in addition the mean values of socd in fiw miw and siw in the top 50 cm soils were 4 55 3 26 and 3 84 kg c m2 respectively 3 6 environmental variables that affect the soil carbon content the correlation matrix between soil carbon and soil properties is shown in table 3 accoding to table 3 soc was positively related to the wc and silt content p 0 05 and was significantly negatively correlated with soil ph bd sand content and c n ratio p 0 05 mbc was significantly correlated with ec na k mg2 ca2 cl so4 2 sar ph bd in a negative way p 0 05 and tn in a positive way p 0 01 rooc had a significantly positive relationship with the mg2 ca2 wc clay and silt contents and tn p 0 05 in addition the ph bd and sand content were negatively correlated with rooc p 0 05 doc was significantly positively related to ca2 wc and tn p 0 05 and negatively related to ph bd sand content and c n ratio p 0 01 4 discussion 4 1 effects of hydrologic conditions on soc content and other soil properties the fate of soc in wetlands is largely determined by the water table elevation and water salinity kroeger et al 2017 the anoxic wet conditions in wetlands can inhibit the decomposition of organic matter and benefit the sequestration of carbon mathijssen et al 2019 olsson et al 2009 found that the soil orgnic carbon stock in slightly moist sites was higher than it was in dry sites in addition the so4 2 provided by seawater causes sulfate reduction to be the primary organic matter decomposition pathway in coastal wetlands and this process is slower than aerobic decomposition wang et al 2019 the salinity values in fiw miw and siw were significant different due to the different hydrologic conditions the seawater intrusion in miw and siw caused high soil salinity especially in siw according to the iuss working group wrb 2007 if the electrical conductivity measured in a saturated soil paste ece is higher than 15 ds m the soil is classified as saline soil the estimation of soil salinity in saturated paste is expensive and time consuming thus we measured the soil salinity using 1 5 soil water extracts ec1 5 according to the reduction formulas provide by aboukila and norton 2017 ece 5 04ec1 5 0 37 r 2 0 927 the soil ece values in siw were higher than 15 ds m however the soil ecevalues in fiw and miw were lower than 15 ds m thus soils in siw were saline while soils in fiw and miw were not saline the hydrologic conditions and salinity determined the vegetation types in three wetlands the ratio between inputs organic matter produced in situ and ex situ and outputs decomposition and erosion determines the accumulation of organic matter in wetland soils bernal and mitsch 2008 the productivity and anaerobic conditions produced by standing water play a decisive role in enhancing soil carbon stock in wetlands bernal and mitsch 2012 the higher aboveground biomass in fiw than in siw table 1 is one reason for the higher carbon content and carbon stock in the former the relative distribution of soc had a strong association with vegetation and plant litters increased soil nutrients in the top soils explaining why soil carbon was higher in the top 10 cm soils jobbágy and jackson 2000 2001 the increase of the soil carbon in the 40 50 cm soils in miw might be associated with the effects of seawater intrusion 4 2 effects of soil properties on soc contents high salinity influences the

1043,freshwater influenced wetlands fiw wetlands impacted by both freshwater flooding and underground seawater miw and seawater influenced wetlands siw were chosen as sampling sites to investigate the variations in the soil organic carbon content and stock in wetlands with different hydrologic conditions in the yellow river delta china the results showed that a salinity gradient developed as the hydrologic conditions ranged from freshwater to seawater in 0 50 cm soils the mean values of soil organic carbon soc microbial biomass carbon mbc and readily oxidized organic carbon rooc were higher in fiw and siw than those in miw while the dissolved organic carbon doc showed a higher mean value in miw along the 0 50 cm soil profile soc mbc rooc and doc decreased as the soil depth increased in fiw and siw however in miw soil carbon initially decreased and then increased later the annual mean values of soc in 0 50 cm soils were 6 87 g kg in fiw 4 92 g kg in miw and 5 42 g kg in siw respectively the soil organic carbon density socd values for fiw miw and siw were 4 55 3 26 and 3 84 kg c m2 respectively correlation analysis revealed that soc rooc and doc were significantly

decisively affect global carbon cycling bernal and mitsch 2008 2012 because of their high carbon storage wetlands contribute greatly to climate regulation one of the most important ecosystem services ausseil et al 2015 the carbon storage in wetlands is controlled by several factors including the wetland type the topography and landscape position the hydrologic regime vegetation types temperature and therefore climate soil moisture ph salinity and the morphology of the wetland bernal and mitsch 2008 ju et al 2010 mitsch et al 2013 mizanur rahman et al 2015 coastal wetlands are considered a significant sink for global carbon and recognized as sites for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission offset projects that preserve existing carbon stocks or create new wetlands to increase future sequestration chambers et al 2013 kroeger et al 2017 the high carbon sequestration capacity of coastal wetlands is mainly due to their relatively slow microbial decomposition rate high primary productivity and the ability to trap and bury significant amounts of allochthonous c from terrestrial run off and tidal deposition chambers et al 2013 wang et al 2019 among these variables the hydrologic condition determines the basic wetland structures and functions zedler 2000 besides hydrology determines soil salinity through interactions among tidal inundation precipitation runoff groundwater flow and evapotranspiration white and madsen 2016 soil salinity strongly affects the distribution of vegetation microbial activity soil properties and thus the decomposition of organic matter herbert et al 2015 vegetation types and vegetation functional attributes significantly affect soil carbon stock in mangrove wetlands mizanur rahman et al 2015 thus the effects of hydrologic conditions on soil carbon stocks in wetlands are worth a thorough investigation climate changes are anticipated to profoundly affect wetlands by altering hydrological regimes with high global variability erwin 2009 subsequently the critical functions and services of wetlands including their carbon storage capacity will be affected junk et al 2013 besides sea level rise resulted from by climate warming would severely threaten freshwater wetlands and enlarge the area of saline wetlands moomaw et al 2018 therefore the salinity in wetlands affected by sea level rise would increase inevitably however wetland salinization potentially causes wetland degradation alterations in ecosystem level processes and landscape and final feedback to global climate systems herbert et al 2015 the worldwide degradation and loss of wetlands has caused wetland restoration to be essential and urgent dam et al 2015 the yellow river delta is no exception to serious degradation and loss due to anthropogenic activities and salinization cui et al 2017 so far the main restoration measure adopted by local managers has been the channeling freshwater from the yellow river to the variously degraded wetlands to create freshwater phragmites australis wetlands bai et al 2015 however freshwater wetlands are characterized with both high carbon sequestration and high ch4 emissions in contrast saline wetlands are tidal and feature high rates of net carbon storage and minor ch4 emissions kroeger et al 2017 thus specific restoration measures and management plans should consider these different features erwin 2009 this study chose typical wetlands in the yellow river delta as sampling sites and aimed to compare the organic carbon content and stock of wetlands soils with different hydrologic conditions and to provide guidelines for wetland restoration and management 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area is located in the nature reserve of the yellow river

the mean annual air temperature precipitation and evaporation values are 12 4 c 551 6 mm and 1928 2 mm respectively zhao et al 2015 perpendicular to the north bank of the yellow river three types of wetlands with different hydrologic conditions were chosen as sampling sites in 2014 fig 1 a freshwater influenced wetlands fiw are close to the north bank of the yellow river mainly covered with cattail and a small proportion of phragmites australis and calamagrostis pseudophragmites and affected by freshwater flooding from the water and sediment regulation in the late june or early july since 2002 the wetlands impacted by flooding from both freshwater the water and sediment regulation and underground seawater miw are dominated by phragmites australis tidal seawater and underground seawater influencing wetlands siw are dominated by suaeda salsa and are frequently flooded by tides however fiw and miw are flooded by freshwater at least once a year the distance from fiw miw and siw to the north bank of the yellow river is 20 m 200 m and 700 m respectively fig 1 b besides the mean value of salinity in 0 50 cm soils was significantly higher in miw and siw than in fiw due to the

rooc and doc along soil profiles are illustrated in fig 5 a b c and d respectively soc mbc rooc and doc in fiw and siw generally decreased as soil depth increased with the highest value occurring at the 0 10 cm soil depth in contrast soc mbc rooc and doc in miw initially decreased and then increased later with increasing soil depth the highest values of soil carbon in miw were observed in the 40 50 cm soils horizontally soc and rooc first declined and then increased from the yellow river to the sea whereas doc showed an opposite tendency as for mbc a decreasing trend toward the sea could be observed 3 5 soil carbon stock in the top 50 cm soils of the three wetlands table 2 shows the proportions of mbc rooc and doc in soc in the three wetlands the mbc occupied a higher proportion than rooc and doc did in the three wetlands with the mean percentage of 5 in fiw 6 04 in miw and 4 04 in siw respectively the rooc soc ratio was lower than the mbc soc ratio ranging from 1 to 2 in the three wetlands however the doc soc ratio in the three wetlands was less than 0 5 much lower than the mbc soc and the rooc soc ratios in sum the low percentage of these three labile fractions indicated that soc in the three wetlands was mostly composed of stable carbon the soil organic carbon density socd was used to represent the soil organic carbon stock in this study the soil organic carbon stocks in the upper 50 cm soils in the four sampling periods among the three wetlands are exhibited in fig 6 a as shown in fig 6 a socd in fiw was significantly higher than that in miw p 0 05 and socd

negatively related to ph bd sand content and c n ratio p 0 01 4 discussion 4 1 effects of hydrologic conditions on soc content and other soil properties the fate of soc in wetlands is largely determined by the water table elevation and water salinity kroeger et al 2017 the anoxic wet conditions in wetlands can inhibit the decomposition of organic matter and benefit the sequestration of carbon mathijssen et al 2019 olsson et al 2009 found that the soil orgnic carbon stock in slightly moist sites was higher than it was in dry sites in addition the so4 2 provided by seawater causes sulfate reduction to be the primary organic matter decomposition pathway in coastal wetlands and this process is slower than aerobic decomposition wang et al 2019 the salinity values in fiw miw and siw were significant different due to the different hydrologic conditions the seawater intrusion in miw and siw caused high soil salinity especially in siw according to the iuss working group wrb 2007 if the electrical conductivity measured in a saturated soil paste ece is higher than 15 ds m the soil is classified as saline soil the estimation of soil salinity in saturated paste is expensive and time consuming thus we measured the soil salinity using 1 5 soil water extracts ec1 5 according to the reduction formulas provide by aboukila and norton 2017 ece 5 04ec1 5 0 37 r 2 0 927 the soil ece values in siw were higher than 15 ds m however the soil ecevalues in fiw and miw were lower than 15 ds m thus soils in siw were saline while soils in fiw and miw were not saline the hydrologic conditions and salinity determined the vegetation types in three wetlands the ratio between inputs organic matter produced in situ and ex situ and outputs decomposition and erosion determines the accumulation of organic matter in wetland soils bernal and mitsch 2008 the productivity and anaerobic conditions produced by standing water play a decisive role in enhancing soil carbon stock in wetlands bernal and mitsch 2012 the higher aboveground biomass in fiw than in siw table 1 is one reason for the higher carbon content and carbon stock in the former the relative distribution of soc had a strong association with vegetation and plant litters increased soil nutrients in the top soils explaining why soil carbon was higher in the top 10 cm soils jobbágy and jackson 2000 2001 the increase of the soil carbon in the 40 50 cm soils in miw might be associated with the effects of seawater intrusion 4 2 effects of soil properties on soc contents high salinity influences the

the proportion of labile organic carbon in total carbon is generally very low it is of great significance to influence greenhouse gas emissions and reflect the availability of soil carbon which is frequently used to assess the soil quality huo et al 2017 soil labile organic carbon refers to the part of organic carbon in soil that was fast moving unstable easily oxidized and easily mineralizable xi et al 2018 soil microbial biomass carbon mbc and dissolved organic carbon doc are two important indicators of soil labile organic carbon pool huo et al 2017 wickland et al 2018 mbc presents the carbon in the living soil microorganism whose volume is 5 103 µm3 which plays a fundamental role in soil organic carbon dynamics and is often regarded as a useful indicator for the changes in soil carbon stabilization and nutrient dynamics liu et al 2016 doc is the organic carbon extracted using water or diluted salt solution and can pass through 0 45 µm filter which is more important for biogeochemical processes and the ecosystem function in particular soil processes involving labile organic carbon may strongly control the carbon source sink functions of estuarine wetland ecosystems jones and willett 2006 said pullicino et al 2016 soil mbc and doc have become research hotspots in wetland ecosystems since they can reflect and affect mineral weathering soil formation process the growth and activity of microorganisms and the transformation and decomposition of soil organic matter som tu et al 2006 xi et al 2018 labile organic carbon density including mbc density mbcd and doc density docd means soil labile organic carbon content per unit area which is significant to evaluate the total labile organic carbon level in estuarine wetlands zhao et al 2018 soil salinity and moisture determine the spatial distribution characteristics of different land cover types and soil properties to some extent which drives the changes in soil labile organic carbon huo et al 2017 wang et al 2017 yang et al 2018 meanwhile salinity and moisture are important factors impacting microbial community structures and activities by influencing osmotic stress toxic ions contents and diffusion of oxygen mavi et al 2012a yan et al 2015 wang et al 2019 previous study has reported that soil salinity and moisture can vary both in time and space yan et al 2015 moreover the global sea level rise might subsequently increase the frequency of seawater intrusion farther into historically low and medium salinity estuarine zones which would further affect soil labile organic carbon levels in estuarine wetlands yang et al 2018 therefore it is very significant to evaluate the effects of soil salinity and water on soil labile organic carbon in estuarine wetlands for studying global carbon cycling profile distributions of labile organic carbon in estuarine wetlands with different hydrological conditions were not consistent and were greatly affected by soil moisture and salinity li et al 2018 steinmuller et al 2019 found that mbc and doc in coastal wetland soils of barataria bay la usa fluctuated at the top 50 cm soil and accumulated at the 60 70 cm soil depth which were significantly positively correlated with soil moisture the yellow river delta is located in the south coast of bohai bay and the west coast of laizhou bay 37 20 38 11 n 118 21 119 20 e which is the most complete and largest newly formed estuarine wetlands in the warm temperate zone in china wang et al 2016 in this study we analyzed soil mbc and doc distributions in estuarine wetlands with different water tables and salinities of the yellow river delta the primary objectives of this work were 1 to investigate profile distributions of soil labile organic carbon in three types of wetlands with different water levels and salinities and different plant covers 2 to identify the changes in soil mbc and doc contents with increasing soil salinity and water contents in estuarine wetlands and 3 to reveal the relationships between soil mbc and doc and selected other properties in these estuarine wetlands 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area lies in the yellow river delta national nature reserve shandong province of china where the vegetation is dominated by phragmites australis tamarix chinensis and suaeda salsa etc zhao et al 2017 it has a sub humid warm temperate and continental monsoon climate chen et al 2016 the annual mean air temperature in this region is 12 21 c and 13 57 c in 2012 and 2013 respectively the annual mean precipitation is 305 34 mm and 587 85 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively in which approximately 50 of the rainfall is concentrated in summer bai et al 2012 hoerling et al 2013 the annual mean evaporation in this area is as high as 1962 mm especially in spring bai et al 2015 there is a high soil salt content and plant salt content and their salt tolerance decrease with increasing distances from the sea to the land weng et al 2008 as typical estuarine wetlands the study area is most typically affected by the freshwater of the yellow river and the tidal saltwater there are large areas of salt marshes affected by the tides freshwater wetlands mainly affected by the yellow river and brackish wetlands interacted with freshwater and saltwater wang et al 2016 therefore we chose three types of estuarine wetlands i e freshwater wetlands brackish wetlands and salt marshes as the sampling plots to investigate the changes of soil labile organic carbon in estuarine wetlands of the yellow river delta the location of the study area is shown in fig 1 the freshwater wetlands are located on the north bank of the yellow river and are mainly affected by the freshwater of the river they are also affected by the flow sediment regulation of xiaolangdi reservoir from mid june to early july and the water table varies from 168 cm to 112 cm which are defined as wetlands with low groundwater tables lw the brackish wetlands on near the south bank of the yellow river which is influenced by both freshwater and tidal floods with the water table varying from 120 cm to 82 cm the brackish wetlands are also defined as wetlands with middle groundwater tables mw the salt marshes are in the offshore locations affected by tidal cycles which is defined as wetlands with high groundwater tables hw ranging from 3 cm to 0 cm three land covers in each sampling plot were selected including bare land bl suaeda salsa ss and phragmites australis pa because ss and pa are the predominant plant species in the study area both ss and pa can effectively provide habitats for birds and other speices and participate in the biogeochemical cycles of nutrient elements which has different effects on soil carbon content jia et al 2018 soil water content wc increased significantly from lw to hw while soil salinity increased significantly from lw to hw fig 2 2 2 water table measurement the groundwater table of each sampling site including bl lw ss lw pa lw bl mw ss mw pa mw bl hw ss hw and pa hw was measured by groundwater wells monthly during the growing seasons in 2012 and 2013 a bell shaped metal body attached to a rope was extended to the position of the water in the groundwater well where the length of the rope was the water table 2 3 sample collection and analysis plant litters and stones on the soil surface were removed and soil profiles were excavated to a depth of 50 cm in the selected wetlands including bl lw ss lw pa lw bl mw ss mw pa mw bl hw ss hw and pa hw of the yellow river delta in may 2012 and may 2013 respectively soils were collected at intervals of 10 cm in soil profiles three replicate samples were collected from each layer of each soil profile a total of 270 soil samples were obtained in order to avoid contamination soil samples were collected from bottom to top along soil profiles and then the soil samples were quickly placed in zip lock polyethylene bags and taken back to the laboratory one part of the soil samples was stored at 4 c for the determination of soil mbc and microbial biomass nitrogen mbn and doc the remaining samples were air dried and passed through a 2 mm sieve for the determination of soil ph and salinity the sieved soil samples were further ground to pass through a 0 15 mm sieve for the determination of soil organic carbon soc and total nitrogen tn meanwhile another three soil cores 100 cm3 in each sampling site were collected using cutting rings for the determination of soil wc and bulk density bd donald 1987 soil ph and salinity were measured w v in a 1 5 solution of soil water using a ph meter hach company loveland co usa and an salinity meter mettler toledo usa respectively tn were determined on a chnos elemental analyzer vario el german soc was determined using dichromate oxidation nelson and sommers 1982 mbc and mbn were measured by the chloroform fumigation extraction method vance et al 1987 doc was estimated as described as kalbitz et al 2003 i e ultrapure water was added to the soil and then the solutions were filtered through 0 2 µm membrane filters to remove microorganisms total organic carbon toc analyzer l cpn japan was used to determine doc concentration in the filtrate mbcd and docd of each laye at each sampling site was calculated as follows 1 mbcd mbc bd h 2 docd doc bd h where mbcd and docd are the soil mbc density kg c m2 and doc density kg c m2 respectively mbc and doc are the microbial biomass carbon content mg kg and dissolved organic carbon content mg kg bd is the soil bulk density g cm3 and h is the thickness of the soil layer cm the mbc mbn was the ratio of mbc and mbn and calculated as molar ratio the microbial quotient qmb was the ratio of mbc and soc the c n ratio was the ratio of soc and tn and calculated as the molar ratio 2 4 statistical analysis one way anova analysis was performed by spss 16 0 software package to identify the significance in soil mbc mbcd doc docd and soil wc and salinity among different wetlands or different soil layers regression analysis was carried out by origin 9 2 software package to reveal the relationships between soil labile organic carbon and wc and

1 distribution patterns of soil labile organic carbon soil mbc is considered to be an important and labile fraction of som involving in energy and nutrient cycling ebhin masto et al 2006 in this study mbc and mbcd basically presented an increasing trend with depth along bl soil profiles except for bl mw and bl hw in 2013 as a result of the absence of vegetation cover in bl soc mainly came from the river tidal floods and sediments brought by river and tidal cycles zhang et al 2007 delaune and white 2012 and mueller et al 2016 demonstrated that sea level rise promoted the deposition of suspended matter and peat accumulation which are not conducive to the decomposition of som meanwhile affected by the fluctuation of the water table the elevated water table might slow down the degradation rate of som and improve the storage capacity of carbon so soil organic carbon content in deep soils was higher kettridge et al 2015 accordingly organic matter in surface soils was low due to no plant litter inputs which couldn t provide a favorable living environment for microorganisms li et al 2019 soil mbc in deep soils was higher than those in surface soils which was affected by som levels rath and rousk 2015 however the profile distribution patterns of doc and docd in bl were not consistent with those of mbc and mbcd the main reason was that doc the more mobile and bioavailable fraction of organic carbon in soil mainly comes from plant litters the secretion of roots and soil animals and soil microbial metabolism products which is affected by many factors such as tidal cycle upstream input and vegetation cover fellman et al 2008 shahzad et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 among the sampling sites covered by vegetation mbc and mbcd were relatively high in surface soils of ss lw in 2012 and 2013 ss hw in 2013 pa hw in 2013 and pa lw in 2013 the similar profile distribution patterns of doc and docd in ss hw soils in 2012 were observed the labile organic carbon contents of the soils covered vegetation could be affected by the organic matter from plant litters and root exudates brown et al 2000 an adequate carbon source and a more favorable living environment for microbial growth and proliferation were formed due to plants liang et al 2017 in addition the depth distribution characteristics of soil labile organic carbon in mw and hw wetlands were different from lw wetlands because mw and hw wetlands were more affected by tidal cycles and water table fluctuations tidal floods could bring a large amount of suspended matter and the larger tidal flow at ebb tides might also carry plant litters away leading to lower contents of organic carbon and labile organic carbon in surface soils burd et al 2016 e g the mbc and mbcd in ss mw soils and doc and docd in pa hw soils at the middle soil depths showed relatively high levels moreover plant root growth also affected the depth distributions of the labile organic carbon jobbágy and jackson 2000 previous studies suggested that the accretion of estuarine wetlands highly depends on the accumulation of organic matter rather than minerals and that the accumulation of som is mainly controlled by the growth of roots rather than the production of aboveground biomass or tidal input nyman et al 2006 generally estuarine wetlands can be affected by a variety of environmental factors such as vegetation growth microbial activity tidal and runoff changes rainfall jobbágy and jackson 2000 labile organic carbon in soil profiles of estuarine wetlands is mobile and susceptible to change under the effects of environmental factors therefore the profile distribution patterns of soil labile organic carbon in sampling sites with different land cover under different water tables were complicated and inconsistent mbcd in the top 50 cm soil in sampling sites covered by plants ss and pa was basically higher than that in bl soils in estuarine wetlands with different groundwater tables plants can provide an adequate carbon source and a more suitable environment for microorganisms through litters and root secretions liang et al 2017 however there were no consistent characteristics of docd in the top 50 cm soil in these sampling sites with different land covers docd in the top 50 cm soil varied greatly from 2012 to 2013 which was related to the instability of doc itself fellman et al 2008 the pca results showed that the distributions of sampling sites under different groundwater tables could not be clearly distinguished indicating that a small difference in soil properties and organic carbon contents between them however soil properties and organic carbon contents in 2012 and 2013 were different and could be clearly distinguished between the two years the average mean precipitation is 305 34 mm and 587 85 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively so that the climate conditions in 2012 were drier than those in 2013 bai et al 2012 hoerling et al 2013 it had a great impact on soil physical and chemical properties of estuarine wetlands and most directly reflected in the change in soil wc mckee et al 2004 less precipitation in 2012 limited plant productivity and appeared to constrain som accumulation osland et al 2018 leading to lower soc in 2013 compared with 2012 accordingly soil labile organic carbon in 2012 was higher than that in 2013 therefore the effects of interannual climate change on soil properties and organic carbon contents in estuarine wetlands were more obvious than the effects of different water tables in the same year in addition our results also indicated that soil element contents in a certain year cannot represent their long term average level in the area when conducting environmental monitoring 4 2 effects of water and salt change on soil labile organic carbon the mbc contents in mw and hw soils decreased with increasing wc p 0 05 and p 0 01 fig 7 a previous studies also showed a negative correlation between mbc and soil moisture huo et al 2017 ross 1987 the reason for the results was mainly that the elevated soil wc resulted in a limited o2 diffusion which would limit the metabolism of aerobic microorganisms yan et al 2015 wang et al 2019 therefore soil mbc contents were relatively decreased like soil mbc the doc contents in mw and hw also showed a decrease with increasing wc p 0 01 and p 0 05 fig 7 c doc is believed to be derived from plant roots litters soil humic substances and metabolic products of soil animals and microorganisms van hees et al 2005 huo et al 2017 presented that doc was highly correlated with mbc the changes in soil mbc and doc with increasing wc in mw and hw wetlands indicated that a continuous increase in soil wc would reduce soil fertility however the lowest mbc content in lw wetlands was observed when soil wc was 25 and then increased with increasing wc fig 7 a microbial activities highly depend on soil moisture since related enzymes are produced by microorganisms and organic matter transport in soil also needs the liquid phase huo et al 2017 soil moisture was the main limiting factor for the variations in doc contents and the positive correlation between doc and soil moisture was reported in previous studies kalbitz et al 2000 sugihara et al 2010 in this study we also observed the significantly positive correlation between doc and wc in lw wetlands p 0 01 fig 7 c soil mbc mbn ratio is often used to reflect the structure of microbial communities bacteria dominated in soil microbial communities when soil mbc mbn ratio was 3 5 while fungus dominated in soil microbial communities when soil mbc mbn ratio was 4 15 raiesi and kabiri 2016 qmb a parameter calculated by the percentage of the contents of mbc and soc is one of the important indexes to evaluate the activity of soc the soc was accumulated when the qmb was high on the contrary the soc was released when the qmb decreased zheng et al 2018 the c n ratio is a good indicator and useful tool for measuring the degree of decomposition and the quality of som higher c n ratios could contribute to the accumulation of soil organic carbon because som decomposition would be limited by nitrogen availability wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 in this study soil wc showed a close relationship with soc p 0 05 mbn p 0 01 mbc mbn p 0 01 qmb p 0 01 c n p 0 01 soil bd p 0 01 salinity p 0 01 and ph p 0 01 indicating that soil wc could affect the accumulation and release of soc as well as the structure of microbial community and change the growth of microorganism by changing other soil environmental factors however an increase in soc and a decrease in labile organic carbon with increasing wc in mw and hw wetlands implied that the increasing wc is beneficial to the accumulation of soc keiluweit et al 2016 stanford and epstein 1974 however this contradicted the results that soil wc was negatively correlated with qmb p 0 01 and c n p 0 01 which might be caused by many environmental factors such as soil salinity and nitrogen pool morrissey et al 2014 the increasing salinity would cause a decrease before an increase in mbc contents in three types of wetlands with different groundwater tables fig 7 b a higher soil salinity might lead to non salt adapted microbial species to experience osmotic stress interruptions in cellular function and cell lysis yan et al 2015 yang et al 2018 thus mbc levels would decrease with increasing salinities when initial soil salinity level is low however the tolerance threshold of microorganisms to salinity were different in sampling sites under different water tables because osmotic potential could be affected by both salinity and soil water content yan et al 2015 the apparent differential sensitivity of microorganisms to salinity in sampling sites under different groundwater tables can be explained by their different wc and osmotic potentials at the same salinity level mavi et al 2012a low soil wc in lw wetlands limited the tolerance threshold of cells to salinity which decreased mbc content when soil salinity was at the range from 0 5 ppt to 0 9 ppt on the contrary an increase in soil moisture alleviated the salinity stress on cells and increased the salt tolerance threshold of microorganisms we observed that mbc decreased when soil salinity varied from 2 0 ppt to 2 7 ppt in hw wetlands however mbc contents in all sampling sites showed an increasing trend when soil salinity increased continuously the possible reason was that the different structures of microbial communities in different soils with various salinities and many halotolerant microorganisms suitable for survival in the high salinity soils could counteract osmotic stress by synthesizing osmolytes yan et al 2015 additionally the negative correlation between salinity and mbc mbn ratio p 0 01 might be associated with the fact that fungi tends to be more sensitive to salt stress than bacteria yan et al 2015 generally the higher mbc in low and high salinity soils implied the faster degradation and turnover rate of som in estuarine wetlands under low or high salt conditions tu et al 2006 the doc in lw wetlands increased with salinity fig 7 d because enhanced salinity can increase the solubility of organic matter since na organic linkages would enhance clay dispersion and mobilization sumner et al 1998 previous studies also showed that doc contents increased with salinity in tidal freshwater wetland soils mavi et al 2012b wang et al 2017 however the reason why the relationships between doc and salinity in mw and hw wetlands were not significant p 0 05 was that doc is a very active fraction in som and is sensitive to many environmental factors yang et al 2018 doc contents in these sampling sites with different groundwater tables generally showed an increasing before decreasing tendency with increasing soil salinities when all data were put together doc contents increased firstly with increasing salinities at lower salinity ranges due to cation exchange and or changes in water inundation mavi et al 2012b wang et al 2017 however the increasing salinity decreased the desorption capacity of tidal wetland soils sediments at higher salinity ranges because the ionic strength is higher in seawater than that in soil sediment yang et al 2018 the doc reached the maximum at salinity level of 1 8 ppt and mbc accordingly reached the maximal value at the salinity level of 2 0 ppt indicating that soil microbial activities and soil fertility in estuarine wetland soils with salinity between 1 8 and 2 0 ppt were relatively high which was conducive to plant growth additionally the significant relationships between doc wc salinity and soil ph p 0 01 implied that wc and salinity might affect the adsorption and desorption of doc by impacting soil ph values 5 conclusions the results showed that the profile distributions of soil labile organic carbon in the sampling sites with different land covers under different groundwater tables were complicated and inconsistent meanwhile soil organic carbon contents of estuarine wetlands exhibited an interannual change so that it is necessary to show the multi year average organic carbon level instead of a certain year s level when estimating soil carbon contents in estuarine wetlands the effects of salt and moisture changes on soil labile organic carbon were different in investigating three wetlands with different groundwater tables soil mbc level in lw wetlands was the lowest when the soil wc was 25 and then increased with increasing wc and doc showed an increase with increasing wc the mbc and doc contents in mw and hw wetlands decreased with increasing wc mbc showed a decrease first and then a sequential increase with increasing salinities in three wetlands comparatively doc in three wetlands totally exhibited an increase fist and a sequential decrease with increasing salinities soil microbes had relatively high activities in estuarine wetlands at the salinity range of 1 8 2 0 ppt the findings of this study

1044,changes in labile organic carbon in wetland soils as indicators of soil quality and climate change have received many attention worldwide soil samples were collected in 2012 and 2013 in estuarine wetlands with different groundwater tables in the yellow river delta and soil salinity water content wc microbial biomass carbon mbc and dissolved organic carbon doc were determined to investigate the effects of water and salinity on labile organic carbon in wetland soils our results showed that the response of labile organic carbon to salt and water conditions varied varied in soil samples with different groundwater tables the mbc in soils with low groundwater tables lw was the lowest when soil wc was 25 and then exhibited an increase with increasing wc the doc in lw soils has increased and mbc and doc contents in soils with middle groundwater tables mw and high groundwater tables hw has decreased with increasing wc mbc in three wetlands presented a decreasing before increasing tendency with increasing salinity whereas doc showed an increasing before decreasing tendency soil microbial biomass and soil fertility in estuarine wetlands with salinity between 1 8 and 2 0 ppt were relatively high which was conducive to plant growth the findings of this study provide a better understanding of the relationships between soil labile organic carbon and water and salt conditions as also deliver basic data for carbon sequestration and blue carbon management in estuarine wetlands keywords microbial biomass carbon dissolved organic carbon water and soil salt conditions vertical profile distributions estuarine wetlands 1 introduction estuarine wetlands accounting for 3 4 of the global wetland area play a critical role in supporting biodiversity conservation providing a habitat for wildlife and protecting coastal water quality yang et al 2018 estuarine wetlands also serve as important blue carbon ecosystems due to their sufficient capacity of carbon sequestration 250 500 g c m 2 year 1 which plays key role in global climate change and carbon cycling yang et al 2018 the reduced carbon storage or the vegetation biomass in estuarine wetlands will lead to an increase in carbon emission thus exacerbating global warming osland et al 2018 a previous study has demonstrated that the changes in soil carbon mainly occurred in labile organic carbon xi et al 2018 although the proportion of labile organic carbon in total carbon is generally very low it is of great significance to influence greenhouse gas emissions and reflect the availability of soil carbon which is frequently used to assess the soil quality huo et al 2017 soil labile organic carbon refers to the part of organic carbon in soil that was fast moving unstable easily oxidized and easily mineralizable xi et al 2018 soil microbial biomass carbon mbc and dissolved organic carbon doc are two important indicators of soil labile organic carbon pool huo et al 2017 wickland et al 2018 mbc presents the carbon in the living soil microorganism whose volume is 5 103 µm3 which plays a fundamental role in soil organic carbon dynamics and is often regarded as a useful indicator for the changes in soil carbon stabilization and nutrient dynamics liu et al 2016 doc is the organic carbon extracted using water or diluted salt solution and can pass through 0 45 µm filter which is more important for biogeochemical processes and the ecosystem function in particular soil processes involving labile organic carbon may strongly control the carbon source sink functions of estuarine wetland ecosystems jones and willett 2006 said pullicino et al 2016 soil mbc and doc have become research hotspots in wetland ecosystems since they can reflect and affect mineral weathering soil formation process the growth and activity of microorganisms and the transformation and decomposition of soil organic matter som tu et al 2006 xi et al 2018 labile organic carbon density including mbc density mbcd and doc density docd means soil labile organic carbon content per unit area which is significant to evaluate the total labile organic carbon level in estuarine wetlands zhao et al 2018 soil salinity and moisture determine the spatial distribution characteristics of different land cover types and soil properties to some extent which drives the changes in soil labile organic carbon huo et al 2017 wang et al 2017 yang et al 2018 meanwhile salinity and moisture are important factors impacting microbial community structures and activities by influencing osmotic stress toxic ions contents and diffusion of oxygen mavi et al 2012a yan et al 2015 wang et al 2019 previous study has reported that soil salinity and moisture can vary both in time and space yan et al 2015 moreover the global sea level rise might subsequently increase the frequency of seawater intrusion farther into historically low and medium salinity estuarine zones which would further affect soil labile organic carbon levels in estuarine wetlands yang et al 2018 therefore it is very significant to evaluate the effects of soil salinity and water on soil labile organic carbon in estuarine wetlands for studying global carbon cycling profile distributions of labile organic carbon in estuarine wetlands with different hydrological conditions were not consistent and were greatly affected by soil moisture and salinity li et al 2018 steinmuller et al 2019 found that mbc and doc in coastal wetland soils of barataria bay la usa fluctuated at the top 50 cm soil and accumulated at the 60 70 cm soil depth which were significantly positively correlated with soil moisture the yellow river delta is located in the south coast of bohai bay and the west coast of laizhou bay 37 20 38 11 n 118 21 119 20 e which is the most complete and largest newly formed estuarine wetlands in the warm temperate zone in china wang et al 2016 in this study we analyzed soil mbc and doc distributions in estuarine wetlands with different water tables and salinities of the yellow river delta the primary objectives of this work were 1 to investigate profile distributions of soil labile organic carbon in three types of wetlands with different water levels and salinities and different plant covers 2 to identify the changes in soil mbc and doc contents with increasing soil salinity and water contents in estuarine wetlands and 3 to reveal the relationships between soil mbc and doc and selected other properties in these estuarine wetlands 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area lies in the yellow river delta national nature reserve shandong province of china where the vegetation is dominated by phragmites australis tamarix chinensis and suaeda salsa etc zhao et al 2017 it has a sub humid warm temperate and continental monsoon climate chen et al 2016 the annual mean air temperature in this region is 12 21 c and 13 57 c in 2012 and 2013 respectively the annual mean precipitation is 305 34 mm and 587 85 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively in which approximately 50 of the rainfall is concentrated in summer bai et al 2012 hoerling et al 2013 the annual mean evaporation in this area is as high as 1962 mm especially in spring bai et al 2015 there is a high soil salt content and plant salt content and their salt tolerance decrease with increasing distances from the sea to the land weng et al 2008 as typical estuarine wetlands the study area is most typically affected by the freshwater of the yellow river and the tidal saltwater there are large areas of salt marshes affected by the tides freshwater wetlands mainly affected by the yellow river and brackish wetlands interacted with freshwater and saltwater wang et al 2016 therefore we chose three types of estuarine wetlands i e freshwater wetlands brackish wetlands and salt marshes as the sampling plots to investigate the changes of soil labile organic carbon in estuarine wetlands of the yellow river delta the location of the study area is shown in fig 1 the freshwater wetlands are located on the north bank of the yellow river and are mainly affected by the freshwater of the river they are also affected by the flow sediment regulation of xiaolangdi reservoir from mid june to early july and the water table varies from 168 cm to 112 cm which are defined as wetlands with low groundwater tables lw the brackish wetlands on near the south bank of the yellow river which is influenced by both freshwater and tidal floods with the water table varying from 120 cm to 82 cm the brackish wetlands are also defined as wetlands with middle groundwater tables mw the salt marshes are in the offshore locations affected by tidal cycles which is defined as wetlands with high groundwater tables hw ranging from 3 cm to 0 cm three land covers in each sampling plot were selected including bare land bl suaeda salsa ss and phragmites australis pa because ss and pa are the predominant plant species in the study area both ss and pa can effectively provide habitats for birds and other speices and participate in the biogeochemical cycles of nutrient elements which has different effects on soil carbon content jia et al 2018 soil water content wc increased significantly from lw to hw while soil salinity increased significantly from lw to hw fig 2 2 2 water table measurement the groundwater table of each sampling site including bl lw ss lw pa lw bl mw ss mw pa mw bl hw ss hw and pa hw was measured by groundwater wells monthly during the growing seasons in 2012 and 2013 a bell shaped metal body attached to a rope was extended to the position of the water in the groundwater well where the length of the rope was the water table 2 3 sample collection and analysis plant litters and stones on the soil surface were removed and soil profiles were excavated to a depth of 50 cm in the selected wetlands including bl lw ss lw pa lw bl mw ss mw pa mw bl hw ss hw and pa hw of the yellow river delta in may 2012 and may 2013 respectively soils were collected at intervals of 10 cm in soil profiles three replicate samples were collected from each layer of each soil profile a total of 270 soil samples were obtained in order to avoid contamination soil samples were collected from bottom to top along soil profiles and then the soil samples were quickly placed in zip lock polyethylene bags and taken back to the laboratory one part of the soil samples was stored at 4 c for the determination of soil mbc and microbial biomass nitrogen mbn and doc the remaining samples were air dried and passed through a 2 mm sieve for the determination of soil ph and salinity the sieved soil samples were further ground to pass through a 0 15 mm sieve for the determination of soil organic carbon soc and total nitrogen tn meanwhile another three soil cores 100 cm3 in each sampling site were collected using cutting rings for the determination of soil wc and bulk density bd donald 1987 soil ph and salinity were measured w v in a 1 5 solution of soil water using a ph meter hach company loveland co usa and an salinity meter mettler toledo usa respectively tn were determined on a chnos elemental analyzer vario el german soc was determined using dichromate oxidation nelson and sommers 1982 mbc and mbn were measured by the chloroform fumigation extraction method vance et al 1987 doc was estimated as described as kalbitz et al 2003 i e ultrapure water was added to the soil and then the solutions were filtered through 0 2 µm membrane filters to remove microorganisms total organic carbon toc analyzer l cpn japan was used to determine doc concentration in the filtrate mbcd and docd of each laye at each sampling site was calculated as follows 1 mbcd mbc bd h 2 docd doc bd h where mbcd and docd are the soil mbc density kg c m2 and doc density kg c m2 respectively mbc and doc are the microbial biomass carbon content mg kg and dissolved organic carbon content mg kg bd is the soil bulk density g cm3 and h is the thickness of the soil layer cm the mbc mbn was the ratio of mbc and mbn and calculated as molar ratio the microbial quotient qmb was the ratio of mbc and soc the c n ratio was the ratio of soc and tn and calculated as the molar ratio 2 4 statistical analysis one way anova analysis was performed by spss 16 0 software package to identify the significance in soil mbc mbcd doc docd and soil wc and salinity among different wetlands or different soil layers regression analysis was carried out by origin 9 2 software package to reveal the relationships between soil labile organic carbon and wc and between soil labile organic carbon and salinity principal component analysis pca was conducted by canoco 5 0 to identify the relationships among soil labile organic carbon and environmental variables

decreasing before increasing tendency with increasing salinities in lw p 0 01 mw p 0 05 and hw p 0 01 wetlands fig 7 b generally the distributions of mbc contents in the top 50 cm soils in three types of wetlands in the two years showed a w shape with increasing salinities p 0 01 i e mbc content reached the minimal values at the salinity levels of 0 9 and 2 9 ppt and reached the maximal value at the salinity level of 2 0 ppt p 0 01 the relationships between doc and wc in the top 50 cm soils of lw and mw wetlands in the top 50 cm in the two years showed a highly statistically significantly positive correlation and negative correlation respectively p 0 01 fig 7 c however there were no significant correlations between doc and wc in hw wetlands in the two years p 0 05 the relationships between doc and salinity in the top 50 cm soils of lw wetlands showed a highly statistically significant positive correlation p 0 01 while no significant relationships between doc and salinity were observed in mw and hw wetlands in the two years p 0 05 fig 7 d however doc contents in the top 50 cm soils of three wetlands in the top 50 cm soils in the two years presented an increasing before decreasing curve with increasing salinities in the two years doc reached the maximum at the salinity level of 1 8 ppt p 0 01 3 3 principal component analysis and correlation analysis pca analysis results of soil labile organic carbon and environmental variables showed that 95 7 of the variance could be explained by the first two axes and their eigenvalues were 0 899 and 0 058 respectively fig 8 the first pca axis was mainly positively correlated with soil mbc and c n ratio the second pca axis was mainly positively correlated with soil mbn ph wc and salinity and negatively correlated with soil doc bd and c n ratio as shown in fig 8 the distributions of sampling sites under different groundwater tables could not be clearly distinguished while the soil carbon and environmental variables in 2012 and 2013 were different as a whole and could be clearly separated between the two years the correlation analysis showed that wc was significantly positively correlated with soil salinity p 0 01 ph p 0 01 soc p 0 05 and mbn p 0 01 and was significantly negatively correlated with soil bd p 0 01 docd p 0 05 qmb p 0 01 mbc mbn p 0 01 and c n p 0 01 fig 9 salinity had a significantly positive correlation with soil ph p 0 01 soc p 0 01 mbc and mbcd p 0 05 mbn p 0 01 and a negative correlation with mbc mbn ratios p 0 01 additionally soil ph was significantly correlated with doc p 0 01 and the doc contents decreased with increasing soil ph values soil ph was also significantly positively correlated with mbn p 0 01 and negatively correlated with mbc mbn ratios p 0 01 soc mbc and mbcd had a positive correlation with each other p 0 01 doc was significantly positively correlated with docd p 0 01 doc docd mbc mbcd and qmb showed positive correlations with c n ratios p 0 01 4 discussion 4 1 distribution patterns of soil labile organic carbon soil mbc is considered to be an important and labile fraction of som involving in energy and nutrient cycling ebhin masto et al 2006 in this study mbc and mbcd basically presented an increasing trend with depth along bl soil profiles except for bl mw and bl hw in 2013 as a result of the absence of vegetation cover in bl soc mainly came from the river tidal floods and sediments brought by river and tidal cycles zhang et al 2007 delaune and white 2012 and mueller et al 2016 demonstrated that sea level rise promoted the deposition of suspended matter and peat accumulation which are not conducive to the decomposition of som meanwhile affected by the fluctuation of the water table the elevated water table might slow down the degradation rate of som and improve the storage capacity of carbon so soil organic carbon content in deep soils was higher kettridge et al 2015 accordingly organic matter in surface soils was low due to no plant litter inputs which couldn t provide a favorable living environment for microorganisms li et al 2019 soil mbc in deep soils was higher than those in surface soils which was affected by som levels rath and rousk 2015 however the profile distribution patterns of doc and docd in bl were not consistent with those of mbc and mbcd the main reason was that doc the more mobile and bioavailable fraction of organic carbon in soil mainly comes from plant litters the secretion of roots and soil animals and soil microbial metabolism products which is affected by many factors such as tidal cycle upstream input and vegetation cover fellman et al 2008 shahzad et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 among the sampling sites covered by vegetation mbc and mbcd were relatively high in surface soils of ss lw in 2012 and 2013 ss hw in 2013 pa hw in 2013 and pa lw in 2013 the similar profile distribution patterns of doc and docd in ss hw soils in 2012 were observed the labile organic carbon contents of the soils covered vegetation could be affected by the organic matter from plant litters and root exudates brown et al 2000 an adequate carbon source and a more favorable living environment for microbial growth and proliferation were formed due to plants liang et al 2017 in addition the depth distribution characteristics of soil labile organic carbon in mw and hw wetlands were different from lw wetlands because mw and hw wetlands were more affected by tidal cycles and water table fluctuations tidal floods could bring a large amount of suspended matter and the larger tidal flow at ebb tides might also carry plant litters away leading to lower contents of organic carbon and labile organic carbon in surface soils burd et al 2016 e g the mbc and mbcd in ss mw soils and doc and docd in pa hw soils at the middle soil depths showed relatively high levels moreover plant root growth also affected the depth distributions of the labile organic carbon jobbágy and jackson 2000 previous studies suggested that the accretion of estuarine wetlands highly depends on the accumulation of organic matter rather than minerals and that the accumulation of som is mainly controlled by the growth of roots rather than the production of aboveground biomass or tidal input nyman et al 2006 generally estuarine wetlands can be affected by a variety of environmental factors such as vegetation growth microbial activity tidal and runoff changes rainfall jobbágy and jackson 2000 labile organic carbon in soil profiles of estuarine wetlands is mobile and susceptible to change under the effects of environmental factors therefore the profile distribution patterns of soil labile organic carbon in sampling sites with different land cover under different water tables were complicated and inconsistent mbcd in the top 50 cm soil in sampling sites covered by plants ss and pa was basically higher than that in bl soils in estuarine wetlands with different groundwater tables plants can provide an adequate carbon source and a more suitable environment for microorganisms through litters and root secretions liang et al 2017 however there were no consistent characteristics of docd in the top 50 cm soil in these sampling sites with different land covers docd in the top 50 cm soil varied greatly from 2012 to 2013 which was related to the instability of doc itself fellman et al 2008 the pca results showed that the distributions of sampling sites under different groundwater tables could not be clearly distinguished indicating that a small difference in soil properties and organic carbon contents between them however soil properties and organic carbon contents in 2012 and 2013 were different and could be clearly distinguished between the two years the average mean precipitation is 305 34 mm and 587 85 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively so that the climate conditions in 2012 were drier than those in 2013 bai et al 2012 hoerling et al 2013 it had a great impact on soil physical and chemical properties of estuarine wetlands and most directly reflected in the change in soil wc mckee et al 2004 less precipitation in 2012 limited plant productivity and appeared to constrain som accumulation osland et al 2018 leading to lower soc in 2013 compared with 2012 accordingly soil labile organic carbon in 2012 was higher than that in 2013 therefore the effects of interannual climate change on soil properties and organic carbon contents in estuarine wetlands were more obvious than the effects of different water tables in the same year in addition our results also indicated that soil element contents in a certain year cannot represent their long term average level in the area when conducting environmental monitoring 4 2 effects of water and salt change on soil labile organic carbon the mbc contents in mw and hw soils decreased with increasing wc p 0 05 and p 0 01 fig 7 a previous studies also showed a negative correlation between mbc and soil moisture huo et al 2017 ross 1987 the reason for the results was mainly that the elevated soil wc resulted in a limited o2 diffusion which would limit the metabolism of aerobic microorganisms yan et al 2015 wang et al 2019 therefore soil mbc contents were relatively decreased like soil mbc the doc contents in mw and hw also showed a decrease with increasing wc p 0 01 and p 0 05 fig 7 c doc is believed to be derived from plant roots litters soil humic substances and metabolic products of soil animals and microorganisms van hees et al 2005 huo et al 2017 presented that doc was highly correlated with mbc the changes in soil mbc and doc with increasing wc in mw and hw wetlands indicated that a continuous increase in soil wc would reduce soil fertility however the lowest mbc content in lw wetlands was observed when soil wc was 25 and then increased with increasing wc fig 7 a microbial activities highly depend on soil moisture since related enzymes are produced by microorganisms and organic matter transport in soil also needs the liquid phase huo et al 2017 soil moisture was the main limiting factor for the variations in doc contents and the positive correlation between doc and soil moisture was reported in previous studies kalbitz et al 2000 sugihara et al 2010 in this study we also observed the significantly positive correlation between doc and wc in lw wetlands p 0 01 fig 7 c soil mbc mbn ratio is often used to reflect the structure of microbial communities bacteria dominated in soil microbial communities when soil mbc mbn ratio was 3 5 while fungus dominated in soil microbial communities when soil mbc mbn ratio was 4 15 raiesi and kabiri 2016 qmb a parameter calculated by the percentage of the contents of mbc and soc is one of the important indexes to evaluate the activity of soc the soc was accumulated when the qmb was high on the contrary the soc was released when the qmb decreased zheng et al 2018 the c n ratio is a good indicator and useful tool for measuring the degree of decomposition and the quality of som higher c n ratios could contribute to the accumulation of soil organic carbon because som decomposition would be limited by nitrogen availability wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 in this study soil wc showed a close relationship with soc p 0 05 mbn p 0 01 mbc mbn p 0 01 qmb p 0 01 c n p 0 01 soil bd p 0 01 salinity p 0 01 and ph p 0 01 indicating that soil wc could affect the accumulation and release of soc as well as the structure of microbial community and change the growth of microorganism by changing other soil environmental factors however an increase in soc and a decrease in labile organic carbon with increasing wc in mw and hw wetlands implied that the increasing wc is beneficial to the accumulation of soc keiluweit et al 2016 stanford and epstein 1974 however this contradicted the results that soil wc was negatively correlated with qmb p 0 01 and c n p 0 01 which might be caused by many environmental factors such as soil salinity and nitrogen pool morrissey et al 2014 the increasing salinity would cause a decrease before an increase in mbc contents in three types of wetlands with different groundwater tables fig 7 b a higher soil salinity might lead to non salt adapted microbial species to experience osmotic stress interruptions in cellular function and cell lysis yan et al 2015 yang et al 2018 thus mbc levels would decrease with increasing salinities when initial soil salinity level is low however the tolerance threshold of microorganisms to salinity were different in sampling sites under different water tables because osmotic potential could be affected by both salinity and soil water content yan et al 2015 the apparent differential sensitivity of microorganisms to salinity in sampling sites under different groundwater tables can be explained by their different wc and osmotic potentials at the same salinity level mavi et al 2012a low soil wc in lw wetlands limited the tolerance threshold of cells to salinity which decreased mbc content when soil salinity was at the range from 0 5 ppt to 0 9 ppt on the contrary an increase in soil moisture alleviated the salinity stress on cells and increased the salt tolerance threshold of microorganisms we observed that mbc decreased when soil salinity varied from 2 0 ppt to 2 7 ppt in hw wetlands however mbc contents in all sampling sites showed an increasing trend when soil salinity increased continuously the possible reason was that the different structures of microbial communities in different soils with various salinities and many halotolerant microorganisms suitable for survival in the high salinity soils could counteract osmotic stress by synthesizing osmolytes yan et al 2015 additionally the negative correlation between salinity and mbc mbn ratio p 0 01 might be associated with the fact that fungi tends to be more sensitive to salt stress than bacteria yan et al 2015 generally the higher mbc in low and high salinity soils implied the faster degradation and turnover rate of som in estuarine wetlands under low or high salt conditions tu et al 2006 the doc in lw wetlands increased with salinity fig 7 d because enhanced salinity can increase the solubility of organic matter since na organic linkages would enhance clay dispersion and mobilization sumner et al 1998 previous studies also showed that doc contents increased with salinity in tidal freshwater wetland soils mavi et al 2012b wang et al 2017 however the reason why the relationships between doc and salinity in mw and hw wetlands were not significant p 0 05 was that doc is a very active fraction in som and is sensitive to many environmental factors yang et al 2018 doc contents in these sampling sites with different groundwater tables generally showed an increasing before decreasing tendency with increasing soil salinities when all data were put together doc contents increased firstly with increasing salinities at lower salinity ranges due to cation exchange and or changes in water inundation mavi et al 2012b wang et al 2017 however the increasing salinity decreased the desorption capacity of tidal wetland soils sediments at higher salinity ranges because the ionic strength is higher in seawater than that in soil sediment yang et al 2018 the doc reached the maximum at salinity level of 1 8 ppt and mbc accordingly reached the maximal value at the salinity level of 2 0 ppt indicating that soil microbial activities and soil fertility in estuarine wetland soils with salinity between 1 8 and 2 0 ppt were relatively high which was conducive to plant growth additionally the significant relationships between doc wc salinity and soil ph p 0 01 implied that wc and salinity might affect the adsorption and desorption of doc by impacting soil ph values 5 conclusions the results showed that the profile distributions of soil labile organic carbon in the sampling sites with different land covers under different groundwater tables were complicated and inconsistent meanwhile soil organic carbon contents of estuarine wetlands exhibited an interannual change so that it is necessary to show the multi year average organic carbon level instead of a certain year s level when estimating soil carbon contents in estuarine wetlands the effects of salt and moisture changes on soil labile organic carbon were different in investigating three wetlands with different groundwater tables soil mbc level in lw wetlands was the lowest when the soil wc was 25 and then increased with increasing wc and doc showed an increase with increasing wc the mbc and doc contents in mw and hw wetlands decreased with increasing wc mbc showed a decrease first and then a sequential increase with increasing salinities in three wetlands comparatively doc in three wetlands totally exhibited an increase fist and a sequential decrease with increasing salinities soil microbes had relatively high activities in estuarine wetlands at the salinity range of 1 8 2 0 ppt the findings of this study
