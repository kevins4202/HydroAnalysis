23920,with increased computing power the horizontal grid spacing of regional ocean models is decreasing to the point where they can directly simulate lee waves although oceanic lee waves can be inherently nonhydrostatic such as in the abyssal ocean or in the gulf stream regional ocean models are frequently run in hydrostatic mode to avoid the computational expense of solving the nonhydrostatic pressure however the effects of the nonhydrostatic pressure and the numerical error on the accuracy of the simulated lee waves is not immediately obvious to quantify these effects this paper presents hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic simulations of an idealized lee wave over both linear and nonlinear height and varying length bathymetry utilizing a range of horizontal grid spacings we present an analysis of the numerical error arising from the discrete linear stratified euler equations to identify the numerically induced physics in lee wave simulations as expected for the second order accurate model the numerical error in the lee wave drag decreases quadratically with respect to horizontal grid refinement although the error arises from two primary sources the first is related to discretization of the kinematic bottom boundary condition which acts to decrease the lee wave drag the second is related to discretization of the nonhydrostatic pressure which acts to increase the drag together the results offer a regional ocean modeler several cautionary notes for calculating and interpreting properties of simulated lee waves namely that a hydrostatic model can produce the correct form drag due simply to numerical error and attempting to employ a nonhydrostatic model to correct for this error can require prohibitively fine grid resolution keywords form drag ocean modeling lee waves nonhydrostatic effects grid resolution requirements internal waves 1 introduction simulating certain types of internal gravity waves remains computationally challenging for ocean models chief among these perennially vexing oscillatory signals at least in terms of potential abundance is the lee wave which occurs wherever a steady current with stable stratification interacts with bathymetry the generation of a lee wave causes drag on the background flow hereafter referred to as lee wave drag which is hypothesized to significantly affect the fate of momentum and energy in the ocean legg 2020 nikurashin and ferrari 2011 trossman et al 2016 for global ocean models with o 10 km or coarser resolution lee waves are a subgrid scale phenomenon that must be parameterized regional ocean simulations however are capable of resolving lee waves in both the coastal and abyssal ocean caulfield et al 2019 recent examples include nikurashin et al 2014 zheng and nikurashin 2019 klymak 2018 gula et al 2018 and marez et al 2020 often these studies employ hydrostatic simulations to avoid the computational expense of solving the 3 d elliptic equation for the nonhydrostatic pressure for lee waves the hydrostatic model is appropriate when the horizontal length scale of the bathymetry l h i l l is much longer than the wavelength of the lee wave λ l e e which in typical oceanic conditions is λ l e e o 1 km as demonstrated by linear theory however when the length of the bathymetry narrows to the same order as the lee wavelength the nonhydrostatic pressure reduces the magnitude of the pressure anomaly in the lee wave and attenuates the drag therefore simulations over nonhydrostatic bathymetry that neglect this nonhydrostatic effect risk over predicting the lee wave drag resolving a lee wave often requires the dual constraints of both a fine enough horizontal grid spacing to capture the horizontal gradients in the lee wave as well as the expensive computation of the nonhydrostatic pressure dimensional analysis suggests that both of these requirements should be directly related to the length scale of the bathymetry this paper thus presents a set of hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic simulations of an idealized lee wave over sinusoidal bathymetries of hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic length scale with a range of horizontal grid spacing l h i l l 100 δ x l h i l l 4 the simulations offer a quantitative diagnosis of the resolution requirement and the importance of the nonhydrostatic effect over various length bathymetry additionally this paper presents an analytical evaluation of the discrete lee wave equations and identifies how the truncation error affects the physical system lastly this paper offers a brief comparison of hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic lee wave simulations over nonlinear height bathymetry to demonstrate that the lessons learned in the linear regime apply also in the nonlinear regime this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce an idealized lee wave and derive a dimensionless form of the lee wave drag predicted by linear theory in section 3 we describe our simulations and analyze a set of high resolution simulations in section 4 we present a derivation of the modified equivalent lee wave drag from the discrete pdes and compare it to the drag observed in our simulations in section 5 we offer a brief analysis of nonlinear lee wave simulations finally in section 6 we conclude with suggestions for grid resolutions needed to resolve hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic lee waves 2 linear lee wave theory and parameter space 2 1 dimensional analysis an idealized lee wave can be generated by a flow with constant background horizontal velocity u and buoyancy frequency n 2 g ρ 0 ρ z over a sinusoidal bathymetry of height h 0 and length l h i l l 2 π k see fig 1 sinusoidal bathymetry is chosen in part for the simplicity that it offers the analysis but it also serves as a reasonable approximation of a ubiquitous small scale bathymetric feature of the ocean floor the abyssal hills goff and arbic 2010 abyssal hills are strongly anisotropic appearing as an expanse of periodic ridges aligned with the mid ocean ridges where they are formed locally their amplitudes are focused at dominant wavelengths such that they are similar to a sinusoid rotation is neglected under the assumption of large rossby number u k f 1 where f is the coriolis frequency in the presence of rotation this assumption fails first for the longer more hydrostatic hill lengths for the most hydrostatic hill length considered in this study this assumption is equivalent to n f o 100 see fig 8 10 in gill 1982 which using a typical oceanic buoyancy scale n o 0 001 s 1 is valid at latitudes smaller than approximately 15 steady lee wave theory demonstrates that as u k approaches the rate of f rotation changes the lee wave wavelength slows the vertically propagating wave front and diminishes the form drag gill 1982 for u k f propagating lee waves cannot exist and the steady state drag vanishes though the rotationally evanescent lee wave response may still entail significant drag klymak 2018 thus rotation is likely an important element of most oceanic lee waves however as the goal of this paper is to identify numerical considerations when resolving nonhydrostatic effects in lee waves the analytical clarity gained by ignoring rotation outweighs the potential cost in realism we also assume that the depth of the domain d is irrelevant i e that the ratio of the current to the first mode internal gravity wave speed satisfies u n d 1 in the deep ocean where d 4 km and typical abyssal values of velocity and buoyancy give u n 100 m the assumption of infinite depth is very reasonable in coastal regions where d 1 km reflections of the lee wave from the surface or pycnocline might become important khatiwala 2003 with these assumptions the idealized lee wave is characterized by the dimensional quantities u n h 0 and k choosing u and n to nondimensionalize h 0 and k the governing nondimensional parameters are j n h 0 u and ϵ u k n j is a froude number indicating a ratio of perturbation advection speed within the wave to its group velocity and serves as a measurement of the nonlinearity of the lee wave mayer and fringer 2017 in this study we focus the numerical analysis on linear height bathymetry implying j 1 however the results are applicable for all subcritical lee waves j 1 where the nonlinear effects on the lee wave drag are small nikurashin and ferrari 2010 the results are also applicable to nonlinear height bathymetry with j o 1 as demonstrated in section 5 we note that although much of the lee wave literature focuses on supercritical height bathymetry there are many abyssal hill regions with subcritical heights see fig 9 in nikurashin et al 2014 we will refer to the second nondimensional number ϵ u k n as the nonhydrostatic parameter since it informs the degree of nonhydrostatic effects in the lee wave u k may be interpreted as the frequency of the bathymetric forcing on the flow implying that ϵ is the ratio of this forcing rate to the buoyant response rate of the fluid n equivalently one can view ϵ as a ratio of the wavelength of the lee wave λ l e e 2 π u n to the wavelength of the hill l h i l l 2 π k if the hill is very long such that λ l e e l h i l l then ϵ 1 and the wave is hydrostatic gill 1982 however in their study of the global energy flux into lee waves nikurashin and ferrari 2011 report that upon weighting by the energy flux the average horizontal and vertical wavelength of oceanic lee waves are 2 5 km and 700 m respectively which implies u n 107 m see eq 20 and ϵ 0 27 although not strongly nonhydrostatic this value of ϵ still entails qualitative and quantitative differences between hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic simulations as demonstrated in this paper seen as a ratio of frequencies ϵ is analogous to ω n for internal tides where ω is the tidal frequency and the hydrostatic regime is defined by ω n for internal tides ω n relates directly to the angle of the tidal beam such that as the tidal frequency approaches the buoyancy frequency the beam steepens toward the vertical internal tide simulations run in hydrostatic mode when ω o n will under predict this beam steepening vitousek and fringer 2014 an analogous relationship exists between ϵ and the angle of the group velocity vector in a lee wave as shown in fig 1 and discussed below as a final comment on ϵ note the potentially counter intuitive scaling of the horizontal length by k rather than l h i l l this choice results from recognizing that the quantity δ u n is the inverse of the lee wave wavenumber n u while the lee wave wavelength is λ l e e 2 π u n if one were to use l h i l l to scale the horizontal one could use λ l e e to arrive at the same expression for the nonhydrostatic parameter 1 ϵ λ l e e l h i l l 2 π u n l h i l l u k n it would not be correct however to form a nonhydrostatic parameter as δ l h i l l u n l h i l l because as we show below this choice obscures by a factor of 2 π the distinction between the propagating and evanescent regime given by ϵ 1 although it is still true that a flow is hydrostatic when u n l h i l l 1 baines 1995 omitting the factor of 2 π has resulted in some studies assuming nearly hydrostatic bathymetry ϵ o 0 1 when it is in fact strongly nonhydrostatic ϵ o 1 e g zheng et al 2012 gula et al 2018 marez et al 2020 as we demonstrate below this can result in over predictions of the lee wave drag our quantity of interest in this paper is the form drag associated with a lee wave f which is the drag in units of force per unit length into the page shown in fig 1 since a scale for f in terms of ρ 0 u and n is ρ 0 u 3 n 1 the nondimensional form drag must satisfy 2 f ρ 0 u 3 n 1 f j ϵ 2 2 nondimensional equations we separate the flow into its external and internal quantities such that u total u e x u ρ total ρ z ρ and p total ρ 0 p z ρ 0 p under these definitions the governing steady euler equations after employing the boussinesq approximation are given by 3 u u x u u p x 4 u w x u w p z ρ ρ 0 g 5 u ρ x u ρ ρ 0 n 2 g w where e x x e z z n 2 g ρ 0 ρ z subject to continuity u 0 and the kinematic boundary condition at z h x 6 u h x u h x w where h x is the topography as a deviation from a flat bottom and has a maximum crest to trough amplitude of h 0 the equations are nondimensionalized using the inner variable scales defined by 7 u w ρ p h x z u o u w 0 w r ρ p p h 0 h k 1 x δ z where dimensionless quantities are indicated with the using these scales mayer and fringer 2017 show that the problem is uniquely characterized by ϵ u k n and j n h 0 u with the relevant inner scales nondimensionalized by n and u 8 u 0 u w 0 u g r ρ 0 u n p u 2 n h 0 u n k 1 u n δ u j ϵ j j j j ϵ 1 1 and governing nondimensional equations 9 u x j u u p x 10 ϵ 2 w x j u w p z ρ 11 ρ x

governing nondimensional equations the equations are linearized by taking the j 0 limit giving 13 u x p x 14 ϵ 2 w x p z ρ 15 ρ x w combining with u 0 one can rearrange these equations into a governing equation for w 16 2 w z 2 ϵ 2 2 w x 2 w 0 which is subject to the linearized bottom boundary condition 17 w x 0 h x by linear superposition any shape bathymetry can be decomposed into a sum of sinusoids with different wavelengths bell 1975 our interest is therefore in the solution for one such sinusoidal bathymetry and we define a simple nondimensional height function as 18 h x 1 2 sin x such that the nondimensional trough to crest height is unity when ϵ 1 the solution to eq 16 that satisfies the sinusoidal bottom boundary condition is of the form w x z cos x m z which implies that the nondimensional vertical wavenumber 19 m 1 ϵ 2 1 2 dimensionalizing m with δ 1 eq 8 this results in a constant propagating lee wave wavenumber eq 6 8 6 in gill 1982 20 k l e e m 2 k 2 1 2 n u and lee wave wavelength 21 λ l e e 2 π k l e e 1 2 π u n note that upon shifting to the frame of reference moving with the water eqs 20 and 21 follow directly from the general dispersion relation for internal gravity waves in a continuous stratification ω n k k 2 m 2 1 2 where the sinusoidal bathymetry propagating to the left at speed u acts as a forcing frequency ω u k pedlosky 2003 in this reference frame the group velocity vector has magnitude u 2 n m u 1 ϵ 2 1 2 and is perpendicular to the wavenumber vector in accordance with what is expected for internal gravity waves in continuous stratification however this is not the reference frame of most ocean simulations and viewed in the frame of the hill vector addition shows that the group velocity vector of the lee wave has magnitude 22 c g ϵ u and is parallel to the wavenumber vector pointing downstream at an angle θ to the horizontal given by the relation eq 6 8 13 in gill 1982 23 ϵ cos θ see also chapter 10 of pedlosky 2003 this implies that as the wave becomes more nonhydrostatic ϵ 1 the wavenumber vector and the group velocity vector both tilt increasingly downstream θ 0 lines of constant phase are perpendicular to the wavenumber vector and thus make an angle θ to the vertical this means that as in internal tides lines of constant phase point increasingly vertically with increasing nonhydrostasy however unlike internal tides for the lee wave the energy propagates parallel to the wavenumber vector and thus points increasingly horizontally with increasing nonhydrostasy note that this also implies the relation 24 θ tan 1 m k tan 1 1 ϵ 2 1 2 ϵ which is indeed the inverse relation for an internal tide beam angle vitousek and fringer 2014 in the hydrostatic limit k 0 and the vertical wavenumber m asymptotes to the lee wave wavenumber n u thus for hydrostatic simulations where there is a finite k but the model nonetheless enforces the hydrostatic vertical wavenumber m h s n u the observed wavenumber vector will instead satisfy k h s k 2 n 2 u 2 1 2 with a different angle of propagation given by 25 θ h s tan 1 1 ϵ note that this relation is equivalent to the ϵ 1 limit of eq 24 substitution of w x z cos x m z into the governing linear equations gives 26 u x z 1 2 m cos x m z 27 w x z 1 2 cos x m z 28 ρ x z 1 2 sin x m z 29 p x z 1 2 m cos x m z note that in eq 26 and 29 the magnitudes of the horizontal velocity and pressure scale with m 1 ϵ 2 1 2 and are thus only o 1 in the hydrostatic limit this implies that although mayer and fringer 2017 derived eq 9 12 with the scaling u 0 p j u j u 2 a more general first order scaling for u and p is u 0 p j u m j u 2 m the form drag per unit width over one wavelength is given by 30 f n h s 0 2 π k p x z 0 h x d x where we use the sign convention of a positive drag acting to decelerate the flow nondimensionalizing gives 31 f n h s ρ 0 u 3 n 1 j 2 0 2 π p x z 0 h x d x substitution of p and h eqs 18 and 29 then gives assuming ϵ 1 32 f n h s ρ 0 u 3 n 1 π 4 j 2 1 ϵ 2 1 2 which shows that the nondimensional drag on the background current associated with lee waves grows in proportion to j 2 but decreases with increasing ϵ the ϵ dependence is a direct result of the factor m in the nonhydrostatic solution for the pressure anomaly eq 29 despite the canonical status of this idealized lee wave in texts on stratified flows gill 1982 baines 1995 pedlosky 2003 our derivation of the lee wave drag is unique in that the result is given in nondimensional form the momentum lost to the form drag results in a vertical momentum flux f f l u x ρ 0 u w away from the bathymetry nondimensionalizing with ρ 0 u 2 and inserting the propagating solution for u and w eqs 26 and 27 the nondimensional vertical momentum flux has the form 33 f f l u x ρ 0 u 2 1 4 j 2 ϵ m cos 2 x m z f 0 ρ 0 u 2 cos 2 x m z where the scale for the vertical momentum flux is 34 f 0 1 4 ρ 0 u 2 j 2 ϵ m if we define some horizontal surface in x z space that spans a single horizontal wavelength of the bathymetry from 0 2 π k the total momentum flux through this surface is 35 f f l u x 0 2 π k f f l u x d x f 0 k 0 2 π f f l u x d x substitution of eq 33 then gives 36 f f l u x ρ 0 u 3 n 1 1 4 j 2 m 0 2 π c o s 2 x m z d x 37 π 4 j 2 1 ϵ 2 1 2 thus under our assumptions of linear height bathymetry and inviscid flow the flux of momentum through any horizontal plane is equal and opposite to the form drag of the bathymetry on the flow f f l u x f n h s eq 8 8 10 in gill 1982 finally in the hydrostatic limit ϵ 1 the lee wave drag eq 32 asymptotes to 38 f h s ρ 0 u 3 n 1 π 4 j 2 this is the maximum drag that could possibly result from a single lee wave the nonhydrostatic drag is always smaller by a factor of m i e 39 f n h s m f h s 1 ϵ 2 1 2 f h s f h s therefore serves as a scale for drag in what follows note further that because only the trough to crest height factors into the hydrostatic drag eq 38 any shape hill with a height h 0 will produce the same drag in the linear hydrostatic limit indeed even though we derived f h s for a single sinusoidal hill it is equivalent to the hydrostatic non rotating drag given in gill 1982 eq 8 8 20 for flow over an isolated bell shaped mountain although f h s is the largest drag from a single hill it does not produce the largest density of drag given by k f n h s 2 π upon evaluating the derivative of k f n h s 2 π with respect to the bathymetric wavenumber k the largest drag density can be shown to occur for hills with horizontal wavenumber k n u 2 or ϵ 0 7 hence for a given area of ocean floor a field of strongly nonhydrostatic hills can remove more momentum from the flow than would a single hydrostatic hill occupying the same horizontal span when ϵ 1 the solution to eq 16 is now of the form w x z cos x exp m z which implies m ϵ 2 1 1 2 substitution into the governing linear equations gives 40 u x z 1 2 m sin x exp m z 41 w x z 1 2 cos x exp m z 42 ρ x z 1 2 sin x exp m z 43 p x z 1 2 m sin x exp m z since the pairs p h x and u w are now π 2 out of phase in x the momentum flux and the lee wave drag are identically zero giving 44 f n h s ρ 0 u 3 n 1 0 when ϵ 1 therefore the background current is unaffected by steady flow over any small amplitude hill narrower than the lee wave wavelength λ l e e 2 π u n in this regime the vertical wavenumber m now increases with ϵ as a consequence with decreasing hill length p and u grow in magnitude while shrinking in vertical scale to a thin layer above the hills these are intrinsically nonhydrostatic processes and are impossible for hydrostatic simulations to capture note that the bifurcation of the lee wave solution around ϵ 1 depends on the scaling of the horizontal length with k 1 rather than l h i l l if we had instead formed a nonhydrostatic parameter as u n l h i l l as in baines 1995 we would have obscured this separation of regimes by a factor of 2 π this has resulted in some studies mischaracterizing the hydrostasy of lee waves for example gula et al 2018 and marez et al 2020 simulate lee waves in the gulf stream launched by a chain of linear height seamounts with minimum lengths of from 1 to 2 km and background conditions u n 100 m zheng et al 2012 such that the intuitive scaling gives u n l h i l l 0 01 0 05 small values that imply hydrostatic behavior as a result the authors employed a hydrostatic model to save computational resources however scaling with k 1 gives ϵ u k n 0 3 0 6 larger values that based on eq 39 suggest the true lee wave drag could be 5 20 smaller than reported 3 simulations 3 1 model set up we employ two dimensional x z simulations with the nonhydrostatic suntans model fringer et al 2006 because we consider only one dimensional linear height bathymetry and ignore rotation the physics are symmetrical in the span wise direction and there is no difference between two dimensional and three dimensional simulations indeed even with strong rotation and nonlinear height one dimensional bathymetry nikurashin et al 2014 showed there is little difference between two and three dimensional lee wave simulations for our simulations boundary conditions are periodic in the horizontal free slip on the bottom and top and the free surface is a rigid lid all simulations begin at rest with uniform linear stratification such that the buoyancy frequency n 0 002 rad s 1 they are then spun up to a target velocity of u 0 2 m s 1 using the adaptive forcing scheme of nelson and fringer 2017 this scheme nudges the flow with a uniform along stream pressure gradient that is recomputed with each time step to enforce a constant volume averaged horizontal velocity the values of u and n are typical for the abyssal ocean nikurashin and ferrari 2011 klymak 2018 and coastal regions such as the gulf stream zheng et al 2012 and set the characteristic vertical length scale to δ u n 100 m and the wavelength of the lee wave to λ l e e 2 π δ 628 m a primary goal of the simulations is to demonstrate the convergence of the lee wave drag to the linear theory in both hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic modes as such we simulate waves over idealized linear height bathymetry of sinusoidal shape h x 1 2 h 0 sin k x we keep the hill height fixed at h 0 2 m but vary the hill length l h i l l 4 2 1 0 5 km since n and u are fixed these bathymetric values give a linear height hill with j 0 02 and varying degrees of nonhydrostasy with ϵ 0 16 0 32 0 63 1 26 which includes the evanescent regime with one hill satisfying ϵ 1 the bathymetry is represented as a piecewise linear function referred to as cut cells zhang 2017 rather than the discontinuous stair stepping inherent to z grids this avoids both premature separation on the downslope as well as spurious evanescent waves from a stair stepping bottom and has been shown to provide much more accurate simulations of mountain waves adcroft et al 1997 to test convergence we vary the horizontal grid spacing over l h i l l 100 δ x l h i l l 4 or equivalently 0 06 k 1 δ x 1 57 k 1 to assess nonhydrostatic effects the suntans model is run in both hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic modes the vertical resolution is held fixed see below and is chosen to accurately resolve the vertical scale which is given by the vertical wavelength the depth in all simulations is d 7 km which is just over 11 lee wave wavelengths 11 λ l e e 6912 m to avoid reflections from the surface we use linear damping of perturbation horizontal velocity in a sponge layer that extends over the top 5 km of the domain this is enforced with a source term on the right hand side of the horizontal momentum equation of the form s u u τ s where τ s 2 τ 0 1 tanh z z s l s such that the strength of the damping smoothly transitions into the sponge layer beginning at distance above the floor z s 2000 m with a decay length scale of l s 1 2 λ l e e 314 m and a minimum damping timescale of τ 0 4 n 2000 s the vertical discretization employs a constant resolution of δ z 5 m in the bottom 2 km of the domain and then stretching over the remaining 5 km such that at the surface δ z t o p 300 m this is identical to the vertical grid in nikurashin and ferrari 2010 the vertical resolution near the bottom is δ z 5 m which is quite refined relative to the vertical scale of the lee wave of λ l e e 628 m such high vertical resolution minimizes errors with respect to δ z allowing us to focus on the nonhydrostatic effects dictated by convergence with respect to δ x all runs simulate 10 excitation periods where the excitation period is given by t e x l h i l l u in terms of the excitation period and the lee wave wavelength 45 c g ϵ u 2 π u l h i l l n u 2 π u n u l h i l l λ l e e t e x implying that in the hydrostatic limit where the group velocity is directed vertically eq 23 the wave propagates upward by one wavelength for each excitation period because the excitation period scales with the length of the bathymetry longer hills require longer simulation times that is for l h i l l 0 5 1 2 4 km and u 0 2 m s 1 t e x 0 7 1 4 2 8 5 6 hr and t s i m 0 3 0 6 1 2 2 3 days the kinematic viscosity is constant ν 0 01 m 2 s 1 and no turbulence model is employed shakespeare and hogg 2017 suggest that this value for ν is small enough to produce an effectively inviscid lee wave simulation this is especially true for a lee wave with linear height bathymetry and a free slip bottom boundary condition in which there are no instabilities in the system to drive significant gradients indeed test simulations with smaller viscosity produce little change in the measured lee wave drag ultimately the choice of ν was driven by balancing stability considerations and a desire to avoid using an unreasonably small time step these simulations employ second order accurate central differencing for advection of momentum which imposes the rather severe stability criterion on the size of the time step of δ t 2 ν u 2 0 5 s assuming u 0 w 0 u hence in all simulations we use δ t 0 1 s 3 2 nonhydrostatic effects in resolved simulations as derived above the nonhydrostatic pressure in lee waves permits the wavenumber vector to orient such that its magnitude is always equal to n u above variable wavenumber bathymetry eqs 20 and 23 in the hydrostatic limit ϵ 0 the wavenumber of the bathymetry effectively vanishes and the wavenumber vector points vertically as ϵ increases towards unity the wavenumber vector tilts increasingly downstream up to the limiting point in which the wavenumber of the bathymetry exactly equals the lee wave wavenumber and the wavenumber vector points horizontally downstream beyond this limit in which hills have wavenumbers larger than n u ϵ 1 there is no orientation in which the wavenumber vector can have magnitude n u and thus there is no propagating lee wave this functional dependence of the angle of the nonhydrostatic wavenumber vector on ϵ is given by eq 24 in hydrostatic simulations however the vertical wavenumber remains fixed at its hydrostatic value n u despite any variations in the wavenumber of the bathymetry hydrostatic simulations should thus produce a wavenumber vector with a different angle relative to the horizontal given in eq 25 furthermore because the vertical wavenumber in hydrostatic simulations is insensitive to the wavenumber of the bathymetry a hydrostatic model will still generate lee waves when ϵ 1 well resolved nonhydrostatic and hydrostatic simulations of lee waves should display these diverging characteristics fig 2 shows output from the highest resolution nonhydrostatic simulations for each of the four hill lengths the horizontal grid spacing in each is the same relative to the wavelength of the hill that is k δ x 0 063 the right panels in the figure show time series of the instantaneous wave drag over the course of the simulations nondimensionalized by f h s eq 38 note that all simulations begin by oscillating around the value f n h s eq 32 with maximum values of o f h s the period of these oscillations is precisely t e x from the standpoint of dimensional analysis this is not particularly surprising because although there are two time scales in the problem arising from the terms n and u only the latter of these relates to the forcing of the hill on the wave nevertheless recognizing t e x as the intrinsic lee wave time scale is an important observation from the standpoint of numerical modeling because it sets a lower bound on the necessary duration of a lee wave simulation for these linear height hills the oscillations decay within the first 3 to 4 excitation periods and the measured wave drag asymptotes to f n h s therefore we define steady state as the period given by 5 t e x t 8 t e x in what follows quantities with the overbar e g u are time averaged over this period the left panels in fig 2 display the average nondimensional perturbation horizontal velocity u u j u m note that this nondimensionalization includes the nonhydrostatic factor m 1 ϵ 2 1 2 as opposed to u 0 j u from eq 8 and keeps the magnitude of the nondimensional perturbation u constant across ϵ as predicted by nonhydrostatic linear theory the lee wave wavelength is also constant when ϵ 1 and its orientation tilts downstream with increasing ϵ also in agreement with linear theory the ϵ 1 length hill does not produce a propagating wave and exerts almost no drag upon reaching equilibrium note however that even in this ϵ 1 case the maximum instantaneous drag is of the same order as f h s this occurs because it still requires work to establish the evanescent disturbance to offer a qualitative assessment of the role of nonhydrostatic pressure in these simulations we show in the top panels of fig 3 the time averaged vertical momentum flux f x z ρ 0 u x z w x z nondimensionalized by f 0 eq 34 from the four nonhydrostatic simulations shown in fig 2 the bottom panels show the time averaged flux from the equivalent hydrostatic simulations as suggested by linear theory the difference between the nonhydrostatic and hydrostatic models over the longest hill ϵ 0 16 panels d and h is imperceptible while that over the narrowest hill ϵ 1 26 panels a and e is striking specifically the hydrostatic simulation over the 0 5 km hill ϵ 1 26 panel e generates a propagating lee wave even though ϵ 1 less striking but still significant is that the hydrostatic simulation above the 1 km hill ϵ 0 63 panel f retains a vertical periodicity of exactly the lee wave wavelength λ l e e while the nonhydrostatic simulation over this length hill panel b correctly permits the wavenumber vector to tilt downstream leading to a longer vertical wavelength more quantitatively fig 4 compares the angle of the simulated time averaged wavenumber vector to the predictions from nonhydrostatic and hydrostatic theory eqs 24 and 25 the angle was calculated by first determining the location of the maximum time averaged vertical velocity as a function of z which traces out a line of constant phase in the lee wave we then perform a linear least squares fit to determine the slope and thus the angle of the line of constant phase to the vertical which is equal to the angle of the wavenumber vector to the horizontal as they are sufficiently resolved both the simulated nonhydrostatic and hydrostatic wave angles agree with linear theory note that because the evanescent nonhydrostatic simulation does not produce a propagating wave it has a real k but an imaginary m implying θ 0 4 effect of horizontal grid resolution for an ocean model to resolve any type of wave it requires horizontal grid spacing fine enough to detect the horizontal gradients of said wave failure to satisfy this resolution requirement can result in numerically induced physics dominating the system for example when simulating solitary waves with a second order accurate discretization vitousek and fringer 2011 demonstrate that the horizontal gradients in the wave scale with the depth of the internal interface h 1 and thus the resolution must satisfy γ δ x h 1 2 1 to avoid numerically induced dispersion reducing the speed of the solitary wave additionally vitousek and fringer 2011 show that the numerically induced dispersion can cause a hydrostatic simulation to correctly predict the speed and wavelength of a nonhydrostatic solitary wave albeit for non physical reasons a similar analysis of the discrete lee wave system reveals that the horizontal gradients scale with the inverse bathymetric wavenumber k 1 and that poor horizontal grid spacing results in the model responding to a smaller effective bathymetric wavenumber k e with a corresponding adjustment to the predicted lee wave drag to derive the analytical expressions for these numerically induced physics we discretize the linear nondimensional steady lee wave equations eqs 14 15 and the nondimensional linear bottom boundary condition eq 17 using central differencing in space as an illustrative example of the process the second order accurate in space discretization of the bottom boundary condition is given by 46 w i x 0 h i 1 h i 1 2 δ x where the subscript i corresponds to the horizontal index of the grid point in the computational domain and δ x x i x i 1 k δ x is the nondimensional horizontal grid spacing expanding h i 1 and h i 1 with the taylor series produces the modified equivalent form of the bottom boundary condition 47 w e x 0 h x δ x 2 6 3 h x 3 o δ x 4 where the subscript e reflects that this is the modified equivalent form of the expression from linear theory eq 17 and we have dropped the subscript i because the equations hold for all discrete space inserting the sinusoidal bathymetry h 1 2 sin x implies the equivalent bottom boundary condition accurate to o δ x 4 48 w e x 0 1 2 1 δ x 2 6 cos x which is smaller in magnitude than the analytical solution for w x 0 eq 27 by the factor 1 δ x 2 6 discretizing the bottom boundary condition thus reduces the magnitude of the vertical velocity to one appropriate for a more hydrostatic hill length implying that we can rewrite the modified equivalent bottom boundary condition as 49 w e x 0 1 2 k e k cos x where 50 k e k 1 δ x 2 6 is the modified equivalent hill wavenumber recalling that the magnitude of the lee wave group velocity is equal to ϵ u eq 22 the discrete bottom boundary condition effects a modified equivalent group velocity with magnitude 51 c g e k e k ϵ u giving a modified equivalent group velocity that is slower than c g by a factor of 1 δ x 2 6 this is analogous to numerical dispersion slowing the propagation of solitary internal waves in vitousek and fringer 2011 performing the same discretization on the linear euler equations and cross differentiating gives the modified equivalent form of eq 16 52 w e 2 z 2 ϵ 2 w e 2 x 2 w e δ x 2 6 ϵ 2 w e 4 x 4 δ z 2 6 w e 4 z 4 o δ x 4 δ z 4 note that for a hydrostatic model where ϵ 0 the error from the horizontal discretization vanishes assuming a solution of the form w e 1 2 k e k cos x m e z and δ z 2 δ x 2 since the vertical grid is very fine the effective modified nondimensional vertical wavenumber to o δ x 4 δ z 2 is given by 53 m e 1 k e k ϵ 2 1 2 which is larger than the nonhydrostatic wavenumber eq 19 and thus more hydrostatic the second order accurate discretization of the linear euler equations therefore induces another error that also has the effect of making the flow more hydrostatic indeed at sufficiently coarse resolutions even an evanescent length hill ϵ 1 could generate a non imaginary vertical wavenumber if k e k ϵ 2 1 for example a hill with ϵ 1 and δ x 0 5 would have k e k 0 96 and thus the effective vertical wavenumber m e 0 2 note however that because f e is only asymptotically accurate to o δ x 4 it is only strictly valid for resolutions in the asymptotic limit δ x 4 δ x 2 finally following an identical derivation to that of the analytical wave drag eq 32 we arrive at the modified equivalent wave drag 54 f e k e k m e f h s 1 1 6 k δ x 2 1 ϵ 2 1 1 6 k δ x 2 1 2 f h s expanding the square root this gives 55 f e 1 ϵ 2 2 1 6 k δ x 2 ϵ 2 6 k δ x 2 o k δ x 4 ϵ 4 f h s discretization of the lee wave system thus introduces two competing effects on the wave drag first the discrete bottom boundary condition causes an attenuation of the amplitude of the lee wave by the amount k δ x 2 6 f h s secondly the nonhydrostatic discretization of the equations of motion results in an amplification of the vertical wavenumber which in turn increases the magnitude of the form drag by approximately ϵ 2 k δ x 2 6 f h s only the first of these effects persists in the hydrostatic limit or when using a hydrostatic model however in a coarsely resolved nonhydrostatic model over strongly nonhydrostatic bathymetry the second effect is not negligible lastly eq 54 offers an estimate of the resolution needed to achieve a desired precision for example generating a hydrostatic lee wave with 96 of the theoretical wave drag requires k δ x 6 1 96 0 5 or δ x 0 08 l h i l l although this conclusion simply confirms the general notion that resolving a physical phenomenon requires about ten grid points per length scale associated with that phenomenon connecting the numerical error to the physics is nevertheless a novel pursuit indeed as regional models increase their resolution to the point that they generate lee waves this result provides a useful analytical prediction of the numerical effects they should expect to illustrate the numerical effects in linear lee waves in fig 5 we show the simulated time averaged wave drags and overlay the equivalent modified wave drag f e eq 54 corresponding to each of the four hill lengths ϵ 16 32 63 1 26 as well as the hydrostatic equivalent modified wave drag given by evaluating f e with ϵ 0 the scaling of the axes in fig 5 causes the hydrostatic simulations dashed lines to collapse onto a single curve that converges to f f h s 1 and is very well approximated by the hydrostatic form of f e dotted magenta line at grid resolution smaller than k δ x 0 8 at coarser grid resolution the asymptotic theory used to derive f e is no longer valid and the hydrostatic ϵ 0 32 simulations perform better than predicted by f e although anticipated by both hydrostatic theory and f e it is nevertheless noteworthy that all of the hydrostatic simulations converge with grid refinement to the same hydrostatic lee wave drag f h s this occurs because the hydrostatic simulations generate lee waves with vertical wavenumbers equaling the hydrostatic value m n u and thus display waves with maximum perturbation pressure which linear theory shows to be proportional to m eq 29 likewise the nonhydrostatic simulations converge to the predictions from nonhydrostatic theory f f h s 1 ϵ 2 1 2 eq 39 which follows from the same reasoning as in the hydrostatic result with the difference that in the nonhydrostatic model the vertical wavenumber adjusts such that the magnitude of the wavenumber vector is a constant n u eqs 20 and 23 this nonhydrostatic adjustment to the vertical wavenumber entails an attenuation in the perturbation pressure away from its maximum hydrostatic value and an attendant attenuation of the wave drag for all but the evanescent 500 m length hill ϵ 1 26 the drag increases with grid refinement and is well approximated by f e for k δ x 0 8 again at coarser resolution where f e is not valid the ϵ 0 32 and ϵ 0 63 simulations perform better than predicted by f e the 500 m hill ϵ 1 26 presents the most surprising and from the standpoint of a modeler wishing to resolve lee waves the most discouraging result beginning with the hydrostatic model as in all of the hydrostatic simulations above longer hills those above the 500 m hill exhibit a lee wave with a hydrostatic vertical wavenumber and thus the full hydrostatic drag f h s the hydrostatic model thus dramatically over predicts the drag compared to the nonhydrostatic result of the drag free evanescent wave and as in all of the propagating length simulations the predicted drag increases with increasing grid refinement following the hydrostatic form of f e this implies that a hydrostatic ocean model will generate lee waves even when the horizontal scale of the bathymetry is less than the evanescent length thus producing erroneous numerical drag that increases with grid refinement the nonhydrostatic model on the other hand converges to the correct no drag result with grid refinement however with coarser resolution the nonhydrostatic model also incorrectly predicts a finite drag above the evanescent hill even with a reasonable resolution of k δ x 0 32 or δ x 25 m the nonhydrostatic model predicts a drag of 0 08 f h s although the modified equivalent wave drag f e with ϵ 1 26 dotted green line indicates that the nonhydrostatic model will produce numerically induced wave drag when m e is real this requires the coarse resolution of k δ x 1 48 a regime in which the asymptotic theory used to derive f e is not appropriate this suggests an alternative numerical effect not captured by our discretization analysis that dominates for simulations over evanescent hill lengths noting that the rate of convergence appears first order and that this is a strongly nonhydrostatic simulation it is likely that the numerical effect derives from the bottom boundary condition on the nonhydrostatic pressure which is not second order accurate with cut cells zhang 2017 it is also possible that it results from the o δ z 2 term that we neglected in order to simplify the derivation of m e eq 53 in any case this study shows that while the nonhydrostatic model significantly reduces the erroneous drag over evanescent length bathymetry extremely high resolution is needed to eliminate it for numerical studies focused on simulating the lee wave drag in a region dominated by linear height bathymetry the best solution could be to low pass filter the bathymetry to remove evanescent length components even when using a nonhydrostatic model however above less linear height bathymetry there may be nonlinear interactions between evanescent and propagating components of the bathymetry and low pass filtering the bathymetry might not be appropriate further research is required to determine the best course of action in this scenario nevertheless this study suggests that simulating lee wave drag over narrow hills is a precarious business to emphasize the potential for over predicting the true drag with the hydrostatic model in fig 6 we offer a rescaling of the time averaged drag from the three ϵ 1 length hills now nondimensionalizing by their respective values from nonhydrostatic linear theory f n h s eq 32 this plot does not show the evanescent case since the exact result is f n h s 0 which would yield f f n h s all nonhydrostatic results converge to f f n h s 1 and all hydrostatic results converge to f f n h s 1 ϵ 2 1 2 as observed in fig 5 the rates of convergence are well predicted by f e when k δ x 0 8 although for clarity we do not show f e here for the 1 km hill ϵ 0 63 the convergence of the hydrostatic model to f h s implies that the over prediction in drag caused by using a high resolution hydrostatic simulation asymptotes to 28 on the other hand using a nonhydrostatic model with coarser resolution over the same hill leads to an under prediction of the drag interestingly because drag predicted by the hydrostatic model also decreases with coarser resolution there exists a resolution where the two effects cancel and the hydrostatic model gives better predictions of the nonhydrostatic drag than the nonhydrostatic model for example based on our simulations the hydrostatic model with ϵ 0 63 would produce the correct drag f f n h s when k δ x 1 32 although the nonhydrostatic model would under predict the drag by 16 f 0 84 f n h s with this grid resolution note also that we can estimate this fortuitous resolution which we will denote as δ x l u c k by equating the hydrostatic form of equation f e eq 54 with ϵ 0 to f n h s eq 32 giving the relation 56 δ x l u c k 6 1 1 ϵ 2 1 2 1 2 with ϵ 0 63 this predicts δ x l u c k 1 16 which is close to the observed value of k δ x 1 32 even though this is much too coarse a resolution for f e to be asymptotically valid running the hydrostatic model at this coincidental resolution is thus a case of getting the right answer for the wrong reason and should not be taken as an endorsement for using coarse resolution hydrostatic models over nonhydrostatic bathymetry nevertheless this analysis points to the folly of blindly refining the grid without considering the nonhydrostatic effect with this in mind consider the hydrostatic simulations reported in klymak 2018 gula et al 2018 and marez et al 2020 where δ x 100 m λ l e e 2 π u n 628 m and the minimum hill lengths were l h i l l 1 2 km meaning ϵ 0 3 0 6 and k δ x 0 3 0 6 using f e we sketch this region in fig 6 with the cross hatch pattern in this range of grid resolution these simulations likely over predicted the drag from the narrowest components of their bathymetry by as much as 20 although a hydrostatic simulation over nonhydrostatic bathymetry results in an over prediction of the drag it is nevertheless significantly cheaper from a computational point of view fig 7 displays the ratio of computation time required for otherwise identical simulations run with nonhydrostatic pressure t n h s and without t h s the nonhydrostatic suntans model employs the block jacobi preconditioner to solve the pressure poisson equation with the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm which is less effective for increasing ϵ fringer et al 2006 thus for a given resolution the computational cost of a nonhydrostatic simulation increases with ϵ for example in the case of the strongly nonhydrostatic propagating length bathymetry l h i l l 1 km ϵ 0 63 with a resolution of k δ x 0 32 it takes roughly five times as long to run in nonhydrostatic mode as in hydrostatic mode while the same resolution over the most hydrostatic bathymetry ϵ 0 16 is only twice as time consuming however because the ϵ 0 16 hill is practically hydrostatic the difference between the hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic drag is very small i e f h s f n h s f h s 1 m 0 013 and thus there is little benefit to computing the nonhydrostatic pressure even if it is comparatively inexpensive in addition to the increasing cost related to increasing ϵ fig 7 also shows that for a given ϵ the expense of a nonhydrostatic simulation increases dramatically with grid refinement for example with ϵ 0 63 the nonhydrostatic overhead is roughly two when k δ x 0 63 and it increases to nearly twenty when k δ x 0 063 5 application to nonlinear lee waves unlike the simulations in the previous sections realistic abyssal hill bathymetry is often taller than u n and generates nonlinear lee waves in a separate paper we present a series of high resolution nonhydrostatic lee wave simulations over nonlinear height j o 1 sinusoidal bathymetry mayer and fringer 2020 the study reveals that for hills tall enough to cause blocking wherein stagnant water becomes trapped in the valleys the steady state overtopping flow behaves as if flowing over a new bathymetry defined by the time average lowest overtopping streamline lots whose height h e f f is always subcritical to the lee wave j e f f 1 furthermore we demonstrated that the lee wave drag can be computed by applying linear theory to the lots the accuracy of the drag measurement therefore depends on resolving the lots at appropriate scale for the associated linear lee wave implying that the resolution requirements identified in this paper are applicable to nonlinear lee waves mayer and fringer 2020 identified two common nonhydrostatic features of the lots that can render the entire lots evanescent even above bathymetry otherwise long enough to radiate lee waves the first nonhydrostatic process termed an evanescent undulation develops on the portion of the lots that separates the blocked layer from the overtopping flow for the more hydrostatic hills with ϵ 0 5 the streamline above the blocked layer develops a sinusoidal shape with a wavelength equal to λ l e e hence if treated as bathymetry this portion of the lots is evanescent with ϵ 1 and does not contribute to the wave drag the second nonhydrostatic component evanescent masking results from the blocked layer filling in so much of the valley that the portion of the streamline still connected to the bathymetry shrinks in length becoming shorter than λ l e e in the presence of evanescent masking the entirety of the lots is evanescent to the overtopping flow and the wave drag vanishes both of these phenomena are invisible to hydrostatic simulations as a result using a hydrostatic model with nonlinear height periodic bathymetry can result in significant over predictions of the wave drag to demonstrate as much this section presents hydrostatic versions of the j 2 simulations of mayer and fringer 2020 for the ϵ 0 16 0 32 0 63 length hills as in mayer and fringer 2020 the horizontal resolution of all simulations in this section is δ x 10 m fig 8 shows snapshots of the nondimensional vorticity in the l h i l l 2 km simulation with and without nonhydrostatic pressure over the first 2 5 t e x note the hydrostatic simulations generate a vertically propagating lee wave with a narrow grid scale wavelength from the jump like feature in the lots associated with its separation from the bathymetry downstream of the separation the lots is relatively quiescent showing no indication of evanescent undulations the jump like feature is similar to the result in vitousek and fringer 2011 in which hydrostatic simulations produce grid scale solitary waves with numerical dispersion balancing the nonlinear steepening it thus appears that in the absence of nonhydrostatic dispersion needed to generate the evanescent undulations the hydrostatic model produces a strong jump with a width of a few grid spaces fig 9 shows the drag as a function of time for the l h i l l 2 km simulations in fig 8 we display two measurements of the drag 1 the form drag f f o r m eq 30 computed using the simulated pressure and the analytical bathymetry and 2 the wave drag f f l u x eq 35 computed by integrating the vertical momentum flux through a horizontal plane 15 m above the bathymetry as shown in mayer and fringer 2020 the two measurements are identical when the lee wave reaches steady state indicating that all of the momentum removed from the background flow by the form drag is radiated away in the lee wave by the momentum flux there is however a saturation limit to the momentum flux before a stably stratified fluid collapses into instability approximated by pierrehumbert 1987 as 57 f s a t ρ 0 u 3 n 1 indeed in fig 9 both of the l h i l l 2 km simulations show the wave drag f f l u x saturating at o f s a t within the first t e x of the simulation any form drag larger than this saturation limit cannot radiate as momentum flux and must therefore contribute to local changes in momentum in mayer and fringer 2020 we demonstrate that for the spin up of supercritical lee wave simulations the form drag is always momentarily much larger than the momentum flux with a maximum close to the linear prediction f n h s because the form drag is temporarily acting to establish the blocked layer this tendency is well represented in the nonhydrostatic l h i l l 2 km simulation of fig 9 the hydrostatic simulation also produces excess form drag during spin up however the time series has two local maximums with the first better approximated by twice the linear prediction for hydrostatic lee waves 2 f h s after the blocked layer stabilizes both simulations show the form and wave drag coming into equilibrium however the hydrostatic simulation again produces more drag than its nonhydrostatic companion the hydrostatic over prediction of drag both in the spin up phase and in the quasi steady phase is a numerical artifact it results from the hydrostatic simulation permitting the short length scale components of the lots to generate drag producing lee waves while the nonhydrostatic simulation correctly treats these features as evanescent fig 10 shows the time averaged vorticity for the six simulations the three nonhydrostatic simulations top panels demonstrate the evanescent processes very well the l h i l l 1 km simulation top left offers an especially satisfying demonstration of evanescent masking and evanescent undulations above the blocked layer are evident for both the 2 km and the 4 km top center and top right hills faint lee waves can be seen propagating at an angle downstream from the beginning of the blocked layer where the lots separates from the bathymetry by contrast all of the hydrostatic simulations bottom panels produce a persistent vertically propagating lee wave from the beginning of the blocked layer in the l h i l l 1 km simulation the wave has an especially narrow horizontal wavelength smaller than λ l e e and is therefore not physical the time averaged drag for these ϵ 0 63 0 32 0 16 simulations is f n h s f s a t 0 02 0 06 0 14 for the nonhydrostatic simulations and f h s f s a t 0 12 0 28 0 29 for the hydrostatic simulations note there is very little difference in the drag between the hydrostatic l h i l l 2 km and 4 km simulations this is because all the drag is generated by the narrow width lee wave at the separation point the rest of the blocked layer is flat the hydrostatic model thus predicts a factor of f n h s f h s 7 4 4 6 2 0 more drag than the nonhydrostatic models compared to the result from linear theory in which the over prediction is given by f n h s f h s 1 ϵ 2 1 2 1 29 1 06 1 01 eq 39 we see that the supercritical lee wave accentuates the nonhydrostatic effects and linear theory serves as a lower bound for f h s f s a t note that with δ x λ l e e 0 016 the nonhydrostatic models also over predict the drag in these simulations because they do not have enough resolution to generate fully evanescent lee waves as demonstrated in section 4 thus the ratio f h s f n h s offers a conservative estimate for how much a hydrostatic simulation of a j 2 lee wave over predicts the lee wave drag even in the most hydrostatic of these simulations with ϵ 0 16 the hydrostatic simulation produces twice as much drag as its nonhydrostatic counterpart while in the linear regime an ϵ 0 16 length hill should be well simulated by a hydrostatic simulation hence these nonlinear simulations offer further support for the general notion that lee waves are essentially nonhydrostatic features of ocean currents and the ocean modeler is cautioned against treating them as otherwise 6 conclusion in this paper we derived a nondimensional form of the linear theory for lee wave drag above sinusoidal bathymetry and used suntans with and without the nonhydrostatic pressure to demonstrate the convergence to theory of wave drag in simulated lee waves above bathymetry of linear height j 1 and varying length ϵ 0 16 0 32 0 63 1 26 using central differencing in space we derived a modified equivalent form of the steady lee wave drag f e eq 54 accurate to o δ x 4 δ z 2 where δ x k δ x and δ z n u δ z which shows that discretizing the lee wave system results in two forms of numerically induced physics one effecting the magnitude of the group velocity vector and the other its direction both of these numerically induced physics can be viewed as making the wave more hydrostatic and yet they have opposite effects on the magnitude of the lee wave drag the primary source of numerical physics results from the discretization of the bottom boundary condition which results in a modification of the lee wave drag by the factor k e k 1 1 6 k δ x 2 we observed that f e correctly predicted the convergence of our numerical simulations to the predictions of linear theory for k δ x 0 8 meaning that f e offers a good estimate of the precision of a lee wave simulation such that for example achieving 96 accuracy requires k δ x 0 5 or about δ x 0 08 l h i l l in both the abyssal ocean and coastal regions such as the gulf stream typical bathymetry that generates lee waves has horizontal length scales of o km goff and arbic 2010 zheng et al 2012 resolving the resulting lee wave drag thus requires horizontal grid spacing of δ x o 100 m at the finest resolutions in this study k δ x 0 063 the lee waves display wavenumber vectors that agree with those predicted by linear theory specifically in the nonhydrostatic model the pressure allows the magnitude of the wavenumber vector to remain fixed at n u thus requiring the vertical component of the wavenumber vector to decrease as m n u 1 ϵ 2 1 2 in the hydrostatic model however the vertical component of the wavenumber vector remains fixed at the value given by the hydrostatic limit m h s n u irrespective of the wavenumber of the bathymetry over nonhydrostatic bathymetry this implies that hydrostatic models generate larger magnitude pressure perturbations than dynamically required resulting in an over prediction of the wave drag our simulations demonstrate that this over prediction converges to that predicted by the comparison of hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic linear theory f n h s m f h s where m 1 ϵ 2 1 2 additionally for evanescent length hills ϵ 1 the nonhydrostatic drag vanishes f n h s 0 which is in stark contrast to hydrostatic simulations above evanescent hills which still generate a hydrostatic lee wave producing the full hydrostatic drag f h s at coarser resolutions for all but the nonhydrostatic model above the evanescent bathymetry the computed drags were lower than those predicted by theory in accordance with f e therefore coarsely resolved hydrostatic simulations can produce the correct nonhydrostatic drag but for the wrong reason on the other hand for the nonhydrostatic model above evanescent bathymetry the coarser resolution simulations generate significant drag even though it should vanish indeed even at a resolution of δ x 25 m k δ x 0 32 the nonhydrostatic model still predicts drag of o 0 1 f h s this is a particularly unwelcome discovery as it suggests that both hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic simulations of stratified flow over evanescent length bathymetry will produce numerically induced lee waves unless they employ spectacularly fine resolution finally in the supercritical j 1 regime with periodic bathymetry where blocking results in wave drag saturation we showed that hydrostatic lee wave simulations dramatically over predict the drag even above hydrostatic length bathymetry due to a non physical representation of the blocked layer as a whole this paper has demonstrated that resolving lee waves requires the dual constraint of very fine horizontal grid spacing and computation of the nonhydrostatic pressure failure to satisfy the resolution requirement generally results in a moderate under prediction of drag while failure to compute the nonhydrostatic pressure results in an over prediction of the drag which is negligible above hydrostatic length and linear height bathymetry but becomes dramatic as ϵ 1 or j 1 satisfying both of these constraints is computationally expensive in cases where the nonhydrostatic pressure is important the time required to run a sufficient resolution nonhydrostatic model was found to be about five times that of an otherwise identical hydrostatic model however above nonhydrostatic length bathymetry ϵ o 0 1 this paper demonstrates that choosing only to improve resolution without also computing the nonhydrostatic

23920,with increased computing power the horizontal grid spacing of regional ocean models is decreasing to the point where they can directly simulate lee waves although oceanic lee waves can be inherently nonhydrostatic such as in the abyssal ocean or in the gulf stream regional ocean models are frequently run in hydrostatic mode to avoid the computational expense of solving the nonhydrostatic pressure however the effects of the nonhydrostatic pressure and the numerical error on the accuracy of the simulated lee waves is not immediately obvious to quantify these effects this paper presents hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic simulations of an idealized lee wave over both linear and nonlinear height and varying length bathymetry utilizing a range of horizontal grid spacings we present an analysis of the numerical error arising from the discrete linear stratified euler equations to identify the numerically induced physics in lee wave simulations as expected for the second order accurate model the numerical error in the lee wave drag decreases quadratically with respect to horizontal grid refinement although the error arises from two primary sources the first is related to discretization of the kinematic bottom boundary condition which acts to decrease the lee wave drag the second is related to discretization of the nonhydrostatic pressure which acts to increase the drag together the results offer a regional ocean modeler several cautionary notes for calculating and interpreting properties of simulated lee waves namely that a hydrostatic model can produce the correct form drag due simply to numerical error and attempting to employ a nonhydrostatic model to correct for this error can require prohibitively fine grid resolution keywords form drag ocean modeling lee waves nonhydrostatic effects grid resolution requirements internal waves 1 introduction simulating certain types of internal gravity waves remains computationally challenging for ocean models chief among these perennially vexing oscillatory signals at least in terms of potential abundance is the lee wave which occurs wherever a steady current with stable stratification interacts with bathymetry the generation of a lee wave causes drag on the background flow hereafter referred to as lee wave drag which is hypothesized to significantly affect the fate of momentum and energy in the ocean legg 2020 nikurashin and ferrari 2011 trossman et al 2016 for global ocean models with o 10 km or coarser resolution lee waves are a subgrid scale phenomenon that must be parameterized regional ocean simulations however are capable of resolving lee waves in both the coastal and abyssal ocean caulfield et al 2019 recent examples include nikurashin et al 2014 zheng and nikurashin 2019 klymak 2018 gula et al 2018 and marez et al 2020 often these studies employ hydrostatic simulations to avoid the computational expense of solving the 3 d elliptic equation for the nonhydrostatic pressure for lee waves the hydrostatic model is appropriate when the horizontal length scale of the bathymetry l h i l l is much longer than the wavelength of the lee wave λ l e e which in typical oceanic conditions is λ l e e o 1 km as demonstrated by linear theory however when the length of the bathymetry narrows to the same order as the lee wavelength the nonhydrostatic pressure reduces the magnitude of the pressure anomaly in the lee wave and attenuates the drag therefore simulations over nonhydrostatic bathymetry that neglect this nonhydrostatic effect risk over predicting the lee wave drag resolving a lee wave often requires the dual constraints of both a fine enough horizontal grid spacing to capture the horizontal gradients in the lee wave as well as the expensive computation of the nonhydrostatic pressure dimensional analysis suggests that both of these requirements should be directly related to the length scale of the bathymetry this paper thus presents a set of hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic simulations of an idealized lee wave over sinusoidal bathymetries of hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic length scale with a range of horizontal grid spacing l h i l l 100 δ x l h i l l 4 the simulations offer a quantitative diagnosis of the resolution requirement and the importance of the nonhydrostatic effect over various length bathymetry additionally this paper presents an analytical evaluation of the discrete lee wave equations and identifies how the truncation error affects the physical system lastly this paper offers a brief comparison of hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic lee wave simulations over nonlinear height bathymetry to demonstrate that the lessons learned in the linear regime apply also in the nonlinear regime this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce an idealized lee wave and derive a dimensionless form of the lee wave drag predicted by linear theory in section 3 we describe our simulations and analyze a set of high resolution simulations in section 4 we present a derivation of the modified equivalent lee wave drag from the discrete pdes and compare it to the drag observed in our simulations in section 5 we offer a brief analysis of nonlinear lee wave simulations finally in section 6 we conclude with suggestions for grid resolutions needed to resolve hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic lee waves 2 linear lee wave theory and parameter space 2 1 dimensional analysis an idealized lee wave can be generated by a flow with constant background horizontal velocity u and buoyancy frequency n 2 g ρ 0 ρ z over a sinusoidal bathymetry of height h 0 and length l h i l l 2 π k see fig 1 sinusoidal bathymetry is chosen in part for the simplicity that it offers the analysis but it also serves as a reasonable approximation of a ubiquitous small scale bathymetric feature of the ocean floor the abyssal hills goff and arbic 2010 abyssal hills are strongly anisotropic appearing as an expanse of periodic ridges aligned with the mid ocean ridges where they are formed locally their amplitudes are focused at dominant wavelengths such that they are similar to a sinusoid rotation is neglected under the assumption of large rossby number u k f 1 where f is the coriolis frequency in the presence of rotation this assumption fails first for the longer more hydrostatic hill lengths for the most hydrostatic hill length considered in this study this assumption is equivalent to n f o 100 see fig 8 10 in gill 1982 which using a typical oceanic buoyancy scale n o 0 001 s 1 is valid at latitudes smaller than approximately 15 steady lee wave theory demonstrates that as u k approaches the rate of f rotation changes the lee wave wavelength slows the vertically propagating wave front and diminishes the form drag gill 1982 for u k f propagating lee waves cannot exist and the steady state drag vanishes though the rotationally evanescent lee wave response may still entail significant drag klymak 2018 thus rotation is likely an important element of most oceanic lee waves however as the goal of this paper is to identify numerical considerations when resolving nonhydrostatic effects in lee waves the analytical clarity gained by ignoring rotation outweighs the potential cost in realism we also assume that the depth of the domain d is irrelevant i e that the ratio of the current to the first mode internal gravity wave speed satisfies u n d 1 in the deep ocean where d 4 km and typical abyssal values of velocity and buoyancy give u n 100 m the assumption of infinite depth is very reasonable in coastal regions where d 1 km reflections of the lee wave from the surface or pycnocline might become important khatiwala 2003 with these assumptions the idealized lee wave is characterized by the dimensional quantities u n h 0 and k choosing u and n to nondimensionalize h 0 and k the governing nondimensional parameters are j n h 0 u and ϵ u k n j is a froude number indicating a ratio of perturbation advection speed within the wave to its group velocity and serves as a measurement of the nonlinearity of the lee wave mayer and fringer 2017 in this study we focus the numerical analysis on linear height bathymetry implying j 1 however the results are applicable for all subcritical lee waves j 1 where the nonlinear effects on the lee wave drag are small nikurashin and ferrari 2010 the results are also applicable to nonlinear height bathymetry with j o 1 as demonstrated in section 5 we note that although much of the lee wave literature focuses on supercritical height bathymetry there are many abyssal hill regions with subcritical heights see fig 9 in nikurashin et al 2014 we will refer to the second nondimensional number ϵ u k n as the nonhydrostatic parameter since it informs the degree of nonhydrostatic effects in the lee wave u k may be interpreted as the frequency of the bathymetric forcing on the flow implying that ϵ is the ratio of this forcing rate to the buoyant response rate of the fluid n equivalently one can view ϵ as a ratio of the wavelength of the lee wave λ l e e 2 π u n to the wavelength of the hill l h i l l 2 π k if the hill is very long such that λ l e e l h i l l then ϵ 1 and the wave is hydrostatic gill 1982 however in their study of the global energy flux into lee waves nikurashin and ferrari 2011 report that upon weighting by the energy flux the average horizontal and vertical wavelength of oceanic lee waves are 2 5 km and 700 m respectively which implies u n 107 m see eq 20 and ϵ 0 27 although not strongly nonhydrostatic this value of ϵ still entails qualitative and quantitative differences between hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic simulations as demonstrated in this paper seen as a ratio of frequencies ϵ is analogous to ω n for internal tides where ω is the tidal frequency and the hydrostatic regime is defined by ω n for internal tides ω n relates directly to the angle of the tidal beam such that as the tidal frequency approaches the buoyancy frequency the beam steepens toward the vertical internal tide simulations run in hydrostatic mode when ω o n will under predict this beam steepening vitousek and fringer 2014 an analogous relationship exists between ϵ and the angle of the group velocity vector in a lee wave as shown in fig 1 and discussed below as a final comment on ϵ note the potentially counter intuitive scaling of the horizontal length by k rather than l h i l l this choice results from recognizing that the quantity δ u n is the inverse of the lee wave wavenumber n u while the lee wave wavelength is λ l e e 2 π u n if one were to use l h i l l to scale the horizontal one could use λ l e e to arrive at the same expression for the nonhydrostatic parameter 1 ϵ λ l e e l h i l l 2 π u n l h i l l u k n it would not be correct however to form a nonhydrostatic parameter as δ l h i l l u n l h i l l because as we show below this choice obscures by a factor of 2 π the distinction between the propagating and evanescent regime given by ϵ 1 although it is still true that a flow is hydrostatic when u n l h i l l 1 baines 1995 omitting the factor of 2 π has resulted in some studies assuming nearly hydrostatic bathymetry ϵ o 0 1 when it is in fact strongly nonhydrostatic ϵ o 1 e g zheng et al 2012 gula et al 2018 marez et al 2020 as we demonstrate below this can result in over predictions of the lee wave drag our quantity of interest in this paper is the form drag associated with a lee wave f which is the drag in units of force per unit length into the page shown in fig 1 since a scale for f in terms of ρ 0 u and n is ρ 0 u 3 n 1 the nondimensional form drag must satisfy 2 f ρ 0 u 3 n 1 f j ϵ 2 2 nondimensional equations we separate the flow into its external and internal quantities such that u total u e x u ρ total ρ z ρ and p total ρ 0 p z ρ 0 p under these definitions the governing steady euler equations after employing the boussinesq approximation are given by 3 u u x u u p x

governing nondimensional equations the equations are linearized by taking the j 0 limit giving 13 u x p x 14 ϵ 2 w x p z ρ 15 ρ x w combining with u 0 one can rearrange these equations into a governing equation for w 16 2 w z 2 ϵ 2 2 w x 2 w 0 which is subject to the linearized bottom boundary condition 17 w x 0 h x by linear superposition any shape bathymetry can be decomposed into a sum of sinusoids with different wavelengths bell 1975 our interest is therefore in the solution for one such sinusoidal bathymetry and we define a simple nondimensional height function as 18 h x 1 2 sin x such that the nondimensional trough to crest height is unity when ϵ 1 the solution to eq 16 that satisfies the sinusoidal bottom boundary condition is of the form w x z cos x m z which implies that the nondimensional vertical wavenumber 19 m 1 ϵ 2 1 2 dimensionalizing m with δ 1 eq 8 this results in a constant propagating lee wave wavenumber eq 6 8 6 in gill 1982 20 k l e e m 2 k 2 1 2 n u and lee wave wavelength 21 λ l e e 2 π k l e e 1 2 π u n note that upon shifting to the frame of reference moving with the water eqs 20 and 21 follow directly from the general dispersion relation for internal gravity waves in a continuous stratification ω n k k 2 m 2 1 2 where the sinusoidal bathymetry propagating to the left at speed u acts as a forcing frequency ω u k pedlosky 2003 in this reference frame the group velocity vector has magnitude u 2 n m u 1 ϵ 2 1 2 and is perpendicular to the wavenumber vector in accordance with what is expected for internal gravity waves in continuous stratification however this is not the reference frame of most ocean simulations and viewed in the frame of the hill vector addition shows that the group velocity vector of the lee wave has magnitude 22 c g ϵ u and is parallel to the wavenumber vector pointing downstream at an angle θ to the horizontal given by the relation eq 6 8 13 in gill 1982 23 ϵ cos θ see also chapter 10 of pedlosky 2003 this implies that as the wave becomes more nonhydrostatic ϵ 1 the wavenumber vector and the group velocity vector both tilt increasingly downstream θ 0 lines of constant phase are perpendicular to the wavenumber vector and thus make an angle θ to the vertical this means that as in internal tides lines of constant phase point increasingly vertically with increasing nonhydrostasy however unlike internal tides for the lee wave the energy propagates parallel to the wavenumber vector and thus points increasingly horizontally with increasing nonhydrostasy note that this also implies the relation 24 θ tan 1 m k tan 1 1 ϵ 2 1 2 ϵ which is indeed the inverse relation for an internal tide beam angle vitousek and fringer 2014 in the hydrostatic limit k 0 and the vertical wavenumber m asymptotes to the lee wave wavenumber n u thus for hydrostatic simulations where there is a finite k but the model nonetheless enforces the hydrostatic vertical wavenumber m h s n u the observed wavenumber vector will instead satisfy k h s k 2 n 2 u 2 1 2 with a different angle of propagation given by 25 θ h s tan 1 1 ϵ note that this relation is equivalent to the ϵ 1 limit of eq 24 substitution of w x z cos x m z into the governing linear equations gives 26 u x z 1 2 m cos x m z 27 w x z 1 2 cos x m z 28 ρ x z 1 2 sin x m z 29 p x z 1 2 m cos x m z note that in eq 26 and 29 the magnitudes of the horizontal velocity and pressure scale with m 1 ϵ 2 1 2 and are thus only o 1 in the hydrostatic limit this implies that although mayer and fringer 2017 derived eq 9 12 with the scaling u 0 p j u j u 2 a more general first order scaling for u and p is u 0 p j u m j u 2 m the form drag per unit width over one wavelength is given by 30 f n h s 0 2 π k p x z 0 h x d x where we use the sign convention of a positive drag acting to decelerate the flow nondimensionalizing gives 31 f n h s ρ 0 u 3 n 1 j 2 0 2 π p x z 0 h x d x substitution of p and h eqs 18 and 29 then gives assuming ϵ 1 32 f n h s ρ 0 u 3 n 1 π 4 j 2 1 ϵ 2 1 2 which shows that the nondimensional drag on the background current associated with lee waves grows in proportion to j 2 but decreases with increasing ϵ the ϵ dependence is a direct result of the factor m in the nonhydrostatic solution for the pressure anomaly eq 29 despite the canonical status of this idealized lee wave in texts on stratified flows gill 1982 baines 1995 pedlosky 2003 our derivation of the lee wave drag is unique in that the result is given in nondimensional form the momentum lost to the form drag results in a vertical momentum flux f f l u x ρ 0 u w away from the bathymetry nondimensionalizing with ρ 0 u 2 and inserting the propagating solution for u and w eqs 26 and 27 the nondimensional vertical momentum flux has the form 33 f f l u x ρ 0 u 2 1 4 j 2 ϵ m cos 2 x m z f 0 ρ 0 u 2 cos 2 x m z where the scale for the vertical momentum flux is 34 f 0 1 4 ρ 0 u 2 j 2 ϵ m if we define some horizontal surface in x z space that spans a single horizontal wavelength of the bathymetry from 0 2 π k the total momentum flux through this surface is 35 f f l u x 0 2 π k f f l u x d x f 0 k 0 2 π f f l u x d x substitution of eq 33 then gives 36 f f l u x ρ 0 u 3 n 1 1 4 j 2 m 0 2 π c o s 2 x m z d x 37 π 4 j 2 1 ϵ 2 1 2 thus under our assumptions of linear height bathymetry and inviscid flow the flux of momentum through any horizontal plane is equal and opposite to the form drag of the bathymetry on the flow f f l u x f n h s eq 8 8 10 in gill 1982 finally in the hydrostatic limit ϵ 1 the lee wave drag eq 32 asymptotes to 38 f h s ρ 0 u 3 n 1 π 4 j 2 this is the maximum drag that could possibly result from a single lee wave the nonhydrostatic drag is always smaller by a factor of m i e 39 f n h s m f h s 1 ϵ 2 1 2 f h s f h s therefore serves as a scale for drag in what follows note further that because only the trough to crest height factors into the hydrostatic drag eq 38 any shape hill with a height h 0 will produce the same drag in the linear hydrostatic limit indeed even though we derived f h s for a single sinusoidal hill it is equivalent to the hydrostatic non rotating drag given in gill 1982 eq 8 8 20 for flow over an isolated bell shaped mountain although f h s is the largest drag from a single hill it does not produce the largest density of drag given by k f n h s 2 π upon evaluating the derivative of k f n h s 2 π with respect to the bathymetric wavenumber k the largest drag density can be shown to occur for hills with horizontal wavenumber k n u 2 or ϵ 0 7 hence for a given area of ocean floor a field of strongly nonhydrostatic hills can remove more momentum from the flow than would a single hydrostatic hill occupying the same horizontal span when ϵ 1 the solution to eq 16 is now of the form w x z cos x exp m z which implies m ϵ 2 1 1 2 substitution into the governing linear equations gives 40 u x z 1 2 m sin x exp m z 41 w x z 1 2 cos x exp m z 42 ρ x z 1 2 sin x exp m z 43 p x z 1 2 m sin x exp m z since the pairs p h x and u w are now π 2 out of phase in x the momentum flux and the lee wave drag are identically zero giving 44 f n h s ρ 0 u 3 n 1 0 when ϵ 1 therefore the background current is unaffected by steady flow over any small amplitude hill narrower than the lee wave wavelength λ l e e 2 π u n in this regime the vertical wavenumber m now increases with ϵ as a consequence with decreasing hill length p and u grow in magnitude while shrinking in vertical scale to a thin layer above the hills these are intrinsically nonhydrostatic processes and are impossible for hydrostatic simulations to capture note that the bifurcation of the lee wave solution around ϵ 1 depends on the scaling of the horizontal length with k 1 rather than l h i l l if we had instead formed a nonhydrostatic parameter as u n l h i l l as in baines 1995 we would have obscured this separation of regimes by a factor of 2 π this has resulted in some studies mischaracterizing the hydrostasy of lee waves for example gula et al 2018 and marez et al 2020 simulate lee waves in the gulf stream launched by a chain of linear height seamounts with minimum lengths of from 1 to 2 km and background conditions u n 100 m zheng et al 2012 such that the intuitive scaling gives u n l h i l l 0 01 0 05 small values that imply hydrostatic behavior as a result the authors employed a hydrostatic model to save computational resources however scaling with k 1 gives ϵ u k n 0 3 0 6 larger values that based on eq 39 suggest the true lee wave drag could be 5 20 smaller than reported 3 simulations 3 1 model set up we employ two dimensional x z simulations with the nonhydrostatic suntans model fringer et al 2006 because we consider only one dimensional linear height bathymetry and ignore rotation the physics are symmetrical in the span wise direction and there is no difference between two dimensional and three dimensional simulations indeed even with strong rotation and nonlinear height one dimensional bathymetry nikurashin et al 2014 showed there is little difference between two and three dimensional lee wave simulations for our simulations boundary conditions are periodic in the horizontal free slip on the bottom and top and the free surface is a rigid lid all simulations begin at rest with uniform linear stratification such that the buoyancy frequency n 0 002 rad s 1 they are then spun up to a target velocity of u 0 2 m s 1 using the adaptive forcing scheme of nelson and fringer 2017 this scheme nudges the flow with a uniform along stream pressure gradient that is recomputed with each time step to enforce a constant volume averaged horizontal velocity the values of u and n are typical for the abyssal ocean nikurashin and ferrari 2011 klymak 2018 and coastal regions such as the gulf stream zheng et al 2012 and set the characteristic vertical length scale to δ u n 100 m and the wavelength of the lee wave to λ l e e 2 π δ 628 m a primary goal of the simulations is to demonstrate the convergence of the lee wave drag to the linear theory in both hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic modes as such we simulate waves over idealized linear height bathymetry of sinusoidal shape h x 1 2 h 0 sin k x we keep the hill height fixed at h 0 2 m but vary the hill length l h i l l 4 2 1 0 5 km since n and u are fixed these bathymetric values give a linear height hill with j 0 02 and varying degrees of nonhydrostasy with ϵ 0 16 0 32 0 63 1 26 which includes the evanescent regime with one hill satisfying ϵ 1 the bathymetry is represented as a piecewise linear function referred to as cut cells zhang 2017 rather than the discontinuous stair stepping inherent to z grids this avoids both premature separation on the downslope as well as spurious evanescent waves from a stair stepping bottom and has been shown to provide much more accurate simulations of mountain waves adcroft et al 1997 to test convergence we vary the horizontal grid spacing over l h i l l 100 δ x l h i l l 4 or equivalently 0 06 k 1 δ x 1 57 k 1 to assess nonhydrostatic effects the suntans model is run in both hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic modes the vertical resolution is held fixed see below and is chosen to accurately resolve the vertical scale which is given by the vertical wavelength the depth in all simulations is d 7 km which is just over 11 lee wave wavelengths 11 λ l e e 6912 m to avoid reflections from the surface we use linear damping of perturbation horizontal velocity in a sponge layer that extends over the top 5 km of the domain this is enforced with a source term on the right hand side of the horizontal momentum equation of the form s u u τ s where τ s 2 τ 0 1 tanh z z s l s such that the strength of the damping smoothly transitions into the sponge layer beginning at distance above the floor z s 2000 m with a decay length scale of l s 1 2 λ l e e 314 m and a minimum damping timescale of τ 0 4 n 2000 s the vertical discretization employs a constant resolution of δ z 5 m in the bottom 2 km of the domain and then stretching over the remaining 5 km such that at the surface δ z t o p 300 m this is identical to the vertical grid in nikurashin and ferrari 2010 the vertical resolution near the bottom is δ z 5 m which is quite refined relative to the vertical scale of the lee wave of λ l e e 628 m such high vertical resolution minimizes errors with respect to δ z allowing us to focus on the nonhydrostatic effects dictated by convergence with respect to δ x all runs simulate 10 excitation periods where the excitation period is given by t e x l h i l l u in terms of the excitation period and the lee wave wavelength 45 c g ϵ u 2 π u l h i l l n u 2 π u n u l h i l l λ l e e t e x implying that in the hydrostatic limit where the group velocity is directed vertically eq 23 the wave propagates upward by one wavelength for each excitation period because the excitation period scales with the length of the bathymetry longer hills require longer simulation times that is for l h i l l 0 5 1 2 4 km and u 0 2 m s 1 t e x 0 7 1 4 2 8 5 6 hr and t s i m 0 3 0 6 1 2 2 3 days the kinematic viscosity is constant ν 0 01 m 2 s 1 and no turbulence model is employed shakespeare and hogg 2017 suggest that this value for ν is small enough to produce an effectively inviscid lee wave simulation this is especially true for a lee wave with linear height bathymetry and a free slip bottom boundary condition in which there are no instabilities in the system to drive significant gradients indeed test simulations with smaller viscosity produce little change in the measured lee wave drag ultimately the choice of ν was driven by balancing stability considerations and a desire to avoid using an unreasonably small time step these simulations employ second order accurate central differencing for advection of momentum which imposes the rather severe stability criterion on the size of the time step of δ t 2 ν u 2 0 5 s assuming u 0 w 0 u hence in all simulations we use δ t 0 1 s 3 2 nonhydrostatic effects in resolved simulations as derived above the nonhydrostatic pressure in lee waves permits the wavenumber vector to orient such that its magnitude is always equal to n u above variable wavenumber bathymetry eqs 20 and 23 in the hydrostatic limit ϵ 0 the wavenumber of the bathymetry effectively vanishes and the wavenumber vector points vertically as ϵ increases towards unity the wavenumber vector tilts increasingly downstream up to the limiting point in which the wavenumber of the bathymetry exactly equals the lee wave wavenumber and the wavenumber vector points horizontally downstream beyond this limit in which hills have wavenumbers larger than n u ϵ 1 there is no orientation in which the wavenumber vector can have magnitude n u and thus there is no propagating lee wave this functional dependence of the angle of the nonhydrostatic wavenumber vector on ϵ is given by eq 24 in hydrostatic simulations however the vertical wavenumber remains fixed at its hydrostatic value n u despite any variations in the wavenumber of the bathymetry hydrostatic simulations should thus produce a wavenumber vector with a different angle relative to the horizontal given in eq 25 furthermore because the vertical wavenumber in hydrostatic simulations is insensitive to the wavenumber of the bathymetry a hydrostatic model will still generate lee waves when ϵ 1 well resolved nonhydrostatic and hydrostatic simulations of lee waves should display these diverging characteristics fig 2 shows output from the highest resolution nonhydrostatic simulations for each of the four hill lengths the horizontal grid spacing in each is the same relative to the wavelength of the hill that is k δ x 0 063 the right panels in the figure show time series of the instantaneous wave drag over the course of the simulations nondimensionalized by f h s eq 38 note that all simulations begin by oscillating around the value f n h s eq 32 with maximum values of o f h s the period of these oscillations is precisely t e x from the standpoint of dimensional analysis this is not particularly surprising because although there are two time scales in the problem arising from the terms n and u only the latter of these relates to the forcing of the hill on the wave nevertheless recognizing t e x as the intrinsic lee wave time scale is an important observation from the standpoint of numerical modeling because it sets a lower bound on the necessary duration of a lee wave simulation for these linear height hills the oscillations decay within the first 3 to 4 excitation periods and the measured wave drag asymptotes to f n h s therefore we define steady state as the period given by 5 t e x t 8 t e x in what follows quantities with the overbar e g u are time averaged over this period the left panels in fig 2 display the average nondimensional perturbation horizontal velocity u u j u m note that this nondimensionalization includes the nonhydrostatic factor m 1 ϵ 2 1 2 as opposed to u 0 j u from eq 8 and keeps the magnitude of the nondimensional perturbation u constant across ϵ as predicted by nonhydrostatic linear theory the lee wave wavelength is also constant when ϵ 1 and its orientation tilts downstream with increasing ϵ also in agreement with linear theory the ϵ 1 length hill does not produce a propagating wave and exerts almost no drag upon reaching equilibrium note however that even in this ϵ 1 case the maximum instantaneous drag is of the same order as f h s this occurs because it still requires work to establish the evanescent disturbance to offer a qualitative assessment of the role of nonhydrostatic pressure in these simulations we show in the top panels of fig 3 the time averaged vertical momentum flux f x z ρ 0 u x z w x z nondimensionalized by f 0 eq 34 from the four nonhydrostatic simulations shown in fig 2 the bottom panels show the time averaged flux from the equivalent hydrostatic simulations as suggested by linear theory the difference between the nonhydrostatic and hydrostatic models over the longest hill ϵ 0 16 panels d and h is imperceptible while that over the narrowest hill ϵ 1 26 panels a and e is striking specifically the hydrostatic simulation over the 0 5 km hill ϵ 1 26 panel e generates a propagating lee wave even though ϵ 1 less striking but still significant is that the hydrostatic simulation above the 1 km hill ϵ 0 63 panel f retains a vertical periodicity of exactly the lee wave wavelength λ l e e while the nonhydrostatic simulation over this length hill panel b correctly permits the wavenumber vector to tilt downstream leading to a longer vertical wavelength more quantitatively fig 4 compares the angle of the simulated time averaged wavenumber vector to the predictions from nonhydrostatic and hydrostatic theory eqs 24 and 25 the angle was calculated by first determining the location of the maximum time averaged vertical velocity as a function of z which traces out a line of constant phase in the lee wave we then perform a linear least squares fit to determine the slope and thus the angle of the line of constant phase to the vertical which is equal to the angle of the wavenumber vector to the horizontal as they are sufficiently resolved both the simulated nonhydrostatic and hydrostatic wave angles agree with linear theory note that because the evanescent nonhydrostatic simulation does not produce a propagating wave it has a real k but an imaginary m implying θ 0 4 effect of horizontal grid resolution for an ocean model to resolve any type of wave it requires horizontal grid spacing fine enough to detect the horizontal gradients of said wave failure to satisfy this resolution requirement can result in numerically induced physics dominating the system for example when simulating solitary waves with a second order accurate discretization vitousek and fringer 2011 demonstrate that the horizontal gradients in the wave scale with the depth of the internal interface h 1 and thus the resolution must satisfy γ δ x h 1 2 1 to avoid numerically induced dispersion reducing the speed of the solitary wave additionally vitousek and fringer 2011 show that the numerically induced dispersion can cause a hydrostatic simulation to correctly predict the speed and wavelength of a nonhydrostatic solitary wave albeit for non physical reasons a similar analysis of the discrete lee wave system reveals that the horizontal gradients scale with the inverse bathymetric wavenumber k 1 and that poor horizontal grid spacing results in the model responding to a smaller effective bathymetric wavenumber k e with a corresponding adjustment to the predicted lee wave drag to derive the analytical expressions for these numerically induced physics we discretize the linear nondimensional steady lee wave equations eqs 14 15 and the nondimensional linear bottom boundary condition eq 17 using central differencing in space as an illustrative example of the process the second order accurate in space discretization of the bottom boundary condition is given by 46 w i x 0 h i 1 h i 1 2 δ x where the subscript i corresponds to the horizontal index of the grid point in the computational domain and δ x x i x i 1 k δ x is the nondimensional horizontal grid spacing expanding h i 1 and h i 1 with the taylor series produces the modified equivalent form of the bottom boundary condition 47 w e x 0 h x δ x 2 6 3 h x 3 o δ x 4 where the subscript e reflects that this is the modified equivalent form of the expression from linear theory eq 17 and we have dropped the subscript i because the equations hold for all discrete space inserting the sinusoidal bathymetry h 1 2 sin x implies the equivalent bottom boundary condition accurate to o δ x 4 48 w e x 0 1 2 1 δ x 2 6 cos x which is smaller in magnitude than the analytical solution for w x 0 eq 27 by the factor 1 δ x 2 6 discretizing the bottom boundary condition thus reduces the magnitude of the vertical velocity to one appropriate for a more hydrostatic hill length implying that we can rewrite the modified equivalent bottom boundary condition as 49 w e x 0 1 2 k e k cos x where 50 k e k 1 δ x 2 6 is the modified equivalent hill wavenumber recalling that the magnitude of the lee wave group velocity is equal to ϵ u eq 22 the discrete bottom boundary condition effects a modified equivalent group velocity with magnitude 51 c g e k e k ϵ u giving a modified equivalent group velocity that is slower than c g by a factor of 1 δ x 2 6 this is analogous to numerical dispersion slowing the propagation of solitary internal waves in vitousek and fringer 2011 performing the same discretization on the linear euler equations and cross differentiating gives the modified equivalent form of eq 16 52 w e 2 z 2 ϵ 2 w e 2 x 2 w e δ x 2 6 ϵ 2 w e 4 x 4 δ z 2 6 w e 4 z 4 o δ x 4 δ z 4 note that for a hydrostatic model where ϵ 0 the error from the horizontal discretization vanishes assuming a solution of the form w e 1 2 k e k cos x m e z and δ z 2 δ x 2 since the vertical grid is very fine the effective modified nondimensional vertical wavenumber to o δ x 4 δ z 2 is given by 53 m e 1 k e k ϵ 2 1 2 which is larger than the nonhydrostatic wavenumber eq 19 and thus more hydrostatic the second order accurate discretization of the linear euler equations therefore induces another error that also has the effect of making the flow more hydrostatic indeed at sufficiently coarse resolutions even an evanescent length hill ϵ 1 could generate a non imaginary vertical wavenumber if k e k ϵ 2 1 for example a hill with ϵ 1 and δ x 0 5 would have k e k 0 96 and thus the effective vertical wavenumber m e 0 2 note however that because f e is only asymptotically accurate to o δ x 4 it is only strictly valid for resolutions in the asymptotic limit δ x 4 δ x 2 finally following an identical derivation to that of the analytical wave drag eq 32 we arrive at the modified equivalent wave drag 54 f e k e k m e f h s 1 1 6 k δ x 2 1 ϵ 2 1 1 6 k δ x 2 1 2 f h s expanding the square root this gives 55 f e 1 ϵ 2 2 1 6 k δ x 2 ϵ 2 6 k δ x 2 o k δ x 4 ϵ 4 f h s discretization of the lee wave system thus introduces two competing effects on the wave drag first the discrete bottom boundary condition causes an attenuation of the amplitude of the lee wave by the amount k δ x 2 6 f h s secondly the nonhydrostatic discretization of the equations of motion results in an amplification of the vertical wavenumber which in turn increases the magnitude of the form drag by approximately ϵ 2 k δ x 2 6 f h s only the first of these effects persists in the hydrostatic limit or when using a hydrostatic model however in a coarsely resolved nonhydrostatic model over strongly nonhydrostatic bathymetry the second effect is not negligible lastly eq 54 offers an estimate of the resolution needed to achieve a desired precision for example generating a hydrostatic lee wave with 96 of the theoretical wave drag requires k δ x 6 1 96 0 5 or δ x 0 08 l h i l l although this conclusion simply confirms the general notion that resolving a physical phenomenon requires about ten grid points per length scale associated with that phenomenon connecting the numerical error to the physics is nevertheless a novel pursuit indeed as regional models increase their resolution to the point that they generate lee waves this result provides a useful analytical prediction of the numerical effects they should expect to illustrate the numerical effects in linear lee waves in fig 5 we show the simulated time averaged wave drags and overlay the equivalent modified wave drag f e eq 54 corresponding to each of the four hill lengths ϵ 16 32 63 1 26 as well as the hydrostatic equivalent modified wave drag given by evaluating f e with ϵ 0 the scaling of the axes in fig 5 causes the hydrostatic simulations dashed lines to collapse onto a single curve that converges to f f h s 1 and is very well approximated by the hydrostatic form of f e dotted magenta line at grid resolution smaller than k δ x 0 8 at coarser grid resolution the asymptotic theory used to derive f e is no longer valid and the hydrostatic ϵ 0 32 simulations perform better than predicted by f e although anticipated by both hydrostatic theory and f e it is nevertheless noteworthy that all of the hydrostatic simulations converge with grid refinement to the same hydrostatic lee wave drag f h s this occurs because the hydrostatic simulations generate lee waves with vertical wavenumbers equaling the hydrostatic value m n u and thus display waves with maximum perturbation pressure which linear theory shows to be proportional to m eq 29 likewise the nonhydrostatic simulations converge to the predictions from nonhydrostatic theory f f h s 1 ϵ 2 1 2 eq 39 which follows from the same reasoning as in the hydrostatic result with the difference that in the nonhydrostatic model the vertical wavenumber adjusts such that the magnitude of the wavenumber vector is a constant n u eqs 20 and 23 this nonhydrostatic adjustment to the vertical wavenumber entails an attenuation in the perturbation pressure away from its maximum hydrostatic value and an attendant attenuation of the wave drag for all but the evanescent 500 m length hill ϵ 1 26 the drag increases with grid refinement and is well approximated by f e for k δ x 0 8 again at coarser resolution where f e is not valid the ϵ 0 32 and ϵ 0 63 simulations perform better than predicted by f e the 500 m hill ϵ 1 26 presents the most surprising and from the standpoint of a modeler wishing to resolve lee waves the most discouraging result beginning with the hydrostatic model as in all of the hydrostatic simulations above longer hills those above the 500 m hill exhibit a lee wave with a hydrostatic vertical wavenumber and thus the full hydrostatic drag f h s the hydrostatic model thus dramatically over predicts the drag compared to the nonhydrostatic result of the drag free evanescent wave and as in all of the propagating length simulations the predicted drag increases with increasing grid refinement following the hydrostatic form of f e this implies that a hydrostatic ocean model will generate lee waves even when the horizontal scale of the bathymetry is less than the evanescent length thus producing erroneous numerical drag that increases with grid refinement the nonhydrostatic model on the other hand converges to the correct no drag result with grid refinement however with coarser resolution the nonhydrostatic model also incorrectly predicts a finite drag above the evanescent hill even with a reasonable resolution of k δ x 0 32 or δ x 25 m the nonhydrostatic model predicts a drag of 0 08 f h s although the modified equivalent wave drag f e with ϵ 1 26 dotted green line indicates that the nonhydrostatic model will produce numerically induced wave drag when m e is real this requires the coarse resolution of k δ x 1 48 a regime in which the asymptotic theory used to derive f e is not appropriate this suggests an alternative numerical effect not captured by our discretization analysis that dominates for simulations over evanescent hill lengths noting that the rate of convergence appears first order and that this is a strongly nonhydrostatic simulation it is likely that the numerical effect derives from the bottom boundary condition on the nonhydrostatic pressure which is not second order accurate with cut cells zhang 2017 it is also possible that it results from the o δ z 2 term that we neglected in order to simplify the derivation of m e eq 53 in any case this study shows that while the nonhydrostatic model significantly reduces the erroneous drag over evanescent length bathymetry extremely high resolution is needed to eliminate it for numerical studies focused on simulating the lee wave drag in a region dominated by linear height bathymetry the best solution could be to low pass filter the bathymetry to remove evanescent length components even when using a nonhydrostatic model however above less linear height bathymetry there may be nonlinear interactions between evanescent and propagating components of the bathymetry and low pass filtering the bathymetry might not be appropriate further research is required to determine the best course of action in this scenario nevertheless this study suggests that simulating lee wave drag over narrow hills is a precarious business to emphasize the potential for over predicting the true drag with the hydrostatic model in fig 6 we offer a rescaling of the time averaged drag from the three ϵ 1 length hills now nondimensionalizing by their respective values from nonhydrostatic linear theory f n h s eq 32 this plot does not show the evanescent case since the exact result is f n h s 0 which would yield f f n h s all nonhydrostatic results converge to f f n h s 1 and all hydrostatic results converge to f f n h s 1 ϵ 2 1 2 as observed in fig 5 the rates of convergence are well predicted by f e when k δ x 0 8 although for clarity we do not show f e here for the 1 km hill ϵ 0 63 the convergence of the hydrostatic model to f h s implies that the over prediction in drag caused by using a high resolution hydrostatic simulation asymptotes to 28 on the other hand using a nonhydrostatic model with coarser resolution over the same hill leads to an under prediction of the drag interestingly because drag predicted by the hydrostatic model also decreases with coarser resolution there exists a resolution where the two effects cancel and the hydrostatic model gives better predictions of the nonhydrostatic drag than the nonhydrostatic model for example based on our simulations the hydrostatic model with ϵ 0 63 would produce the correct drag f f n h s when k δ x 1 32 although the nonhydrostatic model would under predict the drag by 16 f 0 84 f n h s with this grid resolution note also that we can estimate this fortuitous resolution which we will denote as δ x l u c k by equating the hydrostatic form of equation f e eq 54 with ϵ 0 to f n h s eq 32 giving the relation 56 δ x l u c k 6 1 1 ϵ 2 1 2 1 2 with ϵ 0 63 this predicts δ x l u c k 1 16 which is close to the observed value of k δ x 1 32 even though this is much too coarse a resolution for f e to be asymptotically valid running the hydrostatic model at this coincidental resolution is thus a case of getting the right answer for the wrong reason and should not be taken as an endorsement for using coarse resolution hydrostatic models over nonhydrostatic bathymetry nevertheless this analysis points to the folly of blindly refining the grid without considering the nonhydrostatic effect with this in mind consider the hydrostatic simulations reported in klymak 2018 gula et al 2018 and marez et al 2020 where δ x 100 m λ l e e 2 π u n 628 m and the minimum hill lengths were l h i l l 1 2 km meaning ϵ 0 3 0 6 and k δ x 0 3 0 6 using f e we sketch this region in fig 6 with the cross hatch pattern in this range of grid resolution these simulations likely over predicted the drag from the narrowest components of their bathymetry by as much as 20 although a hydrostatic simulation over nonhydrostatic bathymetry results in an over prediction of the drag it is nevertheless significantly cheaper from a computational point of view fig 7 displays the ratio of computation time required for otherwise identical simulations run with nonhydrostatic pressure t n h s and without t h s the nonhydrostatic suntans model employs the block jacobi preconditioner to solve the pressure poisson equation with the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm which is less effective for increasing ϵ fringer et al 2006 thus for a given resolution the computational cost of a nonhydrostatic simulation increases with ϵ for example in the case of the strongly nonhydrostatic propagating length bathymetry l h i l l 1 km ϵ 0 63 with a resolution of k δ x 0 32 it takes roughly five times as long to run in nonhydrostatic mode as in hydrostatic mode while the same resolution over the most hydrostatic bathymetry ϵ 0 16 is only twice as time consuming however because the ϵ 0 16 hill is practically hydrostatic the difference between the hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic drag is very small i e f h s f n h s f h s 1 m 0 013 and thus there is little benefit to computing the nonhydrostatic pressure even if it is comparatively inexpensive in addition to the increasing cost related to increasing ϵ fig 7 also shows that for a given ϵ the expense of a nonhydrostatic simulation increases dramatically with grid refinement for example with ϵ 0 63 the nonhydrostatic overhead is roughly two when k δ x 0 63 and it increases to nearly twenty when k δ x 0 063 5 application to nonlinear lee waves unlike the simulations in the previous sections realistic abyssal hill bathymetry is often taller than u n and generates nonlinear lee waves in a separate paper we present a series of high resolution nonhydrostatic lee wave simulations over nonlinear height j o 1 sinusoidal bathymetry mayer and fringer 2020 the study reveals that for hills tall enough to cause blocking wherein stagnant water becomes trapped in the valleys the steady state overtopping flow behaves as if flowing over a new bathymetry defined by the time average lowest overtopping streamline lots whose height h e f f is always subcritical to the lee wave j e f f 1 furthermore we demonstrated that the lee wave drag can be computed by applying linear theory to the lots the accuracy of the drag measurement therefore depends on resolving the lots at appropriate scale for the associated linear lee wave implying that the resolution requirements identified in this paper are applicable to nonlinear lee waves mayer and fringer 2020 identified two common nonhydrostatic features of the lots that can render the entire lots evanescent even above bathymetry otherwise long enough to radiate lee waves the first nonhydrostatic process termed an evanescent undulation develops on the portion of the lots that separates the blocked layer from the overtopping flow for the more hydrostatic hills with ϵ 0 5 the streamline above the blocked layer develops a sinusoidal shape with a wavelength equal to λ l e e hence if treated as bathymetry this portion of the lots is evanescent with ϵ 1 and does not contribute to the wave drag the second nonhydrostatic component evanescent masking results from the blocked layer filling in so much of the valley that the portion of the streamline still connected to the bathymetry shrinks in length becoming shorter than λ l e e in the presence of evanescent masking the entirety of the lots is evanescent to the overtopping flow and the wave drag vanishes both of these phenomena are invisible to hydrostatic simulations as a result using a hydrostatic model with nonlinear height periodic bathymetry can result in significant over predictions of the wave drag to demonstrate as much this section presents hydrostatic versions of the j 2 simulations of mayer and fringer 2020 for the ϵ 0 16 0 32 0 63 length hills as in mayer and fringer 2020 the horizontal resolution of all simulations in this section is δ x 10 m fig 8 shows snapshots of the nondimensional vorticity in the l h i l l 2 km simulation with and without nonhydrostatic pressure over the first 2 5 t e x note the hydrostatic simulations generate a vertically propagating lee wave with a narrow grid scale wavelength from the jump like feature in the lots associated with its separation from the bathymetry downstream of the separation the lots is relatively quiescent showing no indication of evanescent undulations the jump like feature is similar to the result in vitousek and fringer 2011 in which hydrostatic simulations produce grid scale solitary waves with numerical dispersion balancing the nonlinear steepening it thus appears that in the absence of nonhydrostatic dispersion needed to generate the evanescent undulations the hydrostatic model produces a strong jump with a width of a few grid spaces fig 9 shows the drag as a function of time for the l h i l l 2 km simulations in fig 8 we display two measurements of the drag 1 the form drag f f o r m eq 30 computed using the simulated pressure and the analytical bathymetry and 2 the wave drag f f l u x eq 35 computed by integrating the vertical momentum flux through a horizontal plane 15 m above the bathymetry as shown in mayer and fringer 2020 the two measurements are identical when the lee wave reaches steady state indicating that all of the momentum removed from the background flow by the form drag is radiated away in the lee wave by the momentum flux there is however a saturation limit to the momentum flux before a stably stratified fluid collapses into instability approximated by pierrehumbert 1987 as 57 f s a t ρ 0 u 3 n 1 indeed in fig 9 both of the l h i l l 2 km simulations show the wave drag f f l u x saturating at o f s a t within the first t e x of the simulation any form drag larger than this saturation limit cannot radiate as momentum flux and must therefore contribute to local changes in momentum in mayer and fringer 2020 we demonstrate that for the spin up of supercritical lee wave simulations the form drag is always momentarily much larger than the momentum flux with a maximum close to the linear prediction f n h s because the form drag is temporarily acting to establish the blocked layer this tendency is well represented in the nonhydrostatic l h i l l 2 km simulation of fig 9 the hydrostatic simulation also produces excess form drag during spin up however the time series has two local maximums with the first better approximated by twice the linear prediction for hydrostatic lee waves 2 f h s after the blocked layer stabilizes both simulations show the form and wave drag coming into equilibrium however the hydrostatic simulation again produces more drag than its nonhydrostatic companion the hydrostatic over prediction of drag both in the spin up phase and in the quasi steady phase is a numerical artifact it results from the hydrostatic simulation permitting the short length scale components of the lots to generate drag producing lee waves while the nonhydrostatic simulation correctly treats these features as evanescent fig 10 shows the time averaged vorticity for the six simulations the three nonhydrostatic simulations top panels demonstrate the evanescent processes very well the l h i l l 1 km simulation top left offers an especially satisfying demonstration of evanescent masking and evanescent undulations above the blocked layer are evident for both the 2 km and the 4 km top center and top right hills faint lee waves can be seen propagating at an angle downstream from the beginning of the blocked layer where the lots separates from the bathymetry by contrast all of the hydrostatic simulations bottom panels produce a persistent vertically propagating lee wave from the beginning of the blocked layer in the l h i l l 1 km simulation the wave has an especially narrow horizontal wavelength smaller than λ l e e and is therefore not physical the time averaged drag for these ϵ 0 63 0 32 0 16 simulations is f n h s f s a t 0 02 0 06 0 14 for the nonhydrostatic simulations and f h s f s a t 0 12 0 28 0 29 for the hydrostatic simulations note there is very little difference in the drag between the hydrostatic l h i l l 2 km and 4 km simulations this is because all the drag is generated by the narrow width lee wave at the separation point the rest of the blocked layer is flat the hydrostatic model thus predicts a factor of f n h s f h s 7 4 4 6 2 0 more drag than the nonhydrostatic models compared to the result from linear theory in which the over prediction is given by f n h s f h s 1 ϵ 2 1 2 1 29 1 06 1 01 eq 39 we see that the supercritical lee wave accentuates the nonhydrostatic effects and linear theory serves as a lower bound for f h s f s a t note that with δ x λ l e e 0 016 the nonhydrostatic models also over predict the drag in these simulations because they do not have enough resolution to generate fully evanescent lee waves as demonstrated in section 4 thus the ratio f h s f n h s offers a conservative estimate for how much a hydrostatic simulation of a j 2 lee wave over predicts the lee wave drag even in the most hydrostatic of these simulations with ϵ 0 16 the hydrostatic simulation produces twice as much drag as its nonhydrostatic counterpart while in the linear regime an ϵ 0 16 length hill should be well simulated by a hydrostatic simulation hence these nonlinear simulations offer further support for the general notion that lee waves are essentially nonhydrostatic features of ocean currents and the ocean modeler is cautioned against treating them as otherwise 6 conclusion in this paper we derived a nondimensional form of the linear theory for lee wave drag above sinusoidal bathymetry and used suntans with and without the nonhydrostatic pressure to demonstrate the convergence to theory of wave drag in simulated lee waves above bathymetry of linear height j 1 and varying length ϵ 0 16 0 32 0 63 1 26 using central differencing in space we derived a modified equivalent form of the steady lee wave drag f e eq 54 accurate to o δ x 4 δ z 2 where δ x k δ x and δ z n u δ z which shows that discretizing the lee wave system results in two forms of numerically induced physics one effecting the magnitude of the group velocity vector and the other its direction both of these numerically induced physics can be viewed as making the wave more hydrostatic and yet they have opposite effects on the magnitude of the lee wave drag the primary source of numerical physics results from the discretization of the bottom boundary condition which results in a modification of the lee wave drag by the factor k e k 1 1 6 k δ x 2 we observed that f e correctly predicted the convergence of our numerical simulations to the predictions of linear theory for k δ x 0 8 meaning that f e offers a good estimate of the precision of a lee wave simulation such that for example achieving 96 accuracy requires k δ x 0 5 or about δ x 0 08 l h i l l in both the abyssal ocean and coastal regions such as the gulf stream typical bathymetry that generates lee waves has horizontal length scales of o km goff and arbic 2010 zheng et al 2012 resolving the resulting lee wave drag thus requires horizontal grid spacing of δ x o 100 m at the finest resolutions in this study k δ x 0 063 the lee waves display wavenumber vectors that agree with those predicted by linear theory specifically in the nonhydrostatic model the pressure allows the magnitude of the wavenumber vector to remain fixed at n u thus requiring the vertical component of the wavenumber vector to decrease as m n u 1 ϵ 2 1 2 in the hydrostatic model however the vertical component of the wavenumber vector remains fixed at the value given by the hydrostatic limit m h s n u irrespective of the wavenumber of the bathymetry over nonhydrostatic bathymetry this implies that hydrostatic models generate larger magnitude pressure perturbations than dynamically required resulting in an over prediction of the wave drag our simulations demonstrate that this over prediction converges to that predicted by the comparison of hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic linear theory f n h s m f h s where m 1 ϵ 2 1 2 additionally for evanescent length hills ϵ 1 the nonhydrostatic drag vanishes f n h s 0 which is in stark contrast to hydrostatic simulations above evanescent hills which still generate a hydrostatic lee wave producing the full hydrostatic drag f h s at coarser resolutions for all but the nonhydrostatic model above the evanescent bathymetry the computed drags were lower than those predicted by theory in accordance with f e therefore coarsely resolved hydrostatic simulations can produce the correct nonhydrostatic drag but for the wrong reason on the other hand for the nonhydrostatic model above evanescent bathymetry the coarser resolution simulations generate significant drag even though it should vanish indeed even at a resolution of δ x 25 m k δ x 0 32 the nonhydrostatic model still predicts drag of o 0 1 f h s this is a particularly unwelcome discovery as it suggests that both hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic simulations of stratified flow over evanescent length bathymetry will produce numerically induced lee waves unless they employ spectacularly fine resolution finally in the supercritical j 1 regime with periodic bathymetry where blocking results in wave drag saturation we showed that hydrostatic lee wave simulations dramatically over predict the drag even above hydrostatic length bathymetry due to a non physical representation of the blocked layer as a whole this paper has demonstrated that resolving lee waves requires the dual constraint of very fine horizontal grid spacing and computation of the nonhydrostatic pressure failure to satisfy the resolution requirement generally results in a moderate under prediction of drag while failure to compute the nonhydrostatic pressure results in an over prediction of the drag which is negligible above hydrostatic length and linear height bathymetry but becomes dramatic as ϵ 1 or j 1 satisfying both of these constraints is computationally expensive in cases where the nonhydrostatic pressure is important the time required to run a sufficient resolution nonhydrostatic model was found to be about five times that of an otherwise identical hydrostatic model however above nonhydrostatic length bathymetry ϵ o 0 1 this paper demonstrates that choosing only to improve resolution without also computing the nonhydrostatic

23921,it has been known for some time that the ocean basins are populated by what is known as zonal jets deep zonal jets or striations since the oceanic flow is at least weakly chaotic it is not known whether the positions of the jets are deterministic that is entirely determined by external parameters a number of theories have been proposed to explain them some of them predicting zonal jets at fixed latitudes and others implying that the positions of the jets are random to investigate how deterministic the zonal jets are in the eastern north pacific a ten member ensemble of long term integrations of a semi global eddy resolving ocean general circulation model is analyzed the positions of the equatorial jets even their variability seem to obey deterministic dynamics and some of the jets in the tropics 5 15 n migrate poleward coherently similarly between ensemble members the jets in the subtropics 15 45 n systematically migrate equatorward but their positions are less coherent the jets in the subpolar region 45 n are random and without systematic migration jets near the coast of north and south america tend to have shorter meridional wavelengths than interior ones and those in the northern hemisphere are fairly coherent whereas those in the southern hemisphere seem more random there are a few quasi barotropic jets which are anchored to steep bottom topographic features and which also appear to trap shallower counter flows on their poleward and equatorward flanks keywords deep zonal jets eddy resolving ocean general circulation model ensemble deterministic chaos 1 introduction the ocean basins are populated by zonal jets or striations everywhere e g hogg and owens 1999 sinha and richards 1999 treguier et al 2003 nakano and hasumi 2005 maximenko et al 2005 kamenkovich et al 2009 divakaran and brassington 2011 cravatte et al 2012 2017 except for the few well known examples and for the equatorial zonal flows see below the zonal jets are not well understood there may be different kinds arising from different mechanisms below we first review the zonal jets in general sections 1 1 1 3 this discussion potentially applies to all zonal jets except for the equatorial zonal flows we then touch upon the equatorial zonal flows and near equatorial tropical in this paper jets section 1 4 as it is not quite clear where the influence of equatorial dynamics ends and from which latitudes the zonal jets start to dominate we finally discuss the scientific issue this paper tackles section 1 5 and state the purpose and plan of the present paper section 1 6 1 1 zonal jets below the main pycnocline zonal velocity averaged over one year or more tends to show narrow 100 km alternating flows that tend to extend vertically down to 1000 3000m depth e g divakaran and brassington 2011 richards et al 2006 cravatte et al 2017 and zonally many thousands of kilometers e g nakano and hasumi 2005 cravatte et al 2017 their iso phase lines are often somewhat tilted from the zonal direction e g nakano and hasumi 2005 richards et al 2006 maximenko et al 2008 van sebille et al 2011 near the surface and in the main pycnocline the instantaneous flow field is dominated by mesoscale eddies and the zonal jets are not clear in snapshots of velocity e g berloff et al 2011 moreover even in long term mean they are often masked by the general circulation in the upper ocean and become visible only in meridionally highpass filtered fields maximenko et al 2005 divakaran and brassington 2011 taguchi et al 2012 as a result the lagrangian trajectories of water parcels would not be zonal where the meridional component of the large scale flow is significant maximenko et al 2008 in this case some authors prefer the term striations in place of jets maximenko et al 2008 in the present paper we keep using the term jets for convenience and simplicity 1 2 variability and migration richards et al 2006 found in an eddy resolving oceanic general circulation model ogcm simulation a previous version of the model we use in the present study see section 2 1 that the jets tend to migrate equatorward within the latitudinal bands of 20 30 n and 20 30 s in the pacific with a phase speed of about 0 045m s and a period of about 4yr boland et al 2012 proposed a mechanism in which a large scale bottom slope causes the phase lines of jets to tilt from the zonal direction and the jets to migrate in the meridional direction see also khatri and berloff 2018 2019 nakano et al 2018 detected a systematic interannual southward migration of surface fronts at 0 002 m s downstream of the kuroshio extension in satellite sea surface height data 1 3 theories various theories have been proposed to explain the spatial structures of off equatorial outside 5 latitude zonal jets berloff et al 2009 provide in their introduction a comprehensive review of theories that had been proposed by then it has been known that mesoscale eddies produce zonal jets in idealized models a randomly forced idealized ocean tends to produce a set of zonal jets e g berloff 2005 scott and dritschel 2012 and an ocean under a large scale forcing which undergoes instability does so too e g panetta 1993 treguier and panetta 1994 that suggests that the jets are inherent to the ocean as long as there are mesoscale eddies kamenkovich et al 2009 one mechanism often invoked e g sinha and richards 1999 nakano and hasumi 2005 richards et al 2006 to explain how eddies lead to a series of alternating zonal jets is usually termed the rhines effect originally conceived by rhines 1975 there is a debate whether the rhines effect really works as rhines 1975 conceived sukoriansky et al 2007 under this mechanism the strength of eddies and the planetary beta determine the meridional distances between the jets and there is no reason that the positions of the jets are fixed to some preferred latitudes unless there are preferred places for eddies to be located islands coastal geometry or bottom topography could provide such preferred places as well as potentially provide fine scale forcing to the jets maximenko et al 2008 identified a set of stationary alternating zonal jets striations off california and chile in a surface geostrophic flow field derived from a mean ssh dataset in geostrophic flow derived from a collection of xbt data and in an ogcm which is the previous version of the model we use in the present study see section 2 1 as well as in fine scale temperature anomaly over the top 400m from the xbt and ogcm data remarkably the positions of some of these observed jets agree with those from the ogcm because these jets are found not far from the coast the authors conjecture that they are probably generated by some coastal processes one such coastal process has been identified if there is concentrated vertical motion or concentrated curl of reynolds stress or wind stress anchored at an island or a coastal feature of the eastern boundary it will drive zonally extended jets jia 2000 özgökmen and crisciani 2001 maximenko et al 2008 melnichenko et al 2010 belmadani et al 2013 davis et al 2014 this feature is sometimes called the beta plume the azores current jia 2000 and the hawaiian lee countercurrent xie et al 2001 sasaki and nonaka 2006 sasaki et al 2006 are regarded as an example of this mechanism davis et al 2014 found that most zonal jets extend from north america in their eddy permitting ogcm and argue that beta plume is the main cause of the zonal jets a related mechanism is proposed by hristova et al 2008 and wang et al 2012 who demonstrated that unstable modes of an eastern boundary current can lead to alternating zonal flows that resemble the zonal jets melnichenko et al 2010 examined the vorticity and potential vorticity pv balance of the jets striations identified by maximenko et al 2008 near the west coast of north and south america and found that the eddy thickness flux e g gent and mcwilliams 1990 significantly contributes to the pv balance indicating a non negligible role of nonlinear eddy mean flow interaction they however also suggest that linear mechanisms such as the beta plume may be regulating or guiding the positions of the jets this idea may apply to other situations the jets themselves may arise from some eddy mean flow interaction but their positions may be controlled by rossby waves emanating from the coast by bottom topography or by islands berloff et al 2009 proposed a mechanism by which a structure similar to the zonal jets emerges from a multi stage instability of large scale flow according to this mechanism the meridional distance between the jets is determined ultimately by the large scale flow but the positions of the jets are random qiu et al 2013 found that in a nonlinear 1 5 layer model annual rossby waves are unstable generating a set of eddies which in turn generate zonal jets they argue that meridional spacing between the jets originates from the meridional wavelength of the unstable mode and also that the resultant series of zonal jets is anchored at the equator according to this argument the positions of the jets are fixed relatively to the equator and determined by given parameters such as the stratification and the wind stress that forces the annual rossby waves 1 4 equatorial and tropical jets latitude 10 15 along and near the equator latitude 5 there is a different class of zonal jets to the off equatorial zonal jets discussed above it is not clear whether the tropical jets latitude 10 15 are dynamically similar to the off equatorial zonal jets or dynamically connected to the equatorial jets ménesguen et al 2019 since our results below pertain partly to the equatorial and tropical jets section 3 here we very briefly review these flows see cravatte et al 2017 and ménesguen et al 2019 for comprehensive reviews about these jets for a visual aid refer to fig 2 below the equatorial undercurrent euc

a k a north and south equatorial countercurrents e g johnson et al 2002 are regarded as essentially driven by large scale winds e g mccreary 1981 pedlosky 1987 hua et al 2003 furue et al 2007 2009 there are some more jet like zonal flows on and near the equator whose dynamics are less well understood below the euc there is a westward equatorial intermediate current eic e g firing 1987 rowe et al 2000 and below it there is a set of alternating zonal flows called the equatorial deep jets edjs with a vertical wavelength of 400 600m e g firing 1987 ascani et al 2015 on the poleward sides of this structure there are tall eastward flows at 2 extending from 500m to at least 1500m firing 1987 ascani et al 2015 we borrow cravatte et al s 2017 terminology and call these tall eastward flows the north and south intermediate countercurrents nicc and sicc poleward of these are several more alternating jets cravatte et al 2017 ménesguen et al 2019 1 5 deterministic chaos deterministic chaos or simply chaos was made well known by lorenz s 1963 work on a simple dynamical system representing an aspect of atmospheric circulation the discovery of chaos was remarkable because a deterministic dynamical system exhibits unpredictable behaviors starting from very slightly different initial conditions a chaotic system evolves into significantly different states after a while some aspects or features of the system therefore are not predictable in practice even though it is a deterministic system in principle e g kalnay 2003 section 6 4 of her book shukla s 1998 introduction offers a concise review of this issue since oceanic mesoscale eddies originate from instability where nonsignificant perturbation grows to finite amplitude the phases of eddies are usually unpredictable for slower variabilities seasonal and slower some chaotic behaviors have also been recognized for the western boundary current e g dijkstra and ghil 2005 nonaka et al 2016 that is the interannual to decadal variability of the kuroshio and the gulf stream and their eastward extensions are not entirely determined by external forcing such as winds two integrations of a high resolution ogcm under identical forcing and boundary conditions and started from slightly different initial conditions can and will develop significantly different pathways for the western boundary current dijkstra and ghil 2005 nonaka et al 2016 this poses an interesting and important question when interpreting an observed oceanic flow field does a current found in the observed data have to be there when validating a result of a numerical model against observation one has to know what aspects of the modeled field should agree with the observation for an obvious example in general the phases of the modeled mesoscale eddies do not have to agree with those of the observed eddies because of the chaotic nature of the eddies and therefore reproducing the phases of eddies is not a goal of improving non data assimilated numerical models 1 6 present study then what about the zonal jets are their positions determined by external forcing so that the positions of modeled jets need to agree with those of observations or are their positions random in the same sense as the phases of mesoscale eddies are random it is also an interesting question whether the phases of the migrating jets section 1 2 are determined by external forcing or not answering these questions will give constraints to theories as some theories predict the positions of the zonal jets as a function of external parameters and other theories predict only the meridional spacing between the jets section 1 3 to answer these questions requires an ensemble of realizations the most common and straightforward way to obtain an ensemble is to run the same numerical model repeatedly under the same forcing and boundary conditions starting from slightly different initial conditions if the positions of the zonal jets agree between the members of the ensemble the positions are likely determined uniquely by external parameters for convenience we term this situation deterministic and we call such jets coherent if the positions of the zonal jets are different between the ensemble members they are likely random in this study we examine a 10 member ensemble of 50 yr runs of a semi global eddy resolving model our goal is to explore and document various statistical behaviors and properties of the zonal jets in the time space and ensemble dimensions to answer the above questions in this study we focus on the pacific ocean because some of the key past studies are on this ocean e g nakano and hasumi 2005 maximenko et al 2005 richards et al 2006 cravatte et al 2017 further we mainly focus on the eastern pacific north of the equator because as we shall see the structures of the zonal jets are clearest and simplest there the rest of this paper is organized as follows the next section describes this ogcm and the ensemble of runs the results are shown in section 3 and summarized and discussed in section 4 the main text includes only essential figures to support the main conclusions the supplementary

reanalysis product tsujino et al 2018 along the artificial northern and southern boundaries the model temperature and salinity are restored toward the monthly climatological values from world ocean

al 2005 the initial condition of the standard run is a state of rest with the temperature and salinity fields of 1 january 1958 of ofes version 1 masumoto et al 2004 sasaki et al 2008 ofes2 has been integrated up to the end of year 2018 so far besides this standard run we have an ensemble of ten integrations under the same boundary conditions the only difference being the initial condition the initial temperature and salinity fields of these ten runs are those of the 3rd 5th and 21st of january 1965 of the ofes2 standard run they are integrated up to the end of 2016 in this study we call them m01 m02 and m10 nonaka et al 2020 a similar three member ensemble with ofes version 1 was discussed by nonaka et al 2016 in this study we use monthly averages from the model output 2 2 averages we use a moving sliding average with the hann window blackman and tukey 1959 see also suppl s2 for temporal low pass filtering to extract the jet like flows by removing mesoscale eddies because of the smoothness of hann filter in the frequency space suppl s2 one year averages tend still to include significant seasonal cycle not shown to extract features that change more slowly therefore we use the 23 point 2 year version of hann filter with the quarter power half amplitude frequency at 0 5 cycles per year suppl s2 the same approach was used by gouriou and delcroix 2002 to extract variability at periods longer than 12 months in what follows we use the notation q for an arbitrary quantity q to denote this 2 year moving average richards et al 2006 also used a two year running average to extract the zonal jets on the other hand we denote the ensemble average the average over the m 10 ensemble members by q note that the ensemble average commutes with the lowpass filter q 1 m m 1 m d t h t t q m t d t h t t 1 m m 1 m q m t q where h t t is the window function of the moving average suppl s2 and q m is the variable q from ensemble member m for this reason we calculate only one of q and q in extracting jet like structures from the velocity field the temporal moving average and ensemble average have different characteristics if the axis of the jet is stationary the lowpass filter weakens variability associated with eddies for each ensemble member without weakening or broadening the jet but when the axis moves it weakens and broadens the jet on the other hand if the jet is a deterministic feature the ensemble average weakens eddies at each time without weakening or broadening the jet even if it moves in time if in contrast the axis position is different between the ensemble members the average weakens and broadens the jet 2 3 measures of variability a natural measure of ensemble spread i e how different the ensemble members are from each other is the variance 1 var q q q 2 and the square root of this quantity is the ensemble standard deviation one can however expect that the standard deviation will tend to be large where internal variability is large although this is not always true as we shall see below therefore another measure of ensemble spread is the standard deviation normalized by a measure of internal variability for the deep zonal jet we calculate the interannual variability of low passed field u over a certain period and use it to normalize the ensemble standard deviation 2 var u l var l u 1 2 where the overline with l indicates a temporal average over 1995 2014 and var l q is the long term variance var l q q q l 2 l as a measure of mesoscale eddy activity we use u u u 1 where u 1 is the moving average of u with the 1 year hann filter the 2 year average defined above is not used for this purpose because the deviation from it would then include more seasonal variability the eddy activity is then defined as u 2 l we use this quantity as a proxy of the proper eddy kinetic energy eke which includes the v component to avoid processing one more huge dataset just to plot eke this quantity shown later in fig 4d has a similar spatial distribution to that of surface eddy kinetic energy derived from surface drifters maximenko et al 2009 it is also similar to the distribution of sea surface height ssh variability shown by sasaki et al 2020 for the ofes2 standard run except at the equator where the variability of ssh associated with velocity variability is much weaker 2 4 detection of axis position we use a very simple method to detect jet axes separately for eastward and westward jets for a fixed longitude depth and time we determine the latitudes of local maxima in u y that is the latitudes y such that u y u y δ y and u y u y δ y with δ y 1 10 we then retain only those latitudes where u 0 eastward the axis positions of westward jets are analogously defined they are the latitudes of minima in u such that u 0 this simple scheme should give a reasonable skill at detecting the axes of the zonal jets fig 1 shows a meridional section of zonal velocity at 500m along 140 w as an example the velocity profile is surprisingly smooth and regular perhaps less so in the 15 n 30 n latitudinal range sometimes there is a tiny local minimum with in a single jet which the above scheme will erroneously give two axes close to each other this problem is alleviated by collecting nearby local maxima into a somewhat coarser gridbox as below we next define an index n i j z t e which indicates the existence or absence of an eastward jet axis within the gridbox i j z t e where e is the ensemble member number e 1 m n i j z t e 1 if the gridbox contains at least one axis and n 0 otherwise below we use both the original grid 0 1 0 1 and a somewhat coarser 0 3 0 3 grid finally the index n i j z t e 1 m n i j z t e is a measure of agreement between the ensemble members n m if all members have an axis in the gridbox and n 0 if none of them has an axis there 3 results 3 1 comparison with cravatte et al 2017 cravatte et al 2017 show two kinds of zonal velocity field one a composite of various meridional sections with acoustic doppler current profilers adcp taken during 1999 2015 and the other a geostrophic calculation based on a gridded climatological temperature and salinity dataset from the argo array over 2004 2014 referenced to a 1000 m depth horizontal velocity field estimated from the trajectories of argo floats at their parking depths cravatte et al 2017 show that the two fields quantitatively agree including the positions of the zonal jets the method of using argo is probably the only way to obtain the three dimensional structure of the zonal jets from observation except in regions like the tropical pacific where adcp profiles have been repeatedly taken we have looked into such a dataset produced by gray and riser 2014 it has turned out however that the velocity field in this dataset is somewhat too smooth to resolve the zonal jets here we compare cravatte et al s 2017 zonal velocity with our model s we choose their meridional section averaged over 160 w 120 w which includes the longitude 140 w we focus on below for a comparison of the horizontal flow pattern see fig s1 since it is not clear which years have most influence on cravatte et al s composites of observations we have looked at all 2 4 8 10 year averages within years 2004 2014 from member m01 to compare our velocity field with cravatte et al s fig 2a is their geostrophic velocity based on argo and fig 2b is one of the most similar by eye plots from our model which is an average over years 2011 2012 the averaging period 2005 2014 for the other model plot fig 2c is similar to that of the argo data cravatte et al 2017 use there is one eastward flow below the eic westward in the model but not in the observation below this eastward flow in the ogcm there are more westward and eastward alternating flows on the equator with a vertical wavelength of 300 400m these properties suggest that they are the equatorial deep jets edjs firing 1987 ascani et al 2015 matthießen et al 2017 greatbatch et al 2018 the velocity field based on argo does not show this feature and the adcp composite not shown does not go deep enough in the section to the west 179 e 160 w cravatte et al 2017 show however the adcp composite shows a strong hint of the edjs fig s2 while the argo velocity does not the model shows somewhat clearer edjs there than in the 160 w 120 w range fig s2 on the poleward sides of the edjs are eastward flows at 1 5 that extend from 500m depth beyond the bottom of the plot this feature is clearer in fig 2c for the model they have several cores in the vertical in the ogcm whereas they extend relatively uniformly in the vertical in the observation these flows must be the nicc and sicc section 1 but it is not clear why they are separated into several cores in the ogcm the latitude of the nicc core of the model is not as vertically uniform above 700m as that of the observation off the equator in the northern hemisphere the meridional wavelength distance between eastward jets is somewhat larger in the model than in the observation for example at the depth of 500m there are eastward jets at 4 n and 14 n sandwiching two more in the model whereas there are eastward jets at 4 5 n and 13 n sandwiching two more in the observation the vertical structures of the eastward jets have some differences some of the jets slant poleward or equatorward and the directions of the slants are different between the model and observation and the cores of the second and third eastward jets are much higher in the water column in the model the fourth jet is much broader and weaker in the model the peak strengths of the other three eastward jets are above 1 5cm s both in the model and observation the three westward jets between these four eastward jets have similar differences and similarities in the southern hemisphere the meridional wavelength is similar between the model and observation the jets are less well defined weaker and broader in the model the fifth 14 s through seventh 18 s eastward jets are missing from the model it is not clear whether there should be one to one correspondence between the model and observation because there is considerable temporal variability at least in the ogcm for example an average over a longer period 2005 2014 fig 2c shows weaker jets another possibility is that the positions of the jets are random see section 1 the temporal variability and ensemble spread of the jets are discussed below most of these conclusions hold for the section to the west 179 e 160 w cravatte et al 2017 show fig s2 3 2 ensemble spread 3 2 1 evolution before focusing on the statistics of the deep jets we first examine broadly how the ensemble members differ fig 3 shows a measure of the ensemble spread along 140 w for which we show other statistics below the reason for the choice of this longitude will become clear below as we examine the flow field two latitude bands 10 30 n and 45 60 n are selected because the ensemble spread of the two year mean velocity u is generally largest there along 140 w not shown initially the ensemble spread quickly increases and then after 5 10yr it flattens out with large interannual oscillation remaining the timescale of this initial growth is similar to and perhaps somewhat longer than that nonaka et al 2016 found for the development of ensemble spread of the kuroshio extension although it is not very clear from this graph the ensemble spread for the 45 60 n band seems to grow faster than the other band this difference could be due to the different distances from the eastern boundary because some disturbances like mesoscale eddies and rossby waves propagate westward from the continent this result suggests that 10 years is long enough for the ensemble to fully spread the interannual to decadal variability in fig 3 could be related to variability in external forcing or could just be due to insufficient statistics the latter is a hypothesis that the variability would vanish with a sufficiently large number of ensemble members in the analysis below we choose year 2010 the 36th year as an example 3 2 2 horizontal distribution the horizontal distribution of the ensemble spread at 500m depth is shown in fig 4a the distribution off the equator is generally very similar to that of the interannual variability fig 4b this similarity was noted by nonaka et al 2016 for sea surface height variability in the north pacific there are local maxima off california and alaska but into the interior the variability generally increase toward the west it is interesting that the hawaiian island chain appears to block the westward spreading of the variability other island chains tend to have similar impacts the mechanism of this tendency is not clear but as we shall see below topographic features tend to anchor deep zonal jets and the low variability of the low passed field may be because of this effect another possibility is that the islands block rossby waves reducing variability in their western wakes in the subpolar north pacific both ensemble and temporal standard deviations are generally small but include small scale regions of higher variability figs 4a and 4b the most conspicuous difference between the temporal and ensemble variabilities is along the equator fig 4c despite the large temporal variability the ensemble spread tends to be relatively small there indicating that the equatorial variability in u is controlled by external forcing or by otherwise deterministic dynamics this point will be discussed later section 4 2 1 it is interesting that between 10 s and 20 n the ensemble spread is small despite the moderate temporal variability suggesting that the temporal variability is relatively coherent similar between ensemble members there likewise the ensemble spread tends to be weak fig 4c in the subtropical south pacific south of the band 10 s 20 s of moderate variability the kuroshio extension extending eastward from japan along 35 n has extremely large variability but its ensemble variability is somewhat smaller than its temporal variability in the downstream part of the extension fig 4c nonaka et al 2020 explore this feature in ofes2 a measure of fast mesoscale variability is plotted in fig 4d its distribution is broadly similar to that of the temporal variability of u mesoscale variability may be somehow related to the slower variability of u in general it is however interesting that the fast variability is not weaker on the west side of the hawaiian island chain whereas it is weaker on the west side of the mariana islands 145 e 15 n in the central subpolar and northern subtropical regions of the north pacific the fast variability is very weak whereas both the ensemble spread and the temporal variability are moderately large there 3 3 plan view of deep zonal jets fig 5 plots the zonal velocity field at 500m depth to show a typical horizontal structure of the jets in the pacific fig 5a is a monthly mean field from one ensemble member some well known permanent currents are visible the westward flowing blue eic over 150 w 120 w right on the equator the nicc and sicc at 2 from the equator see also fig 2 over 170 e 150 w and the eastward flowing kuroshio extension along 35 n extending eastward from japan the westward currents on the poleward flanks of the nicc and sicc jets seem to be also a commonly found feature fig 2 cravatte et al 2017 besides these currents the ocean is filled with wiggly filament like structures in the latitude bands of 30 s 15 s and 15 n 30 n in the east the phase lines of the zonal velocity tend to be oriented from the poleward westward to equatorward eastward directions nw se in the northern hemisphere and sw ne in the southern hemisphere as was found in past studies nakano and hasumi 2005 richards et al 2008 between 5 n and 10 n in the east the phase lines tend to tilt in the opposite way sw ne near the coast of the americas the meridional scale of the jets seems somewhat smaller than that of offshore ones in the latitudinal bands of 20 s 40 s and 20 n 50 n these jets probably correspond or are related to the stationary striations maximenko et al 2008 identified these fine scale structures can be generally viewed as a superposition of mesoscale variability and zonal jets indeed the low passed field fig 5b reveals a set of zonal jets as is well known see section 1 particularly in the eastern pacific north of 20 s some of these jets revealed in the low passed field can be identified as known currents which are obscured by eddies in the monthly mean field such as the secondary southern tsuchiya jet rowe et al 2000 which flows eastward red just to the south of the primary southern tj at 4 s see also fig 2b the primary tj is confined above 500m and does not show up in fig 5b and the hawaiian lee countercurrent the eastward jet red extending westward from the southern tip of the hawaiian island chain section 1 the general pattern of the other unnamed alternating zonal jets in the tropics is similar to that found in observations cravatte et al 2017 fig s1 it is interesting that there is a pair of eastward and westward jets between 5 n and 10 n over 140 w 100 w that retain the sw ne tilt across the equator in the southern hemisphere there is a similar tendency that the weak jets tilt in the nw se direction this tendency for the tropical jets to tilt from the westward equatorward to the eastward poleward direction is noted by cravatte et al 2017 for the upper layer 100 600m and reminiscent of the poleward veering of the north and south tsuchiya jets mccreary et al 2002 furue et al 2007 2009 in deeper ocean 1000 m cravatte et al 2017 found the jets are more zonal whereas our tropical jets still show similar tilts at 1100m fig s5 and at 1600m not shown this difference between the upper and lower layers manifests itself as the jump in the flow structure at 900 m in fig 2a particularly clear in the southern hemisphere in this plot it is an interesting subject of future study to investigate why our ogcm does not show this jump between the upper and lower layers in the subtropics in the east the jets are more zonal fig 5b than in the snapshot fig 5a in the subpolar north pacific the jets are still wiggly and similar to their snapshots as shall be shown later the jets in the subpolar region tend to be more stationary than in lower latitudes fig 5c shows the ensemble average at the same month as fig 5a if the positions of the deep jets are the same between the ensemble members the ensemble average of one snapshot monthly mean should show a similar set of zonal jets to the temporally low passed field because ensemble average presumably tends to cancel out mesoscale eddies indeed the jets are generally clearer in the ensemble mean fig 5c than in the snapshot fig 5a the flow field however appears quite different from the low passed one the equatorial zonal flows in the ensemble mean fig 5c is more similar to those in one member fig 5a than to those in the low passed field fig 5b for example the secondary southern tj 165 e 170 w 4 s mentioned above is less well defined in the ensemble mean and the spatial structure of the variability associated with the secondary tj in the ensemble mean is similar to that in the single member field this result suggests that there are deterministic temporal variabilities near the equator in the tropics and in the subtropics in the east the jets are not as zonal as in the low passed field both tropical and subtropical jets tend to tilt in the same ways as in the snapshot of the single member this tendency suggests that the tilts are a robust feature it is interesting that in the western north pacific the jets tend to tilt in the opposite direction sw ne between 40 n and 50 n this tendency is the same as that found by van sebille et al 2011 in the north atlantic as will be shown later and as was pointed out by previous studies see section 1 the subtropical jets migrate equatorward if the tilted stripes of the snapshots figs 5a and 5c are uniform and migrate equatorward the zonal stripes of the low passed field fig 5b is not explained that suggests that the tilted stripes are not uniform but their amplitudes are modulated according to latitudinal positions or equivalently the velocity field may be a superposition of tilted wave like faster moving disturbances and slower moving or stationary zonal jets those jets which are identifiable both in the low passed andensemble mean fields such as the eastward jet extending from 140 w 6 n to 110 w 9 n are broader and noisier in the ensemble mean they are broader because of the ensemble spread and they are noisier perhaps because 10 members are not quite enough to average out mesoscale variability another interesting difference is that the zonal jets close to the americas poleward of 10 tend to be much better defined in the low passed field fig 5b than in the ensemble mean fig 5c this tendency indicates either that these jets are less deterministic or that 10 member ensemble is not quite enough to average out mesoscale variability the ensemble average of the low passed field fig 5d appears a smoother version of fig 5b the jets tend to be weaker and broader again suggesting differences among ensemble members the clear zonal jets in the low passed field near california and chile also become weaker those off california are still visible whereas those off chile are mostly averaged out except for the pair of eastward and westward flows at 28 s 30 s to properly compare with maximenko et al 2008 who reported that their observation and model produce these off california and off chile jets at the same locations however we should look at 200 300m depths where maximenko et al s jets are more robust these maps seem to indicate that there is a break between the set of near coast jets along the americas and the offshore interior jets this feature is clearer in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere this break runs roughly parallel to the coast line and appears unrelated to the one noted by qiu et al 2013 in version 1 of ofes section 2 1 the latter corresponds to the western edge of the low mesoscale variability fig 4d extending southwestward from baja california toward the equator qiu et al s 2013 break may be discernible as a white line in figs 5b and 5d extending from the tip of baja california toward the point x 130 w and y 10 n such a line is added in fig s3 as a visual aid this feature may be consistent with qiu et al s theory if we assume that the theory explains only the interior jets because the theory indicates that the zonal jets start to develop and extend westward only from a certain distance from the eastern boundary and that the distance is larger near the equator further this line may correspond to the western edge of the low variability region off north america in figs 4a and 4b fig 5 also suggests that the hawaiian island chain disrupts the jets impacts of islands presumably propagate westward as rossby waves recall the hawaiian lee countercurrent mentioned above in what follows therefore we focus on the part of the pacific east of hawaii and pick up 140 w as this section extends further north into the gulf of alaska than the other round number longitudes east of hawaii 3 4 meridional sections fig 6 shows the various u fields plotted in fig 5 this time along 140 w north of 5 s there is no large scale topographic features in the northern hemisphere to the east of this longitude until the continent of america is reached by visually inspecting the bottom topography of our model not shown at a depth of 500m no seamounts or islands show up either in the northern hemisphere until very near baja california and at 1100m some sparse isolated seamounts start to show up in the southern hemisphere there is the east pacific rise 110 w whose top reaches 2000 m depth at places and there are more islands and seamounts especially between 30 s and 5 s fig s4 probably for these reasons the zonal jets are much less well defined in the southern hemisphere fig s4 we therefore focus on the northern hemisphere fig 6 in the snapshot fig 6a most of the jets have a deep structure extending from below the surface layer down to 1000 2000m or more there are also numerous jets that appear to be bottom trapped and to extend upward some of them up to 2000 m at the equator we see the familiar set of currents some of them less well defined than in the long term mean discussed earlier fig 2 in the low passed field fig 6b most of these zonal flows including the equatorial ones retain their basic structures and simply become somewhat weaker but in the latitude band of 5 15 n the alternating jets show up only in the low passed field the tropical alternating jets 5 15 n are not clear either in the ensemble mean of the snapshots fig 6c as pointed out for the horizontal maps fig 5b vs fig 5c north of 15 n however the ensemble mean of the snapshots fig 6c appear similar to the low passed field fig 6b despite the difference in the horizontal structure of the jets zonal in fig 5b vs tilted in fig 5c the horizontally tilted velocity disturbances therefore have vertically similar scales to the zonal jets the bottom trapped jets at 14 n 23 n 32 n 40 n and 42 n are similar in structure and amplitude between figs 6b and 6c suggesting that they are controlled by bottom topography other jets that intensify toward the bottom tend to be stronger in the ensemble average than in the temporal average suggesting that they vary in time in a deterministic manner or otherwise they may be fast variability which are not quite canceled out by the ensemble average jets in the low passed field are generally weakened by ensemble averaging fig 6b vs fig 6d moreover many of the jets have their axes at different locations for example the eastward subthermocline jet just south of 20 n in fig 6b is located at 20 n in fig 6d this same jet is much clearer and located at 20 n in the ensemble average of the snapshot fig 6c indicating that the low passed field of this particular member fig 6b is likely an outlier for this particular jet among the members equatorward of 25 n the surface layer flow is dominated by the broad westward flow of the subtropical gyre and below it the top of the eastward jets deepens poleward figs 6b and 6d as previously pointed out by qiu et al 2013 and cravatte et al 2017 the southern hemisphere equatorward of 25 s shows a similar feature in a much clearer way figs s4b and s4c there is one quasi barotropic eastward jet at 40 n anchored to a cliff at the bottom its amplitude is similar in all the four plots indicating that it is stationary and deterministic it is accompanied by westward jets on its southern flank over 0 2000m depth sometimes there is a similar westward flow also on its northern flank not shown there is a similar stationary and deterministic quasi barotropic westward jet at 32 n accompanied by an eastward jet on its northern flank sometimes with another eastward jet on its southern flank not shown the cliff at 40 n extends nearly zonally fig 7 the eastward jet trapped at 40 n however does not extend much according to the map fig 5d it and the westward jet accompanying it on its southern flank extend only between 144 w and 138 w the meridional section along 150 w not shown for example does have the cliff but not the eastward quasi barotropic jet it is interesting that davis et al s 2014 numerical experiment with realistic topography starting from a state of rest with a horizontally uniform stratification shows a clear eastward jet along 40 n extending from the coast of america to about 150 w developing within a year and staying there their fig 2a c while this jet does not exist in their experiment with a flat bottom their fig 2d f the cliff at 32 n tilts a little from the zonal direction fig 7 the bottom trapped westward jet at 32 n and the accompanying eastward jet on its northern flank appear to extend from 132 w to 157 w with a similar slight tilt fig 5d along 150 w not shown for example the westward jet still reaches the bottom although the cliff turns into a somewhat wide valley fig 7 and the jet axis sits in the middle of it at 31 n a very narrow westward jet with some sw ne tilt also exists near 32 n 140 w in davis et al s 2014 numerical experiment with realistic bottom topography their fig 2a c which is replaced by a broader weaker eastward flow in their experiment with a flat bottom their fig 2d f 3 5 temporal variability 3 5 1 hovmöller diagrams the temporal variability of the jets is illustrated in fig 8 fig 8a is a hovmöller diagram of u along 140 w at 500m depth from a single member on and close to the equator the eic nicc and sicc see the discussion of fig 6 are robust with some temporal variability sometimes disrupting them poleward of them the jets appear to slowly migrate poleward between 6 11 n further poleward between 15 35 n they tend to systematically migrate equatorward as noted by richards et al 2006 further poleward the bottom anchored stationary westward jet at 32 n and eastward jet at 40 n see the discussion of fig 6 are visible as a fairly stationary feature the shallower eastward jet north of 32 n and westward jet south of 40 n accompanying the corresponding bottom anchored jets fig 6 are also fairly stationary poleward of 40 n the jets are more intense and have shorter meridional wavelengths which is clear also in fig 5b they are not stationary and do not show any systematic propagation note that this longitude is not far from the north american continent fig 5 and that the meridional intervals are somewhat larger further west into the interior 3 5 2 jet axes fig 8b plots the detected positions of eastward jets section 2 4 for all ensemble members with different colors for different members the meridional migration of the nicc and sicc is very coherent suggesting that their positions are determined by external forcing or by otherwise deterministic dynamics see section 4 2 1 the eastward jet to the north of the nicc is also coherent although it is not as coherent as the nicc it is interesting that nicc sometimes collapses as in 1986 fig 8b when it is not seen in the corresponding horizontal map not shown and the eastward jet north of the nicc let us call it the secondary nicc in the present paper comes as close to the equator as 4 n and starts to migrate poleward although it is not known whether this variability of the nicc and the secondary nicc is realistic or not this result from our ogcm suggests that perhaps the primary and secondary niccs are almost always there they migrate meridionally at interannual timescales and the primary nicc sometimes collapses when it is too close to the equator we clearly need more detailed analysis to establish the variability of these intermediate currents which may be an interesting subject of a future study it is remarkable that there are clear white regions further north between 7 n and 15 n in particular the jet at 7 n that stays there before 1975 slowly migrates to 11 n by 1992 a westward jet follows this eastward jet on its southern flank not shown this pair is remarkably coherent between the ensemble members there are a few more coherent migrating jets later in this latitude band this temporal migration may partly explain the discrepancy between observations and our model fig 2 agreement between the members is not perfect of course and that may be another potential explanation for the discrepancy the jets migrating toward the equator between 15 n and 30 n appear less coherent although some whitish bands are discernible we have looked at a superposition not shown of fig 8b over fig 8a and subjectively by eye found more dots of axes over stronger eastward velocity red suggesting a degree of agreement between the members whether there is really such interannual to decadal modulation of coherence is an interesting subject of future study in the subpolar region on the other hand no clear agreement is seen these results become clearer when the axis occurrences are binned in 0 3 0 3 gridboxes as described in section 2 4 fig 8c fig 9 shows one meridional profile of u at 500m depth and at a given time as a sample of the ensemble average and individual members equatorward of 15 n the ensemble spread is small see also fig 4 and a few coherent jets are discernible north of it the positions of the jets do not agree among the ensemble members except for the eastward stationary jet at 40 n and the accompanying westward jet just to the south the westward stationary jet at 32 n and the accompanying eastward jet just to the north and perhaps some coherent eastward jet at 20 n the last one may be just a coincidence or could be a coherent jet migrating equatorward see fig 8 3 6 other depths and longitudes because the output from our ensemble runs is prohibitively large we have not been able to extend our analysis to the entire pacific ocean here we pick another depth and a few other longitudes to see whether the above conclusions hold there as the vertical section fig 6 indicates most off equatorial deep jets are deep slowly decaying toward the bottom at 1100m therefore the jets are weaker but otherwise their properties are similar fig s5 and fig s7 for example the jets anchored at 32 n and 40 n are still clearly visible in the hovmöller diagrams compare fig s7 with fig s6 and the coherent poleward migration of some of the tropical jets is visible the equatorial current system has a complicated vertical structure fig 2 and therefore those at 1100m depth do not necessarily vertically align with those at 500m the timescales of variability however seem to be similar fig s7 vs fig s6 and they still vary coherently general properties of the deep jets do not change along 150 w fig s8 except that the stationary quasi barotropic eastward jet at 40 n is not seen at this longitude and that the stationary westward jet at 32 n is shifted to 31 n fig s8c as stated earlier the zonal extent of the 40 n is short and the 32 n jet extends westward with some southward tilt following the ocean floor valley fig 7 along 150 w the poleward and equatorward migration of tropical and subtropical jets is clear and the equatorward migration of tropical jets appears coherent between ensemble members figs s8b and s8c just west of the hawaiian islands the vertical structures of the subtropical and subpolar jets fig s9 appear different from those along 140 w fig 6 the subpolar jets are deeper more stationary and coherent between ensemble members these properties are discernible also in fig 5 the westward flowing branch of the subtropical gyre north equatorial current south of 30 n is thicker in the vertical and stronger toward the west which is a usual property of the subtropical gyre according to the sverdup dynamics and as a consequence the top of the deep jets appear deeper there is a surface trapped eastward jet at 18 20 n which is the hawaiian lee countercurrent section 1 despite the number of steep seamounts the continuation of the hawaiian island chain the tropical jets are similar to those to the east of hawaii compare 8 n 20 n below the surface westward flow between fig s9d and fig 6d the strong stationary coherent eastward jet at 30 n extending from the bottom to 1500m is a curious feature finally in the southern hemisphere along 130 w fig s4 the tropical jets are weak see also fig 2 poleward of 20 s only very weak deep jets survive the temporal average fig s4b or the ensemble average fig s4c other north south asymmetries are apparent in the map fig 5 4 summary and discussion 4 1 summary to explore the temporal spatial and statistical properties of the zonal jets in the eastern north pacific ten long term integrations of an eddy resolving ogcm are examined we define the jets to be meridionally small scale alternating zonal flows in a moving temporal average over 2 years u section 2 2 even though the ten runs start from almost identical initial conditions the positions of most modeled jets start to diverge almost immediately and their ensemble spread grows until the 5th 10th years of integration fig 3 the spatial distribution of the ensemble spread fig 4a is similar to that of the interannual variability fig 4b with a clear exception of the equatorial region fig 4c where interannual variability tends to be coherent coincident between the ensemble members the distribution of the interannual variability and ensemble spread is broadly similar to that of mesoscale eddies fig 4d outside the equatorial region consistent with most theories which relate mesoscale eddies to zonal jets in one way or another section 1 3 in the eastern pacific north of 20 s the zonal jets typically appear as meandering stripes fig 5a in monthly mean fields snapshots in this paper and the familiar zonal jet structure emerges in the low passed field fig 5b on the other hand the jets are generally less clear in the ensemble averaged snapshots fig 5c because of ensemble spread and perhaps because the size of ensemble is not quite large enough to cancel out mesoscale variability it is interesting that the tropical jets in the east show some tendency toward tilts in the equatorward westward to poleward eastward direction in all averages fig 5a d the subtropical jets in the east tend to tilt in the opposite direction as was found in past studies e g nakano and hasumi 2005 richards et al 2006 maximenko et al 2008 van sebille et al 2011 this tilt is not visible in the low passed field fig 5b because the jets tend to migrate toward the equator at interannual timescales richards et al 2006 the fact that there still remain clear zonal jets in the low passed field fig 5b suggests that the tilted stripes in the snapshots already include zonally elongated modulations because if a tilted pure plane wave propagates the temporal average should not include zonal stripes it is interesting that the ensemble average of snapshots fig 5c shows these tilts at all suggesting that there is some coherence agreement between the ensemble members for the tilted features jets near the coast of north and south america tend to have shorter meridional wavelengths than interior ones typical deep jets extend from the surface or from below the main pycnocline to 1500 2500m fig 6 there are also bottom trapped jets some of them extending to 2000 m fig 6 like the upper zonal jets the bottom trapped ones show various temporal and statistical behaviors some are stationary fig 6b and some are coherent fig 6c in the north pacific along 140 w there are two examples of very coherent and robust jets anchored to bottom cliffs showing quasi barotropic vertical profiles extending from the surface to the bottom fig 6d each is accompanied by similarly robust counter flows on either side of it the accompanying jets however do not extend to the bottom but have a similar vertical extent to the regular zonal jets fig 6d these jets apparently follow zonally extended cliffs fig 7 but only one of them follows the cliff over a large zonal distance the temporal evolution of the jets includes five patterns fig 8a the equatorial jets oscillate at interannual timescales with both gradual and sudden changes tropical jets tend to migrate poleward at a decadal time scale subtropical jets regularly migrate equatorward as if they are some kind of waves there are the two stationary jets anchored to bottom features as described above and finally the jets move slowly and randomly in the subpolar region the positions of the equatorial jets even their variability seem to obey deterministic dynamics and some of the tropical jets migrate poleward coherently figs 8b and 8c the equatorward migration of subtropical jets is very systematic but the phases of the jets agree less well between ensemble members the subpolar jets are random and without systematic migration 4 2 discussion 4 2 1 coherent jets how can the coherence the axis positions agreeing between ensemble members be explained although the details of the mechanism are not clear the two jets at 32 n and 40 n along 140 w are obviously anchored by the bottom topographic features and the shallower counter flows accompanying them are likely anchored by the respective barotropic jets the coherence of the tropical and subtropical migrating jets are more intriguing an interesting subject of future study davis et al 2014 argued that the zonal jets mostly originate from the eastern boundary and are anchored at coastal geometrical features another mechanism that would result in coherence in our analysis however the zonal extents of the jets near the eastern boundary are short and the interior is filled with other non stationary jets davis et al also found that the zonal jets extend into the interior much farther in their quasi linear solution than in their nonlinear counterpart considering that the horizontal resolution of their model is about 0 2 we conjecture that the zonal extents of the eastern boundary jets are even shorter in our ofes2 experiments because eddies are stronger in our model and beta plumes emanating from the eastern boundary are taken over by other types of jets in the interior the coherence of the nicc and the secondary nicc fig 8 could be due to resonant basin modes m claus may 2020 personal communication weak random forcing such as from tropical instability waves e g philander 1978 can excite resonant basin modes with multi yearly periodicity cane and moore 1981 brandt et al 2016 these modes are formed by the eastward propagation of equatorial kelvin waves and their westward reflection as equatorial rossby waves although it is not clear how far away from the equator the influences of the basin modes go the nicc and sicc may be related to the basin modes e g ascani et al 2015 bastin et al 2020 resonant basin modes have recently been discussed to explain the equatorial deep jets edjs e g ascani et al 2015 matthießen et al 2017 greatbatch et al 2018 ménesguen et al 2019 and references therein fig 2b does seem to indicate that our model reproduces edjs if our model indeed develop such resonant basin modes the coherence of the equatorial jets may be explained as follows the standard run of ofes2 started from year 1958 section 2 1 have likely had developed basin modes before the ensemble runs were initialized at 1965 because of the temporal regularity of the basin modes and if the forcing feeding into them is weak as hypothesized brandt et al 2016 it would take many oscillation periods before the basin modes de synchronize between the ensemble members even if the weak forcing that maintain them are random if some deterministic forcing contribute to the maintenance of the basin modes they may never de synchronize it would be a great test of this hypothesis to examine the off equatorial zonal jets in an ensemble of idealized model runs like those of past edj studies e g ascani et al 2015 brandt et al 2016 matthießen et al 2017 greatbatch et al 2018 another potential mechanism that would result in the coherence of zonal jets is proposed by qiu et al 2013 see section 1 3 this theory predicts the meridional distance between the jets as a function of the amplitude of annual rossby waves and of other external parameters in addition qiu et al 2013 hypothesize that the set of the jets is anchored to the equator this theory therefore may explain the coherence of the positions figs 8b and 8c in principle this mechanism works all the way up to the critical latitude of annual baroclinic rossby waves 50 n 1 1 assuming an annual frequency ω 2 π 1 yr and a gravity wave speed of c 3 m s 1 qiu et al s value and solving ω β y c 2 f y clarke and shi 1991 for y our result is however that the jets tend to be less coherent for higher latitudes supposing that qiu et al s theory is correct our result could mean that the impacts of the equator are felt less strongly or that some other mechanisms are more significant for higher latitudes 4 2 2 meridional migration the fact that tropical jets migrate poleward and subtropical jets equatorward might have something to do with the sverdrup interior flow which agrees with the directions of the migration h nakano 2019 personal communication this idea may be consistent with khatri and berloff 2018 2019 who proposed that zonal inhomogeneities of the background potential vorticity can result in meridional drift of both purely zonal and tilted non zonal striations or jets in our case the background potential vorticity is zonally inhomogeneous due to the meridional component of the sverdrup flow both the basin mode mechanism and qiu et al s 2013 mechanism discussed above can lead to meridional migration of zonal jets the slow oscillation from the former mechanism could shift the zonal jets as stated above qiu et al s 2013 theory predicts the meridional distance between the jets as a function of the amplitude of annual rossby waves and of other external parameters if so and if qiu et al s mechanism explains the jets the migration of the jets must be due to some decadal modulation of some of the external parameters 4 2 3 influence of bottom topography it is interesting that some observed surface fronts in the north atlantic closely follow steep bottom features miller et al 2013 this communication between the surface and the bottom might be mediated by quasi barotropic jets anchored at steep bottom features an intriguing question is whether deep jets in general have any impacts on surface fronts taguchi et al 2012 pointed out one potential mechanism by which deep jets introduce fine scale structures in the sea surface temperature field this kind of mechanism could further impact upon submesoscale fronts we have not explored the statistics of the bottom trapped jets fig 6 as stated in the discussion of fig 6 bottom trapped jets in the ensemble mean fig 6d are stronger between 25 n and 45 n along 140 w than in the low passed field fig 6b does this mean that they vary in time coherently this may be another subject for future study the bottom anchored quasi barotropic jets seem to anchor shallower jets on their flanks it is not clear how common this feature is even though the bottom cliff is nearly zonal at 40 n the jet s zonal extent is quite limited fig 5b on the other hand the one at 32 n follows the slightly tilted cliff over a much greater distance there are similar zonally extended cliffs and valleys in the southeastern pacific and in the middle of the atlantic it would be interesting to look into these regions for more information about the quasi barotropic jets we have not examined jets further west in the subpolar region there because of the weaker stratification impacts of bottom topography on the upper ocean circulation tend to be more significant than in lower latitudes one example is the control of surface jets by barotropic circulation trapped to a bottom topographic feature in the northwest pacific mitsudera et al 2018 miyama et al 2018 such control of bottom topography may be the reason for the robustness of the zonal jets in this region fig 5 4 2 4 concluding remarks our ten member ensemble has yielded useful statistical information as above but there have been instances where statistical confidence is in doubt to obtain quantitative statistics for the zonal jets therefore more ensemble members would be necessary credit authorship contribution statement ryo furue

23921,it has been known for some time that the ocean basins are populated by what is known as zonal jets deep zonal jets or striations since the oceanic flow is at least weakly chaotic it is not known whether the positions of the jets are deterministic that is entirely determined by external parameters a number of theories have been proposed to explain them some of them predicting zonal jets at fixed latitudes and others implying that the positions of the jets are random to investigate how deterministic the zonal jets are in the eastern north pacific a ten member ensemble of long term integrations of a semi global eddy resolving ocean general circulation model is analyzed the positions of the equatorial jets even their variability seem to obey deterministic dynamics and some of the jets in the tropics 5 15 n migrate poleward coherently similarly between ensemble members the jets in the subtropics 15 45 n systematically migrate equatorward but their positions are less coherent the jets in the subpolar region 45 n are random and without systematic migration jets near the coast of north and south america tend to have shorter meridional wavelengths than interior ones and those in the northern hemisphere are fairly coherent whereas those in the southern hemisphere seem more random there are a few quasi barotropic jets which are anchored to steep bottom topographic features and which also appear to trap shallower counter flows on their poleward and equatorward flanks keywords deep zonal jets eddy resolving ocean general circulation model ensemble deterministic chaos 1 introduction the ocean basins are populated by zonal jets or striations everywhere e g hogg and owens 1999 sinha and richards 1999 treguier et al 2003 nakano and hasumi 2005 maximenko et al 2005 kamenkovich et al 2009 divakaran and brassington 2011 cravatte et al 2012 2017 except for the few well known examples and for the equatorial zonal flows see below the zonal jets are not well understood there may be different kinds arising from different mechanisms below we first review the zonal jets in general sections 1 1 1 3 this discussion potentially applies to all zonal jets except for the equatorial zonal flows we then touch upon the equatorial zonal flows and near equatorial tropical in this paper jets section 1 4 as it is not quite clear where the influence of equatorial dynamics ends and from which latitudes the zonal jets start to dominate we finally discuss the scientific issue this paper tackles section 1 5 and state the purpose and plan of the present paper section 1 6 1 1 zonal jets below the main pycnocline zonal velocity averaged over one year or more tends to show narrow 100 km alternating flows that tend to extend vertically down to 1000 3000m depth e g divakaran and brassington 2011 richards et al 2006 cravatte et al 2017 and zonally many thousands of kilometers e g nakano and hasumi 2005 cravatte et al 2017 their iso phase lines are often somewhat tilted from the zonal direction e g nakano and hasumi 2005 richards et al 2006 maximenko et al 2008 van sebille et al 2011 near the surface and in the main pycnocline the instantaneous flow field is dominated by mesoscale eddies and the zonal jets are not clear in snapshots of velocity e g berloff et al 2011 moreover even in long term mean they are often masked by the general circulation in the upper ocean and become visible only in meridionally highpass filtered fields maximenko et al 2005 divakaran and brassington 2011 taguchi et al 2012 as a result the lagrangian trajectories of water parcels would not be zonal where the meridional component of the large scale flow is significant maximenko et al 2008 in this case some authors prefer the term striations in place of jets maximenko et al 2008 in the present paper we keep using the term jets for convenience and simplicity 1 2 variability and migration richards et al 2006 found in an eddy resolving oceanic general circulation model ogcm simulation a previous version of the model we use in the present study see section 2 1 that the jets tend to migrate equatorward within the latitudinal bands of 20 30 n and 20 30 s in the pacific with a phase speed of about 0 045m s and a period of about 4yr boland et al 2012 proposed a mechanism in which a large scale bottom slope causes the phase lines of jets to tilt from the zonal direction and the jets to migrate in the meridional direction see also khatri and berloff 2018 2019 nakano et al 2018 detected a systematic interannual southward migration of surface fronts at 0 002 m s downstream of the kuroshio extension in satellite sea surface height data 1 3 theories various theories have been proposed to explain the spatial structures of off equatorial outside 5 latitude zonal jets berloff et al 2009 provide in their introduction a comprehensive review of theories that had been proposed by then it has been known that mesoscale eddies produce zonal jets in idealized models a randomly forced idealized ocean tends to produce a set of zonal jets e g berloff 2005 scott and dritschel 2012 and an ocean under a large scale forcing which undergoes instability does so too e g panetta 1993 treguier and panetta 1994 that suggests that the jets are inherent to the ocean as long as there are mesoscale eddies kamenkovich et al 2009 one mechanism often invoked e g sinha and richards 1999 nakano and hasumi 2005 richards et al 2006 to explain how eddies lead to a series of alternating zonal jets is usually termed the rhines effect originally conceived by rhines 1975 there is a debate whether the rhines effect really works as rhines 1975 conceived sukoriansky et al 2007 under this mechanism the strength of eddies and the planetary beta determine the meridional distances between the jets and there is no reason that the positions of the jets are fixed to some preferred latitudes unless there are preferred places for eddies to be located islands coastal geometry or bottom topography could provide such preferred places as well as potentially provide fine scale forcing to the jets maximenko et al 2008 identified a set of stationary alternating zonal jets striations off california and chile in a surface geostrophic flow field derived from a mean ssh dataset in geostrophic flow derived from a collection of xbt data and in an ogcm which is the previous version of the model we use in the present study see section 2 1 as well as in fine scale temperature anomaly over the top 400m from the xbt and ogcm data remarkably the positions of some of these observed jets agree with those from the ogcm because these jets are found not far from the coast the authors conjecture that they are probably generated by some coastal processes one such coastal process has been identified if there is concentrated vertical motion or concentrated curl of reynolds stress or wind stress anchored at an island or a coastal feature of the eastern boundary it will drive zonally extended jets jia 2000 özgökmen and crisciani 2001 maximenko et al 2008 melnichenko et al 2010 belmadani et al 2013 davis et al 2014 this feature is sometimes called the beta plume the azores current jia 2000 and the hawaiian lee countercurrent xie et al 2001 sasaki and nonaka 2006 sasaki et al 2006 are regarded as an example of this mechanism davis et al 2014 found that most zonal jets extend from north america in their eddy permitting ogcm and argue that beta plume is the main cause of the zonal jets a related mechanism is proposed by hristova et al 2008 and wang et al 2012 who demonstrated that unstable modes of an eastern boundary current can lead to alternating zonal flows that resemble the zonal jets melnichenko et al 2010 examined the vorticity and potential vorticity pv balance of the jets striations identified by maximenko et al 2008 near the west coast of north and south america and found that the eddy thickness flux e g gent and mcwilliams 1990 significantly contributes to the pv balance indicating a non negligible role of nonlinear eddy mean flow interaction they however also suggest that linear mechanisms such as the beta plume may be regulating or guiding the positions of the jets this idea may apply to other situations the jets themselves may arise from some eddy mean flow interaction but their positions may be controlled by rossby waves emanating from the coast by bottom topography or by islands berloff et al 2009 proposed a mechanism by which a structure similar to the zonal jets emerges from a multi stage instability of large scale flow according to this mechanism the meridional distance between the jets is determined ultimately by the large scale flow but the positions of the jets are random qiu et al 2013 found that in a nonlinear 1 5 layer model annual rossby waves are unstable generating a set of eddies which in turn generate zonal jets they argue that meridional spacing between the jets originates from the meridional wavelength of the unstable mode and also that the resultant series of zonal jets is anchored at the equator according to this argument the positions of the jets are fixed relatively to the equator and determined by given parameters such as the stratification and the wind stress that forces the annual rossby waves 1 4 equatorial and tropical jets latitude 10 15 along and near the equator latitude 5 there is a different class of zonal jets to the off equatorial zonal jets discussed above it is not clear whether the tropical jets latitude 10 15 are dynamically similar to the off equatorial zonal jets or dynamically connected to the equatorial jets ménesguen et al 2019 since our results below pertain partly to the equatorial and tropical jets section 3 here we very briefly review these flows see cravatte et al 2017 and ménesguen et al 2019 for comprehensive reviews about these jets for a visual aid refer to fig 2 below the equatorial undercurrent euc which flows eastward along the equator in the main thermocline 100 200m depth e g johnson et al 2002 and the eastward flowing northern and southern tuchiya jets tjs at 3 6 latitude and 200 500m depth a k a north and south equatorial countercurrents e g johnson et al 2002 are regarded as essentially driven by large scale winds e g mccreary 1981 pedlosky 1987 hua et al 2003 furue et al 2007 2009 there are some more jet like zonal flows on and near the equator whose dynamics are less well understood below the euc there is a westward equatorial intermediate current eic e g firing 1987 rowe et al 2000 and below it there is a set of alternating zonal flows called the equatorial deep jets edjs with a vertical wavelength of 400 600m e g firing 1987 ascani et al 2015 on the poleward sides of this structure there are tall eastward flows at 2 extending from 500m to at least 1500m firing 1987 ascani et al 2015 we borrow cravatte et al s 2017 terminology and call these tall eastward flows the north and south intermediate countercurrents nicc and sicc poleward of these are several more alternating jets cravatte et al 2017 ménesguen et al 2019 1 5 deterministic chaos deterministic chaos or simply chaos was made well known by lorenz s 1963 work on a simple dynamical system representing an aspect of atmospheric circulation the discovery of chaos was remarkable because a deterministic dynamical system exhibits unpredictable behaviors starting from very slightly different initial conditions a chaotic system evolves into significantly different states after a while some aspects or features of the system therefore are not predictable in practice even though it is a deterministic system in principle e g kalnay 2003 section 6 4 of her book shukla s 1998 introduction offers a concise review of this issue since oceanic mesoscale eddies originate from instability where nonsignificant perturbation grows to finite amplitude the phases of eddies are usually unpredictable for slower variabilities seasonal and slower some chaotic behaviors have also been recognized for the western boundary current e g dijkstra and ghil 2005 nonaka et al 2016 that is the interannual to decadal variability of the kuroshio and the gulf stream and their eastward extensions are not entirely determined by external forcing such as winds two integrations of a high resolution ogcm under identical forcing and boundary conditions and started from slightly different initial conditions can and will develop significantly different pathways for the western boundary current dijkstra and ghil 2005 nonaka et al 2016 this poses an interesting and important question when interpreting an observed oceanic flow field does a current found in the observed data have to be there when validating a result of a numerical model against observation one has to know what aspects of the modeled field should agree with the observation for an obvious example in general the phases of the modeled mesoscale eddies do not have to agree with those of the observed eddies because of the chaotic nature of the eddies and therefore reproducing the phases of eddies is not a goal of improving non data assimilated numerical models 1 6 present study then what about the zonal jets are their positions determined by external forcing so that the positions of modeled jets need to agree with those of observations or are their positions random in the same sense as the phases of mesoscale eddies are random it is also an interesting question whether the phases of the migrating jets section 1 2 are determined by external forcing or not answering these questions will give constraints to theories as some theories predict the positions of the zonal jets as a function of external parameters and other theories predict only the meridional spacing between the jets section 1 3 to answer these questions requires an ensemble of realizations the most common and straightforward way to obtain an ensemble is to run the same numerical model repeatedly under the same forcing and boundary conditions starting from slightly different initial conditions if the positions of the zonal jets agree between the members of the ensemble the positions are likely determined uniquely by external parameters for convenience we term this situation deterministic and we call such jets coherent if the positions of the zonal jets are different between the ensemble members they are likely random in this study we examine a 10 member ensemble of 50 yr runs of a semi global eddy resolving model our goal is to explore and document various statistical behaviors and properties of the zonal jets in the time space and ensemble dimensions to answer the above questions in this study we focus on the pacific ocean because some of the key past studies are on this ocean e g nakano and hasumi 2005 maximenko et al 2005 richards et al 2006 cravatte et al 2017 further we mainly focus on the eastern pacific north of the equator because as we shall see the structures of the zonal jets are clearest and simplest there the rest of this paper is organized as follows the next section describes this ogcm and the ensemble of runs the results are shown in section 3 and summarized and discussed in section 4 the main text includes only essential figures to support the main conclusions the supplementary material sm includes the several figures that the text mentions only briefly sm also includes the derivation of a minor mathematical result used in the main text 2 data and methods 2 1 ogcm the ogcm

al 2005 the initial condition of the standard run is a state of rest with the temperature and salinity fields of 1 january 1958 of ofes version 1 masumoto et al 2004 sasaki et al 2008 ofes2 has been integrated up to the end of year 2018 so far besides this standard run we have an ensemble of ten integrations under the same boundary conditions the only difference being the initial condition the initial temperature and salinity fields of these ten runs are those of the 3rd 5th and 21st of january 1965 of the ofes2 standard run they are integrated up to the end of 2016 in this study we call them m01 m02 and m10 nonaka et al 2020 a similar three member ensemble with ofes version 1 was discussed by nonaka et al 2016 in this study we use monthly averages from the model output 2 2 averages we use a moving sliding average with the hann window blackman and tukey 1959 see also suppl s2 for temporal low pass filtering to extract the jet like flows by removing mesoscale eddies because of the smoothness of hann filter in the frequency space suppl s2 one year averages tend still to include significant seasonal cycle not shown to extract features that change more slowly therefore we use the 23 point 2 year version of hann filter with the quarter power half amplitude frequency at 0 5 cycles per year suppl s2 the same approach was used by gouriou and delcroix 2002 to extract variability at periods longer than 12 months in what follows we use the notation q for an arbitrary quantity q to denote this 2 year moving average richards et al 2006 also used a two year running average to extract the zonal jets on the other hand we denote the ensemble average the average over the m 10 ensemble members by q note that the ensemble average commutes with the lowpass filter q 1 m m 1 m d t h t t q m t d t h t t 1 m m 1 m q m t q where h t t is the window function of the moving average suppl s2 and q m is the variable q from ensemble member m for this reason we calculate only one of q and q in extracting jet like structures from the velocity field the temporal moving average and ensemble average have different characteristics if the axis of the jet is stationary the lowpass filter weakens variability associated with eddies for each ensemble member without weakening or broadening the jet but when the axis moves it weakens and broadens the jet on the other hand if the jet is a deterministic feature the ensemble average weakens eddies at each time without weakening or broadening the jet even if it moves in time if in contrast the axis position is different between the ensemble members the average weakens and broadens the jet 2 3 measures of variability a natural measure of ensemble spread i e how different the ensemble members are from each other is the variance 1 var q q q 2 and the square root of this quantity is the ensemble standard deviation one can however expect that the standard deviation will tend to be large where internal variability is large although this is not always true as we shall see below therefore another measure of ensemble spread is the standard deviation normalized by a measure of internal variability for the deep zonal jet we calculate the interannual variability of low passed field u over a certain period and use it to normalize the ensemble standard deviation 2 var u l var l u 1 2 where the overline with l indicates a temporal average over 1995 2014 and var l q is the long term variance var l q q q l 2 l as a measure of mesoscale eddy activity we use u u u 1 where u 1 is the moving average of u with the 1 year hann filter the 2 year average defined above is not used for this purpose because the deviation from it would then include more seasonal variability the eddy activity is then defined as u 2 l we use this quantity as a proxy of the proper eddy kinetic energy eke which includes the v component to avoid processing one more huge dataset just to plot eke this quantity shown later in fig 4d has a similar spatial distribution to that of surface eddy kinetic energy derived from surface drifters maximenko et al 2009 it is also similar to the distribution of sea surface height ssh variability shown by sasaki et al 2020 for the ofes2 standard run except at the equator where the variability of ssh associated with velocity variability is much weaker 2 4 detection of axis position we use a very simple method to detect jet axes separately for eastward and westward jets for a fixed longitude depth and time we determine the latitudes of local maxima in u y that is the latitudes y such that u y u y δ y and u y u y δ y with δ y 1 10 we then retain only those latitudes where u 0 eastward the axis positions of westward jets are analogously defined they are the latitudes of minima in u such that u 0 this simple scheme should give a reasonable skill at detecting the axes of the zonal jets fig 1 shows a meridional section of zonal velocity at 500m along 140 w as an example the velocity profile is surprisingly smooth and regular perhaps less so in the 15 n 30 n latitudinal range sometimes there is a tiny local minimum with in a single jet which the above scheme will erroneously give two axes close to each other this problem is alleviated by collecting nearby local maxima into a somewhat coarser gridbox as below we next define an index n i j z t e which indicates the existence or absence of an eastward jet axis within the gridbox i j z t e where e is the ensemble member number e 1 m n i j z t e 1 if the gridbox contains at least one axis and n 0 otherwise below we use both the original grid 0 1 0 1 and a somewhat coarser 0 3 0 3 grid finally the index n i j z t e 1 m n i j z t e is a measure of agreement between the ensemble members n m if all members have an axis in the gridbox and n 0 if none of them has an axis there 3 results 3 1 comparison with cravatte et al 2017 cravatte et al 2017 show two kinds of zonal velocity field one a composite of various meridional sections with acoustic doppler current profilers adcp taken during 1999 2015 and the other a geostrophic calculation based on a gridded climatological temperature and salinity dataset from the argo array over 2004 2014 referenced to a 1000 m depth horizontal velocity field estimated from the trajectories of argo floats at their parking depths cravatte et al 2017 show that the two fields quantitatively agree including the positions of the zonal jets the method of using argo is probably the only way to obtain the three dimensional structure of the zonal jets from observation except in regions like the tropical pacific where adcp profiles have been repeatedly taken we have looked into such a dataset produced by gray and riser 2014 it has turned out however that the velocity field in this dataset is somewhat too smooth to resolve the zonal jets here we compare cravatte et al s 2017 zonal velocity with our model s we choose their meridional section averaged over 160 w 120 w which includes the longitude 140 w we focus on below for a comparison of the horizontal flow pattern see fig s1 since it is not clear which years have most influence on cravatte et al s composites of observations we have looked at all 2 4 8 10 year averages within years 2004 2014 from member m01 to compare our velocity field with cravatte et al s fig 2a is their geostrophic velocity based on argo and fig 2b is one of the most similar by eye plots from our model which is an average over years 2011 2012 the averaging period 2005 2014 for the other model plot fig 2c is similar to that of the argo data cravatte et al 2017 use there is one eastward flow below the eic westward in the model but not in the observation below this eastward flow in the ogcm there are more westward and eastward alternating flows on the equator with a vertical wavelength of 300 400m these properties suggest that they are the equatorial deep jets edjs firing 1987 ascani et al 2015 matthießen et al 2017 greatbatch et al 2018 the velocity field based on argo does not show this feature and the adcp composite not shown does not go deep enough in the section to the west 179 e 160 w cravatte et al 2017 show however the adcp composite shows a strong hint of the edjs fig s2 while the argo velocity does not the model shows somewhat clearer edjs there than in the 160 w 120 w range fig s2 on the poleward sides of the edjs are eastward flows at 1 5 that extend from 500m depth beyond the bottom of the plot this feature is clearer in fig 2c for the model they have several cores in the vertical in the ogcm whereas they extend relatively uniformly in the vertical in the observation these flows must be the nicc and sicc section 1 but it is not clear why they are separated into several cores in the ogcm the latitude of the nicc core of the model is not as vertically uniform above 700m as that of the observation off the equator in the northern hemisphere the meridional wavelength distance between eastward jets is somewhat larger in the model than in the observation for example at the depth of 500m there are eastward jets at 4 n and 14 n sandwiching two more in the model whereas there are eastward jets at 4 5 n and 13 n sandwiching two more in the observation the vertical structures of the eastward jets have some differences some of the jets slant poleward or equatorward and the directions of the slants are different between the model and observation and the cores of the second and third eastward jets are much higher in the water column in the model the fourth jet is much broader and weaker in the model the peak strengths of the other three eastward jets are above 1 5cm s both in the model and observation the three westward jets between these four eastward jets have similar differences and similarities in the southern hemisphere the meridional wavelength is similar between the model and observation the jets are less well defined weaker and broader in the model the fifth 14 s through seventh 18 s eastward jets are missing from the model it is not clear whether there should be one to one correspondence between the model and observation because there is considerable temporal variability at least in the ogcm for example an average over a longer period 2005 2014 fig 2c shows weaker jets another possibility is that the positions of the jets are random see section 1 the temporal variability and ensemble spread of the jets are discussed below most of these conclusions hold for the section to the west 179 e 160 w cravatte et al 2017 show fig s2 3 2 ensemble spread 3 2 1 evolution before focusing on the statistics of the deep jets we first examine broadly how the ensemble members differ fig 3 shows a measure of the ensemble spread along 140 w for which we show other statistics below the reason for the choice of this longitude will become clear below as we examine the flow field two latitude bands 10 30 n and 45 60 n are selected because the ensemble spread of the two year mean velocity u is generally largest there along 140 w not shown initially the ensemble spread quickly increases and then after 5 10yr it flattens out with large interannual oscillation remaining the timescale of this initial growth is similar to and perhaps somewhat longer than that nonaka et al 2016 found for the development of ensemble spread of the kuroshio extension although it is not very clear from this graph the ensemble spread for the 45 60 n band seems to grow faster than the other band this difference could be due to the different distances from the eastern boundary because some disturbances like mesoscale eddies and rossby waves propagate westward from the continent this result suggests that 10 years is long enough for the ensemble to fully spread the interannual to decadal variability in fig 3 could be related to variability in external forcing or could just be due to insufficient statistics the latter is a hypothesis that the variability would vanish with a sufficiently large number of ensemble members in the analysis below we choose year 2010 the 36th year as an example 3 2 2 horizontal distribution the horizontal distribution of the ensemble spread at 500m depth is shown in fig 4a the distribution off the equator is generally very similar to that of the interannual variability fig 4b this similarity was noted by nonaka et al 2016 for sea surface height variability in the north pacific there are local maxima off california and alaska but into the interior the variability generally increase toward the west it is interesting that the hawaiian island chain appears to block the westward spreading of the variability other island chains tend to have similar impacts the mechanism of this tendency is not clear but as we shall see below topographic features tend to anchor deep zonal jets and the low variability of the low passed field may be because of this effect another possibility is that the islands block rossby waves reducing variability in their western wakes in the subpolar north pacific both ensemble and temporal standard deviations are generally small but include small scale regions of higher variability figs 4a and 4b the most conspicuous difference between the temporal and ensemble variabilities is along the equator fig 4c despite the large temporal variability the ensemble spread tends to be relatively small there indicating that the equatorial variability in u is controlled by external forcing or by otherwise deterministic dynamics this point will be discussed later section 4 2 1 it is interesting that between 10 s and 20 n the ensemble spread is small despite the moderate temporal variability suggesting that the temporal variability is relatively coherent similar between ensemble members there likewise the ensemble spread tends to be weak fig 4c in the subtropical south pacific south of the band 10 s 20 s of moderate variability the kuroshio extension extending eastward from japan along 35 n has extremely large variability but its ensemble variability is somewhat smaller than its temporal variability in the downstream part of the extension fig 4c nonaka et al 2020 explore this feature in ofes2 a measure of fast mesoscale variability is plotted in fig 4d its distribution is broadly similar to that of the temporal variability of u mesoscale variability may be somehow related to the slower variability of u in general it is however interesting that the fast variability is not weaker on the west side of the hawaiian island chain whereas it is weaker on the west side of the mariana islands 145 e 15 n in the central subpolar and northern subtropical regions of the north pacific the fast variability is very weak whereas both the ensemble spread and the temporal variability are moderately large there 3 3 plan view of deep zonal jets fig 5 plots the zonal velocity field at 500m depth to show a typical horizontal structure of the jets in the pacific fig 5a is a monthly mean field from one ensemble member some well known permanent currents are visible the westward flowing blue eic over 150 w 120 w right on the equator the nicc and sicc at 2 from the equator see also fig 2 over 170 e 150 w and the eastward flowing kuroshio extension along 35 n extending eastward from japan the westward currents on the poleward flanks of the nicc and sicc jets seem to be also a commonly found feature fig 2 cravatte et al 2017 besides these currents the ocean is filled with wiggly filament like structures in the latitude bands of 30 s 15 s and 15 n 30 n in the east the phase lines of the zonal velocity tend to be oriented from the poleward westward to equatorward eastward directions nw se in the northern hemisphere and sw ne in the southern hemisphere as was found in past studies nakano and hasumi 2005 richards et al 2008 between 5 n and 10 n in the east the phase lines tend to tilt in the opposite way sw ne near the coast of the americas the meridional scale of the jets seems somewhat smaller than that of offshore ones in the latitudinal bands of 20 s 40 s and 20 n 50 n these jets probably correspond or are related to the stationary striations maximenko et al 2008 identified these fine scale structures can be generally viewed as a superposition of mesoscale variability and zonal jets indeed the low passed field fig 5b reveals a set of zonal jets as is well known see section 1 particularly in the eastern pacific north of 20 s some of these jets revealed in the low passed field can be identified as known currents which are obscured by eddies in the monthly mean field such as the secondary southern tsuchiya jet rowe et al 2000 which flows eastward red just to the south of the primary southern tj at 4 s see also fig 2b the primary tj is confined above 500m and does not show up in fig 5b and the hawaiian lee countercurrent the eastward jet red extending westward from the southern tip of the hawaiian island chain section 1 the general pattern of the other unnamed alternating zonal jets in the tropics is similar to that found in observations cravatte et al 2017 fig s1 it is interesting that there is a pair of eastward and westward jets between 5 n and 10 n over 140 w 100 w that retain the sw ne tilt across the equator in the southern hemisphere there is a similar tendency that the weak jets tilt in the nw se direction this tendency for the tropical jets to tilt from the westward equatorward to the eastward poleward direction is noted by cravatte et al 2017 for the upper layer 100 600m and reminiscent of the poleward veering of the north and south tsuchiya jets mccreary et al 2002 furue et al 2007 2009 in deeper ocean 1000 m cravatte et al 2017 found the jets are more zonal whereas our tropical jets still show similar tilts at 1100m fig s5 and at 1600m not shown this difference between the upper and lower layers manifests itself as the jump in the flow structure at 900 m in fig 2a particularly clear in the southern hemisphere in this plot it is an interesting subject of future study to investigate why our ogcm does not show this jump between the upper and lower layers in the subtropics in the east the jets are more zonal fig 5b than in the snapshot fig 5a in the subpolar north pacific the jets are still wiggly and similar to their snapshots as shall be shown later the jets in the subpolar region tend to be more stationary than in lower latitudes fig 5c shows the ensemble average at the same month as fig 5a if the positions of the deep jets are the same between the ensemble members the ensemble average of one snapshot monthly mean should show a similar set of zonal jets to the temporally low passed field because ensemble average presumably tends to cancel out mesoscale eddies indeed the jets are generally clearer in the ensemble mean fig 5c than in the snapshot fig 5a the flow field however appears quite different from the low passed one the equatorial zonal flows in the ensemble mean fig 5c is more similar to those in one member fig 5a than to those in the low passed field fig 5b for example the secondary southern tj 165 e 170 w 4 s mentioned above is less well defined in the ensemble mean and the spatial structure of the variability associated with the secondary tj in the ensemble mean is similar to that in the single member field this result suggests that there are deterministic temporal variabilities near the equator in the tropics and in the subtropics in the east the jets are not as zonal as in the low passed field both tropical and subtropical jets tend to tilt in the same ways as in the snapshot of the single member this tendency suggests that the tilts are a robust feature it is interesting that in the western north pacific the jets tend to tilt in the opposite direction sw ne between 40 n and 50 n this tendency is the same as that found by van sebille et al 2011 in the north atlantic as will be shown later and as was pointed out by previous studies see section 1 the subtropical jets migrate equatorward if the tilted stripes of the snapshots figs 5a and 5c are uniform and migrate equatorward the zonal stripes of the low passed field fig 5b is not explained that suggests that the tilted stripes are not uniform but their amplitudes are modulated according to latitudinal positions or equivalently the velocity field may be a superposition of tilted wave like faster moving disturbances and slower moving or stationary zonal jets those jets which are identifiable both in the low passed andensemble mean fields such as the eastward jet extending from 140 w 6 n to 110 w 9 n are broader and noisier in the ensemble mean they are broader because of the ensemble spread and they are noisier perhaps because 10 members are not quite enough to average out mesoscale variability another interesting difference is that the zonal jets close to the americas poleward of 10 tend to be much better defined in the low passed field fig 5b than in the ensemble mean fig 5c this tendency indicates either that these jets are less deterministic or that 10 member ensemble is not quite enough to average out mesoscale variability the ensemble average of the low passed field fig 5d appears a smoother version of fig 5b the jets tend to be weaker and broader again suggesting differences among ensemble members the clear zonal jets in the low passed field near california and chile also become weaker those off california are still visible whereas those off chile are mostly averaged out except for the pair of eastward and westward flows at 28 s 30 s to properly compare with maximenko et al 2008 who reported that their observation and model produce these off california and off chile jets at the same locations however we should look at 200 300m depths where maximenko et al s jets are more robust these maps seem to indicate that there is a break between the set of near coast jets along the americas and the offshore interior jets this feature is clearer in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere this break runs roughly parallel to the coast line and appears unrelated to the one noted by qiu et al 2013 in version 1 of ofes section 2 1 the latter corresponds to the western edge of the low mesoscale variability fig 4d extending southwestward from baja california toward the equator qiu et al s 2013 break may be discernible as a white line in figs 5b and 5d extending from the tip of baja california toward the point x 130 w and y 10 n such a line is added in fig s3 as a visual aid this feature may be consistent with qiu et al s theory if we assume that the theory explains only the interior jets because the theory indicates that the zonal jets start to develop and extend westward only from a certain distance from the eastern boundary and that the distance is larger near the equator further this line may correspond to the western edge of the low variability region off north america in figs 4a and 4b fig 5 also suggests that the hawaiian island chain disrupts the jets impacts of islands presumably propagate westward as rossby waves recall the hawaiian lee countercurrent mentioned above in what follows therefore we focus on the part of the pacific east of hawaii and pick up 140 w as this section extends further north into the gulf of alaska than the other round number longitudes east of hawaii 3 4 meridional sections fig 6 shows the various u fields plotted in fig 5 this time along 140 w north of 5 s there is no large scale topographic features in the northern hemisphere to the east of this longitude until the continent of america is reached by visually inspecting the bottom topography of our model not shown at a depth of 500m no seamounts or islands show up either in the northern hemisphere until very near baja california and at 1100m some sparse isolated seamounts start to show up in the southern hemisphere there is the east pacific rise 110 w whose top reaches 2000 m depth at places and there are more islands and seamounts especially between 30 s and 5 s fig s4 probably for these reasons the zonal jets are much less well defined in the southern hemisphere fig s4 we therefore focus on the northern hemisphere fig 6 in the snapshot fig 6a most of the jets have a deep structure extending from below the surface layer down to 1000 2000m or more there are also numerous jets that appear to be bottom trapped and to extend upward some of them up to 2000 m at the equator we see the familiar set of currents some of them less well defined than in the long term mean discussed earlier fig 2 in the low passed field fig 6b most of these zonal flows including the equatorial ones retain their basic structures and simply become somewhat weaker but in the latitude band of 5 15 n the alternating jets show up only in the low passed field the tropical alternating jets 5 15 n are not clear either in the ensemble mean of the snapshots fig 6c as pointed out for the horizontal maps fig 5b vs fig 5c north of 15 n however the ensemble mean of the snapshots fig 6c appear similar to the low passed field fig 6b despite the difference in the horizontal structure of the jets zonal in fig 5b vs tilted in fig 5c the horizontally tilted velocity disturbances therefore have vertically similar scales to the zonal jets the bottom trapped jets at 14 n 23 n 32 n 40 n and 42 n are similar in structure and amplitude between figs 6b and 6c suggesting that they are controlled by bottom topography other jets that intensify toward the bottom tend to be stronger in the ensemble average than in the temporal average suggesting that they vary in time in a deterministic manner or otherwise they may be fast variability which are not quite canceled out by the ensemble average jets in the low passed field are generally weakened by ensemble averaging fig 6b vs fig 6d moreover many of the jets have their axes at different locations for example the eastward subthermocline jet just south of 20 n in fig 6b is located at 20 n in fig 6d this same jet is much clearer and located at 20 n in the ensemble average of the snapshot fig 6c indicating that the low passed field of this particular member fig 6b is likely an outlier for this particular jet among the members equatorward of 25 n the surface layer flow is dominated by the broad westward flow of the subtropical gyre and below it the top of the eastward jets deepens poleward figs 6b and 6d as previously pointed out by qiu et al 2013 and cravatte et al 2017 the southern hemisphere equatorward of 25 s shows a similar feature in a much clearer way figs s4b and s4c there is one quasi barotropic eastward jet at 40 n anchored to a cliff at the bottom its amplitude is similar in all the four plots indicating that it is stationary and deterministic it is accompanied by westward jets on its southern flank over 0 2000m depth sometimes there is a similar westward flow also on its northern flank not shown there is a similar stationary and deterministic quasi barotropic westward jet at 32 n accompanied by an eastward jet on its northern flank sometimes with another eastward jet on its southern flank not shown the cliff at 40 n extends nearly zonally fig 7 the eastward jet trapped at 40 n however does not extend much according to the map fig 5d it and the westward jet accompanying it on its southern flank extend only between 144 w and 138 w the meridional section along 150 w not shown for example does have the cliff but not the eastward quasi barotropic jet it is interesting that davis et al s 2014 numerical experiment with realistic topography starting from a state of rest with a horizontally uniform stratification shows a clear eastward jet along 40 n extending from the coast of america to about 150 w developing within a year and staying there their fig 2a c while this jet does not exist in their experiment with a flat bottom their fig 2d f the cliff at 32 n tilts a little from the zonal direction fig 7 the bottom trapped westward jet at 32 n and the accompanying eastward jet on its northern flank appear to extend from 132 w to 157 w with a similar slight tilt fig 5d along 150 w not shown for example the westward jet still reaches the bottom although the cliff turns into a somewhat wide valley fig 7 and the jet axis sits in the middle of it at 31 n a very narrow westward jet with some sw ne tilt also exists near 32 n 140 w in davis et al s 2014 numerical experiment with realistic bottom topography their fig 2a c which is replaced by a broader weaker eastward flow in their experiment with a flat bottom their fig 2d f 3 5 temporal variability 3 5 1 hovmöller diagrams the temporal variability of the jets is illustrated in fig 8 fig 8a is a hovmöller diagram of u along 140 w at 500m depth from a single member on and close to the equator the eic nicc and sicc see the discussion of fig 6 are robust with some temporal variability sometimes disrupting them poleward of them the jets appear to slowly migrate poleward between 6 11 n further poleward between 15 35 n they tend to systematically migrate equatorward as noted by richards et al 2006 further poleward the bottom anchored stationary westward jet at 32 n and eastward jet at 40 n see the discussion of fig 6 are visible as a fairly stationary feature the shallower eastward jet north of 32 n and westward jet south of 40 n accompanying the corresponding bottom anchored jets fig 6 are also fairly stationary poleward of 40 n the jets are more intense and have shorter meridional wavelengths which is clear also in fig 5b they are not stationary and do not show any systematic propagation note that this longitude is not far from the north american continent fig 5 and that the meridional intervals are somewhat larger further west into the interior 3 5 2 jet axes fig 8b plots the detected positions of eastward jets section 2 4 for all ensemble members with different colors for different members the meridional migration of the nicc and sicc is very coherent suggesting that their positions are determined by external forcing or by otherwise deterministic dynamics see section 4 2 1 the eastward jet to the north of the nicc is also coherent although it is not as coherent as the nicc it is interesting that nicc sometimes collapses as in 1986 fig 8b when it is not seen in the corresponding horizontal map not shown and the eastward jet north of the nicc let us call it the secondary nicc in the present paper comes as close to the equator as 4 n and starts to migrate poleward although it is not known whether this variability of the nicc and the secondary nicc is realistic or not this result from our ogcm suggests that perhaps the primary and secondary niccs are almost always there they migrate meridionally at interannual timescales and the primary nicc sometimes collapses when it is too close to the equator we clearly need more detailed analysis to establish the variability of these intermediate currents which may be an interesting subject of a future study it is remarkable that there are clear white regions further north between 7 n and 15 n in particular the jet at 7 n that stays there before 1975 slowly migrates to 11 n by 1992 a westward jet follows this eastward jet on its southern flank not shown this pair is remarkably coherent between the ensemble members there are a few more coherent migrating jets later in this latitude band this temporal migration may partly explain the discrepancy between observations and our model fig 2 agreement between the members is not perfect of course and that may be another potential explanation for the discrepancy the jets migrating toward the equator between 15 n and 30 n appear less coherent although some whitish bands are discernible we have looked at a superposition not shown of fig 8b over fig 8a and subjectively by eye found more dots of axes over stronger eastward velocity red suggesting a degree of agreement between the members whether there is really such interannual to decadal modulation of coherence is an interesting subject of future study in the subpolar region on the other hand no clear agreement is seen these results become clearer when the axis occurrences are binned in 0 3 0 3 gridboxes as described in section 2 4 fig 8c fig 9 shows one meridional profile of u at 500m depth and at a given time as a sample of the ensemble average and individual members equatorward of 15 n the ensemble spread is small see also fig 4 and a few coherent jets are discernible north of it the positions of the jets do not agree among the ensemble members except for the eastward stationary jet at 40 n and the accompanying westward jet just to the south the westward stationary jet at 32 n and the accompanying eastward jet just to the north and perhaps some coherent eastward jet at 20 n the last one may be just a coincidence or could be a coherent jet migrating equatorward see fig 8 3 6 other depths and longitudes because the output from our ensemble runs is prohibitively large we have not been able to extend our analysis to the entire pacific ocean here we pick another depth and a few other longitudes to see whether the above conclusions hold there as the vertical section fig 6 indicates most off equatorial deep jets are deep slowly decaying toward the bottom at 1100m therefore the jets are weaker but otherwise their properties are similar fig s5 and fig s7 for example the jets anchored at 32 n and 40 n are still clearly visible in the hovmöller diagrams compare fig s7 with fig s6 and the coherent poleward migration of some of the tropical jets is visible the equatorial current system has a complicated vertical structure fig 2 and therefore those at 1100m depth do not necessarily vertically align with those at 500m the timescales of variability however seem to be similar fig s7 vs fig s6 and they still vary coherently general properties of the deep jets do not change along 150 w fig s8 except that the stationary quasi barotropic eastward jet at 40 n is not seen at this longitude and that the stationary westward jet at 32 n is shifted to 31 n fig s8c as stated earlier the zonal extent of the 40 n is short and the 32 n jet extends westward with some southward tilt following the ocean floor valley fig 7 along 150 w the poleward and equatorward migration of tropical and subtropical jets is clear and the equatorward migration of tropical jets appears coherent between ensemble members figs s8b and s8c just west of the hawaiian islands the vertical structures of the subtropical and subpolar jets fig s9 appear different from those along 140 w fig 6 the subpolar jets are deeper more stationary and coherent between ensemble members these properties are discernible also in fig 5 the westward flowing branch of the subtropical gyre north equatorial current south of 30 n is thicker in the vertical and stronger toward the west which is a usual property of the subtropical gyre according to the sverdup dynamics and as a consequence the top of the deep jets appear deeper there is a surface trapped eastward jet at 18 20 n which is the hawaiian lee countercurrent section 1 despite the number of steep seamounts the continuation of the hawaiian island chain the tropical jets are similar to those to the east of hawaii compare 8 n 20 n below the surface westward flow between fig s9d and fig 6d the strong stationary coherent eastward jet at 30 n extending from the bottom to 1500m is a curious feature finally in the southern hemisphere along 130 w fig s4 the tropical jets are weak see also fig 2 poleward of 20 s only very weak deep jets survive the temporal average fig s4b or the ensemble average fig s4c other north south asymmetries are apparent in the map fig 5 4 summary and discussion 4 1 summary to explore the temporal spatial and statistical properties of the zonal jets in the eastern north pacific ten long term integrations of an eddy resolving ogcm are examined we define the jets to be meridionally small scale alternating zonal flows in a moving temporal average over 2 years u section 2 2 even though the ten runs start from almost identical initial conditions the positions of most modeled jets start to diverge almost immediately and their ensemble spread grows until the 5th 10th years of integration fig 3 the spatial distribution of the ensemble spread fig 4a is similar to that of the interannual variability fig 4b with a clear exception of the equatorial region fig 4c where interannual variability tends to be coherent coincident between the ensemble members the distribution of the interannual variability and ensemble spread is broadly similar to that of mesoscale eddies fig 4d outside the equatorial region consistent with most theories which relate mesoscale eddies to zonal jets in one way or another section 1 3 in the eastern pacific north of 20 s the zonal jets typically appear as meandering stripes fig 5a in monthly mean fields snapshots in this paper and the familiar zonal jet structure emerges in the low passed field fig 5b on the other hand the jets are generally less clear in the ensemble averaged snapshots fig 5c because of ensemble spread and perhaps because the size of ensemble is not quite large enough to cancel out mesoscale variability it is interesting that the tropical jets in the east show some tendency toward tilts in the equatorward westward to poleward eastward direction in all averages fig 5a d the subtropical jets in the east tend to tilt in the opposite direction as was found in past studies e g nakano and hasumi 2005 richards et al 2006 maximenko et al 2008 van sebille et al 2011 this tilt is not visible in the low passed field fig 5b because the jets tend to migrate toward the equator at interannual timescales richards et al 2006 the fact that there still remain clear zonal jets in the low passed field fig 5b suggests that the tilted stripes in the snapshots already include zonally elongated modulations because if a tilted pure plane wave propagates the temporal average should not include zonal stripes it is interesting that the ensemble average of snapshots fig 5c shows these tilts at all suggesting that there is some coherence agreement between the ensemble members for the tilted features jets near the coast of north and south america tend to have shorter meridional wavelengths than interior ones typical deep jets extend from the surface or from below the main pycnocline to 1500 2500m fig 6 there are also bottom trapped jets some of them extending to 2000 m fig 6 like the upper zonal jets the bottom trapped ones show various temporal and statistical behaviors some are stationary fig 6b and some are coherent fig 6c in the north pacific along 140 w there are two examples of very coherent and robust jets anchored to bottom cliffs showing quasi barotropic vertical profiles extending from the surface to the bottom fig 6d each is accompanied by similarly robust counter flows on either side of it the accompanying jets however do not extend to the bottom but have a similar vertical extent to the regular zonal jets fig 6d these jets apparently follow zonally extended cliffs fig 7 but only one of them follows the cliff over a large zonal distance the temporal evolution of the jets includes five patterns fig 8a the equatorial jets oscillate at interannual timescales with both gradual and sudden changes tropical jets tend to migrate poleward at a decadal time scale subtropical jets regularly migrate equatorward as if they are some kind of waves there are the two stationary jets anchored to bottom features as described above and finally the jets move slowly and randomly in the subpolar region the positions of the equatorial jets even their variability seem to obey deterministic dynamics and some of the tropical jets migrate poleward coherently figs 8b and 8c the equatorward migration of subtropical jets is very systematic but the phases of the jets agree less well between ensemble members the subpolar jets are random and without systematic migration 4 2 discussion 4 2 1 coherent jets how can the coherence the axis positions agreeing between ensemble members be explained although the details of the mechanism are not clear the two jets at 32 n and 40 n along 140 w are obviously anchored by the bottom topographic features and the shallower counter flows accompanying them are likely anchored by the respective barotropic jets the coherence of the tropical and subtropical migrating jets are more intriguing an interesting subject of future study davis et al 2014 argued that the zonal jets mostly originate from the eastern boundary and are anchored at coastal geometrical features another mechanism that would result in coherence in our analysis however the zonal extents of the jets near the eastern boundary are short and the interior is filled with other non stationary jets davis et al also found that the zonal jets extend into the interior much farther in their quasi linear solution than in their nonlinear counterpart considering that the horizontal resolution of their model is about 0 2 we conjecture that the zonal extents of the eastern boundary jets are even shorter in our ofes2 experiments because eddies are stronger in our model and beta plumes emanating from the eastern boundary are taken over by other types of jets in the interior the coherence of the nicc and the secondary nicc fig 8 could be due to resonant basin modes m claus may 2020 personal communication weak random forcing such as from tropical instability waves e g philander 1978 can excite resonant basin modes with multi yearly periodicity cane and moore 1981 brandt et al 2016 these modes are formed by the eastward propagation of equatorial kelvin waves and their westward reflection as equatorial rossby waves although it is not clear how far away from the equator the influences of the basin modes go the nicc and sicc may be related to the basin modes e g ascani et al 2015 bastin et al 2020 resonant basin modes have recently been discussed to explain the equatorial deep jets edjs e g ascani et al 2015 matthießen et al 2017 greatbatch et al 2018 ménesguen et al 2019 and references therein fig 2b does seem to indicate that our model reproduces edjs if our model indeed develop such resonant basin modes the coherence of the equatorial jets may be explained as follows the standard run of ofes2 started from year 1958 section 2 1 have likely had developed basin modes before the ensemble runs were initialized at 1965 because of the temporal regularity of the basin modes and if the forcing feeding into them is weak as hypothesized brandt et al 2016 it would take many oscillation periods before the basin modes de synchronize between the ensemble members even if the weak forcing that maintain them are random if some deterministic forcing contribute to the maintenance of the basin modes they may never de synchronize it would be a great test of this hypothesis to examine the off equatorial zonal jets in an ensemble of idealized model runs like those of past edj studies e g ascani et al 2015 brandt et al 2016 matthießen et al 2017 greatbatch et al 2018 another potential mechanism that would result in the coherence of zonal jets is proposed by qiu et al 2013 see section 1 3 this theory predicts the meridional distance between the jets as a function of the amplitude of annual rossby waves and of other external parameters in addition qiu et al 2013 hypothesize that the set of the jets is anchored to the equator this theory therefore may explain the coherence of the positions figs 8b and 8c in principle this mechanism works all the way up to the critical latitude of annual baroclinic rossby waves 50 n 1 1 assuming an annual frequency ω 2 π 1 yr and a gravity wave speed of c 3 m s 1 qiu et al s value and solving ω β y c 2 f y clarke and shi 1991 for y our result is however that the jets tend to be less coherent for higher latitudes supposing that qiu et al s theory is correct our result could mean that the impacts of the equator are felt less strongly or that some other mechanisms are more significant for higher latitudes 4 2 2 meridional migration the fact that tropical jets migrate poleward and subtropical jets equatorward might have something to do with the sverdrup interior flow which agrees with the directions of the migration h nakano 2019 personal communication this idea may be consistent with khatri and berloff 2018 2019 who proposed that zonal inhomogeneities of the background potential vorticity can result in meridional drift of both purely zonal and tilted non zonal striations or jets in our case the background potential vorticity is zonally inhomogeneous due to the meridional component of the sverdrup flow both the basin mode mechanism and qiu et al s 2013 mechanism discussed above can lead to meridional migration of zonal jets the slow oscillation from the former mechanism could shift the zonal jets as stated above qiu et al s 2013 theory predicts the meridional distance between the jets as a function of the amplitude of annual rossby waves and of other external parameters if so and if qiu et al s mechanism explains the jets the migration of the jets must be due to some decadal modulation of some of the external parameters 4 2 3 influence of bottom topography it is interesting that some observed surface fronts in the north atlantic closely follow steep bottom features miller et al 2013 this communication between the surface and the bottom might be mediated by quasi barotropic jets anchored at steep bottom features an intriguing question is whether deep jets in general have any impacts on surface fronts taguchi et al 2012 pointed out one potential mechanism by which deep jets introduce fine scale structures in the sea surface temperature field this kind of mechanism could further impact upon submesoscale fronts we have not explored the statistics of the bottom trapped jets fig 6 as stated in the discussion of fig 6 bottom trapped jets in the ensemble mean fig 6d are stronger between 25 n and 45 n along 140 w than in the low passed field fig 6b does this mean that they vary in time coherently this may be another subject for future study the bottom anchored quasi barotropic jets seem to anchor shallower jets on their flanks it is not clear how common this feature is even though the bottom cliff is nearly zonal at 40 n the jet s zonal extent is quite limited fig 5b on the other hand the one at 32 n follows the slightly tilted cliff over a much greater distance there are similar zonally extended cliffs and valleys in the southeastern pacific and in the middle of the atlantic it would be interesting to look into these regions for more information about the quasi barotropic jets we have not examined jets further west in the subpolar region there because of the weaker stratification impacts of bottom topography on the upper ocean circulation tend to be more significant than in lower latitudes one example is the control of surface jets by barotropic circulation trapped to a bottom topographic feature in the northwest pacific mitsudera et al 2018 miyama et al 2018 such control of bottom topography may be the reason for the robustness of the zonal jets in this region fig 5 4 2 4 concluding remarks our ten member ensemble has yielded useful statistical information as above but there have been instances where statistical confidence is in doubt to obtain quantitative statistics for the zonal jets therefore more ensemble members would be necessary credit authorship contribution statement ryo furue

23922,we address ocean modeling capability that has grown exponentially while ocean observation growth has not maintained pace a situation leading to seemingly degraded forecast skill when model resolution is increased skill in predicting ocean instabilities such as mesoscale eddies requires satellite and in situ observations continually correcting numerical model conditions observations constrain positions of larger ocean model features while smaller features are unconstrained by means of an observation system simulation experiment osse we show that time space observation coverage controls the separation of constrained and unconstrained feature scales using 1000 independent surface drifters we show constrained scales have deterministic prediction skill and unconstrained scales predict areas of higher expected errors the results are shown to be consistent with ensemble forecasts separating constrained and unconstrained features and using information within each appropriately allows us to manage the present gap between observation and model resolution keywords data assimilation osse ensemble uncertainty 1 introduction ocean forecasting has progressed in recent decades since the beginning of the global ocean data assimilation experiment godae smith 2000 global and multiple nested area predictions occur in operational centers around the world lellouche et al 2018 lemieux et al 2016 metzger et al 2014 rowley and mask 2014 schiller et al 2020 these systems regularly correct a prior forecast with recent satellite and in situ observations the satellite sea surface height ssh observations are particularly critical for inferring ocean interior thermohaline variability within mesoscale eddies le traon et al 2017 and the argo program provides regular in situ observations of the ocean interior roemmich et al 2009 in situ data has increased with deployment of autonomous systems such as gliders rudnick 2016 and development of surface drifter swarms novelli et al 2017 while computational capability and thus numerical model resolution and complexity has grown exponentially with moore s law observational sampling capability has not maintained pace thus a significant gap now exists between scales resolved by regular observations and scales numerical models can physically represent sandery and sakov 2017 showed decreased ocean predictive skill as model horizontal resolution increases and we find the gap between observation and model resolution is a key contributor to this outcome this can have consequences in emergency response situations such as the deep water horizon incident that used forecasts from high resolution models to predict surface oil trajectory the associated ocean oil modeling effort did not account for the significant model and observation resolution gap and the result was wide discrepancy between forecasts and observations liu et al 2011 to illustrate the situation we examine trajectories of more than 1000 surface drifters from the lagrangian submesoscale experiment laser in the gulf of mexico özgökmen et al 2018 relative to a 1 km data assimilative numerical model fig 1a the cycling assimilation began several months prior to the drifter deployment and every day the system assimilated all regular observations satellite altimeter sea surface height satellite sea surface temperature near real time in situ profiles and ship observations the regular satellite ssh observations over 5 days are sparse relative to the finest scales of features represented by the model the drifters are independent from the model at larger scales there is qualitative correspondence between model and drifters in the prominent loop current eddy lce in the southern area the southward flow across the florida shelf and the southward flow in the range of 24 28 n 89 90 w within smaller scale features the correspondence degrades as the satellite observations do not resolve these small scales and thus corrections are not made to the model to constrain the positions of the features the illustration in fig 1a using the 1 km resolution model is not extreme prior model results at 250 m resolution in this area contain strong instabilities along the shelf break front and sharpening of fronts that the 1 km model does not represent well jacobs et al 2016 thus present model resolution capability can produce forecasts at scales far smaller than resolved by regular observations the situation creates a contradiction within operational centers conducting ocean forecasts if there is skill only in larger scales why should a center dedicate oftentimes significant computer resources to produce forecasts at smaller scales in this paper we address the problem by understanding how model and observation resolution control skill across the scale spectrum and what useful information is contained within partitions of said scale spectrum there are three main aspects and we place them in a framework aligned with wavenumber spectra fig 2 1 larger scales are constrained by observations noting wavenumber as k we define constrained scales as having power spectral density of errors ε k less than the power spectral density of the true world γ k or scales at which ε k γ k 1 2 observations and the data assimilation system determine features that are resolved and corrected and these control the boundary separating constrained and unconstrained scales the boundary is defined as ε k γ k 1 3 features within unconstrained scales are misplaced in model forecasts and therefore uncorrelated with the true world features fig 1a the variance of errors is larger than the variance of the features in unconstrained scales or ε k γ k 1 the meteorology community has examined this problem in high resolution models intended to represent convection and rain gilleland et al 2009 overview a range of methods developed to show the skill and therefore benefit of high resolution models individual small scale rain areas may not be accurately predicted but when measured by different metrics the character and coverage of events have skillful information the approach we use here is similar to the neighborhood or scale separation categories gilleland et al 2010 contingency diagrams for metrics such as rainfall threshold suffer a double penalty small scale misplaced rain events in a high resolution model lead to false positives and small scale non rain events lead to false negatives as the events in the model do not align with observed small scale events in our case this effect manifests as error variance at unconstrained scales reaching peak values of twice the true variance or ε k γ k 2 developing different metrics has avoided the double penalty mittermaier and roberts 2010 using only the constrained scales aids in removing the double penalty and there is valuable information in the unconstrained scales if used appropriately just as in the case of high resolution atmospheric models predicting the general areas of rainfall events such as along atmospheric fronts the information of variability at small scales has value in predicting areas in which the small ocean features occur and lead to larger forecast errors the available ocean observations are not persistent high resolution gridded data such as radar observed rainfall rates used in meteorological studies the laser data is a very dense data set for oceanography but it is comparatively sparse and not uniform this limits our ability to develop metrics and we restrict ourselves to using rms error statistics at observation locations thus we proceed with a different approach to show the value of high resolution model forecasts model skill assessments typically use the full model result as a deterministic forecast separating the constrained and unconstrained portions of the forecast allows us to use the constrained portion as a deterministic forecast and the unconstrained portion as an estimate of forecast error there is confidence in the prediction at constrained scales and uncertainty in unconstrained scales to substantiate the framework considered here we provide evidence for several points 1 we show that removing the model unconstrained features results in lower errors relative to observations and we build on prior work that estimated the constrained scales jacobs et al 2020 errors of velocity relative to the laser drifters indicate the majority of the error variance is due to unconstrained features rather than errors in the constrained features 2 the results demonstrated in 1 are consistent with ensemble forecast methodologies historically used to quantify uncertainty computing the mean across the ensemble removes features not correlated between members the power spectra of the mean across the ensemble contain much less energy at unconstrained scales when compared to the spectra of individual ensemble members 3 observation ability to resolve features controls the boundary between constrained and unconstrained scales an observation system simulation experiment osse using simulated surface water ocean topography swot observations provides this demonstration 4 the unconstrained portion of the model solution has skill in predicting forecast errors this is demonstrated by using the unconstrained portion of the model forecast in combination with model errors with respect to the independent 1000 laser drifters over 3 months the unconstrained variability is also shown to be consistent with ensemble variance estimates the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides the setup of model experiments which include the cycling data assimilative 1 km model the 3 km ensemble and the osse setup section 3 discusses the results separated into the constrained solution section 3 1 the boundary controlled by observations section 3 2 and the unconstrained solution section 3 3 section 4 discusses the applicability and factors that influence the results finally section 5 provides overall conclusions and final thoughts 2 model experiment setup 2 1 1 km assimilative model the navy coastal ocean model ncom produced our simulated three dimensional ocean fields throughout the study ncom is based on the hydrostatic and boussinesq approximations and explicitly represents time evolving temperature salinity velocity and sea surface height the model integrates the primitive equations in time using an explicit leapfrog scheme with a split barotropic baroclinic mode barron et al 2006 the model covers the entire gulf of mexico with a horizontal resolution set to 1 km and using 50 sigma z levels in the vertical d addezio et al 2019a b jacobs et al 2020 2016 souopgui et al 2020 the global ocean forecast system gofs based on the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom metzger et al 2014 delivered boundary conditions at 3 hour frequency that were interpolated in time to the ncom time step gofs did not contain tides a global tide solution egbert and erofeeva 2002 was the source of tidal velocities and surface heights in addition to the time interpolated gofs boundary conditions a separate atmospheric model within the coupled ocean atmosphere mesoscale prediction system coamps hodur 1997 provided data for computing atmospheric momentum flux air temperature humidity and solar radiation at hourly frequency for surface forcing to the ocean model daily freshwater inflow of rivers was represented as a velocity transport into the model domain at land boundary points with a salinity of 0 and velocity distributed over depth the transports were from the united states geological survey usgs river monitoring stations using the instruments closest to the model land boundary for rivers without observations historical monthly transports were used the ncom model connects to the navy coupled ocean data assimilation ncoda system that utilizes a 3 dimensional variational 3dvar approach smith et al 2011 each day of the model run recent observations minus the prior model forecast provide innovations and the 3dvar computes an analysis to correct the model fields there are several important aspects of the data assimilation process that have been examined and optimized in previous work the error autocovariances of the prior forecast used as the background have been examined closely details of the error covariance specification are in jacobs et al 2014a the background error autocovariance is cast as a variance amplitude and autocorrelation separable in horizontal vertical and flow dependent functions the horizontal autocorrelation is a second order autoregressive soar function with length scale based on the rossby radius of deformation multiplied by a scaling factor the scaling factor is examined closely in jacobs et al 2020 and we use the optimal value from that study resulting in a length scale of the soar of approximately 36 km averaged over the domain the vertical correlation is also a soar function with a length scale based on the background vertical density gradient so that positions in the water column with high vertical gradient have short length scales in order to maintain sharp vertical features the flow dependent correlation decreases correlations in the direction of the horizontal ssh gradient which prevents data from affecting the analysis across mesoscale fronts prior work has shown the two dominant factors in the autocovariance are the evolution of the variance amplitude and the time period prior to the analysis over which observations are used the time evolving variance formulation has been shown to be a good representation of forecast minus observation variances and including ssh observations over a 5 day window also advances the forecast skill jacobs et al 2014a 2 2 observations and observation errors the regular observations include the satellite ssh jason 2 cryosat 2 saral altika the satellite sst observations separated into day and night observations profile data from ship of opportunity xbt argo floats ocean gliders and surface ship data these are the observations that are regularly publicly available in near real time and processed operationally we refer to these as the regular observations the satellite sst temporal spatialsampling is relatively high and the spacing between observations is typically much less than the horizontal decorrelation scale of the assimilation the nadir ssh observations from jason 2 cryosat 2 saral altika are typically very close in the direction along the satellite ground track approximately 6 5 km but on any given day the ground tracks are typically far apart in the across track direction fig 1a in both these cases there is substantial redundant information that greatly slows the computational solution process of the data assimilation without adding significant value very close observations can also result in a 3dvar analysis with amplitude greater than any of the observation innovations for these reasons observations are combined into super observations super obs by averaging spatially close observations or thinning that selects one data point from a set of spatially close observations for the altimeter ssh the super obbing is conducted by averaging ssh values that are close as measured by the horizontal decorrelation scale of the background error the super obbed ssh is then converted to a synthetic vertical temperature and salinity profile using correlations based on historical in situ observations helber et al 2013 satellite sst data are more uniform and super obbing is also done by spatial averaging of values in situ profiles from certain platforms such as gliders or towed ctd may be very dense in one direction for these data types thinning is used to prevent averaging from smoothing sharp features the average temperature profile may be unrealistic and therefore data is thinned to maintain individual observed profiles data thinning and super obbing are conducted in the data preparation stage observation errors are a sum of instrument and representativeness errors representativeness errors are intended to be the variance of true features that the model is not expected to represent and representativeness errors are much larger than instrument errors the value of the representativeness error in the assimilation system is a function of the background gradients in the horizontal and vertical sst representativeness errors are higher in areas of sharp fronts as the fronts in the true ocean can move more rapidly than in the model the average sst total error is about 0 6 c with minimum errors of 0 1 c and maximum errors reaching 1 8 c profile representativeness errors are higher at depths of high vertical gradients as internal waves can create large variations that are not represented in the model using one day of observations in the 1 km system fig 3 shows the effects of including the vertical gradient dependence in the total errors ascribed to argo and the synthetic profiles derived from ssh observations the assimilation system computes error estimates for each profile individually the minimum mean and maximum values across all profiles are shown in fig 3 in fig 2 the representativeness error is the variance at scales of physics not represented by the model and scales below the nyquist we will see in the discussion that when the model has unconstrained features these features should contribute additional errors to observations this consideration was not taken into account in the experiments and the discussion considers how aspects of the assimilation process may change the results this study uses the model and assimilation system throughout results in fig 1a are from the model and assimilation system using all regular observations to correct the model state on a daily basis and the system was initialized in 2012 the drifter trajectories do not affect the results and therefore represent independent observations 2 3 power spectral density the power spectral density psd in fig 2 represents a space and time average an approximately 6 degree square subdomain in deep water was chosen for two dimensional psd calculations d addezio et al 2019b four variables were considered mixed layer depth mld diagnosed from the model temperature 100 m depth temperature surface kinetic energy ke and sea surface height ssh model data with 3 hour frequency were saved for psd computation at each 3 hour interval a two dimensional fast fourier transform computed the two dimensional psd a time average of the two dimensional psd provided a single mean two dimensional psd estimate to obtain a one dimensional spectrum the time mean two dimensional psd was averaged in direction along concentric circles of constant wavenumber k d addezio et al 2019b richman et al 2012 the two dimensional psd is defined as 1 g k x k y g x y e i k x x e i k y y d x d y where k x k y is the wavenumber vector the first term on the right side is the fourier transform of the function g x y and is the complex conjugate of the fourier transform the directional average is then 2 g r k 1 2 π k π π g k x k y k d θ where k k x 2 k y 2 θ is direction and within the integral there is an implicit conversion from g k x k y to g k θ the plots in fig 2 are g r k to obtain variance g r k must be multiplied by 2 π k and then integrated over k the total variance v is 3 v 0 2 π k g r k d k 0 2 π k π π 1 2 π k g k x k y k d θ d k 0 π π g k x k y k d θ d k g k x k y d k x d k y because fig 2 is plotted in log space multiplying by k is equivalent to adding 1 to the spectral slopes for surface kinetic energy we applied the processing described above separately to surface zonal and meridional velocity and then averaged the two resulting spectra richman et al 2012 2 4 3 km ensemble model ensemble ocean predictions are composed of a set of numerical forecast models the system used here was set up at 3 km resolution using the ncom model in this study a 32 member ensemble used an ensemble transform et methodology one member was the control run which conducted a daily data assimilation cycle after the data assimilation the perturbations of the remaining members from the control run were scaled so that the ensemble variance matched the analysis variance estimated during the data assimilation process mclay et al 2008 all the members were then integrated forward in time until the next assimilation cycle thus the analysis variance controls the spread of the ensemble at the analysis time and the ensemble growth during the forecast is dependent on the nonlinear model development the ensemble prediction system was initialized in 2012 and conducted daily cycles at any location and for any variable the ensemble set provides a sample intended to represent the probability density function of the state evensen 1994 this ensemble system has previously shown skill in forecasting errors in the gulf of mexico domain wei et al 2014 the variance across the ensemble increases during the forecast period the spread reliability is an evaluation of the variance across the ensemble to the error variance with observations the spread reliability shows the ensemble is able to predict areas of larger and smaller errors consistent with observations the ensemble under predicts error in that the variance across the ensemble is typically lower than the observed error variance this is also reflected in the talagrand histograms wei et al 2013 part of the error of any ensemble member is due to unconstrained features at any time the mean over ensemble members reduces the influence of the unconstrained features if the features are uncorrelated across members this phenomenon will be explored more thoroughly in section 3 1 we analyze results of the ensemble ocean system covering january through june 2016 using the power spectral density analysis described in section 2 3 the order of ensemble averaging time averaging and computing psd is important as the computation of psd is a non linear operation define an ensemble member variable v i j as the i th ensemble member at the j th time define the mean psd of a variable as 4 1 n i n j i 1 n i j 1 n j p s d v i j where p s d is the squared amplitude of the fourier transform averaged over direction n i is the number of ensemble members and n j is the number of time steps the mean psd represents the energy distribution of the variable that would occur on average within any snapshot of any ensemble member define the ensemble mean psd as 5 1 n j j 1 n j p s d 1 n i i 1 n i v i j this averages the ensemble members which reduces the effects due to unconstrained features before computing the psd and averaging realizations over time the ratio of ensemble mean psd to mean psd should be less than 1 and indicates the fraction of energy remaining after averaging across the ensemble fig 4 at the largest scales the ratio is near 1 which indicates the energy of features is similar across all the ensemble members at the larger scales at smaller scales features across the ensembles are uncorrelated and averaging reduces the energy in the ensemble mean psd the characteristic of importance is the wavenumber range over which the ratio decreases substantially from a value of 1 in section 3 1 we consider this wavenumber range to show consistency with estimated constrained scales 2 5 1 km osse setup in the osse experiment the term nature run is the system with all realistic boundary conditions and surface forcing but without any data assimilation the osse setup uses a 1 km nature run d addezio et al 2019a b the nature run allows the numerical model physics to represent instability processes that cascade energy across the wavenumber spectrum fig 2 the nature run also provides the data sampled by simulated observing systems we sampled the nature run at all regular satellite and in situ observation locations and by the swot simulator version 2 0 0 gaultier et al 2016 a second 1 km osse model assimilates the simulated observations the gofs state on november 1 2015 provides the initial condition to the nature run this initial condition was 2 months prior to the osse experiment to allow spin up after spin up to january 1 2016 a 1 year integration of the nature run saved 3 hourly values of 3 dimensional temperature salinity and velocity and 2 dimensional sea surface height the osse initial condition on december 1 2015 was set to the nature state on december 1 2016 this provided a seasonally realistic initial condition with ocean mesoscale features that were out of place relative to the nature run the osse is spun up for one month assimilating daily simulated nature run observations and is evaluated relative to the nature run starting january 1 2016 d addezio et al 2019b this osse is a fraternal twin experiment that does not represent errors in the physics of the numerical model we sampled the nature run at real observation locations and times for the regular observing network in situ satellite sea surface temperature and satellite altimetry and the swot simulator sampled the nature run using a 2 km grid in the along and across track directions the swot simulator includes estimates of the errors from a range of sources in the experiments here we include only an estimate of the sensor noise from the karin instrument gaultier et al 2016 the expected sampling for swot is 1 km in the along and across track directions in section 2 2 we discussed the super obbing and thinning that takes place with respect to the horizontal decorrelation scale even at 2 km the swot observations are significantly reduced a 1 km sampling would result in the same data quantity used in the assimilation examples of the swot super obbing are provided in d addezio et al 2019b their fig 9 the simulated observations were assimilated by the osse using the ncoda 3dvar system smith et al 2011 the osse used a two step multi scale formulation of ncoda li et al 2015 souopgui et al 2020 the first step of the analysis used same settings as discussed in the 1 km model of section 2 1 which are mesoscale oriented the second step used the results of the first step as the background for computing innovations observation minus background and a smaller decorrelation length scale souopgui et al 2020 this methodology improves analysis skill when the observing network is able to resolve a wide range of spatial scales li et al 2015 2019 muscarella et al 2014 the osse multi scale 3dvar assimilated observations every 24 h for a six month period for the second analysis step the horizontal scale of the soar function was about 10 km the 10 km scale represents about 20 km features which is near the lower limit of features swot expects to resolve each daily analysis used data over a prior period the first step used prior data periods of 12 day 5 day and 1 day for in situ profiles satellite altimetry and satellite sea surface temperature respectively the second analysis used data over a 1 day period for all observation types as the smaller spatial scales have shorter time scales souopgui et al 2020 temperature at 100 m depth was used for evaluation fig 5 the osse assimilation experiment minus the nature run provided full time varying 3d error fields a spectral analysis performed on the errors provided the ability to identify constrained and unconstrained scales 3 results we use the wavenumber psd to illustrate the relations between model resolution observation resolution and the gap between the two fig 2 the data are from a 1 km resolution ocean model section 2 1 and the psd lines are one dimensional spectra representing time and direction averages section 2 3 features smaller than 2 km are beyond the nyquist wavelength of the model 1 km grid second order accurate numerical schemes require about 10 grid points within one wavelength to reasonably represent a first derivative roache 1998 for the 1 km model considered there is a limit at 10 km wavelength separating physics the model represents from those it does not the level of desired numerical accuracy may change from one situation to another so this limit may not be a clear and distinct line model resolution controls the limits at the smallest scales in the spectrum as model resolution increases both the nyquist and representation limits move to smaller wavelengths to the right now we consider what information is contained in the larger constrained scales what controls the boundary between the constrained and unconstrained and what information lies within the unconstrained scales 3 1 constrained scales and confidence by the definition introduced in section 1 error variance in the constrained wavenumber band fig 2 is lower than the variance of the features themselves d addezio et al 2019b for the osse experiments we can compute the psd of forecast errors to determine the boundary between constrained and unconstrained because we do not have regularly gridded observations of the true ocean we cannot directly compute psd of errors an approach to estimating the boundary separating constrained and unconstrained scales is to filter unconstrained features from the model to reduce error variance relative to observations jacobs et al 2020 the filtering methodology is described in appendix a which uses a gaussian convolution kernel initially removing small scale features reduces errors to observations and gradually increasing the size of the filter reduces errors until a minimum error is reached continuing to increase the filter size and removing larger scales increases errors errors in surface trajectories are a minimum at a filter length scale of 58 km defined by a gaussian e folding scale in a convolution kernel or a 220 km wavelength defined by the 1 4 power point of the filter the errors as a function of filtering scale in jacobs et al 2020 are a broad minimum because error psd divided by true ocean psd ε k γ k gradually transitions from less than 1 to greater than 1 this is also apparent in the osse results in section 3 2 in addition the gaussian kernel does not provide a sharp cutoff in wavenumber space this boundary can change depending on the particular situation and therefore this boundary is not a clear and distinct line in fig 2 the unconstrained band lies between the boundary of skillful prediction of constrained features larger than 220 km wavelength and the model representation limit at 10 km wavelengths in tests varying the horizontal decorrelation length scale within the data assimilation the error minimum occurred at the same filtering scale for the range of decorrelation scales tested except for the longest decorrelation scale that was unrealistically large jacobs et al 2020 ocean forecasting experiments indicate that forecast skill degrades with increasing model resolution sandery and sakov 2017 fig 2 helps interpret this result assume the model resolution were such that the scale of represented features were equivalent to scales resolved by observations and allowed by the data assimilation in this case there would be no unconstrained wavenumber band as model resolution increases the unconstrained band between constrained scales and the model representation limit increases all of the variance in the unconstrained band adds to the error level because by definition there is no skill in the unconstrained band the error variance added from the unconstrained band is more than up to twice the variance of the features in the unconstrained band because the model and true feature positions are uncorrelated appendix b as model resolution continues to increase the unconstrained band becomes wider the variance added from the unconstrained band continues to increase errors as model resolution increases errors at small scales significantly affect ocean surface trajectory forecasts griffa et al 2004 and we show the total error variance in the constrained band is less than the total error variance in the unconstrained band differencing a model field from observations three sources contribute to error variance appendix b 1 errors in the constrained band ec 2 the model unconstrained scale variance mu and 3 the true ocean variance at the unconstrained scale tu for the moment we are neglecting the variance of the true ocean at scales not represented by the model after filtering mu features from numerical model fields rms error decreases to 0 80 times the original value jacobs et al 2020 assuming a zero mean the rms squared is the variance and therefore filtering the mu reduces variance to 0 64 of the original value assuming the three error contributions are statistically independent the mu variance is 0 36 of the total error variance the remaining 0 64 of the total variance is the sum of ec and tu a conservative assumption is that tu variance is equal to mu variance then the contribution of the ec band is 0 28 of the total error variance which is less than tu and mu errors the assumption is conservative as we expect tu variance is greater than mu variance since model resolution limits features physically represented fig 2 thus the contribution of the ec errors to the total error would be less than the estimated value of 0 28 and the conclusion remains valid initially we neglected errors due to variance at scales smaller than represented by the model if we consider the contribution of errors due to variability in the true ocean at scales not represented in the model the ec errors become smaller and the conclusion remains valid the contribution to errors due to variability in the unconstrained band is larger than the contribution to errors in the constrained band the majority of uncertainty is in the unconstrained portion of the solution the constrained portion of the solution can be described as the portion in which we have confidence this result is a reflection of the definition that constrained scales have error variance smaller than the variance of the solution section 1 this conclusion is for the observations of velocity obtained from the laser drifters the psd slope can change the boundary position for different variables because the psd curves represent an average over direction integration to obtain variance in a wavenumber band requires multiplication by wavenumber section 2 3 when considering the contribution to variance in different wavenumber bands a value of 1 should be added to the slopes of the lines in fig 2 the ratio of unconstrained to constrained variance u c variance is the ratio of the psd integrated over the unconstrained band to the psd integrated over the constrained band the ssh slope magnitude is largest and the mixed layer depth mld slope magnitude is smallest therefore ssh u c variance is smaller than mld u c variance this has implications for evaluating the impact of added observations osses suggest that when increasing ssh observations ssh skill advancements are small while skill advancements in mld are larger d addezio et al 2019b jacobs et al 2014a when judging observation system impact it is important to consider a relevant variable that is sensitive to the observations and contains requisite smaller scale structure finally we evaluate consistency of the estimated constrained and unconstrained bands with an ensemble representation results from the 32 member ocean model ensemble indicate smaller scales being unconstrained the mean psd contains more variance than the ensemble mean psd and the ratio of the two shows larger energy reductions at smaller scales fig 4 averaging over the ensemble realizations reduces the signal of unconstrained features not correlated between ensemble members larger scale features are similar amongst the ensemble members and averaging across the ensembles does not greatly reduce the constrained energy smaller scales contain a more pronounced reduction of energy when averaging over the ensemble set with the change in relative energy occurring in the range of 100 to 200 km wavelengths this is consistent with the estimated constrained scale of 220 km obtained by filtering the 1 km model result to minimize errors to the laser data jacobs et al 2020 thus our conclusions are consistent with ensemble approaches and we consider this further in the discussion section 4 3 2 the boundary separating constrained and unconstrained scales ocean features resolved by observations and corrected by the assimilation control the boundary between constrained and unconstrained scales prior theory and experiments have shown computing model corrections at scales smaller than resolved by observations leads to degradation of results li et al 2015 thus limited independent observations to resolve features represent a wall to predictive skill demonstrations of high resolution in situ data özgökmen et al 2018 and future high resolution satellite ocean observing systems such as swot fu and ubelmann 2014 can reduce errors one such example is the application of dense surface drifter deployments to predicting trajectories inferred velocities from 300 drifters in the grand lagrangian deployment glad olascoaga et al 2013 correct model forecasts and forecast drift trajectories improve significantly as the data constrain smaller scale features through a 4dvar assimilation carrier et al 2014 an explanation of the effect is that the additional data moves the boundary to smaller scales to the right in fig 2 the constrained band increases in size the unconstrained band reduces in size and the total variance contributing to errors in the unconstrained band decreases we use an osse to demonstrate and quantify this more clearly an osse of the swot observing system section 2 5 demonstrates this in terms of the psd of errors satellite orbits are predictable far in advance therefore we know the data distribution that will occur however the sampled points in an area do not always form a similar regular pattern every day from the swot osse results the mean of the absolute value of the error mae of 100 m depth temperature fig 5a contains a periodicity which correlates negatively to the number of observations within each daily assimilation we use the 100 m temperature for evaluation rather than the ssh because the ssh psd slope is steeper which leads to 100 m temperature being a more sensitive metric in addition the ssh is the main observed variable and evaluation of a less observed variable provides a more independent test the psd of the mae time series contains a local peak at 10 7 days fig 5b this is roughly half the 21 day exact repeat period of the swot orbit and it is due to the manner in which the satellite samples the area during the orbit cycle while swot data are dense along satellite observation swaths distribution of swaths in an area is irregular in time during the 21 day swot repeat period a set of swaths first covers the area leading to increased data then there is a time gap of no swot swaths leading to data decrease and later a second set of swaths provides another dense sampling set followed by another data gap this leads to the 10 7 day periodicity in 100 m temperature errors because we have full time varying fields from the nature and osse models we can compute full error fields we compute constrained scales in 100 m depth temperature using data at times of the local minima in the mae and separately at the times of local maxima using wavenumber spectral analysis to compute the normalized error psd for the osse experiment we used d addezio et al 2019b 6 ε o s s e γ n a t u r e γ o s s e where ε o s s e is the osse error psd psd of the nature run minus osse γ n a t u r e is the nature run psd γ o s s e is the osse psd and brackets denote the mean of the two psd values range from 0 to 2 fig 5 a value of 0 indicates the osse has no error at the particular wavelength a value of 2 indicates the osse and the nature run are uncorrelated and the error variance is the sum of the osse variance and the nature run variance we define the boundary between constrained and unconstrained scales as the wavelength where the normalized error psd has a value of 1 as in section 1 the constrained scales have errors smaller than the variability of the features the boundaries between constrained and unconstrained scales are 68 km during times of error minima and data maxima versus 92 km during times of error maxima and data minima fig 5c thus we see the boundary separating constrained and unconstrained scales oscillating throughout the swot observing cycle with the full time varying temperature field we can examine the details of the boundary both in spatial scale and temporal scale the wavenumber frequency spectra of errors the nature run and the osse experiment were computed from the 00z value of 100 m temperature on each day of the 6 months this produces a three dimensional matrix with dimensions f k x k y the k x k y psd were directionally averaged as described in section 2 3 generating a final f k psd matrix normalizing the error psd according to eq 6 and using the definition of the boundary between constrained and unconstrained as the normalized psd having a value of 1 we can see how the time scale of the boundary changes as a function of spatial scale fig 5d in this analysis we have not separated data from times of error minima and maxima at the largest scales there is skill at time periods longer than approximately 15 days the boundary time scale increases as spatial scales become shorter for example at 50 km scales only time periods longer than 40 days have skill the shortest scales at which there is skill are about 30 km at which the time scales move to 180 days the ability of the observation data to resolve smaller features moves the boundary while observations move the boundary to smaller scales and advance prediction skill we must properly utilize the constrained and unconstrained information from forecasts regardless of the boundary position 3 3 unconstrained scales and uncertainty though there is not skill in predicting the exact location of features in the unconstrained band we can still recover valuable information from this band in the constrained scales there is skill in predicting the position of features which is deterministic forecast skill assuming the model physics are realistic the unconstrained solution contains statistical prediction skill while the position of any unconstrained feature is not predictable the model can predict areas in which the unconstrained features develop filtering can separate scales and the unconstrained features are the residual of the full model solution minus the constrained scales appendix a at any time define the local unconstrained variability at a point x o y o as the spatially weighted rms of the local unconstrained features v ˆ u x o y o appendix a in areas containing unconstrained features with large amplitude v ˆ u is large and areas containing small amplitude unconstrained features v ˆ u is small the vectors in fig 1a are the full model solution and vectors in fig 1b are the constrained currents that remain after filtering the results shown in fig 1a the background color in fig 1b is the local unconstrained variability of speed square root of eastward and northward v ˆ u 2 larger scale constrained ocean features such as mesoscale eddies have strong currents around the periphery which form sharp fronts the small scale nature of the fronts results in errors due to mispositioning with high values of v ˆ u bathymetric features such as the shelf break along louisiana to the florida panhandle are areas of active generation of small features jacobs et al 2016 mesoscale eddies modulate stratification that becomes conducive or inhibitive to the formation of submesoscale eddies capet et al 2008 d asaro et al 2011 jacobs et al 2014b mcwilliams 2016 qiu et al 2014 shcherbina et al 2013 thomas et al 2013 zhong and bracco 2013 the anticyclonic gulf of mexico loop current eddy lce contains a much deeper thermocline than the surrounding area this effect decreases stratification in the upper water column and leads to a much deeper mixed layer that is conducive to the formation of submesoscale eddies the lce is typically an area of high submesoscale eddy activity forecast errors or uncertainty are not expected to be distributed uniformly but should be related to the underlying processes we show skill in v ˆ u 2 being a predictor for error variance by using trajectories observed by more than 1000 surface drifters from laser in the gulf of mexico özgökmen et al 2018 the value of v ˆ u 2 is an estimate of the expected errors due to unconstrained ocean features if the estimator v ˆ u 2 has skill in predicting areas of small scale activity we expect a relation with observed error variance this relation changes if we are computing errors to the full model solution or errors to only the constrained portion of the model solution appendix b the expected relation between v ˆ u 2 and the constrained model solution error variance is a constant value due to errors in the constrained field plus the value of v ˆ u 2 due to the true ocean variance at unconstrained scales the expected relation between v ˆ u 2 and the full model solution error variance is the same constant due to errors in the constrained field plus twice the value of v ˆ u 2 due to the unconstrained variance in the model solution and the true ocean variance at unconstrained scales to demonstrate v ˆ u 2 has predictive skill for every drifter velocity at a location and time we first compute the squared observed velocity error the squared error adds to the value in a bin determined by the coincident value of v ˆ u 2 within each bin of v ˆ u 2 we compute the mean of all squared velocity errors velocity squared errors are accumulated separately from both the full model field and the constrained model field the results fig 6 are consistent with expected relations the error variance of both the full model solution and the constrained solution have about the same constant value the constrained solution error variance increases with a slope of about 1 and the total solution error variance increases with of slope of about 2 this supports two conclusions first using only the constrained scales in deterministic forecasts produces lower errors in model variables in an rms sense second the unconstrained local variance v ˆ u 2 provides statistical prediction of error variance we can accomplish this only if forecasts have sufficient resolution to represent the small scale features the ensemble results also aid in verifying the predictive skill in v ˆ u 2 we compute the small scale variance of surface velocity by summing the eastward and the northward small scale variance of velocity components from the 1 km model from the ensemble at each time we sum the eastward and the northward variance across the ensemble we restrict the comparisons of the information to water depths that are greater than 1000 m where mesoscale and submesoscale instabilities are the dominant process the probability density function of the small scale surface velocity variance and the variance of surface velocity across the ensemble indicate a high correlation fig 7 this further advances the utility of the scale separation method as the result correlates well with the ensemble methodology we also note that the forecast time period considered in the evaluations here is only the 0 to 24 h forecast after the data assimilation cycle each day it would be expected that as longer forecast times are considered the boundary between constrained and unconstrained energy will move to larger scales or to the left in fig 2 the rate at which the boundary moves to the left would be expected to be a function of the instability growth time across the wavenumber spectrum the swot osse results fig 5 give some indication of the speed at which errors increase over time as the mae increases during periods of no swot coverage from the minimum value the rate at which the constrained scales change during the forecast time is an important aspect left for future examination 4 discussion results in fig 6 are consistent with the concept that the forecast solution contains skill in the constrained scales the unconstrained scales add error the small scale variability is predictor of the error variance and thus the high resolution forecasts have skill in predicting areas in which the small scale variability will occur this is similar to the meteorological problem of showing skill in high resolution model rainfall gilleland et al 2010 a range of metrics have been developed in meteorology such as fractional skill score which is skill in predicting the fraction of an area over which rainfall exceeds a threshold mittermaier and roberts 2010 such metrics are enabled by large area gridded data of rainfall rates from radar systems even with the extensive drifter deployment during the laser experiment the ocean sampling was relatively sparse and non uniform constructing regular gridded fields for evaluation was not possible so our metrics are simple rms errors at point locations improved metrics could advance the demonstration of value in high resolution ocean models it is also important to consider the variables used in the metrics and the spectral slopes in fig 2 are important considerations the steep slope of ssh indicates this is not a sensitive variable for demonstrating advances in predictive skill the shallow slope of the eke and mld shows the influence of smaller scale features previous observation system experiments oses jacobs et al 2014b indicate the improvement when adding an additional altimeter data stream is much smaller in ssh than in frontogenesis forcing and surface divergence skill frontogenesis forcing is based on the flow field strain and buoyancy gradients and surface divergence is a gradient of the velocity field the slope of the frontogenesis forcing and divergence psd would be shallower by a value of 1 than eke and the slope of eke is about 1 shallower than the slope of ssh that would be expected if currents were in geostrophic balance fig 2 because frontal areas typically contain stronger currents they are important for many applications including fisheries commercial endeavors and emergency response the surface divergence driven by frontogenesis may be sufficiently observable in the future by airborne instruments rodríguez et al 2018 as we look to developing metrics more closely related to human activity these will tend toward variables that have a much flatter slope and thus much more variability at small scales part of the forecast process is the assimilation and associated settings including length scales of background errors flow dependent correlations and observation errors prior results indicate the boundary separating constrained and unconstrained scales is more sensitive to some parts of the data assimilation than others in experiments varying the horizontal decorrelation scale jacobs et al 2020 the boundary did not change except for the largest unrealistic decorrelation scale in osse experiments souopgui et al 2020 adding swot data increased skill in both single scale and multi scale assimilation the multi scale assimilation consistently provided increased forecast skill relative to the single scale assimilation and the boundary scale decreased slightly thus changes in the data assimilation process can have impact on the boundary between constrained and unconstrained scales it should be noted that the osse experiments were able to compute the boundary scale from the psd of full time evolving 3d fields while the estimates of the boundary scale through comparison to non uniformly distributed drifters used a filtering approach the osse experiments are a much more sensitive tool than what can be measured by direct observations together these results imply that advancing the data assimilation process and settings increases forecast skill and can have impacts on the boundary of constrained scales from the osse results in this paper we find additional observations that resolve smaller scale ocean features reduce the constrained scales the features leading to the unconstrained energy are due primarily to flow instabilities these include small mesoscale eddies on the scale of 100 km submesoscale eddies with high rossby number and frontogenesis processes that are driven by straining of the mesoscale and submesoscale flow and buoyancy fields hoskins 1982 the motivation for conducting the experiments at 1 km resolution was to resolve the processes associated with submesoscale eddies capet et al 2008 prediction of instability processes requires regular corrections to model initial conditions and high resolution models with insufficient observations leads to unconstrained scales other dynamical regimes may not contain processes leading to the separate unconstrained features in particular coastal environments are dominated by wind driven events and fresh water fluxes from land rather than instabilities thus caution should be exercised prior to applying these concepts to other dynamical regimes in light of the unconstrained variability we must reconsider observation errors in high resolution models errors in instrumentation are often the smallest source of discrepancy between observations and model forecasts representativeness errors are regarded as signal due to small scale features in the true world that the numerical model does not represent in fig 2 this is the variance in the band at scales smaller than represented by the model or smaller than 10 km in the case of the 1 km resolution model used here considering fig 2 again there is large variance in the unconstrained band that creates deviations of the model from observations and this is an additional error source the unconstrained errors in fig 2 are larger than the representativeness errors because the model resolution represents features down to 10 km and observations constrain only much larger features in addition because the model unconstrained features are uncorrelated with the true ocean features the total unconstrained error variance is twice the variance of the true ocean in the unconstrained band if as in appendix b we separate the model and true world into variability in the constrained scales and unconstrained scales and if we assume the model and true fields are uncorrelated in the unconstrained band we find additional errors that are twice the variance in the unconstrained scales represented by the model when comparing to the laser drifters to the representativeness errors we must add twice the unconstrained variance this is analogous to the double penalty errors pointed out by gilleland et al 2009 in the assimilation experiments here the unconstrained variance error was not considered including the error would be expected to reduce the influence of observations and appropriate errors could increase forecast skill and move the boundary to smaller scales while the quantitative value of the boundary position may change the concepts of separating constrained and unconstrained scales would not 5 conclusions we provide a framework in wavenumber space to understand concepts involved in ocean forecast systems that have model resolution representing features smaller than observations resolve and the assimilation system corrects constrained scales are defined as having error variance smaller than the true world variance model smaller scales are unconstrained and have errors larger than the true world variance we have confidence in the forecasts at the constrained scales and the unconstrained scales contain uncertainty since there is no predictive skill error variance in the unconstrained band is up to twice the variance of the true world features results from ensemble forecasts are consistent with the scales estimated to be constrained the ratio of ensemble mean psd to the mean of the ensemble psd shows the large reduction of energy in the unconstrained scales indicating the uncorrelated features between ensemble members at the smaller scales the framework explains results in which increased resolution leads to degraded skill sandery and sakov 2017 since increased resolution increases the variance in the unconstrained scales the boundary between constrained and unconstrained bands is controlled by the capability of observations to resolve features and the assimilation to correct the model initial condition moving the boundary to smaller scales increases the constrained band and reduces forecast error the assimilation system must use data appropriately to ensure smaller features are corrected as shown by souopgui et al 2020 variables and metrics that are most sensitive to observation and assimilation impacts are those with larger energy at smaller scales and thus have shallow psd slopes ocean variables such as mld and frontal forcing are better indicators of advanced forecasts than ssh adding observations through the swot osse shows regular periodic intervals when swot swaths cover the domain with the boundary moving to smaller scales and intervals when swot swaths are absent from the domain with the boundary moving to larger scales the osse also shows the separation of time and space scales of constrained features the largest constrained features cover time scales of 15 days and longer while the smaller constrained features occur only at time scales of 100 days and longer in the 1 km setup the unconstrained local variance v ˆ u 2 has skill in predicting the forecast errors since the majority of the errors are due to features at scales below the constrained in order for v ˆ u 2 to be a predictor model resolution must be sufficient to represent unconstrained processes of importance twice the unconstrained variance must be included in observation errors in addition to representativeness errors based on the psd of the 1 km model fig 2 the unconstrained errors are larger than representativeness errors which are typically larger than instrument errors the equivalent results of the unconstrained variance versus ensemble variance in fig 7 require several critical factors to be met the locations of unconstrained variability must have predictability and the areas of unconstrained variability are controlled by the larger scale constrained flow field we must know the boundary position between the constrained and unconstrained portions of the fields and the laser observations play a key role in estimating the boundary scale the forecast model must have sufficient resolution to represent the majority of variance at unconstrained scales finally the majority of forecast error must be in the unconstrained band and the psd slope is an important factor in determining this fig 2 knowing the separation between constrained and unconstrained energy allows high resolution forecasts to be used most effectively the constrained portion of the solution has lower errors information in the unconstrained local variance could be exploited in statistical forecasts piterbarg 2001 we must continue to extend numerical representation of smaller scale dynamics as these affect dispersion at scales well below model resolutions poje et al 2014 theory to exploit unconstrained statistical information in dispersion prediction has been utilized in the ocean haza et al 2007 ultimately by knowing and exploiting both constrained and unconstrained information we can justify continued increase in ocean model

unconstrained band the model error variance is twice the unconstrained variance v ˆ u 2 if the local spatial variance of the unconstrained scales in the model v ˆ u 2 is an estimate of the unconstrained variance then the expected squared error in the model constrained field at a location is a constant due to the error in the model constrained field plus the estimated unconstrained

23922,we address ocean modeling capability that has grown exponentially while ocean observation growth has not maintained pace a situation leading to seemingly degraded forecast skill when model resolution is increased skill in predicting ocean instabilities such as mesoscale eddies requires satellite and in situ observations continually correcting numerical model conditions observations constrain positions of larger ocean model features while smaller features are unconstrained by means of an observation system simulation experiment osse we show that time space observation coverage controls the separation of constrained and unconstrained feature scales using 1000 independent surface drifters we show constrained scales have deterministic prediction skill and unconstrained scales predict areas of higher expected errors the results are shown to be consistent with ensemble forecasts separating constrained and unconstrained features and using information within each appropriately allows us to manage the present gap between observation and model resolution keywords data assimilation osse ensemble uncertainty 1 introduction ocean forecasting has progressed in recent decades since the beginning of the global ocean data assimilation experiment godae smith 2000 global and multiple nested area predictions occur in operational centers around the world lellouche et al 2018 lemieux et al 2016 metzger et al 2014 rowley and mask 2014 schiller et al 2020 these systems regularly correct a prior forecast with recent satellite and in situ observations the satellite sea surface height ssh observations are particularly critical for inferring ocean interior thermohaline variability within mesoscale eddies le traon et al 2017 and the argo program provides regular in situ observations of the ocean interior roemmich et al 2009 in situ data has increased with deployment of autonomous systems such as gliders rudnick 2016 and development of surface drifter swarms novelli et al 2017 while computational capability and thus numerical model resolution and complexity has grown exponentially with moore s law observational sampling capability has not maintained pace thus a significant gap now exists between scales resolved by regular observations and scales numerical models can physically represent sandery and sakov 2017 showed decreased ocean predictive skill as model horizontal resolution increases and we find the gap between observation and model resolution is a key contributor to this outcome this can have consequences in emergency response situations such as the deep water horizon incident that used forecasts from high resolution models to predict surface oil trajectory the associated ocean oil modeling effort did not account for the significant model and observation resolution gap and the result was wide discrepancy between forecasts and observations liu et al 2011 to illustrate the situation we examine trajectories of more than 1000 surface drifters from the lagrangian submesoscale experiment laser in the gulf of mexico özgökmen et al 2018 relative to a 1 km data assimilative numerical model fig 1a the cycling assimilation began several months prior to the drifter deployment and every day the system assimilated all regular observations satellite altimeter sea surface height satellite sea surface temperature near real time in situ profiles and ship observations the regular satellite ssh observations over 5 days are sparse relative to the finest scales of features represented by the model the drifters are independent from the model at larger scales there is qualitative correspondence between model and drifters in the prominent loop current eddy lce in the southern area the southward flow across the florida shelf and the southward flow in the range of 24 28 n 89 90 w within smaller scale features the correspondence degrades as the satellite observations do not resolve these small scales and thus corrections are not made to the model to constrain the positions of the features the illustration in fig 1a using the 1 km resolution model is not extreme prior model results at 250 m resolution in this area contain strong instabilities along the shelf break front and sharpening of fronts that the 1 km model does not represent well jacobs et al 2016 thus present model resolution capability can produce forecasts at scales far smaller than resolved by regular observations the situation creates a contradiction within operational centers conducting ocean forecasts if there is skill only in larger scales why should a center dedicate oftentimes significant computer resources to produce forecasts at smaller scales in this paper we address the problem by understanding how model and observation resolution control skill across the scale spectrum and what useful information is contained within partitions of said scale spectrum there are three main aspects and we place them in a framework aligned with wavenumber spectra fig 2 1 larger scales are constrained by observations noting wavenumber as k we define constrained scales as having power spectral density of errors ε k less than the power spectral density of the true world γ k or scales at which ε k γ k 1 2 observations and the data assimilation system determine features that are resolved and corrected and these control the boundary separating constrained and unconstrained scales the boundary is defined as ε k γ k 1 3 features within unconstrained scales are misplaced in model forecasts and therefore uncorrelated with the true world features fig 1a the variance of errors is larger than the variance of the features in unconstrained scales or ε k γ k 1 the meteorology community has examined this problem in high resolution models intended to represent convection and rain gilleland et al 2009 overview a range of methods developed to show the skill and therefore benefit of high resolution models individual small scale rain areas may not be accurately predicted but when measured by different metrics the character and coverage of events have skillful information the approach we use here is similar to the neighborhood or scale separation categories gilleland et al 2010 contingency diagrams for metrics such as rainfall threshold suffer a double penalty small scale misplaced rain events in a high resolution model lead to false positives and small scale non rain events lead to false negatives as the events in the model do not align with observed small scale events in our case this effect manifests as error variance at unconstrained scales reaching peak values of twice the true variance or ε k γ k 2 developing different metrics has avoided the double penalty mittermaier and roberts 2010 using only the constrained scales aids in removing the double penalty and there is valuable information in the unconstrained scales if used appropriately just as in the case of high resolution atmospheric models predicting the general areas of rainfall events such as along atmospheric fronts the information of variability at small scales has value in predicting areas in which the small ocean features occur and lead to larger forecast errors the available ocean observations are not persistent high resolution gridded data such as radar observed rainfall rates used in meteorological studies the laser data is a very dense data set for oceanography but it is comparatively sparse and not uniform this limits our ability to develop metrics and we restrict ourselves to using rms error statistics at observation locations thus we proceed with a different approach to show the value of high resolution model forecasts model skill assessments typically use the full model result as a deterministic forecast separating the constrained and unconstrained portions of the forecast allows us to use the constrained portion as a deterministic forecast and the unconstrained portion as an estimate of forecast error there is confidence in the prediction at constrained scales and uncertainty in unconstrained scales to substantiate the framework considered here we provide evidence for several points 1 we show that removing the model unconstrained features results in lower errors relative to observations and we build on prior work that estimated the constrained scales jacobs et al 2020 errors of velocity relative to the laser drifters indicate the majority of the error variance is due to unconstrained features rather than errors in the constrained features 2 the results demonstrated in 1 are consistent with ensemble forecast methodologies historically used to quantify uncertainty computing the mean across the ensemble removes features not correlated between members the power spectra of the mean across the ensemble contain much less energy at unconstrained scales when compared to the spectra of individual ensemble members 3 observation ability to resolve features controls the boundary between constrained and unconstrained scales an observation system simulation experiment osse using simulated surface water ocean topography swot observations provides this demonstration 4 the unconstrained portion of the model solution has skill in predicting forecast errors this is demonstrated by using the unconstrained portion of the model forecast in combination with model errors with respect to the independent 1000 laser drifters over 3 months the unconstrained variability is also shown to be consistent with ensemble variance estimates the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides the setup of model experiments which include the cycling data assimilative 1 km model the 3 km ensemble and the osse setup section 3 discusses the results separated into the constrained solution section 3 1 the boundary controlled by observations section 3 2 and the unconstrained solution section 3 3 section 4 discusses the applicability and factors that influence the results finally section 5 provides overall conclusions and final thoughts 2 model experiment setup 2 1 1 km assimilative model the navy coastal ocean model ncom produced our simulated three dimensional ocean fields throughout the study ncom is based on the hydrostatic and boussinesq approximations and explicitly represents time evolving temperature salinity velocity and sea surface height the model integrates the primitive equations in time using an explicit leapfrog scheme with a split barotropic baroclinic mode barron et al 2006 the model covers the entire gulf of mexico with a horizontal resolution set to 1 km and using 50 sigma z levels in the vertical d addezio et al 2019a b jacobs et al 2020 2016 souopgui et al 2020 the global ocean forecast system gofs based on the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom metzger et al 2014 delivered boundary conditions at 3 hour frequency that were interpolated in time to the ncom time step gofs did not contain tides a global tide solution egbert and erofeeva 2002 was the source of tidal velocities and surface heights in addition to the time interpolated gofs boundary conditions a separate atmospheric model within the coupled ocean atmosphere mesoscale prediction system coamps hodur 1997 provided data for computing atmospheric momentum flux air temperature humidity and solar radiation at hourly frequency for surface forcing to the ocean model daily freshwater inflow of rivers was represented as a velocity transport into the model domain at land boundary points with a salinity of 0 and velocity distributed over depth the transports were from the united states geological survey usgs river monitoring stations using the instruments closest to the model land boundary for rivers without observations historical monthly transports were used the ncom model connects to the navy coupled ocean data assimilation ncoda system that utilizes a 3 dimensional variational 3dvar approach smith et al 2011 each day of the model run recent observations minus the prior model forecast provide innovations and the 3dvar computes an analysis to correct the model fields there are several important aspects of the data assimilation process that have been examined and optimized in previous work the error autocovariances of the prior forecast used as the background have been examined closely details of the error covariance specification are in jacobs et al 2014a the background error autocovariance is cast as a variance amplitude and autocorrelation separable in horizontal vertical and flow dependent functions the horizontal autocorrelation is a second order autoregressive soar function with length scale based on the rossby radius of deformation multiplied by a scaling factor the scaling factor is examined closely in jacobs et al 2020 and we use the optimal value from that study resulting in a length scale of the soar of approximately 36 km averaged over the domain the vertical correlation is also a soar function with a length scale based on the background vertical density gradient so that positions in the water column with high vertical gradient have short length scales in order to maintain sharp vertical features the flow dependent correlation decreases correlations in the direction of the horizontal ssh gradient which prevents data from affecting the analysis across mesoscale fronts prior work has shown the two dominant factors in the autocovariance are the evolution of the variance amplitude and the time period prior to the analysis over which observations are used the time evolving variance formulation has been shown to be a good representation of forecast minus observation variances and including ssh observations over a 5 day window also advances the forecast skill jacobs et al 2014a 2 2 observations and observation errors the regular observations include the satellite ssh jason 2 cryosat 2 saral altika the satellite sst observations separated into day and night observations profile data from ship of opportunity xbt argo floats ocean gliders and surface ship data these are the observations that are regularly publicly available in near real time and processed operationally we refer to these as the regular observations the satellite sst temporal spatialsampling is relatively high and the spacing between observations is typically much less than the horizontal decorrelation scale of the assimilation the nadir ssh observations from jason 2 cryosat 2 saral altika are typically very close in the direction along the satellite ground track approximately 6 5 km but on any given day the ground tracks are typically far apart in the across track direction fig 1a in both these cases there is substantial redundant information that greatly slows the computational solution process of the data assimilation without adding significant value very close observations can also result in a 3dvar analysis with amplitude greater than any of the observation innovations for these reasons observations are combined into super observations super obs by averaging spatially close observations or thinning that selects one data point from a set of spatially close observations for the altimeter ssh the super obbing is conducted by averaging ssh values that are close as measured by the horizontal decorrelation scale of the background error the super obbed ssh is then converted to a synthetic vertical temperature and salinity profile using correlations based on historical in situ observations helber et al 2013 satellite sst data are more uniform and super obbing is also done by spatial averaging of values in situ profiles from certain platforms such as gliders or towed ctd may be very dense in one direction for these data types thinning is used to prevent averaging from smoothing sharp features the average temperature profile may be unrealistic and therefore data is thinned to maintain individual observed profiles data thinning and super obbing are conducted in the data preparation stage observation errors are a sum of instrument and representativeness errors representativeness errors are intended to be the variance of true features that the model is not expected to represent and representativeness errors are much larger than instrument errors the value of the representativeness error in the assimilation system is a function of the background gradients in the horizontal and vertical sst representativeness errors are higher in areas of sharp fronts as the fronts in the true ocean can move more rapidly than in the model the average sst total error is about 0 6 c with minimum errors of 0 1 c and maximum errors reaching 1 8 c profile representativeness errors are higher at depths of high vertical gradients as internal waves can create large variations that are not represented in the model using one day of observations in the 1 km system fig 3 shows the effects of including the vertical gradient dependence in the total errors ascribed to argo and the synthetic profiles derived from ssh observations the assimilation system computes error estimates for each profile individually the minimum mean and maximum values across all profiles are shown in fig 3 in fig 2 the representativeness error is the variance at scales of physics not represented by the model and scales below the nyquist we will see in the discussion that when the model has unconstrained features these features should contribute additional errors to observations this consideration was not taken into account in the experiments and the discussion considers how aspects of the assimilation process may change the results this study uses the model and assimilation system throughout results in fig 1a are from the model and assimilation system using all regular observations to correct the model state on a daily basis and the system was initialized in 2012 the drifter trajectories do not affect the results and therefore represent independent observations 2 3 power spectral density the power spectral density psd in fig 2 represents a space and time average an approximately 6 degree square subdomain in deep water was chosen for two dimensional psd calculations d addezio et al 2019b four variables were considered mixed layer depth mld diagnosed from the model temperature 100 m depth temperature surface kinetic energy ke and sea surface height ssh model data with 3 hour frequency were saved for psd computation at each 3 hour interval a two dimensional fast fourier transform computed the two dimensional psd a time average of the two dimensional psd provided a single mean two dimensional psd estimate to obtain a one dimensional spectrum the time mean two dimensional psd was averaged in direction along concentric circles of constant wavenumber k d addezio et al 2019b richman et al 2012 the two dimensional psd is defined as 1 g k x k y g x y e i k x x e i k y y d x d y where k x k y is the wavenumber vector the first term on the right side is the fourier transform of the function g x y and is the complex conjugate of the fourier transform the directional average is then 2 g r k 1 2 π k π π g k x k y k d θ where k k x 2 k y 2 θ is direction and within the integral there is an implicit conversion from g k x k y to g k θ the plots in fig 2 are g r k to obtain variance g r k must be multiplied by 2 π k and then integrated over k the total variance v is 3 v 0 2 π k g r k d k 0 2 π k π π 1 2 π k g k x k y k d θ d k 0 π π g k x k y k d θ d k g k x k y d k x d k y because fig 2 is plotted in log space multiplying by k is equivalent to adding 1 to the spectral slopes for surface kinetic energy we applied the processing described above separately to surface zonal and meridional velocity and then averaged the two resulting spectra richman et al 2012 2 4 3 km ensemble model ensemble ocean predictions are composed of a set of numerical forecast models the system used here was set up at 3 km resolution using the ncom model in this study a 32 member ensemble used an ensemble transform et methodology one member was the control run which conducted a daily data assimilation cycle after the data assimilation the perturbations of the remaining members from the control run were scaled so that the ensemble variance matched the analysis variance estimated during the data assimilation process mclay et al 2008 all the members were then integrated forward in time until the next assimilation cycle thus the analysis variance controls the spread of the ensemble at the analysis time and the ensemble growth during the forecast is dependent on the nonlinear model development the ensemble prediction system was initialized in 2012 and conducted daily cycles at any location and for any variable the ensemble set provides a sample intended to represent the probability density function of the state evensen 1994 this ensemble system has previously shown skill in forecasting errors in the gulf of mexico domain wei et al 2014 the variance across the ensemble increases during the forecast period the spread reliability is an evaluation of the variance across the ensemble to the error variance with observations the spread reliability shows the ensemble is able to predict areas of larger and smaller errors consistent with observations the ensemble under predicts error in that the variance across the ensemble is typically lower than the observed error variance this is also reflected in the talagrand histograms wei et al 2013 part of the error of any ensemble member is due to unconstrained features at any time the mean over ensemble members reduces the influence of the unconstrained features if the features are uncorrelated across members this phenomenon will be explored more thoroughly in section 3 1 we analyze results of the ensemble ocean system covering january through june 2016 using the power spectral density analysis described in section 2 3 the order of ensemble averaging time averaging and computing psd is important as the computation of psd is a non linear operation define an ensemble member variable v i j as the i th ensemble member at the j th time define the mean psd of a variable as 4 1 n i n j i 1 n i j 1 n j p s d v i j where p s d is the squared amplitude of the fourier transform averaged over direction n i is the number of ensemble members and n j is the number of time steps the mean psd represents the energy distribution of the variable that would occur on average within any snapshot of any ensemble member define the ensemble mean psd as 5 1 n j j 1 n j p s d 1 n i i 1 n i v i j this averages the ensemble members which reduces the effects due to unconstrained features before computing the psd and averaging realizations over time the ratio of ensemble mean psd to mean psd should be less than 1 and indicates the fraction of energy remaining after averaging across the ensemble fig 4 at the largest scales the ratio is near 1 which indicates the energy of features is similar across all the ensemble members at the larger scales at smaller scales features across the ensembles are uncorrelated and averaging reduces the energy in the ensemble mean psd the characteristic of importance is the wavenumber range over which the ratio decreases substantially from a value of 1 in section 3 1 we consider this wavenumber range to show consistency with estimated constrained scales 2 5 1 km osse setup in the osse experiment the term nature run is the system with all realistic boundary conditions and surface forcing but without any data assimilation the osse setup uses a 1 km nature run d addezio et al 2019a b the nature run allows the numerical model physics to represent instability processes that cascade energy across the wavenumber spectrum fig 2 the nature run also provides the data sampled by simulated observing systems we sampled the nature run at all regular satellite and in situ observation locations and by the swot simulator version 2 0 0 gaultier et al 2016 a second 1 km osse model assimilates the simulated observations the gofs state on november 1 2015 provides the initial condition to the nature run this initial condition was 2 months prior to the osse experiment to allow spin up after spin up to january 1 2016 a 1 year integration of the nature run saved 3 hourly values of 3 dimensional temperature salinity and velocity and 2 dimensional sea surface height the osse initial condition on december 1 2015 was set to the nature state on december 1 2016 this provided a seasonally realistic initial condition with ocean mesoscale features that were out of place relative to the nature run the osse is spun up for one month assimilating daily simulated nature run observations and is evaluated relative to the nature run starting january 1 2016 d addezio et al 2019b this osse is a fraternal twin experiment that does not represent errors in the physics of the numerical model we sampled the nature run at real observation locations and times for the regular observing network in situ satellite sea surface temperature and satellite altimetry and the swot simulator sampled the nature run using a 2 km grid in the along and across track directions the swot simulator includes estimates of the errors from a range of sources in the experiments here we include only an estimate of the sensor noise from the karin instrument gaultier et al 2016 the expected sampling for swot is 1 km in the along and across track directions in section 2 2 we discussed the super obbing and thinning that takes place with respect to the horizontal decorrelation scale even at 2 km the swot observations are significantly reduced a 1 km sampling would result in the same data quantity used in the assimilation examples of the swot super obbing are provided in d addezio et al 2019b their fig 9 the simulated observations were assimilated by the osse using the ncoda 3dvar system smith et al 2011 the osse used a two step multi scale formulation of ncoda li et al 2015 souopgui et al 2020 the first step of the analysis used same settings as discussed in the 1 km model of section 2 1 which are mesoscale oriented the second step used the results of the first step as the background for computing innovations observation minus background and a smaller decorrelation length scale souopgui et al 2020 this methodology improves analysis skill when the observing network is able to resolve a wide range of spatial scales li et al 2015 2019 muscarella et al 2014 the osse multi scale 3dvar assimilated observations every 24 h for a six month period for the second analysis step the horizontal scale of the soar function was about 10 km the 10 km scale represents about 20 km features which is near the lower limit of features swot expects to resolve each daily analysis used data over a prior period the first step used prior data periods of 12 day 5 day and 1 day for in situ profiles satellite altimetry and satellite sea surface temperature respectively the second analysis used data over a 1 day period for all observation types as the smaller spatial scales have shorter time scales souopgui et al 2020 temperature at 100 m depth was used for evaluation fig 5 the osse assimilation experiment minus the nature run provided full time varying 3d error fields a spectral analysis performed on the errors provided the ability to identify constrained and unconstrained scales 3 results we use the wavenumber psd to illustrate the relations between model resolution observation resolution and the gap between the two fig 2 the data are from a 1 km resolution ocean model section 2 1 and the psd lines are one dimensional spectra representing time and direction averages section 2 3 features smaller than 2 km are beyond the nyquist wavelength of the model 1 km grid second order accurate numerical schemes require about 10 grid points within one wavelength to reasonably represent a first derivative roache 1998 for the 1 km model considered there is a limit at 10 km wavelength separating physics the model represents from those it does not the level of desired numerical accuracy may change from one situation to another so this limit may not be a clear and distinct line model resolution controls the limits at the smallest scales in the spectrum as model resolution increases both the nyquist and representation limits move to smaller wavelengths to the right now we consider what information is contained in the larger constrained scales what controls the boundary between the constrained and unconstrained and what information lies within the unconstrained scales 3 1 constrained scales and confidence by the definition introduced in section 1 error variance in the constrained wavenumber band fig 2 is lower than the variance of the features themselves d addezio et al 2019b for the osse experiments we can compute the psd of forecast errors to determine the boundary between constrained and unconstrained because we do not have regularly gridded observations of the true ocean we cannot directly compute psd of errors an approach to estimating the boundary separating constrained and unconstrained scales is to filter unconstrained features from the model to reduce error variance relative to observations jacobs et al 2020 the filtering methodology is described in appendix a which uses a gaussian convolution kernel initially removing small scale features reduces errors to observations and gradually increasing the size of the filter reduces errors until a minimum error is reached continuing to increase the filter size and removing larger scales increases errors errors in surface trajectories are a minimum at a filter length scale of 58 km defined by a gaussian e folding scale in a convolution kernel or a 220 km wavelength defined by the 1 4 power point of the filter the errors as a function of filtering scale in jacobs et al 2020 are a broad minimum because error psd divided by true ocean psd ε k γ k gradually transitions from less than 1 to greater than 1 this is also apparent in the osse results in section 3 2 in addition the gaussian kernel does not provide a sharp cutoff in wavenumber space this boundary can change depending on the particular situation and therefore this boundary is not a clear and distinct line in fig 2 the unconstrained band lies between the boundary of skillful prediction of constrained features larger than 220 km wavelength and the model representation limit at 10 km wavelengths in tests varying the horizontal decorrelation length scale within the data assimilation the error minimum occurred at the same filtering scale for the range of decorrelation scales tested except for the longest decorrelation scale that was unrealistically large jacobs et al 2020 ocean forecasting experiments indicate that forecast skill degrades with increasing model resolution sandery and sakov 2017 fig 2 helps interpret this result assume the model resolution were such that the scale of represented features were equivalent to scales resolved by observations and allowed by the data assimilation in this case there would be no unconstrained wavenumber band as model resolution increases the unconstrained band between constrained scales and the model representation limit increases all of the variance in the unconstrained band adds to the error level because by definition there is no skill in the unconstrained band the error variance added from the unconstrained band is more than up to twice the variance of the features in the unconstrained band because the model and true feature positions are uncorrelated appendix b as model resolution continues to increase the unconstrained band becomes wider the variance added from the unconstrained band continues to increase errors as model resolution increases errors at small scales significantly affect ocean surface trajectory forecasts griffa et al 2004 and we show the total error variance in the constrained band is less than the total error variance in the unconstrained band differencing a model field from observations three sources contribute to error variance appendix b 1 errors in the constrained band ec 2 the model unconstrained scale variance mu and 3 the true ocean variance at the unconstrained scale tu for the moment we are neglecting the variance of the true ocean at scales not represented by the model after filtering mu features from numerical model fields rms error decreases to 0 80 times the original value jacobs et al 2020 assuming a zero mean the rms squared is the variance and therefore filtering the mu reduces variance to 0 64 of the original value assuming the three error contributions are statistically independent the mu variance is 0 36 of the total error variance the remaining 0 64 of the total variance is the sum of ec and tu a conservative assumption is that tu variance is equal to mu variance then the contribution of the ec band is 0 28 of the total error variance which is less than tu and mu errors the assumption is conservative as we expect tu variance is greater than mu variance since model resolution limits features physically represented fig 2 thus the contribution of the ec errors to the total error would be less than the estimated value of 0 28 and the conclusion remains valid initially we neglected errors due to variance at scales smaller than represented by the model if we consider the contribution of errors due to variability in the true ocean at scales not represented in the model the ec errors become smaller and the conclusion remains valid the contribution to errors due to variability in the unconstrained band is larger than the contribution to errors in the constrained band the majority of uncertainty is in the unconstrained portion of the solution the constrained portion of the solution can be described as the portion in which we have confidence this result is a reflection of the definition that constrained scales have error variance smaller than the variance of the solution section 1 this conclusion is for the observations of velocity obtained from the laser drifters the psd slope can change the boundary position for different variables because the psd curves represent an average over direction integration to obtain variance in a wavenumber band requires multiplication by wavenumber section 2 3 when considering the contribution to variance in different wavenumber bands a value of 1 should be added to the slopes of the lines in fig 2 the ratio of unconstrained to constrained variance u c variance is the ratio of the psd integrated over the unconstrained band to the psd integrated over the constrained band the ssh slope magnitude is largest and the mixed layer depth mld slope magnitude is smallest therefore ssh u c variance is smaller than mld u c variance this has implications for evaluating the impact of added observations osses suggest that when increasing ssh observations ssh skill advancements are small while skill advancements in mld are larger d addezio et al 2019b jacobs et al 2014a when judging observation system impact it is important to consider a relevant variable that is sensitive to the observations and contains requisite smaller scale structure finally we evaluate consistency of the estimated constrained and unconstrained bands with an ensemble representation results from the 32 member ocean model ensemble indicate smaller scales being unconstrained the mean psd contains more variance than the ensemble mean psd and the ratio of the two shows larger energy reductions at smaller scales fig 4 averaging over the ensemble realizations reduces the signal of unconstrained features not correlated between ensemble members larger scale features are similar amongst the ensemble members and averaging across the ensembles does not greatly reduce the constrained energy smaller scales contain a more pronounced reduction of energy when averaging over the ensemble set with the change in relative energy occurring in the range of 100 to 200 km wavelengths this is consistent with the estimated constrained scale of 220 km obtained by filtering the 1 km model result to minimize errors to the laser data jacobs et al 2020 thus our conclusions are consistent with ensemble approaches and we consider this further in the discussion section 4 3 2 the boundary separating constrained and unconstrained scales ocean features resolved by observations and corrected by the assimilation control the boundary between constrained and unconstrained scales prior theory and experiments have shown computing model corrections at scales smaller than resolved by observations leads to degradation of results li et al 2015 thus limited independent observations to resolve features represent a wall to predictive skill demonstrations of high resolution in situ data özgökmen et al 2018 and future high resolution satellite ocean observing systems such as swot fu and ubelmann 2014 can reduce errors one such example is the application of dense surface drifter deployments to predicting trajectories inferred velocities from 300 drifters in the grand lagrangian deployment glad olascoaga et al 2013 correct model forecasts and forecast drift trajectories improve significantly as the data constrain smaller scale features through a 4dvar assimilation carrier et al 2014 an explanation of the effect is that the additional data moves the boundary to smaller scales to the right in fig 2 the constrained band increases in size the unconstrained band reduces in size and the total variance contributing to errors in the unconstrained band decreases we use an osse to demonstrate and quantify this more clearly an osse of the swot observing system section 2 5 demonstrates this in terms of the psd of errors satellite orbits are predictable far in advance therefore we know the data distribution that will occur however the sampled points in an area do not always form a similar regular pattern every day from the swot osse results the mean of the absolute value of the error mae of 100 m depth temperature fig 5a contains a periodicity which correlates negatively to the number of observations within each daily assimilation we use the 100 m temperature for evaluation rather than the ssh because the ssh psd slope is steeper which leads to 100 m temperature being a more sensitive metric in addition the ssh is the main observed variable and evaluation of a less observed variable provides a more independent test the psd of the mae time series contains a local peak at 10 7 days fig 5b this is roughly half the 21 day exact repeat period of the swot orbit and it is due to the manner in which the satellite samples the area during the orbit cycle while swot data are dense along satellite observation swaths distribution of swaths in an area is irregular in time during the 21 day swot repeat period a set of swaths first covers the area leading to increased data then there is a time gap of no swot swaths leading to data decrease and later a second set of swaths provides another dense sampling set followed by another data gap this leads to the 10 7 day periodicity in 100 m temperature errors because we have full time varying fields from the nature and osse models we can compute full error fields we compute constrained scales in 100 m depth temperature using data at times of the local minima in the mae and separately at the times of local maxima using wavenumber spectral analysis to compute the normalized error psd for the osse experiment we used d addezio et al 2019b 6 ε o s s e γ n a t u r e γ o s s e where ε o s s e is the osse error psd psd of the nature run minus osse γ n a t u r e is the nature run psd γ o s s e is the osse psd and brackets denote the mean of the two psd values range from 0 to 2 fig 5 a value of 0 indicates the osse has no error at the particular wavelength a value of 2 indicates the osse and the nature run are uncorrelated and the error variance is the sum of the osse variance and the nature run variance we define the boundary between constrained and unconstrained scales as the wavelength where the normalized error psd has a value of 1 as in section 1 the constrained scales have errors smaller than the variability of the features the boundaries between constrained and unconstrained scales are 68 km during times of error minima and data maxima versus 92 km during times of error maxima and data minima fig 5c thus we see the boundary separating constrained and unconstrained scales oscillating throughout the swot observing cycle with the full time varying temperature field we can examine the details of the boundary both in spatial scale and temporal scale the wavenumber frequency spectra of errors the nature run and the osse experiment were computed from the 00z value of 100 m temperature on each day of the 6 months this produces a three dimensional matrix with dimensions f k x k y the k x k y psd were directionally averaged as described in section 2 3 generating a final f k psd matrix normalizing the error psd according to eq 6 and using the definition of the boundary between constrained and unconstrained as the normalized psd having a value of 1 we can see how the time scale of the boundary changes as a function of spatial scale fig 5d in this analysis we have not separated data from times of error minima and maxima at the largest scales there is skill at time periods longer than approximately 15 days the boundary time scale increases as spatial scales become shorter for example at 50 km scales only time periods longer than 40 days have skill the shortest scales at which there is skill are about 30 km at which the time scales move to 180 days the ability of the observation data to resolve smaller features moves the boundary while observations move the boundary to smaller scales and advance prediction skill we must properly utilize the constrained and unconstrained information from forecasts regardless of the boundary position 3 3 unconstrained scales and uncertainty though there is not skill in predicting the exact location of features in the unconstrained band we can still recover valuable information from this band in the constrained scales there is skill in predicting the position of features which is deterministic forecast skill assuming the model physics are realistic the unconstrained solution contains statistical prediction skill while the position of any unconstrained feature is not predictable the model can predict areas in which the unconstrained features develop filtering can separate scales and the unconstrained features are the residual of the full model solution minus the constrained scales appendix a at any time define the local unconstrained variability at a point x o y o as the spatially weighted rms of the local unconstrained features v ˆ u x o y o appendix a in areas containing unconstrained features with large amplitude v ˆ u is large and areas containing small amplitude unconstrained features v ˆ u is small the vectors in fig 1a are the full model solution and vectors in fig 1b are the constrained currents that remain after filtering the results shown in fig 1a the background color in fig 1b is the local unconstrained variability of speed square root of eastward and northward v ˆ u 2 larger scale constrained ocean features such as mesoscale eddies have strong currents around the periphery which form sharp fronts the small scale nature of the fronts results in errors due to mispositioning with high values of v ˆ u bathymetric features such as the shelf break along louisiana to the florida panhandle are areas of active generation of small features jacobs et al 2016 mesoscale eddies modulate stratification that becomes conducive or inhibitive to the formation of submesoscale eddies capet et al 2008 d asaro et al 2011 jacobs et al 2014b mcwilliams 2016 qiu et al 2014 shcherbina et al 2013 thomas et al 2013 zhong and bracco 2013 the anticyclonic gulf of mexico loop current eddy lce contains a much deeper thermocline than the surrounding area this effect decreases stratification in the upper water column and leads to a much deeper mixed layer that is conducive to the formation of submesoscale eddies the lce is typically an area of high submesoscale eddy activity forecast errors or uncertainty are not expected to be distributed uniformly but should be related to the underlying processes we show skill in v ˆ u 2 being a predictor for error variance by using trajectories observed by more than 1000 surface drifters from laser in the gulf of mexico özgökmen et al 2018 the value of v ˆ u 2 is an estimate of the expected errors due to unconstrained ocean features if the estimator v ˆ u 2 has skill in predicting areas of small scale activity we expect a relation with observed error variance this relation changes if we are computing errors to the full model solution or errors to only the constrained portion of the model solution appendix b the expected relation between v ˆ u 2 and the constrained model solution error variance is a constant value due to errors in the constrained field plus the value of v ˆ u 2 due to the true ocean variance at unconstrained scales the expected relation between v ˆ u 2 and the full model solution error variance is the same constant due to errors in the constrained field plus twice the value of v ˆ u 2 due to the unconstrained variance in the model solution and the true ocean variance at unconstrained scales to demonstrate v ˆ u 2 has predictive skill for every drifter velocity at a location and time we first compute the squared observed velocity error the squared error adds to the value in a bin determined by the coincident value of v ˆ u 2 within each bin of v ˆ u 2 we compute the mean of all squared velocity errors velocity squared errors are accumulated separately from both the full model field and the constrained model field the results fig 6 are consistent with expected relations the error variance of both the full model solution and the constrained solution have about the same constant value the constrained solution error variance increases with a slope of about 1 and the total solution error variance increases with of slope of about 2 this supports two conclusions first using only the constrained scales in deterministic forecasts produces lower errors in model variables in an rms sense second the unconstrained local variance v ˆ u 2 provides statistical prediction of error variance we can accomplish this only if forecasts have sufficient resolution to represent the small scale features the ensemble results also aid in verifying the predictive skill in v ˆ u 2 we compute the small scale variance of surface velocity by summing the eastward and the northward small scale variance of velocity components from the 1 km model from the ensemble at each time we sum the eastward and the northward variance across the ensemble we restrict the comparisons of the information to water depths that are greater than 1000 m where mesoscale and submesoscale instabilities are the dominant process the probability density function of the small scale surface velocity variance and the variance of surface velocity across the ensemble indicate a high correlation fig 7 this further advances the utility of the scale separation method as the result correlates well with the ensemble methodology we also note that the forecast time period considered in the evaluations here is only the 0 to 24 h forecast after the data assimilation cycle each day it would be expected that as longer forecast times are considered the boundary between constrained and unconstrained energy will move to larger scales or to the left in fig 2 the rate at which the boundary moves to the left would be expected to be a function of the instability growth time across the wavenumber spectrum the swot osse results fig 5 give some indication of the speed at which errors increase over time as the mae increases during periods of no swot coverage from the minimum value the rate at which the constrained scales change during the forecast time is an important aspect left for future examination 4 discussion results in fig 6 are consistent with the concept that the forecast solution contains skill in the constrained scales the unconstrained scales add error the small scale variability is predictor of the error variance and thus the high resolution forecasts have skill in predicting areas in which the small scale variability will occur this is similar to the meteorological problem of showing skill in high resolution model rainfall gilleland et al 2010 a range of metrics have been developed in meteorology such as fractional skill score which is skill in predicting the fraction of an area over which rainfall exceeds a threshold mittermaier and roberts 2010 such metrics are enabled by large area gridded data of rainfall rates from radar systems even with the extensive drifter deployment during the laser experiment the ocean sampling was relatively sparse and non uniform constructing regular gridded fields for evaluation was not possible so our metrics are simple rms errors at point locations improved metrics could advance the demonstration of value in high resolution ocean models it is also important to consider the variables used in the metrics and the spectral slopes in fig 2 are important considerations the steep slope of ssh indicates this is not a sensitive variable for demonstrating advances in predictive skill the shallow slope of the eke and mld shows the influence of smaller scale features previous observation system experiments oses jacobs et al 2014b indicate the improvement when adding an additional altimeter data stream is much smaller in ssh than in frontogenesis forcing and surface divergence skill frontogenesis forcing is based on the flow field strain and buoyancy gradients and surface divergence is a gradient of the velocity field the slope of the frontogenesis forcing and divergence psd would be shallower by a value of 1 than eke and the slope of eke is about 1 shallower than the slope of ssh that would be expected if currents were in geostrophic balance fig 2 because frontal areas typically contain stronger currents they are important for many applications including fisheries commercial endeavors and emergency response the surface divergence driven by frontogenesis may be sufficiently observable in the future by airborne instruments rodríguez et al 2018 as we look to developing metrics more closely related to human activity these will tend toward variables that have a much flatter slope and thus much more variability at small scales part of the forecast process is the assimilation and associated settings including length scales of background errors flow dependent correlations and observation errors prior results indicate the boundary separating constrained and unconstrained scales is more sensitive to some parts of the data assimilation than others in experiments varying the horizontal decorrelation scale jacobs et al 2020 the boundary did not change except for the largest unrealistic decorrelation scale in osse experiments souopgui et al 2020 adding swot data increased skill in both single scale and multi scale assimilation the multi scale assimilation consistently provided increased forecast skill relative to the single scale assimilation and the boundary scale decreased slightly thus changes in the data assimilation process can have impact on the boundary between constrained and unconstrained scales it should be noted that the osse experiments were able to compute the boundary scale from the psd of full time evolving 3d fields while the estimates of the boundary scale through comparison to non uniformly distributed drifters used a filtering approach the osse experiments are a much more sensitive tool than what can be measured by direct observations together these results imply that advancing the data assimilation process and settings increases forecast skill and can have impacts on the boundary of constrained scales from the osse results in this paper we find additional observations that resolve smaller scale ocean features reduce the constrained scales the features leading to the unconstrained energy are due primarily to flow instabilities these include small mesoscale eddies on the scale of 100 km submesoscale eddies with high rossby number and frontogenesis processes that are driven by straining of the mesoscale and submesoscale flow and buoyancy fields hoskins 1982 the motivation for conducting the experiments at 1 km resolution was to resolve the processes associated with submesoscale eddies capet et al 2008 prediction of instability processes requires regular corrections to model initial conditions and high resolution models with insufficient observations leads to unconstrained scales other dynamical regimes may not contain processes leading to the separate unconstrained features in particular coastal environments are dominated by wind driven events and fresh water fluxes from land rather than instabilities thus caution should be exercised prior to applying these concepts to other dynamical regimes in light of the unconstrained variability we must reconsider observation errors in high resolution models errors in instrumentation are often the smallest source of discrepancy between observations and model forecasts representativeness errors are regarded as signal due to small scale features in the true world that the numerical model does not represent in fig 2 this is the variance in the band at scales smaller than represented by the model or smaller than 10 km in the case of the 1 km resolution model used here considering fig 2 again there is large variance in the unconstrained band that creates deviations of the model from observations and this is an additional error source the unconstrained errors in fig 2 are larger than the representativeness errors because the model resolution represents features down to 10 km and observations constrain only much larger features in addition because the model unconstrained features are uncorrelated with the true ocean features the total unconstrained error variance is twice the variance of the true ocean in the unconstrained band if as in appendix b we separate the model and true world into variability in the constrained scales and unconstrained scales and if we assume the model and true fields are uncorrelated in the unconstrained band we find additional errors that are twice the variance in the unconstrained scales represented by the model when comparing to the laser drifters to the representativeness errors we must add twice the unconstrained variance this is analogous to the double penalty errors pointed out by gilleland et al 2009 in the assimilation experiments here the unconstrained variance error was not considered including the error would be expected to reduce the influence of observations and appropriate errors could increase forecast skill and move the boundary to smaller scales while the quantitative value of the boundary position may change the concepts of separating constrained and unconstrained scales would not 5 conclusions we provide a framework in wavenumber space to understand concepts involved in ocean forecast systems that have model resolution representing features smaller than observations resolve and the assimilation system corrects constrained scales are defined as having error variance smaller than the true world variance model smaller scales are unconstrained and have errors larger than the true world variance we have confidence in the forecasts at the constrained scales and the unconstrained scales contain uncertainty since there is no predictive skill error variance in the unconstrained band is up to twice the variance of the true world features results from ensemble forecasts are consistent with the scales estimated to be constrained the ratio of ensemble mean psd to the mean of the ensemble psd shows the large reduction of energy in the unconstrained scales indicating the uncorrelated features between ensemble members at the smaller scales the framework explains results in which increased resolution leads to degraded skill sandery and sakov 2017 since increased resolution increases the variance in the unconstrained scales the boundary between constrained and unconstrained bands is controlled by the capability of observations to resolve features and the assimilation to correct the model initial condition moving the boundary to smaller scales increases the constrained band and reduces forecast error the assimilation system must use data appropriately to ensure smaller features are corrected as shown by souopgui et al 2020 variables and metrics that are most sensitive to observation and assimilation impacts are those with larger energy at smaller scales and thus have shallow psd slopes ocean variables such as mld and frontal forcing are better indicators of advanced forecasts than ssh adding observations through the swot osse shows regular periodic intervals when swot swaths cover the domain with the boundary moving to smaller scales and intervals when swot swaths are absent from the domain with the boundary moving to larger scales the osse also shows the separation of time and space scales of constrained features the largest constrained features cover time scales of 15 days and longer while the smaller constrained features occur only at time scales of 100 days and longer in the 1 km setup the unconstrained local variance v ˆ u 2 has skill in predicting the forecast errors since the majority of the errors are due to features at scales below the constrained in order for v ˆ u 2 to be a predictor model resolution must be sufficient to represent unconstrained processes of importance twice the unconstrained variance must be included in observation errors in addition to representativeness errors based on the psd of the 1 km model fig 2 the unconstrained errors are larger than representativeness errors which are typically larger than instrument errors the equivalent results of the unconstrained variance versus ensemble variance in fig 7 require several critical factors to be met the locations of unconstrained variability must have predictability and the areas of unconstrained variability are controlled by the larger scale constrained flow field we must know the boundary position between the constrained and unconstrained portions of the fields and the laser observations play a key role in estimating the boundary scale the forecast model must have sufficient resolution to represent the majority of variance at unconstrained scales finally the majority of forecast error must be in the unconstrained band and the psd slope is an important factor in determining this fig 2 knowing the separation between constrained and unconstrained energy allows high resolution forecasts to be used most effectively the constrained portion of the solution has lower errors information in the unconstrained local variance could be exploited in statistical forecasts piterbarg 2001 we must continue to extend numerical representation of smaller scale dynamics as these affect dispersion at scales well below model resolutions poje et al 2014 theory to exploit unconstrained statistical information in dispersion prediction has been utilized in the ocean haza et al 2007 ultimately by knowing and exploiting both constrained and unconstrained information we can justify continued increase in ocean model

23923,we describe a new 4 d variational assimilation system called cyclocim to estimate the climatological seasonal cycle of the residual mean ocean circulation cyclocim assimilates monthly mean potential temperature and salinity data from the world ocean atlas and cfc 11 cfc 12 and natural radiocarbon measurements for the deep ocean from the global data analysis project version 2 cyclocim s control parameters include i a seasonally varying 3 d field of unresolved eddy stress divergences that appear in the horizontal momentum equations ii seasonally varying 2 d correction fields for the surface heat and freshwater fluxes and iii a constant scaling factor for the air sea flux of cfcs the influence of initial conditions on a fully spun up ocean model vanishes thus unlike other 4 d variational assimilation systems cyclocim does not include initial conditions as control parameters a bayesian procedure is used to formulate the inverse problem which is solved by finding the maximum of the posterior probability distribution the optimization process used to find the maximum includes a forward simulation to calculate the flow velocities and tracer distributions followed by a backward adjoint simulation to compute the gradient of the posterior a quasi newton search algorithm is used to find the set of parameters to maximize the posterior probability we find that by resolving the seasonal cycle the model is able to better fit the observations in the upper ocean compared to a previous steady state version of the model the main output from cyclocim is a set of 12 data constrained monthly tracer transport matrices that will provide a useful circulation model for global marine biogeochemical cycle studies keywords cfc radiocarbon residual mean circulation data assimilation tracer transport matrix 1 introduction an important goal of data assimilation in oceanography is to provide an estimate of the state of the ocean that is consistent with available observations and known physical laws variational assimilation methods aim to achieve this goal by iteratively minimizing an objective function that measures the difference between predictions obtained from a dynamical circulation model and available observations ghil and malanotte rizzoli 1991 while the applications for global data assimilation products are numerous the detection of climate trends is major driving motivation typically the inputs to the objective function are the model s initial conditions and surface boundary conditions for the fluxes of heat freshwater and momentum but sometimes internal eddy diffusivity parameters are also used e g balmaseda et al 2015 köhl 2015 forget et al 2015 osafune et al 2015 fukumori et al 2018 in addition to producing a space time interpolation of the sparse and irregularly sampled observations a 4 d variational assimilation system also produces an estimate of the global circulation the resulting estimate of the circulation can be extremely useful for computing tracer flux divergences in biogeochemical applications when the focus is on recent trends and variability that fall within the assimilation period the estimated circulation can be used unambiguously e g brix et al 2015 doi et al 2015 carroll et al 2020 for applications involving the functioning of biogeochemical cycles on longer timescales one can time average the estimate and assume that the resulting average is representative of the long term mean circulation for example graven et al 2012 average the state estimate for the period 1992 2004 from the ecco godae assimilation system stammer et al 2004 into monthly mean tracer transport matrices which are then used to simulate the pre industrial carbon cycle and its transient evolution for 1760 2007 for this they assume a climate system that is stationary to first order and repeatedly cycle through the same 12 tracer transport matrices however because each iteration of the assimilation procedure simulates the circulation for at most a few decades while repeatedly adjusting the initial conditions the resulting circulation is never fully spun up consequently it is not clear that the circulation especially in the deep ocean produces stable water masses when the circulation is extrapolated to time scales longer than those used for the assimilation indeed graven et al 2012 demonstrate the existence of clear biases in the shallow to deep exchange of water masses in the data assimilation circulation from the ecco godae model similarly liu et al 2012 show that even after optimizing the initial conditions the surface forcing and eddy diffusivities the german ecco synthesis gecco has temperature errors that are several times bigger than their prior estimates for biogeochemistry research that requires tracer simulations that are much longer than the observational record an alternative data assimilation procedure has been developed e g schlitzer 2007 devries and primeau 2011 it aims to directly constrain a steady state model of the ocean s long term climatological mean using a 3 d no time dependence variational assimilation procedure the application of inverse methods to global marine biogeochemical cycles has progressed rapidly in recent years because of the development of such a data constrained steady model expressed in the form of a tracer transport matrix e g devries et al 2012 devries et al 2013 holzer and primeau 2013 devries and deutsch 2014 devries 2014 holzer et al 2014 teng et al 2014 frants et al 2015 holzer et al 2016 weber et al 2016 devries et al 2017 pasquier and holzer 2016 roshan et al 2017 pasquier and holzer 2017 roshan and devries 2017 holzer et al 2017 john et al 2018 wang et al 2019 martin et al 2019a b the tracer transport matrix used in the aforementioned studies is produced by a data assimilation system known as the ocean circulation inverse model ocim devries and primeau 2011 primeau et al 2013 devries 2014 devries and holzer 2019 ocim uses a variational method to assimilate stationary and transient tracers into a steady state model for the large scale momentum balance of the ocean because of the assimilation process the circulation biases found in most prognostic ocean general circulation models ogcms are greatly reduced as a result biogeochemical inferences made on the basis of tracer flux divergences computed using ocim can be interpreted more reliably than those obtained from free running ogcms the steady state assumption used in the ocim system makes it possible to obtain a fully spun up ocean state by direct matrix inversion rather than by a slow time stepping spin up as is used in traditional ogcms this capability makes it feasible to compute the o 1 0 3 iterations of the forward and adjoint model runs that are required by the iterative numerical optimization algorithm to bring the model state into agreement with the tracer data constraints an important drawback of the steady state formulation is that it ignores the pronounced seasonality of ventilation processes in mid to high latitudes e g marshall and schott 1999 williams et al 1995 this neglect can lead to potentially important biases whose influence on biogeochemical inferences are difficult to quantify for example it is well known that late winter mixed layer water properties are preferentially selected for export to the permanent pycnocline e g stommel 1979 williams et al 1995 by neglecting the seasonal cycle the ocim tracer transport operator must necessarily be biased in the upper ocean if it is to reproduce the correct water mass properties in the permanent thermocline and abyssal waters see for example the discussion in yu and malanotte rizzoli 1996 1998 here we present an extended ocim assimilation system which we call cyclocim that produces a cyclo stationary state estimate for the climatological seasonally varying ocean circulation the direct matrix inversions via lu factorization that were used to obtain fully spun up steady states in ocim are replaced by calls to a cyclo stationary newton krylov solver e g li and primeau 2008 bardin et al 2014 compared with the majority of existing ocean reanalysis efforts e g mazloff et al 2010 balmaseda et al 2015 köhl 2015 forget et al 2015 osafune et al 2015 fukumori et al 2018 what sets our system apart is that it aims to estimate the ocean s mean annual cycle rather than its inter annual variability cyclocim is therefore a generalization to a periodic annual cycle of previous steady state inversions e g schlitzer 1993 wunsch 1996 ganachaud and wunsch 2000 schlitzer 2007 devries and primeau 2011 the goal of the cyclocim assimilation system is therefore most similar to the one in the study of wenzel et al 2001 who developed a 4 d variational assimilation method to estimate a cyclo stationary annual cycle of the ocean circulation there are however some important methodological differences most importantly wenzel et al 2001 follow yu and malanotte rizzoli 1998 by adding a penalty term for departures from a cyclo stationary state to the usual cost function that measures the misfit between the model and the observations they then use the initial conditions i e the january model state along with the monthly mean surface forcing as the control variables in the minimization problem the data assimilation procedure used in wenzel et al 2001 can therefore be viewed as trading off model data misfits for a reduced temporal drift indeed in a fully spun up model with zero drift the initial conditions exert no controllability on the objective function in contrast cyclocim searches for the optimal state in the space of perfectly cyclo stationary model solutions that have zero temporal drift this is achieved by adding time periodic eddy stress divergence terms to the horizontal momentum equations and using them as control variables in the optimization of the residual mean circulation in this respect cyclocim follows the pioneering study of ferreira et al 2005 who added eddy stresses to initial conditions and surface forcing as the control variables used to minimize solution drift and departures from climatological observations of temperature in cyclocim we completely eliminate the initial conditions from the list of adjustable parameters by directly solving for the cyclo stationary annual cycle this cyclo stationary solution represents the projection of the ocean s long term climatological attractor onto a periodic annual cycle the primary focus of this article is to document the numerical formulation of the model and the solution method rather than presenting a scientifically usable state estimate in section 2 we present the governing equations for the residual mean circulation and the computational method used to obtain their cyclo stationary solution in section 3 we present the governing equations and solution method for the cyclo stationary and transient tracers that are used to constrain the circulation in section 4 we give a bayesian formulation of the inverse problem we then present how we use the adjoint method to efficiently compute the gradient of the logarithm of the posterior probability density function so that we can locate the maximum of the posterior probability function in section 5 we compare the tracers simulated using our most probable model to observations we show the most probable meridional overturning circulation conditioned on the tracer data along with the implied meridional fluxes of heat and fresh water finally in section 6 we summarize the results and give directions for future model developments and applications 2 dynamical model the dynamical model is based on the linearized navier stokes equations with hydrostatic and boussinesq approximations with an implicit free surface 1 u t f v 1 a cos ϕ g η λ d u 1 a cos ϕ p λ ρ 0 δ 1 k δ z 1 τ λ δ τ λ ρ 0 1 ρ 0 τ z e λ a v t f u 1 a g η ϕ d v 1 a p ϕ ρ 0 δ 1

cyclo stationary eddy stress vector η is the seasonally varying mean dynamic topography p is the climatologically averaged seasonally varying baroclinic pressure computed using the hydrostatic balance

previously mentioned the averaging operator used to define the residual mean is based on a projection of the ocean circulation on its cyclo stationary mean seasonal cycle consequently any deviation from this perfectly periodic state is by definition part of the eddy field this is different from conventional 4 d variational assimilation models where the large scale low frequency variability such as enso is explicitly resolved by the model and is not part of the eddy field rewriting 1 in matrix vector form we have 2 t u v w η m u v w η f f e where 3 m r f 0 1 a cos ϕ g λ f r 0 1 a g ϕ 1 a cos

climatological fields trenberth et al 1989 and the observed climatological density computed using the equation of state for seawater and the world ocean atlas 2013 boyer et al 2013 gridded temperature

correction here applied as a body force in the upper most layer of the model and the eddy stress divergence only their sum appears in the model and they are therefore lumped together in the inversion 2 1 space discretization the dynamical state of the model is discretized using a staggered arakawa b grid finite difference scheme e g haltiner and williams 1980 with a uniform 4 4 horizontal resolution and a vertical discretization with 24 layers whose thicknesses increase monotonically with depth table 1 resulting in a discretized dynamical state vector x u v w η expressed as a 122 333 1 matrix with this discretization scheme the operator m becomes a time independent 122 333 122 333 sparse matrix operator similarly the right hand side forcings f and f e become time periodic 122 333 dimensional vectors f and f e the resulting governing equation for the dynamics expressed in matrix vector form is 6 d x d t m x f t f e t following devries 2014 we also added a discretized horizontal laplacian operator with a diffusivity of 10 3 m 2 s to the part of the m operator corresponding to the equation for η i e eq 1 e this was done to damp out a checkerboard computational mode associated with the b grid discretization 2 2 time discretization and cyclo stationary state eq 6 can be further discretized in time using an euler backward scheme with d t δ t 12 to get 7 a x n x n 1 f n f n e d t a i m d t with f 0 f 12 f 0 e f 12 e and x 0 x 12 because the forcing term on the right hand side is periodic in time the fully spun up dynamical state will be cyclo stationary and satisfy the following block matrix system 8 i a 0 0 0 i a 0 0 0 i a a 0 0 i a x 12 x 1 x 2 x 11 f 1 f 1 e f 2 f 2 e f 11 f 11 e f 12 f 12 e d t the enormous size of the matrix a precludes the use of a direct lu factorization to solve eq 8 we therefore obtain a solution to eq 8 using an iterative newton krylov solver that avoids the need to explicitly construct a the convergence of the solver is greatly accelerated by the fact that it is possible to construct a nearly converged initial iterate using a fourier representation of the continuous time solution because m does not depend on t a continuous time cyclo stationary solution to eq 6 can be efficiently computed by first transforming the equation to fourier space to this end we expand the forcing function and the solution in eq 6 into a truncated fourier series with 6 complex sinusoidal modes 9 f t f e t k 0 5 f k e i k 2 π t δ t x t k 0 5 x k e i k 2 π t δ t which transforms the coupled system of differential equations 6 into a system of 733 998 complex valued algebraic equations 10 i ω 0 i m 0 0 0 i ω 1 i m 0 0 0 0 0 i ω 5 i m x 0 x 1 x 5 f 0 f 1 f 5 where the subscript corresponds to each sinusoidal mode in eq 9 and ω k k 2 π δ t because the matrix in eq 10 is block diagonal it uncouples into 6 independent 122 333 122 333 systems each of which can be solved using a complex sparse matrix lu factorization the resulting continuous time solution can then be evaluated at t 0 to construct an initial iterate 11 x 1 ℜ k 0 5 x k for the newton krylov solver fully spun up cyclo stationary solutions can be obtained using this method with the equivalent of only a few years of simulation typically 5 or less without the need for a sophisticated preconditioner 2 3 choice of time step following wenzel et al 2001 we use a time step d t δ t 12 in accordance with the time resolution of the woa climatology because our present goal is to describe the solution method rather than present a scientifically usable state estimate we limit our presentation to the case of 12 time steps per year however our assimilation method should work with an arbitrary number of time steps per year we are planning a follow up paper in which we increase the horizontal resolution to 2 2 and explore the sensitivity of the state estimate to the time step size 3 tracer transport the primary observational constraint for the cyclocim state estimate consists of hydrographic tracer observations the advection diffusion equation for a tracer c is given by 12 c t u t k t c s c t where k t is the tracer diffusivity tensor and u t is the residual mean circulation the implicit averaging operator used to define the residual mean is based on a projection of the ocean circulation onto its climatological mean seasonal cycle thus both u t and k t are assumed to be periodic functions with a period of δ t 1 year for the particular state estimates we present here the diffusivity tensor is constructed using an isopycnal diffusivity of 1 0 3 m 2 s 1 and a vertical diffusivity of 10 5 m 2 s 1 the sensitivity to this choice is explored briefly in the appendix the isopycnal surfaces were computed using the 2013 world ocean atlas woa2013 monthly mean temperature and salinity boyer et al 2013 in addition the vertical diffusivity is enhanced to a value of 1 m 2 s 1 in a surface mixed layer of thickness h which is prescribed according to the observed monthly mean mixed layer depth climatology de boyer montégut et al 2004 this large value ensures that tracer concentrations are uniform within the surface mixed layer 3 1 space discretization the tracer transport equations are discretized using a staggered arakawa c grid e g haltiner and williams 1980 for the 4 4 horizontal resolution with 24 vertical layers the model has a total of n 45 515 wet grid boxes a discretized tracer field can then be organized into an n 1 column vector c the discretized version of eq 12 can then be expressed in matrix vector form as follows 13 d c d t γ t c s c t where s is an n 1 source vector and γ t is a n n sparse matrix constructed such that the matrix vector product γ c produces the advective diffusive tracer flux divergence in each of the model s wet grid boxes in the construction of γ the diffusive tracer fluxes are discretized using second order centered differences and the advective fluxes are discretized using a quick up scheme that is semi upwind i e the quadratic interpolation is biased towards the upstream direction in the horizontal and quick in the vertical leonard 1979 for the grid box interfaces separating the ocean from the land or atmosphere γ is constructed to satisfy no normal flux conditions 3 2 potential temperature model for the potential temperature equation the source term s appearing in eq 13 consists of a surface heat flux which we model by restoring the temperature in the model s upper most layer to a prescribed surface temperature field θ a t that is periodic in time i e θ a t δ t θ a t with n s wet surface grid boxes s can be expressed in matrix vector form as 14 s 1 τ λ s θ a λ s t c where τ 30 days but see appendix a 2 for sensitivity experiments λ s is an n n s sparse matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere the state vector c is organized such that its first n s elements correspond to the surface values therefore λ s t c produces an n s 1 vector of surface temperatures the superscript t is used to denote the matrix transpose operation the prescribed surface temperature field is constructed using the woa2013 monthly climatology boyer et al 2013 to which we add a small periodic in time correction to account for errors in the climatology i e θ a t θ a woa t δ θ a t the unobserved correction δ θ a will be estimated as part of the bayesian inversion the inclusion of the δ θ a term and the δ s a term described below makes this method of implementing the surface boundary condition distinctly different than the so called robust diagnostic method where the temperature is restored to the uncorrected observations e g sarmiento and bryan 1982 3 3 salinity model for the salinity equation the source term s consists of surface freshwater fluxes which we model by restoring the salinity in the model s upper most layer to a seasonally varying sea surface salinity field s a t that is periodic in time i e s a t δ t s a t the source vector for salinity is thus given by 15 s 1 τ λ s s a λ s t c where τ 30 days is the restoring timescale the prescribed sea surface salinity field is constructed using the woa2013 boyer et al 2013 monthly climatology to which we add a small periodic in time correction to account for errors in the climatology i e s a t s a woa t δ s a t the unobserved correction δ s a will be estimated as part of the bayesian inversion 3 4 natural radiocarbon model for the natural pre bomb radiocarbon model the source function consists of the radioactive decay and air sea gas exchange of 14co 2 which we model simply as 16 s 1 τ λ s 14 c s λ s t c λ c where λ log 2 5730 years is the 14c decay rate 14 c s is the glodap key et al 2004 estimate of the surface δ 14 c concentration prior to the atmospheric bomb tests and τ 30 days because τ λ 1 we are effectively restoring c to 14 c s in the surface layer of the model 3 5 chlorofluorocarbons model chlorofluorocarbons cfcs are transient tracers which were released into the atmosphere starting in 1940 therefore an initial concentration of zero is used for a transient simulation for the period from january 1940 to december 2009 using a one month long time step in the transient simulation we use the atmospheric history of cfc 11 and cfc 12 usgs 2009 interpolated to a time resolution of one month to model the gas exchange flux we use the standard ocmip 2 formulation najjar and orr 1998 as was done for ocim devries 2014 17 s λ k d z 1 c a t m λ s t c where d z 1 36 1 m is the thickness of the model s upper most layer and c a t m is the prescribed atmospheric cfc concentration the gas exchange operator λ k is an n n s sparse matrix with non zero elements on the main diagonal these are given by the piston velocity k scaled using an adjustable parameter α such that 18 k α u 10 2 s c 660 1 2 1 f ice where u 10 is the monthly climatological root mean square wind speed at 10 m above the sea surface s c is the temperature dependent schmidt number and f ice is the monthly climatological fractional ice cover note that the scalar parameter α does not change with time and is the same in all grid boxes 3 6 time discretization the version of the model we present here uses a fully implicit euler backward time stepping scheme with a time step of one month 19 b n c n c n 1 s n o d t b n i γ n s c n d t for n 1 2 m with d t δ t 12 in this equation the time dependent tracer transport matrix γ t and the partial derivative of the tracer source function with respect to the tracer concentration s c t c are discretized into 12 time independent matrices γ n and s c n respectively for n 1 2 12 with the condition that γ n 12 γ n and s c n 12 s c n the non homogeneous part of the source function is discretized into time dependent source vectors s 0 t n s n o for n 1 2 m for the transient cfc tracers we use the initial condition that c 0 and step the equations forward for n 1 2 m n yr 12 corresponding to the period from 1940 to 2009 for salinity potential temperature and pre bomb radiocarbon the source vectors satisfy the same periodicity condition as the transport operators i e s n 12 o s n o implying that the fully spun up solution m will also be cyclo stationary with c n 12 c n 3 7 cyclo stationary solutions with a one month time discretization and the euler backward scheme the cyclo stationary tracers potential temperature salinity and pre bomb radiocarbon satisfy the following block matrix system 20 i b 1 0 0 0 i b 2 0 0 0 i b 11 b 12 i b c 12 c 1 c 2 c 11 s 1 0 s 2 0 s 11 0 s 12 0 d t in principle one could try to obtain the cyclo stationary solution to eq 20 by directly inverting b but this is computationally very expensive because of the size of b this prohibitive computational cost is particularly true if we try to decrease the size of the time step to better resolve the seasonal cycle we therefore solve eq 20 using a pre conditioned iterative newton krylov solver without explicitly constructing the b matrix or the source vector on the right hand side e g li and primeau 2008 khatiwala 2008 bardin et al 2014 fu and primeau 2017 in this method we apply the preconditioner to the model state after time stepping the model through one annual period the preconditioner accelerates the convergence of the iterative newton krylov solver but otherwise does not affect the solution for the preconditioner we use the same one first described in li and primeau 2008 namely 21 p δ t 12 n 1 12 γ n s c n 1 i it can be thought of as an approximation to eq 20 using one big euler backward time step with the annually averaged tracer transport matrix we use the nsoli m newton krylov solver kelley 2013 and obtain fully spun up cyclo stationary solutions with the equivalent of only a few years of simulation typically less than 10 and seldom more than 50 4 bayesian inversion for the adjustable model parameters as presently formulated the model has a suite of adjustable parameters organized into an 980 737 1 vector 22 p z τ e λ z τ e ϕ δ θ a δ s a α t that must be specified for the problem to be well posed we infer the parameter values via a bayesian inversion procedure constrained by tracer observations note that the parameters z τ e λ and z τ e ϕ include the three dimensional field of horizontal eddy stress divergences as well as the correction to the imposed surface wind stress the two contributions cannot be separated by our inversion procedure the parameters δ θ a and δ s a are the corrections to the surface temperature and salinity used to compute the fluxes of heat and freshwater at the air sea interface α is a scalar parameter that scales the prescribed piston velocity for the flux of cfcs through the air sea interface we assign normal probability distributions to the observed tracer concentrations with the mean of the distributions given by the model s simulated concentrations specifically the probability of the tracer data conditioned on the model parameters is given by 23 prob c i obs p exp 1 2 h i c i c i obs t w i h i c i c i obs where the index i 1 2 5 identifies the particular tracer being considered i e potential temperature salinity cfc 11 cfc 12 or pre bomb radiocarbon the likelihood function for potential temperature was modified from the gaussian density by a factor that assigns a very low probability to potential temperatures that fall close to or below the freezing point of seawater i e exp ω ice ϕ t ϕ where ϕ tanh exp t 2 6 c 0 1 c and ω ice 1 0 4 the matrices h i are used to select the grid boxes and months for which we have tracer observations for potential temperature and salinity these matrices are identity matrices because we constrain the model using the gridded climatology of woa2013 but for the other tracers we use bottle measurements from glodapv2 we retained only bottle radiocarbon measurements below 1000 m for which the measured cfc 11 was less than 0 01 pmol kg to prevent any interference with the bomb signal the scaled precision matrices w i are taken to be the sum of two symmetric matrices one of which is positive definite the positive definite matrix is diagonal with entries given by the reciprocals of the variances σ i 2 computed from all the observations available for a given month and grid box for potential temperature salinity and pre bomb radiocarbon and for a particular grid box month and year for the transient cfc 11 and cfc 12 tracers and then divided by the numbers of observations therefore σ i varies in space and time we use the woa13 to estimate the σ i of temperature and salinity and glodapv2 to estimate the σ i of cfcs and radiocarbon the other matrix is given by β i l t l where l is a discretized version of the horizontal laplacian operator in spherical coordinates the laplacian operator is only added for the potential temperature and the salinity terms to take into account the spatially correlated errors introduced by the gridding of those observations the value of β i is given by one over the product of the variance of the calculated σ i 2 we further assume that conditioned on the model all the tracer observations are independent with this assumption we can construct the likelihood function by simply taking the product of the probability densities for each tracer i e 24 prob c i obs i 1 5 p i 1 5 prob c i obs p for the prior probability of p we assume a normal distribution centered at p 0 25 prob p exp 1 2 p t w p p with a prior precision matrix w p taken to be diagonal for the unobserved errors in the wind stress climatology δ τ λ δ τ ϕ and the unresolved eddy stress forcing z τ e λ z τ e ϕ the diagonal of w p is 1 0 1 f 2 n where f is the forcing vector in eq 6 and n is the number of adjustable eddy stress divergence parameters this choice ensures that the large scale momentum balance follows the thermal wind and ekman balances the square of f in this last expressions is applied element wise for the δ θ a and δ s a the diagonal elements are given by the reciprocal of the product of the variance computed from all the observations for a given month and the number of grid boxes in the surface layer of the model we assign no prior constraint on the value of α we further constrained the prior probability density function for the parameters implicitly by assigning a weak prior on the dynamical state of the model i e we assigned a normal distribution centered at zero 26 prob x p exp 1 2 x t w x x where the precision matrix w x is taken to be diagonal the diagonal elements are given by the reciprocal of velocity and dynamic topography variances the horizontal velocity variances start with a value of 1 m s 2 in the top layer of the model and decay exponentially to 0 07 m s 2 at a depth of 4000 m see eq 14 in large et al 2001 this weak constraint is helpful in the early stages of the parameter optimization as it prevents the search algorithm from suggesting parameter values that lead to implausible dynamical states its impact on the ultimate solution is negligible for the vertical velocity we increased the prior precision by a factor of 50 compared to that used by devries 2014 to be consistent with that used in the latest ocim version ocim2 as described in devries and holzer 2019 the increased penalty is necessary to prevent unrealistically large vertical velocities and a noisy meridional overturning circulation with the above choices the posterior probability density function obtained via bayes theorem is 27 prob p c i obs i 1 5 exp 1 2 i 1 5 h i c i c i obs t w i h i c i c i obs 1 2 ω ice ϕ t ϕ 1 2 x t w x x 1 2 p t w p p note that x in this probability density is an implicit function of p the posterior probability density described by eq 27 lives in a 980 737 dimensional space the large dimension of this space makes it impossible to compute or store the posterior covariance matrix of the state estimate we therefore limit ourselves to summarizing the posterior probability density function in terms of the location of its maximum which is equivalent to finding the minimum of the negative logarithm of the posterior probability density function 28 f p f y p p 1 2 i 1 5 h i c i c i obs t w i h i c i c

temperature salinity and radiocarbon solutions with the transient cfc 11 and cfc 12 solutions note that minimizing f p reduces to solving a nonlinear least squares problem it is important to point out that the location of the minimum of the objective function will not change if we add a multiplicative factor to the objective function such a factor will however affect the size of the posterior error bars for our parameter estimates because this scaling factor affects the normalization constant for the posterior probability introducing it also introduces an extra additive term to the objective function that depends on the scaling factor but not on p this means that if we had introduced the scaling factor we would be able to estimate its size by minimizing the resulting objective function with respect to this factor we did not do this here because we are focusing on finding the most probable state estimate however it will be important to estimate this missing scaling factor in the future so that we can obtain consistent posterior error bars for our state estimate we solve the above problem using a quasi newton method following heinkenschloss 2008 we express the gradient of f p in terms of the partial gradients of f y p 29 p f p y p t y f y p p p f y p f y y p p 1 f p y p p t y f y p p p f y p p f p y p p t λ p p f y p p where the vector of lagrange multipliers λ p is the solution to 30 f y y p p t λ p y f y p the great computational advantage of using the last expression in eq 29 rather than the middle line in eq 29 is that it involves solving only one linear system of equations for λ p instead of solving a separate linear system for each of the 980 737 components of p because the linear system involves the transposed jacobian matrix f y y p p t this method is known as the adjoint method e g schlitzer 1993 2007 devries and primeau 2011 the adjoint system 30 and λ p can be partitioned into components which can be solved separately specifically 31 λ p t λ x t λ θ t λ s t λ c 14 t λ cfc 11 t λ cfc 12 t where 32 b n t λ c n λ c n 1 c n f y p for n m m 1 1 for the cases where c n correspond to the transient cfc tracers the system is solved starting with the final condition λ c m 1 0 and time stepped backwards in time from m n yr 12 to m 1 for the cyclo stationary tracers the λ c n are also periodic and solutions are obtained using the same newton krylov method used to find the cyclo stationary state of the tracers except that the transpose of the operators is used in reverse time order and the transpose of the operator in eq 21 is used for the preconditioning we note that in the forward model the state at time step n 1 is completely determined by the state of the model at time step n similarly in the adjoint model the state at time step n is completely determined by the state at time step n 1 because all the solutions obtained using our cyclo stationary solver are perfectly periodic it does not matter at which month we start the integration we always get the same periodic solution for the same forcing having obtained the lagrange multipliers corresponding to the tracer variables the lagrange multipliers corresponding to the model s dynamical state can be obtained by solving for the cyclo stationary state of 33 a t λ x n λ x n 1 f n where the monthly forcing terms are given by 34 f n γ x n λ θ n λ s n λ c 14 n m 1 n yr λ cfc 11 m n λ cfc 12 m n x n f y p for n 1 2 12 where γ x n corresponds to the partial derivative of the tracer transport operator with respect to the dynamical state variable during month n cyclo stationary solutions are obtained using the same newton krylov solver used for the forward model except that the transpose of a is used in the preconditioner and the forcing terms are cycled in time reversed order 4 1 summary of cyclocim data assimilation procedure the cyclocim data assimilation system solves the constrained optimization problem 35 minimize y p f y p such that c y p 0 where f p f y p p is the negative of the logarithm of the posterior probability density prob p d a t a for p see eqs 27 and 28 and c y p 0 denotes the governing equations for the dynamical and tracer states of the model the solution procedure is summarized in fig 1 the iterative procedure consists of repeating five main steps 1 given a current estimate of p solve the cyclo stationary dynamical model to obtain x p i e the seasonally varying residual mean circulation u v w and dynamic topography η 2 solve the transient tracers c cfc 11 and c cfc 12 and the cyclo stationary tracers potential temperature salinity and natural radiocarbon θ s and c 14 using the sparse matrix tracer transport operators constructed using the current estimate of x 3 evaluate the objective function for the given p that is the posterior probability density function prob p d a t a as given in eq 27 evaluating f p as given in eq 28 is equivalent to evaluating eq 27 because the logarithm function is a monotonically increasing function 4 compute the gradient of the objective function p f p and check if the minimum has been reached 5 use a quasi newton search algorithm and p f p to produce an improved more probable estimate of p the data assimilation procedure we use is equivalent to what is sometimes called a 4 d variational assimilation system except that the time dependent part of the procedure is restricted to be periodic for the circulation and the non transient tracers 5 results we conducted state estimates for a version of cyclocim with a resolution of 8 8 22 layers and 4 4 24 layers the optimization for a version of cyclocim with the standard ocim resolution of 2 2 24 layers is underway but the optimal solution has not yet been found we stop the iteration when the cost function changes by less than 1 per 1000 iteration note that for the 8 8 and 4 4 versions of cyclocim we prescribed a maximum number of iterations but we checked that the above stopping criteria was met for the solutions we present here our goal is to present the higher resolution solution in a separate paper that can focus on the state estimate rather than the technical aspects of the assimilation which is the main focus of the present report the evolution of the objective function for the 8 8 22 model for the 10 000 iterations is shown in fig 2 the objective function starts at a value of approximately 1 0 4 after 10 000 iterations the objective function has decreased to a value of less than 5 4 the drop is fastest for the first 2000 iterations and the rate of decrease slows down afterwards while the rate of decrease is modest in the last 1000 iterations f p is still decreasing monotonically however the changes in the resulting state estimate are rather modest for the version of cyclocim with a 4 4 24 layers resolution which we present in the next section we performed approximately 4 1 0 3 iterations but we restarted the optimization along the way because we did not include all the tracer constraints at the beginning the magnitude of the estimated eddy stress divergence terms which also includes effects due to the missing nonlinear terms and discretization errors is comparable to the magnitude of the error terms from the original steady state ocim model devries and primeau 2011 the horizontally averaged magnitude of the vertical divergence of the eddy stresses is 1 2 1 0 6 m s 2 the magnitude of these parameterized forcing terms are only modestly dependent on the model resolution i e 8 8 4 4 or 2 2 for comparison the explicit forcing appearing on the right hand side of the horizontal momentum equation has a typical horizontally averaged magnitude that is about a factor of three bigger this suggests that the non parameterized large scale momentum balance dominates over the parameterized eddy stresses and confirms that the relative weights we have assigned to the likelihood and prior in our probability model provide an acceptable initial estimate further refinements might be necessary if the goal is to interpret the resulting eddy stress terms physically 5 1 comparison of assimilated variables with observations we begin by comparing each modeled tracer with the observations that were used to constrain the model in figs 3 7 we perform the comparison on the model s 4 4 grid it is therefore important to keep in mind that any variance in the data associated with sharp gradients that cannot be resolved by this coarse mesh will necessarily be ignored in the comparison a summary of the model fit to the data is provided in fig 3 where we show the joint cumulative distribution functions for the observed and modeled tracer variables for all tracers more than 90 of the ocean volume has concentrations that cluster tightly along the 1 1 line with r 2 0 99 for potential temperature and r 2 0 96 for the other tracers the close agreement between the modeled and observed tracers suggests that the cyclocim circulation can be used to produce meaningful estimates of the climatological water mass formation rates and transport for the real ocean which is not always possible when analyzing free running prognostic models in fig 4 the globally averaged root mean square errors rmse for the potential temperature salinity and cfc 11 from cyclocim are compared to the corresponding rmses for the ocim ctrl state estimate devries 2014 by resolving the seasonal cycle cyclocim provides a better fit to the observations at mid to high latitudes in the surface mixed layer and seasonal thermocline for the deep ocean below 500 m where seasonality is negligible the rmse is similar for both state estimates the globally averaged rmse of potential temperature for cyclocim is 0 29 c whereas for ocim it is 0 38 c for the near surface waters 0 200 m the decrease in the rmse is significantly larger 0 70 c for cyclocim versus 1 27 c for ocim most of the improvements occur in mid latitudes fig 5 where the mixed layer depths have a pronounced seasonal variation for example the cold bias of more than 3 c to the north of the kuroshio extension in the ocim state estimate is substantially decreased in the cyclocim state estimate similarly the low latitude warm bias in the ocim state estimate has been eliminated in the cyclocim state estimate consistent with the results of yu and malanotte rizzoli 1998 resolving the seasonal variations produces a significantly improved estimate of the climatological circulation the ability of the model to capture the correct seasonal cycle is illustrated in fig 6 in which we compare the potential temperature anomalies plotted as departure from the annual average along 36 s for cyclocim and the woa2013 observations boyer et al 2013 the modeled potential temperature shows a similar seasonal pattern as the observations in the summer djf the mixed layer is shallow and there is a strong temperature gradient near the surface the mixed layer deepens through the fall mam and winter jja becoming thickest in late winter when the surface stratification entirely disappears in spring son as winds weaken and solar irradiance increases the mixed layer shoals once again the model seasonality is quite similar to that of the observations exceptions are along the western boundary currents where the warm and cold anomalies penetrate deeper in the observations than in the model such errors are not surprising given the coarseness of the model resolution we anticipate that these errors will be reduced in the 2 2 cyclocim and by including the dynamic topography constraints from satellite altimeter data there are also significant improvements in the cyclocim simulated surface salinity fields as can be seen from fig 7 where we plot the errors averaged over the top 200 m of the water column most prominently large errors in the western part of the subpolar gyre in the north atlantic ocean present in the steady ocim state estimate are greatly reduced in the seasonally varying cyclocim state estimate a similar positive bias in the southern ocean for the steady ocim state estimate has been completely eliminated in the cyclocim state estimate improvements extend over most of the ocean with the exception of the arctic basin where a uniformly positive salinity bias in ocim has been replaced by errors that appear more random the globally averaged rmse for salinity in the upper 200 m of the water column is reduced from 0 25 g kg for ocim to 0 11 g kg for cyclocim for the full water column the improvements are more modest but still appreciable with rmse reduced from 0 07 g kg for ocim to 0 04 g kg for cyclocim the cyclocim simulation of cfc 11 also provides a better fit to the observed cfc 11 data the sensitivity of the fit to the scaling parameter for the piston velocity is discussed in appendix a 3 the rmse for surface waters between 0 and 200 m is 0 07 pmol kg for the ocim state estimate whereas for cyclocim it is 0 04 pmol kg in fig 8 we plot the decadal mean zonal averages of cfc 11 and cfc 12 concentrations the zonal averages are calculated using a volume weighted average of the cfc concentrations for gridboxes with at least one cfc measurement at any depth and longitude during the particular decade the agreement between cyclocim and the observations is generally good there are however clear decadal biases at high latitudes in the southern ocean south of 60 s the model concentrations are several standard deviations too low for the 1980 1989 and the 2000 2009 period while being in very good agreement for the 1990 1999 period in the north there are similar low biases but the exact latitude band with the largest biases appear to shift from decade to decade decadal variability in the ventilation of the ocean provides a plausible explanation for these errors e g waugh et al 2013 devries et al 2017 the cyclocim fit to the pre bomb radiocarbon is also very good fig 9 compares the zonally averaged cyclocim simulated radiocarbon to the glodapv2 data olsen et al 2016 the zonal averages are calculated using a volume weighted average using only grid boxes below 1000 m with cfc 11 concentrations below 0 01 pmol kg the good agreement between cyclocim and the glodapv2 radiocarbon at all latitudes and in all basins suggests that the deep ocean ventilation timescales in cyclocim are comparable to those of the real ocean 5 2 meridional overturning circulation the climatological mean meridional overturning circulation moc is defined as the stream function for the zonally integrated meridional volume transport with depth fig 10 a c shows the implied stream function for cyclocim in the southern ocean pacific ocean and atlantic ocean the estimated overturning circulation appears consistent with typical results from inverse models lumpkin and speer 2007 devries and primeau 2011 devries and holzer 2019 cessi 2019 the maximum of the stream function is approximately 30 sv in the southern ocean 60 s 22 sv in the northern atlantic and 8 sv across the equator in the deep pacific ocean 5 3 inferred air sea fluxes and meridional transport of heat and freshwater in contrast to the ocim state estimate we did not use the heat and freshwater reanalysis fluxes to constrain the cyclocim state estimate it is therefore interesting to examine how the inferred meridional heat and freshwater transports compare to other data based estimates fig 11 shows the seasonally averaged surface heat flux during june to august the ocean gains heat in the northern hemisphere and loses it in the southern hemisphere while the reverse is true in the december to february months the shoulder seasons march may and september november have more muted air sea heat flux patterns with the ocean generally gaining heat at low latitudes and losing heat at high latitudes in fig 12 a we show the annually average cyclocim estimate of the air sea heat flux the ocean gains heat in the east pacific cold tongue region and along the eastern boundaries of the pacific and atlantic with magnitude around 150 w m 2 heat gained in the tropical regions is transported poleward and is lost in higher latitudes in fig 12 b we compare the mean meridional transport computed from the cyclocim state estimate to estimates from the core v2 reanalysis large and yeager 2009 from ocim ctrl devries 2014 and from a not fully converged estimate using a version of cyclocim with a horizontal resolution of 2 2 cylcocim2x2 before discussing these results we hasten to point out that as presently configured the model shows great sensitivity to the choice of restoring timescale τ used in the surface boundary condition for heat and freshwater see appendix a 2 the cyclocim meridional heat transport peaks near 20 n with a value of 2 pw and near 20 s with a value of 1 pw the meridional heat transports for cyclocim2x2 and ocim also peak near 20 n but with weaker values of 1 2 1 5 pw respectively and at 15 s with a consistent value of approximately 1 pw in the southern hemisphere there is a general agreement between ocim cyclocim and cyclocim2x2 which in turn predict a significantly larger poleward heat transport than core v2 the larger poleward heat transport in southern hemisphere is also consistent with the ecco estimate forget and ferreira 2019 and from the atmospheric reanalyses trenberth and fasullo 2017 in the northern hemisphere south of 50 n the core v2 meridional heat transport tends to be smaller than that of cyclocim but larger than that of ocim and cyclocim2x2 northward of 50 n cyclocim predicts a significantly smaller poleward heat transport than either core v2 ocim cyclocim2x2 the air sea heat fluxes in the kuroshio and gulf stream regions for the cyclocim state estimate are substantially weaker than those for the core v2 reanalysis not shown the annually averaged heat loss to the atmosphere in the gulf stream region as estimated from cyclocim is around 50 w m 2 while in the labrador sea the annually averaged heat loss is greater than 300 w m 2 such a large heat loss to the atmosphere would suggest a large meridional heat transport to the north of 50 n yet the cyclocim estimate appears to be substantially weaker than either the core v2 ocim or cylcocim2x2 estimates this apparent inconsistency can be explained by the fact that cyclcocim produces an unrealistic southward heat transport near 50 n in the pacific basin which more than compensates for the unrealistically large northward heat transport in the atlantic basin the cylcocim2x2 estimate does not appear to produce the unrealistic southward heat transport in the pacific basin which is encouraging but it does point to the sensitivity of the inferred pattern of air sea heat fluxes to the horizontal resolution of the model in addition to a strong sensitivity to the choice of restoring time scale used in the surface boundary condition for temperature and salinity the implied annually averaged freshwater fluxes fig 12 c show a pattern that is similar to the core v2 reanalysis data not shown large and yeager 2009 there is net evaporation in the subtropical gyres and net precipitation in the intertropical convergence zone itcz and the sub polar regions however cyclocim predicts weak precipitation minus evaporation in the itcz with a magnitude around 1 m year and strong precipitation minus evaporation in the gulf stream region and labrador sea with magnitude more than 3 m year in the corev2 reanalysis there is 1 5 m year of precipitation minus evaporation in the itcz and 1 m year of precipitation minus evaporation in the gulf stream region and labrador sea fig 12 d compares the meridional freshwater transport estimate from cyclocim cyclocim2x2 to those of core v2 and ocim the largest disagreement is in the northern hemisphere between the equator and 40 n where cyclocim predicts a strong southward freshwater transport whereas both ocim and the core v2 estimates show a northward transport between 5 n and 20 n and a substantially weaker southward transport than cyclocim between 20 n and 40 n the cyclocim2x2 estimate is generally closer to the ocim and core v2 estimates implying again that the surface flux patterns are quite sensitive to the horizontal resolution of the model the differences between the core v2 reanalysis and the cyclocim inferred meridional heat and freshwater transport suggest that in future inversions we might obtain improved state estimates by including atmospheric reanalysis constraints in the probability model as we did previously for ocim on the other hand cyclocim2x2 produces reasonable first order estimate of the meridional transports of heat and freshwater that are independent of atmospheric reanalyses without a more thorough uncertainty analysis it is difficult to unequivocally select one estimate over another as being more representative of the true climatological meridional transports such an uncertainty analysis is planned for the 2 2 version of cyclocim 6 summary and discussion we have presented the formulation of a 4 d variational assimilation system for estimating the climatological mean seasonal cycle of the residual mean ocean circulation the system which we call cyclocim assimilates monthly mean potential temperature and salinity data from the woa2013 transient cfc 11 and cfc 12 data from the glodapv2 database and natural radiocarbon measurements for the deep ocean from the glodapv2 database we have demonstrated that our data constrained model produces a plausible overturning circulation while the meridional heat and freshwater transports are quite sensitive to the model s horizontal resolution the 2 2 version of cyclocim produces estimates that are in rough agreement with existing estimates even though the objective function did not explicitly include such constraints by resolving the seasonal cycle we are able to produce a much better fit to observations in the upper ocean compared to our previous steady state ocim estimates and most of the assimilated variables are in agreement with the observational constraints one exception is the cfc 11 and cfc 12 tracers in the antarctic region of the southern ocean where cyclocim concentrations are too low decadal variability in the ventilation of the ocean provides a plausible explanation for these errors e g waugh et al 2013 devries et al 2017 the main product of our assimilation system is a set of 12 monthly data constrained tracer transport operators for the climatological annual cycle of the ocean circulation we anticipate that these operators will be particularly useful for global biogeochemical inversions for which there is a need for reliable estimates of the seasonally varying climatological transport of tracers we focused on the estimate produced using cyclocim with a 4 4 resolution but we are presently completing the optimization for the 2 2 version of the model for expediency we also ignored valuable constraints on the dynamic topography of the model provided by satellite altimeter data we plan on including this constraint in future versions of cyclocim another avenue for future work is to produce an ensemble of tracer transport operators drawn from the bayesian posterior distribution for the eddy stresses and surface forcing so far we have only determined the maximum of the posterior distribution but the development of a computationally efficient means of drawing samples from the posterior should be a high priority for future work so that realistic error estimates can be provided in principle cyclocim could also be used to estimate the eddy stresses as was done in the work of ferreira et al 2005 however as presently formulated the tracer transport errors due to the coarse space and time resolution of the model get partially corrected via adjustments of the eddy stress terms this makes the eddy stress terms noisy and difficult to interpret it might also be necessary to replace the rayleigh drag in the momentum equation with a laplacian viscosity as was done in the original ocim devries and primeau 2011 but subsequently replaced with the computationally more efficient from rayleigh drag devries 2014 for our present goal of generating high fidelity tracer transport operators our inability to separate physical eddy stress from noise is not a major problem but if the goal is to study the eddy stresses it will be important to separate these two contributions to the eddy stress control variables in the model credit authorship contribution

experiments a 1 diffusivity we have conducted three experiments similar to those presented by devries and holzer 2019 for ocim one with the isopycnal diffusivity set to 2000 m 2 s highiso one with isopycnal diffusivity set to 600 m 2 s lowiso and one with high diapycnal diffusivity highdia which increases from 10 5 m 2 s at the surface to 3 4 m 2 s at 5400 m each experiment starts with the optimal solution from the standard cyclocim configuration and then run for 2000 iterations fig a 13 shows that the mean meridional overturning circulation in highiso and highdia experiments are stronger than cyclocim fig 10 whereas lowiso produces a weaker overturning circulation a 2 restoring timescale cyclocim used a surface restoring timescale of τ 30 days for computing the surface fluxes of heat and freshwater see eqs 14 16 we conducted two sensitivity experiments in which we halved and doubled the surface restoring time τ 15 days and τ 60 days each sensitivity experiment started with the optimal parameters estimated from the standard cyclocim configuration and was run for an additional 1500 iterations the inferred heat and freshwater transports are shown in fig a 14 the experiments show that the implied meridional transports are quite sensitive to the choice of τ this sensitivity suggests that in future work we will need to include the additional constraint on the surface fluxes of heat and freshwater from atmospheric reanalysis as we did previously for ocim devries and primeau 2011 this sensitivity might also be due to the absence of a constraint on the dynamic topography from altimeter data which was included in our previous state estimate using ocim a 3 parameter α the optimal value of α used to scale the piston velocity in the air sea gas exchange was 0 14 cm h m s 2 a value that is significantly smaller than the value of 0 251 cm h m s 2 estimated by wanninkhof 2014 for climatological winds we therefore calculated the contribution to the objective function f ˆ eq 28 from cfc 11 and cfc 12 misfits as a function of α the sensitivity shown in fig a 15 is performed holding all the other control parameters fixed at their optimized value taken at face value these results suggest that cyclocim can provide a strong lower bound on α but only a weak upper bound any firm conclusion must await a more fully vetted state estimate which is beyond the scope of the present article 
23923,we describe a new 4 d variational assimilation system called cyclocim to estimate the climatological seasonal cycle of the residual mean ocean circulation cyclocim assimilates monthly mean potential temperature and salinity data from the world ocean atlas and cfc 11 cfc 12 and natural radiocarbon measurements for the deep ocean from the global data analysis project version 2 cyclocim s control parameters include i a seasonally varying 3 d field of unresolved eddy stress divergences that appear in the horizontal momentum equations ii seasonally varying 2 d correction fields for the surface heat and freshwater fluxes and iii a constant scaling factor for the air sea flux of cfcs the influence of initial conditions on a fully spun up ocean model vanishes thus unlike other 4 d variational assimilation systems cyclocim does not include initial conditions as control parameters a bayesian procedure is used to formulate the inverse problem which is solved by finding the maximum of the posterior probability distribution the optimization process used to find the maximum includes a forward simulation to calculate the flow velocities and tracer distributions followed by a backward adjoint simulation to compute the gradient of the posterior a quasi newton search algorithm is used to find the set of parameters to maximize the posterior probability we find that by resolving the seasonal cycle the model is able to better fit the observations in the upper ocean compared to a previous steady state version of the model the main output from cyclocim is a set of 12 data constrained monthly tracer transport matrices that will provide a useful circulation model for global marine biogeochemical cycle studies keywords cfc radiocarbon residual mean circulation data assimilation tracer transport matrix 1 introduction an important goal of data assimilation in oceanography is to provide an estimate of the state of the ocean that is consistent with available observations and known physical laws variational assimilation methods aim to achieve this goal by iteratively minimizing an objective function that measures the difference between predictions obtained from a dynamical circulation model and available observations ghil and malanotte rizzoli 1991 while the applications for global data assimilation products are numerous the detection of climate trends is major driving motivation typically the inputs to the objective function are the model s initial conditions and surface boundary conditions for the fluxes of heat freshwater and momentum but sometimes internal eddy diffusivity parameters are also used e g balmaseda et al 2015 köhl 2015 forget et al 2015 osafune et al 2015 fukumori et al 2018 in addition to producing a space time interpolation of the sparse and irregularly sampled observations a 4 d variational assimilation system also produces an estimate of the global circulation the resulting estimate of the circulation can be extremely useful for computing tracer flux divergences in biogeochemical applications when the focus is on recent trends and variability that fall within the assimilation period the estimated circulation can be used unambiguously e g brix et al 2015 doi et al 2015 carroll et al 2020 for applications involving the functioning of biogeochemical cycles on longer timescales one can time average the estimate and assume that the resulting average is representative of the long term mean circulation for example graven et al 2012 average the state estimate for the period 1992 2004 from the ecco godae assimilation system stammer et al 2004 into monthly mean tracer transport matrices which are then used to simulate the pre industrial carbon cycle and its transient evolution for 1760 2007 for this they assume a climate system that is stationary to first order and repeatedly cycle through the same 12 tracer transport matrices however because each iteration of the assimilation procedure simulates the circulation for at most a few decades while repeatedly adjusting the initial conditions the resulting circulation is never fully spun up consequently it is not clear that the circulation especially in the deep ocean produces stable water masses when the circulation is extrapolated to time scales longer than those used for the assimilation indeed graven et al 2012 demonstrate the existence of clear biases in the shallow to deep exchange of water masses in the data assimilation circulation from the ecco godae model similarly liu et al 2012 show that even after optimizing the initial conditions the surface forcing and eddy diffusivities the german ecco synthesis gecco has temperature errors that are several times bigger than their prior estimates for biogeochemistry research that requires tracer simulations that are much longer than the observational record an alternative data assimilation procedure has been developed e g schlitzer 2007 devries and primeau 2011 it aims to directly constrain a steady state model of the ocean s long term climatological mean using a 3 d no time dependence variational assimilation procedure the application of inverse methods to global marine biogeochemical cycles has progressed rapidly in recent years because of the development of such a data constrained steady model expressed in the form of a tracer transport matrix e g devries et al 2012 devries et al 2013 holzer and primeau 2013 devries and deutsch 2014 devries 2014 holzer et al 2014 teng et al 2014 frants et al 2015 holzer et al 2016 weber et al 2016 devries et al 2017 pasquier and holzer 2016 roshan et al 2017 pasquier and holzer 2017 roshan and devries 2017 holzer et al 2017 john et al 2018 wang et al 2019 martin et al 2019a b the tracer transport matrix used in the aforementioned studies is produced by a data assimilation system known as the ocean circulation inverse model ocim devries and primeau 2011 primeau et al 2013 devries 2014 devries and holzer 2019 ocim uses a variational method to assimilate stationary and transient tracers into a steady state model for the large scale momentum balance of the ocean because of the assimilation process the circulation biases found in most prognostic ocean general circulation models ogcms are greatly reduced as a result biogeochemical inferences made on the basis of tracer flux divergences computed using ocim can be interpreted more reliably than those obtained from free running ogcms the steady state assumption used in the ocim system makes it possible to obtain a fully spun up ocean state by direct matrix inversion rather than by a slow time stepping spin up as is used in traditional ogcms this capability makes it feasible to compute the o 1 0 3 iterations of the forward and adjoint model runs that are required by the iterative numerical optimization algorithm to bring the model state into agreement with the tracer data constraints an important drawback of the steady state formulation is that it ignores the pronounced seasonality of ventilation processes in mid to high latitudes e g marshall and schott 1999 williams et al 1995 this neglect can lead to potentially important biases whose influence on biogeochemical inferences are difficult to quantify for example it is well known that late winter mixed layer water properties are preferentially selected for export to the permanent pycnocline e g stommel 1979 williams et al 1995 by neglecting the seasonal cycle the ocim tracer transport operator must necessarily be biased in the upper ocean if it is to reproduce the correct water mass properties in the permanent thermocline and abyssal waters see for example the discussion in yu and malanotte rizzoli 1996 1998 here we present an extended ocim assimilation system which we call cyclocim that produces a cyclo stationary state estimate for the climatological seasonally varying ocean circulation the direct matrix inversions via lu factorization that were used to obtain fully spun up steady states in ocim are replaced by calls to a cyclo stationary newton krylov solver e g li and primeau 2008 bardin et al 2014 compared with the majority of existing ocean reanalysis efforts e g mazloff et al 2010 balmaseda et al 2015 köhl 2015 forget et al 2015 osafune et al 2015 fukumori et al 2018 what sets our system apart is that it aims to estimate the ocean s mean annual cycle rather than its inter annual variability cyclocim is therefore a generalization to a periodic annual cycle of previous steady state inversions e g schlitzer 1993 wunsch 1996 ganachaud and wunsch 2000 schlitzer 2007 devries and primeau 2011 the goal of the cyclocim assimilation system is therefore most similar to the one in the study of wenzel et al 2001 who developed a 4 d variational assimilation method to estimate a cyclo stationary annual cycle of the ocean circulation there are however some important methodological differences most importantly wenzel et al 2001 follow yu and malanotte rizzoli 1998 by adding a penalty term for departures from a cyclo stationary state to the usual cost function that measures the misfit between the model and the observations they then use the initial conditions i e the january model state along with the monthly mean surface forcing as the control variables in the minimization problem the data assimilation procedure used in wenzel et al 2001 can therefore be viewed as trading off model data misfits for a reduced temporal drift indeed in a fully spun up model with zero drift the initial conditions exert no controllability on the objective function in contrast cyclocim searches for the optimal state in the space of perfectly cyclo stationary model solutions that have zero temporal drift this is achieved by adding time periodic eddy stress divergence terms to the horizontal momentum equations and using them as control variables in the optimization of the residual mean circulation in this respect cyclocim follows the pioneering study of ferreira et al 2005 who added eddy stresses to initial conditions and surface forcing as the control variables used to minimize solution drift and departures from climatological observations of temperature in cyclocim we completely eliminate the initial conditions from the list of adjustable parameters by directly solving for the cyclo stationary annual cycle this cyclo stationary solution represents the projection of the ocean s long term climatological attractor onto a periodic annual cycle the primary focus of this article is to document the numerical formulation of the model and the solution method rather than presenting a scientifically usable state estimate in section 2 we present the governing equations for the residual mean circulation and the computational method used to obtain their cyclo stationary solution in section 3 we present the governing equations and solution method for the cyclo stationary and transient tracers that are used to constrain the circulation in section 4 we give a bayesian formulation of the inverse problem we then present how we use the adjoint method to efficiently compute the gradient of the logarithm of the posterior probability density function so that we can locate the maximum of the posterior probability function in section 5 we compare the tracers simulated using our most probable model to observations we show the most probable meridional overturning circulation conditioned on the tracer data along with the implied meridional fluxes of heat and fresh water finally in section 6 we summarize the results and give directions for future model developments and applications 2 dynamical model the dynamical model is based on the linearized navier stokes equations with hydrostatic and boussinesq approximations with an implicit free surface 1 u t f v 1 a cos ϕ g η λ d u 1 a cos ϕ p λ ρ 0 δ 1 k δ z 1 τ λ δ τ λ ρ 0 1 ρ 0 τ z e λ a v t f u 1 a g η ϕ d v 1 a p ϕ ρ 0 δ 1

eulerian mean τ τ λ τ ϕ is the wind stress and the factor δ 1 k δ z 1 is used to indicate that the wind stress is applied as a body force in the top layer of the discretized model τ e τ e λ τ e ϕ is a cyclo stationary eddy stress vector η is the seasonally varying mean dynamic topography p is the climatologically averaged seasonally varying baroclinic pressure computed using the hydrostatic balance

2002 ferreira et al 2005 devries and primeau 2011 f is the coriolis parameter g is gravity λ is the longitude and ϕ is the latitude the continuity equation is solved in a domain with the surface set

previously mentioned the averaging operator used to define the residual mean is based on a projection of the ocean circulation on its cyclo stationary mean seasonal cycle consequently any deviation from this perfectly periodic state is by definition part of the eddy field this is different from conventional 4 d variational assimilation models where the large scale low frequency variability such as enso is explicitly resolved by the model and is not part of the eddy field rewriting 1 in matrix vector form we have 2 t u v w η m u v w η f f e where 3 m r f 0 1 a cos ϕ g λ f r 0 1 a g ϕ 1 a cos

side is decomposed into two periodic forcing terms f t δ t f t and f e t δ t f e t the first contribution consists of the wind stress and the baroclinic pressure forces 4 f t 1 ρ 0 δ 1 k δ z 1 τ λ g a

climatological fields trenberth et al 1989 and the observed climatological density computed using the equation of state for seawater and the world ocean atlas 2013 boyer et al 2013 gridded temperature

τ ϕ z τ e ϕ 0 0 which will be inferred via the bayesian inversion procedure using transient and cyclo stationary tracer observations we do not attempt to separate the contribution of the wind stress correction here applied as a body force in the upper most layer of the model and the eddy stress divergence only their sum appears in the model and they are therefore lumped together in the inversion 2 1 space discretization the dynamical state of the model is discretized using a staggered arakawa b grid finite difference scheme e g haltiner and williams 1980 with a uniform 4 4 horizontal resolution and a vertical discretization with 24 layers whose thicknesses increase monotonically with depth table 1 resulting in a discretized dynamical state vector x u v w η expressed as a 122 333 1 matrix with this discretization scheme the operator m becomes a time independent 122 333 122 333 sparse matrix operator similarly the right hand side forcings f and f e become time periodic 122 333 dimensional vectors f and f e the resulting governing equation for the dynamics expressed in matrix vector form is 6 d x d t m x f t f e t following devries 2014 we also added a discretized horizontal laplacian operator with a diffusivity of 10 3 m 2 s to the part of the m operator corresponding to the equation for η i e eq 1 e this was done to damp out a checkerboard computational mode associated with the b grid discretization 2 2 time discretization and cyclo stationary state eq 6 can be further discretized in time using an euler backward scheme with d t δ t 12 to get 7 a x n x n 1 f n f n e d t a i m d t with f 0 f 12 f 0 e f 12 e and x 0 x 12 because the forcing term on the right hand side is periodic in time the fully spun up dynamical state will be cyclo stationary and satisfy the following block matrix system 8 i a 0 0 0 i a 0 0 0 i a a 0 0 i a x 12 x 1 x 2 x 11 f 1 f 1 e f 2 f 2 e f 11 f 11 e f 12 f 12 e d t the enormous size of the matrix a precludes the use of a direct lu factorization to solve eq 8 we therefore obtain a solution to eq 8 using an iterative newton krylov solver that avoids the need to explicitly construct a the convergence of the solver is greatly accelerated by the fact that it is possible to construct a nearly converged initial iterate using a fourier representation of the continuous time solution because m does not depend on t a continuous time cyclo stationary solution to eq 6 can be efficiently computed by first transforming the equation to fourier space to this end we expand the forcing function and the solution in eq 6 into a truncated fourier series with 6 complex sinusoidal modes 9 f t f e t k 0 5 f k e i k 2 π t δ t x t k 0 5 x k e i k 2 π t δ t which transforms the coupled system of differential equations 6 into a system of 733 998 complex valued algebraic equations 10 i ω 0 i m 0 0 0 i ω 1 i m 0 0 0 0 0 i ω 5 i m x 0 x 1 x 5 f 0 f 1 f 5 where the subscript corresponds to each sinusoidal mode in eq 9 and ω k k 2 π δ t because the matrix in eq 10 is block diagonal it uncouples into 6 independent 122 333 122 333 systems each of which can be solved using a complex sparse matrix lu factorization the resulting continuous time solution can then be evaluated at t 0 to construct an initial iterate 11 x 1 ℜ k 0 5 x k for the newton krylov solver fully spun up cyclo stationary solutions can be obtained using this method with the equivalent of only a few years of simulation typically 5 or less without the need for a sophisticated preconditioner 2 3 choice of time step following wenzel et al 2001 we use a time step d t δ t 12 in accordance with the time resolution of the woa climatology because our present goal is to describe the solution method rather than present a scientifically usable state estimate we limit our presentation to the case of 12 time steps per year however our assimilation method should work with an arbitrary number of time steps per year we are planning a follow up paper in which we increase the horizontal resolution to 2 2 and explore the sensitivity of the state estimate to the time step size 3 tracer transport the primary observational constraint for the cyclocim state estimate consists of hydrographic tracer observations the advection diffusion equation for a tracer c is given by 12 c t u t k t c s c t where k t is the tracer diffusivity tensor and u t is the residual mean circulation the implicit averaging operator used to define the residual mean is based on a projection of the ocean circulation onto its climatological mean seasonal cycle thus both u t and k t are assumed to be periodic functions with a period of δ t 1 year for the particular state estimates we present here the diffusivity tensor is constructed using an isopycnal diffusivity of 1 0 3 m 2 s 1 and a vertical diffusivity of 10 5 m 2 s 1 the sensitivity to this choice is explored briefly in the appendix the isopycnal surfaces were computed using the 2013 world ocean atlas woa2013 monthly mean temperature and salinity boyer et al 2013 in addition the vertical diffusivity is enhanced to a value of 1 m 2 s 1 in a surface mixed layer of thickness h which is prescribed according to the observed monthly mean mixed layer depth climatology de boyer montégut et al 2004 this large value ensures that tracer concentrations are uniform within the surface mixed layer 3 1 space discretization the tracer transport equations are discretized using a staggered arakawa c grid e g haltiner and williams 1980 for the 4 4 horizontal resolution with 24 vertical layers the model has a total of n 45 515 wet grid boxes a discretized tracer field can then be organized into an n 1 column vector c the discretized version of eq 12 can then be expressed in matrix vector form as follows 13 d c d t γ t c s c t where s is an n 1 source vector and γ t is a n n sparse matrix constructed such that the matrix vector product γ c produces the advective diffusive tracer flux divergence in each of the model s wet grid boxes in the construction of γ the diffusive tracer fluxes are discretized using second order centered differences and the advective fluxes are discretized using a quick up scheme that is semi upwind i e the quadratic interpolation is biased towards the upstream direction in the horizontal and quick in the vertical leonard 1979 for the grid box interfaces separating the ocean from the land or atmosphere γ is constructed to satisfy no normal flux conditions 3 2 potential temperature model for the potential temperature equation the source term s appearing in eq 13 consists of a surface heat flux which we model by restoring the temperature in the model s upper most layer to a prescribed surface temperature field θ a t that is periodic in time i e θ a t δ t θ a t with n s wet surface grid boxes s can be expressed in matrix vector form as 14 s 1 τ λ s θ a λ s t c where τ 30 days but see appendix a 2 for sensitivity experiments λ s is an n n s sparse matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere the state vector c is organized such that its first n s elements correspond to the surface values therefore λ s t c produces an n s 1 vector of surface temperatures the superscript t is used to denote the matrix transpose operation the prescribed surface temperature field is constructed using the woa2013 monthly climatology boyer et al 2013 to which we add a small periodic in time correction to account for errors in the climatology i e θ a t θ a woa t δ θ a t the unobserved correction δ θ a will be estimated as part of the bayesian inversion the inclusion of the δ θ a term and the δ s a term described below makes this method of implementing the surface boundary condition distinctly different than the so called robust diagnostic method where the temperature is restored to the uncorrected observations e g sarmiento and bryan 1982 3 3 salinity model for the salinity equation the source term s consists of surface freshwater fluxes which we model by restoring the salinity in the model s upper most layer to a seasonally varying sea surface salinity field s a t that is periodic in time i e s a t δ t s a t the source vector for salinity is thus given by 15 s 1 τ λ s s a λ s t c where τ 30 days is the restoring timescale the prescribed sea surface salinity field is constructed using the woa2013 boyer et al 2013 monthly climatology to which we add a small periodic in time correction to account for errors in the climatology i e s a t s a woa t δ s a t the unobserved correction δ s a will be estimated as part of the bayesian inversion 3 4 natural radiocarbon model for the natural pre bomb radiocarbon model the source function consists of the radioactive decay and air sea gas exchange of 14co 2 which we model simply as 16 s 1 τ λ s 14 c s λ s t c λ c where λ log 2 5730 years is the 14c decay rate 14 c s is the glodap key et al 2004 estimate of the surface δ 14 c concentration prior to the atmospheric bomb tests and τ 30 days because τ λ 1 we are effectively restoring c to 14 c s in the surface layer of the model 3 5 chlorofluorocarbons model chlorofluorocarbons cfcs are transient tracers which were released into the atmosphere starting in 1940 therefore an initial concentration of zero is used for a transient simulation for the period from january 1940 to december 2009 using a one month long time step in the transient simulation we use the atmospheric history of cfc 11 and cfc 12 usgs 2009 interpolated to a time resolution of one month to model the gas exchange flux we use the standard ocmip 2 formulation najjar and orr 1998 as was done for ocim devries 2014 17 s λ k d z 1 c a t m λ s t c where d z 1 36 1 m is the thickness of the model s upper most layer and c a t m is the prescribed atmospheric cfc concentration the gas exchange operator λ k is an n n s sparse matrix with non zero elements on the main diagonal these are given by the piston velocity k scaled using an adjustable parameter α such

also be cyclo stationary with c n 12 c n 3 7 cyclo stationary solutions with a one month time discretization and the euler backward scheme the cyclo stationary tracers potential temperature salinity

cyclo stationary solution to eq 20 by directly inverting b but this is computationally very expensive because of the size of b this prohibitive computational cost is particularly true if we try to decrease the size of the time step to better resolve the seasonal cycle we therefore solve eq 20 using a pre conditioned iterative newton krylov solver without explicitly constructing the b matrix or the source vector on the right hand side e g li and primeau 2008 khatiwala 2008 bardin et al 2014 fu and primeau 2017 in this method we apply the preconditioner to the model state after time stepping the model through one annual period the preconditioner accelerates the convergence of the iterative newton krylov solver but otherwise does not affect the solution for the preconditioner we use the

averaged tracer transport matrix we use the nsoli m newton krylov solver kelley 2013 and obtain fully spun up cyclo stationary solutions with the equivalent of only a few years of simulation typically less than 10 and seldom more than 50 4 bayesian inversion for the adjustable model parameters as presently formulated the model has a suite of adjustable parameters organized into an 980 737 1 vector 22 p z τ e λ z τ e ϕ δ θ a δ s a α t that must be specified for the problem to be well posed we infer the parameter values via a bayesian inversion procedure constrained by tracer observations note that the parameters z τ e λ and z τ e ϕ include the three dimensional field of horizontal eddy stress divergences as well as the correction to the imposed surface wind stress the two contributions cannot be separated by our inversion procedure the parameters δ θ a and δ s a are the corrections to the surface temperature and salinity used to compute the fluxes of heat and freshwater at the air sea interface α is a scalar parameter that scales the prescribed piston velocity for the flux of cfcs through the air sea interface we assign normal probability distributions to the observed tracer concentrations with the mean of the distributions given by the model s simulated concentrations specifically the probability of the tracer data conditioned on the model parameters is given by 23 prob

below the freezing point of seawater i e exp ω ice ϕ t ϕ where ϕ tanh exp t 2 6 c 0 1 c and ω ice 1 0 4 the matrices h i are used to select the grid boxes and months for which we have tracer observations for potential temperature and salinity these matrices are identity matrices because we constrain the model using the gridded climatology of woa2013 but for the other tracers we use bottle measurements from glodapv2 we retained only bottle radiocarbon measurements below 1000 m for which the measured cfc 11 was less than 0 01 pmol kg to prevent any interference with the bomb signal the scaled precision matrices w i are taken to be the sum of two symmetric matrices one of which is positive definite the positive definite matrix is diagonal with entries given by the reciprocals of the variances σ i 2 computed from all the observations available for a given month and grid box for potential temperature salinity and pre bomb radiocarbon and for a particular grid box month and year for the transient cfc 11 and cfc 12 tracers and then divided by the numbers of observations therefore σ i varies in space and time we use the woa13 to estimate the σ i of temperature and salinity and glodapv2 to estimate the σ i of cfcs and radiocarbon the other matrix is given by β i l t l where l is a discretized version of the horizontal laplacian operator in spherical coordinates the laplacian operator is only added for the potential temperature and the salinity terms to take into account the spatially correlated errors introduced by the gridding of those observations the value of β i is given by one over the product of the variance of the calculated σ i 2 we further assume that conditioned on the model all the tracer observations are independent with this assumption we can construct the likelihood function by simply taking the product of the probability densities for each tracer i e 24 prob c i obs i 1 5 p i 1 5 prob c i obs p for the prior probability of p we assume a normal distribution centered at p 0 25 prob p exp 1 2 p t w p p with a prior precision matrix w p taken to be diagonal for the unobserved errors in the wind stress climatology δ τ λ δ τ ϕ and the unresolved eddy stress forcing z τ e λ z τ e ϕ the diagonal of w p is 1 0 1 f 2 n where f is the forcing vector in eq 6 and n is the number of adjustable eddy stress divergence parameters this choice ensures that the large scale momentum balance follows the thermal wind and ekman balances the square of f in this last expressions is applied element wise for the δ θ a and δ s a the diagonal elements are given by the reciprocal of the product of the variance computed from all the observations for a given month and the number of grid boxes in the surface layer of the model we assign no prior constraint on the value of α we further constrained the prior probability density function for the parameters implicitly by assigning a weak prior on the dynamical state of the model i e we assigned a normal distribution centered at zero 26 prob x p exp 1 2 x t w x x where the precision matrix w x is taken to be diagonal the diagonal elements are given by the reciprocal of velocity and dynamic topography variances the horizontal velocity variances start with a value of 1 m s 2 in the top layer of the model and decay exponentially to 0 07 m s 2 at a depth of 4000 m see eq 14 in large et al 2001 this weak constraint is helpful in the early stages of the parameter optimization as it prevents the search algorithm from suggesting parameter values that lead to implausible dynamical states its impact on the ultimate solution is negligible for the vertical velocity we increased the prior precision by a factor of 50 compared to that used by devries 2014 to be consistent with that used in the latest ocim version ocim2 as described in devries and holzer 2019 the increased penalty is necessary to prevent unrealistically large vertical velocities and a noisy meridional overturning circulation with the above choices the posterior probability density function obtained via bayes theorem is 27 prob p c i obs i 1 5 exp 1 2 i 1 5 h i c i c i obs t w i h i c i c i obs 1 2 ω ice ϕ t ϕ 1 2 x t w x x 1 2 p t w p p note that x in this probability density is an implicit function of p the posterior probability density described by eq 27 lives in a 980 737 dimensional space the large dimension of this space makes it impossible to compute or store the posterior covariance matrix of the state estimate we therefore limit ourselves to summarizing the posterior probability density function in terms of the location of its maximum which is equivalent to finding the minimum of the negative logarithm of the posterior probability density function 28 f p f y p p 1 2 i 1 5 h i c i c i obs t w i h i c i c

temperature salinity and radiocarbon solutions with the transient cfc 11 and cfc 12 solutions note that minimizing f p reduces to solving a nonlinear least squares problem it is important to point out that the location of the minimum of the objective function will not change if we add a multiplicative factor to the objective function such a factor will however affect the size of the posterior error bars for our parameter estimates because this scaling factor affects the normalization constant for the posterior probability introducing it also introduces an extra additive term to the objective function that depends on the scaling factor but not on p this means that if we had introduced the scaling factor we would be able to estimate its size by minimizing the resulting objective function with respect to this factor we did not do this here because we are focusing on finding the most probable state estimate however it will be important to estimate this missing scaling factor in the future so that we can obtain consistent posterior error bars for our state estimate we solve the above problem using a quasi newton method following heinkenschloss 2008 we express the gradient of f p

solution to 30 f y y p p t λ p y f y p the great computational advantage of using the last expression in eq 29 rather than the middle line in eq 29 is that it involves solving only one linear system of equations for λ p instead of solving a separate linear system for each of the 980 737 components of p because the linear system involves the transposed jacobian matrix f y y p p t this method is known as the adjoint method e g schlitzer 1993 2007 devries and primeau 2011 the adjoint system 30 and λ p can be partitioned into components which can be solved separately specifically 31 λ p t λ x t λ θ t λ s t λ c 14 t λ cfc 11 t λ cfc 12 t where 32 b n t λ c n λ c n 1 c n f y p for n m m 1 1 for the cases where c n correspond to the transient cfc tracers the system is solved starting with the final condition λ c m 1 0 and time stepped backwards in time from m n yr 12 to m 1 for the cyclo stationary tracers the λ c n are also periodic and solutions are obtained using the same newton krylov method used to find the cyclo stationary state of the tracers except that the transpose of the operators is used in reverse time order and the transpose of the operator in eq 21 is used for the preconditioning we note that in the forward model the state at time step n 1 is completely determined by the state of the model at time step n similarly in the adjoint model the state at time step n is completely determined by the state at time step n 1 because all the solutions obtained using our cyclo stationary solver are perfectly periodic it does not matter at which month we start the integration we always get the same periodic solution for the same forcing having obtained the lagrange multipliers corresponding to the tracer variables the lagrange multipliers corresponding to the model s dynamical state can be obtained by solving for the cyclo stationary state of 33 a t λ x n λ x n 1 f n where the monthly forcing terms are given by 34 f n γ x n λ θ n λ s n λ c 14 n m 1 n yr λ cfc 11 m n λ cfc 12 m n x n f y p for n 1 2 12 where γ x n corresponds to the partial derivative of the tracer transport operator with respect to the dynamical state variable during month n cyclo stationary solutions are obtained using the same newton krylov solver used for the forward model except that the transpose of a is used in the preconditioner and the forcing terms are cycled in time reversed order 4 1 summary of cyclocim data assimilation procedure the cyclocim data assimilation system solves the constrained optimization problem 35 minimize y p f y p such that c y p 0 where f p f y p p is the negative of the logarithm of the posterior probability density prob p d a t a for p see eqs 27 and 28 and c y p 0 denotes the governing equations for the dynamical and tracer states of the model the solution procedure is summarized in fig 1 the iterative procedure consists of repeating five main steps 1 given a current estimate of p solve the cyclo stationary dynamical model to obtain x p i e the seasonally varying residual mean circulation u v w and dynamic topography η 2 solve the transient tracers c cfc 11 and c cfc 12 and the cyclo stationary tracers potential temperature salinity and natural radiocarbon θ s and c 14 using the sparse matrix tracer transport operators constructed using the current estimate of x 3 evaluate the objective function for the given p that is the posterior probability density function prob p d a t a as given in eq 27 evaluating f p as given in eq 28 is equivalent to evaluating eq 27 because the logarithm function is a monotonically increasing function 4 compute the gradient of the objective function p f p and check if the minimum has been reached 5 use a quasi newton search algorithm and p f p to produce an improved more probable estimate of p the data assimilation procedure we use is equivalent to what is sometimes called a 4 d variational assimilation system except that the time dependent part of the procedure is restricted to be periodic for the circulation and the non transient tracers 5 results we conducted state estimates for a version of cyclocim with a resolution of 8 8 22 layers and 4 4 24 layers the optimization for a version of cyclocim with the standard ocim resolution of 2 2 24 layers is underway but the optimal solution has not yet been found we stop the iteration when the cost function changes by less than 1 per 1000 iteration note that for the 8 8 and 4 4 versions of cyclocim we prescribed a maximum number of iterations but we checked that the above stopping criteria was met for the solutions we present here our goal is to present the higher resolution solution in a separate paper that can focus on the state estimate rather than the technical aspects of the assimilation which is the main focus of the present report the evolution of the objective function for the 8 8 22 model for the 10 000 iterations is shown in fig 2 the objective function starts at a value of approximately 1 0 4 after 10 000 iterations the objective function has decreased to a value of less than 5 4 the drop is fastest for the first 2000 iterations and the rate of decrease slows down afterwards while the rate of decrease is modest in the last 1000 iterations f p is still decreasing monotonically however the changes in the resulting state estimate are rather modest for the version of cyclocim with a 4 4 24 layers resolution which we present in the next section we performed approximately 4 1 0 3 iterations but we restarted the optimization along the way because we did not include all the tracer constraints at the beginning the magnitude of the estimated eddy stress divergence terms which also includes effects due to the missing nonlinear terms and discretization errors is comparable to the magnitude of the error terms from the original steady state ocim model devries and primeau 2011 the horizontally averaged magnitude of the vertical divergence of the eddy stresses is 1 2 1 0 6 m s 2 the magnitude of these parameterized forcing terms are only modestly dependent on the model resolution i e 8 8 4 4 or 2 2 for comparison the explicit forcing appearing on the right hand side of the horizontal momentum equation has a typical horizontally averaged magnitude that is about a factor of three bigger this suggests that the non parameterized large scale momentum balance dominates over the parameterized eddy stresses and confirms that the relative weights we have assigned to the likelihood and prior in our probability model provide an acceptable initial estimate further refinements might be necessary if the goal is to interpret the resulting eddy stress terms physically 5 1 comparison of assimilated variables with observations we begin by comparing each modeled tracer with the observations that were used to constrain the model in figs 3 7 we perform the comparison on the model s 4 4 grid it is therefore important to keep in mind that any variance in the data associated with sharp gradients that cannot be resolved by this coarse mesh will necessarily be ignored in the comparison a summary of the model fit to the data is provided in fig 3 where we show the joint cumulative distribution functions for the observed and modeled tracer variables for all tracers more than 90 of the ocean volume has concentrations that cluster tightly along the 1 1 line with r 2 0 99 for potential temperature and r 2 0 96 for the other tracers the close agreement between the modeled and observed tracers suggests that the cyclocim circulation can be used to produce meaningful estimates of the climatological water mass formation rates and transport for the real ocean which is not always possible when analyzing free running prognostic models in fig 4 the globally averaged root mean square errors rmse for the potential temperature salinity and cfc 11 from cyclocim are compared to the corresponding rmses for the ocim ctrl state estimate devries 2014 by resolving the seasonal cycle cyclocim provides a better fit to the observations at mid to high latitudes in the surface mixed layer and seasonal thermocline for the deep ocean below 500 m where seasonality is negligible the rmse is similar for both state estimates the globally averaged rmse of potential temperature for cyclocim is 0 29 c whereas for ocim it is 0 38 c for the near surface waters 0 200 m the decrease in the rmse is significantly larger 0 70 c for cyclocim versus 1 27 c for ocim most of the improvements occur in mid latitudes fig 5 where the mixed layer depths have a pronounced seasonal variation for example the cold bias of more than 3 c to the north of the kuroshio extension in the ocim state estimate is substantially decreased in the cyclocim state estimate similarly the low latitude warm bias in the ocim state estimate has been eliminated in the cyclocim state estimate consistent with the results of yu and malanotte rizzoli 1998 resolving the seasonal variations produces a significantly improved estimate of the climatological circulation the ability of the model to capture the correct seasonal cycle is illustrated in fig 6 in which we compare the potential temperature anomalies plotted as departure from the annual average along 36 s for cyclocim and the woa2013 observations boyer et al 2013 the modeled potential temperature shows a similar seasonal pattern as the observations in the summer djf the mixed layer is shallow and there is a strong temperature gradient near the surface the mixed layer deepens through the fall mam and winter jja becoming thickest in late winter when the surface stratification entirely disappears in spring son as winds weaken and solar irradiance increases the mixed layer shoals once again the model seasonality is quite similar to that of the observations exceptions are along the western boundary currents where the warm and cold anomalies penetrate deeper in the observations than in the model such errors are not surprising given the coarseness of the model resolution we anticipate that these errors will be reduced in the 2 2 cyclocim and by including the dynamic topography constraints from satellite altimeter data there are also significant improvements in the cyclocim simulated surface salinity fields as can be seen from fig 7 where we plot the errors averaged over the top 200 m of the water column most prominently large errors in the western part of the subpolar gyre in the north atlantic ocean present in the steady ocim state estimate are greatly reduced in the seasonally varying cyclocim state estimate a similar positive bias in the southern ocean for the steady ocim state estimate has been completely eliminated in the cyclocim state estimate improvements extend over most of the ocean with the exception of the arctic basin where a uniformly positive salinity bias in ocim has been replaced by errors that appear more random the globally averaged rmse for salinity in the upper 200 m of the water column is reduced from 0 25 g kg for ocim to 0 11 g kg for cyclocim for the full water column the improvements are more modest but still appreciable with rmse reduced from 0 07 g kg for ocim to 0 04 g kg for cyclocim the cyclocim simulation of cfc 11 also provides a better fit to the observed cfc 11 data the sensitivity of the fit to the scaling parameter for the piston velocity is discussed in appendix a 3 the rmse for surface waters between 0 and 200 m is 0 07 pmol kg for the ocim state estimate whereas for cyclocim it is 0 04 pmol kg in fig 8 we plot the decadal mean zonal averages of cfc 11 and cfc 12 concentrations the zonal averages are calculated using a volume weighted average of the cfc concentrations for gridboxes with at least one cfc measurement at any depth and longitude during the particular decade the agreement between cyclocim and the observations is generally good there are however clear decadal biases at high latitudes in the southern ocean south of 60 s the model concentrations are several standard deviations too low for the 1980 1989 and the 2000 2009 period while being in very good agreement for the 1990 1999 period in the north there are similar low biases but the exact latitude band with the largest biases appear to shift from decade to decade decadal variability in the ventilation of the ocean provides a plausible explanation for these errors e g waugh et al 2013 devries et al 2017 the cyclocim fit to the pre bomb radiocarbon is also very good fig 9 compares the zonally averaged cyclocim simulated radiocarbon to the glodapv2 data olsen et al 2016 the zonal averages are calculated using a volume weighted average using only grid boxes below 1000 m with cfc 11 concentrations below 0 01 pmol kg the good agreement between cyclocim and the glodapv2 radiocarbon at all latitudes and in all basins suggests that the deep ocean ventilation timescales in cyclocim are comparable to those of the real ocean 5 2 meridional overturning circulation the climatological mean meridional overturning circulation moc is defined as the stream function for the zonally integrated meridional volume transport with depth fig 10 a c shows the implied stream function for cyclocim in the southern ocean pacific ocean and atlantic ocean the estimated overturning circulation appears consistent with typical results from inverse models lumpkin and speer 2007 devries and primeau 2011 devries and holzer 2019 cessi 2019 the maximum of the stream function is approximately 30 sv in the southern ocean 60 s 22 sv in the northern atlantic and 8 sv across the equator in the deep pacific ocean 5 3 inferred air sea fluxes and meridional transport of heat and freshwater in contrast to the ocim state estimate we did not use the heat and freshwater reanalysis fluxes to constrain the cyclocim state estimate it is therefore interesting to examine how the inferred meridional heat and freshwater transports compare to other data based estimates fig 11 shows the seasonally averaged surface heat flux during june to august the ocean gains heat in the northern hemisphere and loses it in the southern hemisphere while the reverse is true in the december to february months the shoulder seasons march may and september november have more muted air sea heat flux patterns with the ocean generally gaining heat at low latitudes and losing heat at high latitudes in fig 12 a we show the annually average cyclocim estimate of the air sea heat flux the ocean gains heat in the east pacific cold tongue region and along the eastern boundaries of the pacific and atlantic with magnitude around 150 w m 2 heat gained in the tropical regions is transported poleward and is lost in higher latitudes in fig 12 b we compare the mean meridional transport computed from the cyclocim state estimate to estimates from the core v2 reanalysis large and yeager 2009 from ocim ctrl devries 2014 and from a not fully converged estimate using a version of cyclocim with a horizontal resolution of 2 2 cylcocim2x2 before discussing these results we hasten to point out that as presently configured the model shows great sensitivity to the choice of restoring timescale τ used in the surface boundary condition for heat and freshwater see appendix a 2 the cyclocim meridional heat transport peaks near 20 n with a value of 2 pw and near 20 s with a value of 1 pw the meridional heat transports for cyclocim2x2 and ocim also peak near 20 n but with weaker values of 1 2 1 5 pw respectively and at 15 s with a consistent value of approximately 1 pw in the southern hemisphere there is a general agreement between ocim cyclocim and cyclocim2x2 which in turn predict a significantly larger poleward heat transport than core v2 the larger poleward heat transport in southern hemisphere is also consistent with the ecco estimate forget and ferreira 2019 and from the atmospheric reanalyses trenberth and fasullo 2017 in the northern hemisphere south of 50 n the core v2 meridional heat transport tends to be smaller than that of cyclocim but larger than that of ocim and cyclocim2x2 northward of 50 n cyclocim predicts a significantly smaller poleward heat transport than either core v2 ocim cyclocim2x2 the air sea heat fluxes in the kuroshio and gulf stream regions for the cyclocim state estimate are substantially weaker than those for the core v2 reanalysis not shown the annually averaged heat loss to the atmosphere in the gulf stream region as estimated from cyclocim is around 50 w m 2 while in the labrador sea the annually averaged heat loss is greater than 300 w m 2 such a large heat loss to the atmosphere would suggest a large meridional heat transport to the north of 50 n yet the cyclocim estimate appears to be substantially weaker than either the core v2 ocim or cylcocim2x2 estimates this apparent inconsistency can be explained by the fact that cyclcocim produces an unrealistic southward heat transport near 50 n in the pacific basin which more than compensates for the unrealistically large northward heat transport in the atlantic basin the cylcocim2x2 estimate does not appear to produce the unrealistic southward heat transport in the pacific basin which is encouraging but it does point to the sensitivity of the inferred pattern of air sea heat fluxes to the horizontal resolution of the model in addition to a strong sensitivity to the choice of restoring time scale used in the surface boundary condition for temperature and salinity the implied annually averaged freshwater fluxes fig 12 c show a pattern that is similar to the core v2 reanalysis data not shown large and yeager 2009 there is net evaporation in the subtropical gyres and net precipitation in the intertropical convergence zone itcz and the sub polar regions however cyclocim predicts weak precipitation minus evaporation in the itcz with a magnitude around 1 m year and strong precipitation minus evaporation in the gulf stream region and labrador sea with magnitude more than 3 m year in the corev2 reanalysis there is 1 5 m year of precipitation minus evaporation in the itcz and 1 m year of precipitation minus evaporation in the gulf stream region and labrador sea fig 12 d compares the meridional freshwater transport estimate from cyclocim cyclocim2x2 to those of core v2 and ocim the largest disagreement is in the northern hemisphere between the equator and 40 n where cyclocim predicts a strong southward freshwater transport whereas both ocim and the core v2 estimates show a northward transport between 5 n and 20 n and a substantially weaker southward transport than cyclocim between 20 n and 40 n the cyclocim2x2 estimate is generally closer to the ocim and core v2 estimates implying again that the surface flux patterns are quite sensitive to the horizontal resolution of the model the differences between the core v2 reanalysis and the cyclocim inferred meridional heat and freshwater transport suggest that in future inversions we might obtain improved state estimates by including atmospheric reanalysis constraints in the probability model as we did previously for ocim on the other hand cyclocim2x2 produces reasonable first order estimate of the meridional transports of heat and freshwater that are independent of atmospheric reanalyses without a more thorough uncertainty analysis it is difficult to unequivocally select one estimate over another as being more representative of the true climatological meridional transports such an uncertainty analysis is planned for the 2 2 version of cyclocim 6 summary and discussion we have presented the formulation of a 4 d variational assimilation system for estimating the climatological mean seasonal cycle of the residual mean ocean circulation the system which we call cyclocim assimilates monthly mean potential temperature and salinity data from the woa2013 transient cfc 11 and cfc 12 data from the glodapv2 database and natural radiocarbon measurements for the deep ocean from the glodapv2 database we have demonstrated that our data constrained model produces a plausible overturning circulation while the meridional heat and freshwater transports are quite sensitive to the model s horizontal resolution the 2 2 version of cyclocim produces estimates that are in rough agreement with existing estimates even though the objective function did not explicitly include such constraints by resolving the seasonal cycle we are able to produce a much better fit to observations in the upper ocean compared to our previous steady state ocim estimates and most of the assimilated variables are in agreement with the observational constraints one exception is the cfc 11 and cfc 12 tracers in the antarctic region of the southern ocean where cyclocim concentrations are too low decadal variability in the ventilation of the ocean provides a plausible explanation for these errors e g waugh et al 2013 devries et al 2017 the main product of our assimilation system is a set of 12 monthly data constrained tracer transport operators for the climatological annual cycle of the ocean circulation we anticipate that these operators will be particularly useful for global biogeochemical inversions for which there is a need for reliable estimates of the seasonally varying climatological transport of tracers we focused on the estimate produced using cyclocim with a 4 4 resolution but we are presently completing the optimization for the 2 2 version of the model for expediency we also ignored valuable constraints on the dynamic topography of the model provided by satellite altimeter data we plan on including this constraint in future versions of cyclocim another avenue for future work is to produce an ensemble of tracer transport operators drawn from the bayesian posterior distribution for the eddy stresses and surface forcing so far we have only determined the maximum of the posterior distribution but the development of a computationally efficient means of drawing samples from the posterior should be a high priority for future work so that realistic error estimates can be provided in principle cyclocim could also be used to estimate the eddy stresses as was done in the work of ferreira et al 2005 however as presently formulated the tracer transport errors due to the coarse space and time resolution of the model get partially corrected via adjustments of the eddy stress terms this makes the eddy stress terms noisy and difficult to interpret it might also be necessary to replace the rayleigh drag in the momentum equation with a laplacian viscosity as was done in the original ocim devries and primeau 2011 but subsequently replaced with the computationally more efficient from rayleigh drag devries 2014 for our present goal of generating high fidelity tracer transport operators our inability to separate physical eddy stress from noise is not a major problem but if the goal is to study the eddy stresses it will be important to separate these two contributions to the eddy stress control variables in the model credit authorship contribution

experiments a 1 diffusivity we have conducted three experiments similar to those presented by devries and holzer 2019 for ocim one with the isopycnal diffusivity set to 2000 m 2 s highiso one with isopycnal diffusivity set to 600 m 2 s lowiso and one with high diapycnal diffusivity highdia which increases from 10 5 m 2 s at the surface to 3 4 m 2 s at 5400 m each experiment starts with the optimal solution from the standard cyclocim configuration and then run for 2000 iterations fig a 13 shows that the mean meridional overturning circulation in highiso and highdia experiments are stronger than cyclocim fig 10 whereas lowiso produces a weaker overturning circulation a 2 restoring timescale cyclocim used a surface restoring timescale of τ 30 days for computing the surface fluxes of heat and freshwater see eqs 14 16 we conducted two sensitivity experiments in which we halved and doubled the surface restoring time τ 15 days and τ 60 days each sensitivity experiment started with the optimal parameters estimated from the standard cyclocim configuration and was run for an additional 1500 iterations the inferred heat and freshwater transports are shown in fig a 14 the experiments show that the implied meridional transports are quite sensitive to the choice of τ this sensitivity suggests that in future work we will need to include the additional constraint on the surface fluxes of heat and freshwater from atmospheric reanalysis as we did previously for ocim devries and primeau 2011 this sensitivity might also be due to the absence of a constraint on the dynamic topography from altimeter data which was included in our previous state estimate using ocim a 3 parameter α the optimal value of α used to scale the piston velocity in the air sea gas exchange was 0 14 cm h m s 2 a value that is significantly smaller than the value of 0 251 cm h m s 2 estimated by wanninkhof 2014 for climatological winds we therefore calculated the contribution to the objective function f ˆ eq 28 from cfc 11 and cfc 12 misfits as a function of α the sensitivity shown in fig a 15 is performed holding all the other control parameters fixed at their optimized value taken at face value these results suggest that cyclocim can provide a strong lower bound on α but only a weak upper bound any firm conclusion must await a more fully vetted state estimate which is beyond the scope of the present article 
23924,short waves are of key importance for nearshore dynamics particularly under storms where they contribute to extreme water levels and drive large morphological changes therefore it is crucial to model accurately the propagation and dissipation of storm waves in the nearshore area in this paper field observations collected in contrasted environments and conditions are combined with predictions from a third generation spectral wave model to evaluate four formulations of wave energy dissipation by depth induced breaking the results reveal a substantial over dissipation of incident wave energy occurring over the continental shelf resulting in a negative bias on significant wave height reaching up to 50 to overcome this problem a breaking coefficient dependent of the local bottom slope is introduced within depth induced breaking models in order to account for the varying degrees of saturation naturally found in breaking and broken waves this approach strongly reduces the negative bias observed in the shoreface compared to default parameterizations yielding significant improvements in the prediction of storm waves among the implications of this study our new parameterization of the breaking coefficient results in systematically increased predictions of the wave setup near the shoreline compared to the default parameterization this increase reaches a factor 2 for gently sloping beaches keywords spectral wave models depth induced breaking storm waves wave setup 1 introduction as storm waves contribute to extreme water levels dodet et al 2019 and drive large morphological changes wright and short 1984 coco et al 2014 castelle et al 2015 they are of paramount importance for coastal hazards in a context of sea level rise associated with climate change and a continuous increase of coastal populations neumann et al 2015 it is essential to model accurately the propagation transformation and dissipation of wind generated surface gravity waves hereafter short waves in the nearshore area in particular during storms regional applications of fully coupled ocean circulation and spectral wave numerical models have become widespread for all types of applications ranging from operational predictions to engineering or research purposes e g bidlot et al 2002 boudière et al 2013 guérin et al 2018 however the ability of these models to accurately simulate wave induced hydrodynamics during storms in the nearshore area remains uncertain which is partly explained by the scarcity of field observations required to verify numerical models especially in the surf zone in deep water the parameterizations of the physical processes contributing to wave generation by the wind and its subsequent propagation and transformation have benefited from decades of theoretical and practical developments e g hasselmann 1962 hasselmann and hasselmann 1985 the wamdi group 1988 cavaleri et al 2007 ardhuin et al 2010 and many others in the nearshore area dominant processes such as the adiabatic triad interactions and the dissipation due to depth induced wave breaking remain heavily parameterized in such models to the point that the current solutions are sometimes referred to as engineering solutions e g see cavaleri et al 2007 for a relatively recent review on spectral wave models and the parameterization of the different physical processes involved alternatively modelling chains that combine phase averaged model forcing local phase resolving models over a specific area e g see postacchini et al 2019 permit to describe the key processes associated with wave transformation in the nearshore while requiring little parameterizations however such application remains possible only locally as it is quite computationally expensive which prohibits this approach for operational applications at the regional scale close to shore short waves undergo complex transformations and dissipate their energy mostly through depth induced breaking in the absence of universal consensus on the criteria for wave breaking and on the spectral distribution of energy dissipation it is more convenient to model the macroscale effects in terms of the averaged loss of energy several formulations have been proposed in the literature to compute the average energy dissipation rate in a rayleigh distributed wave field based on the cross shore conservation of the bulk wave energy flux many of these formulations have subsequently been adapted to compute a corresponding source term for spectral modelling purposes the underlying approach of depth induced breaking models follows the seminal work of le mehauté 1962 in which the dissipation rate of a breaking or broken wave hereafter referred to as a breaker is approximated by that of a hydraulic jump of equivalent height bore based model the average energy dissipation rate is obtained by applying the dissipation rate of a breaker to the fraction of breaking or broken waves in the original wave field therefore the average energy dissipation rate is controlled by the computation of the fraction of breaking waves hereinafter q b and a breaking coefficient which is related to the degree of saturation of the breaker and hence controls its energy dissipation rate mostly the different models differ in the formulation of q b and numerous studies further aimed at improving the parameterization of q b through ad hoc scalings with the local bed slope and or local wave characteristics e g see salmon et al 2015 however the performance of these scalings remain uncertain at other sites especially under storm waves and admittedly lack physical grounds in contrast the breaking coefficient has received much less attention in such modelling approach it is generally kept constant in both time and space and is seen as a calibration factor in contrast with these class of depth induced breaking models it is worth noting that an alternative approach was proposed by filipot and ardhuin 2012 these authors introduced a unified formulation for wave breaking from deep ocean up to the inner surf zone in which a dissipation term is computed for each wave scale based on the decomposition of the frequency spectrum introduced by filipot et al 2010 although this formulation brought interesting insights and showed comparable predictive skills to those specific to deep or shallow water environments it remains scarcely used especially in studies related to coastal applications this study provides a critical and objective assessment of four specialized depth induced breaking models which rely on state of the art formulations of the fraction of breaking waves these models are implemented within the spectral model wwm iii roland et al 2012 fully coupled with a 2dh configuration of the circulation model schism zhang et al 2016 the model performances are assessed at two contrasting sites under high energy conditions the results with the default parameterizations show a systematic over dissipation of the incident wave energy over the inner continental shelf especially in high energy conditions in order to address the inherent limitations of the default parameterizations of these models which typically consider breakers as fully saturated bores a new parameterization of the breaking coefficient is introduced based on le méhauté s original work le mehauté 1962 the manuscript is organized as follows the theoretical background on depth induced breaking modelling in parametric models and its application to phase averaged models is reviewed in section 2 the two study cases and the model implementation are presented in section 3 in section 4 the different depth induced breaking formulations with their default parameterizations are firstly tested highlighting their poor predictive skills under high energy conditions then the performances of the adaptive parameterization of the breaking coefficient within the four models are assessed at the two sites considered here the results of this study and their implications are discussed in section 5 before the concluding remarks are provided in section 6 2 theoretical background 2 1 energy dissipation rate of a broken wave the analogy between turbulent bores hydraulic jumps and individual breakers is often used to compute the associated energy dissipation rate per unit span d e g see lubin and chanson 2017 for a recent review on these non linear processes and their similitude the expression for the energy dissipation rate per unit span by a bore d b o r e is given by stoker 1957 1 d b o r e ρ g q h 0 h 1 3 4 h 1 h 0 ρ g 4 g h 0 h 1 2 h 1 h 0 h 0 h 1 3 where ρ is the water density g is the gravitational acceleration q is the discharge in m 2 s and h 0 h 1 are the local water heights upstream and downstream of the discontinuity respectively le mehauté 1962 formulated an analogous expression for breakers denoted with the subscript w b by using the discharge given by solitary wave theory this author further introduced a breaking coefficient here denoted by δ l m which is closely related to the fraction of the active breaking region over the whole wave face in order to express the energy dissipation rate by a breaker of height h d l m 2 d l m δ l m d w b δ l m 1 corresponds to a saturated breaker where the active breaking region extends over the whole wave face while δ l m 0 corresponds to situations without breaking le mehauté 1962 as h 0 and h 1 are a priori not known in statistical or phase averaged numerical models it is convenient to use the following approximations introduced by battjes and janssen 1978 3 h 0 h 1 h g h 1 h 0 2 h 1 h 0 g h where h is the mean water depth when replaced in eq 1 these approximations allow to estimate the energy dissipation rate per unit span by a breaker of height h as 4 d b j 78 1 4 ρ g h 3 g h α 4 ρ g h 3 g h where α is a tuning coefficient of the order of 1 battjes and janssen 1978 in order to account for the differences in various breaker types and variability in the breaking regime saturated non saturated thornton and guza 1983 proposed the following alternative expression 5 d t g 83 1 4 ρ g b h 3 g h considering the above formulations and approximations used it is clear that both α and b hereafter referred to as breaking coefficient are related to the degree of saturation of the breaker on the basis of this assessment and considering le méhauté s analytical developments the following expression is introduced as an alternative to eqs 4 and 5 see appendix for the derivation 6 d n e w b 4 ρ g h 3 g h with b 40 tan β where tan β is the local bottom slope this new formulation incorporates the effect of the bottom slope on the local rate of energy dissipation in a breaker an illustrative evidence of such dependency can be found in martins et al 2018 who performed high resolution measurements of broken waves propagating in the inner surf zone with a lidar scanner see their fig 3 extracting the breaker properties height roller angle and length one can notice that beach slope variations yield changes in roller geometrical properties which subsequently control the rate at which the energy is dissipated furthermore this parameterization is consistent with the bottom slope dependency of the parameter α discussed by hamm 1995 although b can theoretically grow to infinite it is physically bound to 0 1 which means that the breaker saturation is reached over slopes equal to or steeper than 1 40 2 2 total energy dissipation rate of random breaking waves the original approach to model the transformation of random waves in the nearshore typically assumes the wave field to be rayleigh distributed and narrow banded in both frequency and direction as only bulk parameters are simulated the representative period remains constant over space with this approach on sandy shores the cross shore evolution of the wave energy flux is principally controlled by the depth induced breaking intensity given by the local mean period averaged rate of energy dissipation per unit area of breaking or broken waves d b r this term is computed by dividing the energy dissipation rate per unit span by a breaker e g eqs 4 5 or 6 by a representative shallow water wave length λ g h f where f is a representative frequency of the energy spectrum applied to the fraction of breaking and broken waves of the original wave field 2 2 1 battjes and janssen 1978 model bj78 battjes and janssen 1978 assumed that the height of all breakers equals a local maximum possible wave height h m estimated by means of a parameterized miche type criterion 7 h m 0 88 k tanh γ k h 0 88 where k is the wavenumber and γ is the breaking index an adjustable coefficient to allow for effects of bottom slope compared to the theoretical value of 0 88 given by the miche criterion derived for a flat bottom miche 1944 in shallow water k h 1 eq 7 reduces to 8 h m γ h as a result the rayleigh s probability density function of wave heights is clipped at h h m with a delta function according to their analytical developments the fraction of breaking waves q b is consequently computed by means of 9 1 q b ln q b h r m s h m 2 where h r m s is the root mean square wave height assuming h m h o 1 where the dissipation occurs the local mean rate of energy dissipation per unit area finally reads 10 d b r b j 78 α 4 ρ g f m e a n q b h m 2 where f m e a n is a mean frequency which is typically computed from the t m 0 1 wave period defined as m 0 m 1 see eq 23 in section 3 1 3 battjes and stive 1985 performed an extensive calibration and verification of this model using a variety of experimental and field observations although the original model was developed using a mean frequency it should be pointed out that these authors used the peak frequency f p instead of f m e a n in eq 10 with the calibration coefficient α kept at 1 the values for the breaking index γ ranged from 0 60 to 0 83 with an average of 0 73 in the original paper battjes and janssen 1978 used γ 0 8 and α 1 from these results battjes and stive 1985 found a relation between γ and the offshore wave steepness s o which was later adjusted by nairn 1990 11 γ 0 39 0 56 tanh 33 s o with s o h r m s o λ o h r m s o 2 π f p 2 g 2 2 2 thornton and guza 1983 model tg83 based on their field observations thornton and guza 1983 suggested that the wave field was also rayleigh distributed in the surf zone these authors expressed the distribution of breaking wave heights p b h as a weighting of the rayleigh probability density function for all wave heights p h by means of a function w h such that 12 q b 0 p b h d h 0 w h p h d h the total energy dissipation is obtained by integrating the energy dissipation for a single broken wave of height h eq 5 multiplied by p b h thornton and guza 1983 this reads 13 d b r t g 83 0 f p g h d t g 83 w h p h d h b 3 4 ρ g f p h 0 h 3 w h p h d h two expressions for the weight function were proposed in terms of the ratio h r m s h to fit the observed fraction of breaking waves from a field campaign conducted at soldiers beach california thornton and guza 1983 this follows thornton and guza 1982 who showed the depth limited character of inner surf zone waves and found a linear relationship between h r m s and h for brevity the single expression introduced by battjes and janssen 2009 is used 14 w t g 83 i h 1 exp h γ t g h 2 i h r m s γ t g h n i for i 0 w t g 83 0 is independent of the wave height whereas for i 1 the distribution of broken waves is skewed towards the largest waves i e they are more likely to break the coefficient γ t g is set to 0 42 according to thornton and guza 1982 whereas depending on the weight function used the most accurate description of the distribution of breaking waves was obtained using n 0 4 or n 1 2 substituting eq 14 for i 0 1 in eq 13 yields 15 d b r t g 83 i 3 π 16 b 3 f p ρ g h r m s 3 h 1 1 h r m s γ t g h 2 5 2 i h r m s γ t g h n i the model has only one adjustable parameter b introduced in eq 5 whose optimal values ranged from 0 8 to 1 7 depending on the dataset whether field or lab based observations and the weight function thornton and guza 1983 considering that the coefficient is used at power 3 it is worth noting that the resulting value for d b r t g 83 can vary by up to a factor 10 2 2 3 baldock et al 1998 model b98 the model originally proposed by baldock et al 1998 borrows from bj78 and tg83 models it uses a heavyside step function shifted in h m to weigh the rayleigh s probability density function janssen and battjes 2007 reported an inconsistency in the original analytical developments and proposed a corrected expression for the local mean rate of energy dissipation per unit area which reads 16 d b r b 98 3 π 16 α f p ρ g h r m s 3 h 1 4 3 π r 3 3 r 2 exp r 2 erf r where r h m h r m s erf is the error function and h m is computed according to eq 8 the formulation based on the offshore wave steepness eq 11 was used in both papers to compute γ 2 3 recent developments on the parameterization of q b 2 3 1 alternative parameterizations of the breaking index a dependency of the breaking index to the local non dimensional depth was investigated by ruessink et al 2003 who introduced a parameterization of γ which linearly increases with the local non dimensional depth based on the peak period k p h 17 γ 0 76 k p h 0 29 this parameterization is based on the calibration through an inverse modelling approach of a 1d cross shore bulk wave model in which depth induced breaking is modelled according to baldock s original formulation baldock et al 1998 this parameterization of the breaking index has been implemented within spectral models yielding a substantial improvement in model results van der westhuysen 2010 more recently alternative parameterizations of the breaking index with both local bottom slope and non dimensional depth were proposed salmon et al 2015 lin and sheng 2017 with a calibration performed with spectral models against extensive datasets these parameterizations follow earlier experimental studies in which the dependency of the wave height over depth ratio in the inner surf zone to these two parameters was already pointed out raubenheimer et al 1996 sénéchal et al 2001 2 3 2 westhuysen 2010 model w10 van der westhuysen 2010 further investigated breaker index parameterization based on wavefield nonlinearity and introduced an alternative parameterization of q b which relies on the biphase β i a third order quantity that informs on the phase coupling between triads and is thus related to the wave skewness and asymmetry e g see hasselmann et al 1963 elgar and guza 1985 as spectral wave models do not represent quantities at this order β i is generally approximated from a linear estimate of the ursell number u r eldeberky 1997 doering and bowen 1995 following the approach of thornton and guza 1983 the following expression for the weight function w was proposed 18 w w 10 h β i β i r e f n with β i π 2 π 2 tanh δ u r where δ 0 2 according to eldeberky 1997 and u r is computed with its bulk formulation 19 u r g 8 2 π 2 h m 0 t m 0 1 2 h 2 by construction when β i 0 i e waves are symmetric along the vertical axis the percent of broken waves equals zero when β i tends to π 2 waves become more asymmetric i e pitched forward e g see elgar and guza 1985 and the percent of broken waves increases however as all waves tend to break before the limit is reached a scaled limit β i r e f was introduced in the expression of the weighting function in the study by van der westhuysen 2010 the coefficients β i r e f and n were respectively set to 4 π 9 and 2 5 in order to fit the observed fraction of breakers in the lab experiment of boers 1996 using eq 5 the local mean rate of energy dissipation per unit area is finally given by 20 d b r w 10 3 π 16 b 3 ρ g f m e a n h β i β i r e f n h r m s 3 where f m e a n is the mean frequency computed from the t m 0 1 wave period as for the tg83 model b is the only adjustable parameters according to van der westhuysen 2010 it resulted from calibrations that the value of b varied over the range 0 5 to 1 5 2 4 depth induced breaking in spectral models spectral wave models are based on a decomposition of the sea surface elevation in a sum of linear components across relative angular frequencies σ and directions θ these models solve a balance equation for the wave action density spectrum n which is related to the wave energy density spectrum e by n e σ e g see komen et al 1994 21 n t x c g u n σ n σ θ n θ s t o t the left hand side of eq 21 contains the change of wave action in time the advection in the geographical space at a velocity given by the intrinsic group speed vector c g plus an advective current velocity vector u for each spectral component which theoretically depends on the current profile andrews and mcintyre 1978 and on the amplitude of all waves components willebrand 1975 in practice these latter effects are often neglected such that within numerical models u is generally taken as the surface current velocity vector or for coastal applications the depth averaged current cavaleri et al 2007 in wwm iii u is approximated to be the surface current velocity vector roland et al 2012 the last two terms correspond to the advection in spectral space where σ and θ are the propagation velocities in frequencies and directions respectively the evolution of the action spectrum due to a variety of physical phenomena is represented through source terms summed in the right hand side of eq 21 in deep water wind driven wave growth s i n dissipation by whitecapping s d s and non linear quadruplet interactions s n l 4 are the dominant processes transforming the wave field in shallow water three additional processes are considered namely the bottom friction s b f non linear interactions between triads s n l 3 and depth induced breaking s b r the main approach to compute the depth induced breaking source term follows the work of eldeberky and battjes 1996 in which the local mean rate of energy dissipation is distributed over frequencies and directions in proportion to the spectral action density 22 s b r d b r e t o t n where e t o t ρ g σ θ e d σ d θ consequently the aforementioned formulations of the local mean rate of energy dissipation per unit area could be introduced into spectral models it is worth noting that for the bj78 and b98 original models the parameterizations of the breaking index based on offshore wave parameters eq 11 see also apotsos et al 2008 who proposed a parameterization with the offshore significant wave height are not convenient for spectral models applied at regional scale this contrasts with one dimensional smaller scale models based on the cross shore balance of the wave energy flux and which obtained satisfactory results with such parameterizations following the approach of the swan group booij et al 1999 a constant value of γ 0 73 consistent with the results of battjes and stive 1985 is usually used to compute h m by means of eq 8 3 methods the present study is supported with field measurements from two study areas the oléron island france and duck north carolina this section presents the two study cases underlying their contrasting features the model implementation and the result assessment methodology are subsequently described 3 1 study cases 3 1 1 oléron 2010 o10 the first study area is located along the south west coast of the oléron island in the central part of the french atlantic coast see fig 1a this area is characterized by a very gently sloping shoreface where the bottom slope is of the order of 1 1000 and a non barred dissipative beach where bottom slope approximately reaches 1 100 fig 1c tides are semi diurnal and range from 1 5m during neap tides to 5 5m during spring tides which corresponds to a macrotidal regime dodet et al 2019 recently analysed wave regimes along the 30m isobath of the french metropolitan coast in this area the yearly mean wave conditions reported are characterized by a significant wave height of 1 6m a mean wave period of 5 9s and a direction of 285 from the true north this case study is supported by observations from a field campaign carried out by the french hydrographic and oceanographic office in february 2010 during the studied period offshore waves were characterized by a significant wave height reaching 9 5m at biscay buoy location which corresponds to a yearly return period nicolae lerma et al 2015 while the local wave growth in the nearshore area is negligible due to weak local wind the dataset includes data from a datawell buoy dw and two pressure sensors vec and p3 mounted on a structure dropped on the seabed see fig 1b c for their respective location the dw wave bulk parameters at the peak of the storm are given in table 1 3 1 2 duck 2016 d16 the second study area is located on the shoreface surrounding the field research facility frf near duck nc see fig 2a the frf is maintained by the u s army corps of engineers and has focused for many decades the effort of the coastal researcher s community through major field campaigns in particular as topographic surveys are being performed regularly and nearshore current wave and water level data are continuously collected and available to the community this site often serves as a benchmark for numerical models around the frf the bottom topography is quite alongshore uniform fig 2b and is characterized by a steep foreshore generally flanked by a flat terrace sandbar system o 100m in length e g see gallagher et al 1998 beyond which the slope is gentle and decreases monotonically from 1 200 to 1 1000 fig 2c as large morphological changes of the sandbar take place under storm waves while we used a fixed bathymetry in this study only the observations available seaward of the bar are presently considered i e minimum water depth of 3m the d16 case study focuses on high energetic sea states associated with hurricane matthew over the period from october the 3 rd to the 11th and is supported with data from the frf database the dataset includes measurements from a waverider buoy wr in intermediate depth in addition of two other sensors a pressure sensors array deployed in 8m depth as and a current profiler deployed in 3 5m depth adop fig 2b and c the wr wave bulk parameters at the peak of the storm are given in table 1 in particular it is stressed that significant wave height reaching approximately 5m typically occurred one or two times per year over the last decade furthermore spectra timeseries not shown show a slight contribution of locally generated waves superimposed to the incoming swell during the studied period 3 1 3 computation of bulk parameters for study case o10 sub surface pressure timeseries from the two pressure sensors were split into 20 minute long bursts pressure measurements were corrected for sea level atmospheric pressure and detrended then the free surface elevation signal was reconstructed using the transfer function method based on linear wave theory tfm e g see bishop and donelan 1987 this method requires an upper cutoff frequency for not correcting and amplifying noise in the pressure data at high frequencies a problem which increases exponentially with depth the cutoff frequency was set to 0 2hz for p3 and vec sensors which roughly corresponds to an amplification factor up to 50 a value well below the threshold of 100 recommended by smith 2002 finally the sea surface elevation density spectra e f were computed by means of a fast fourier transform on 10 hanning windowed segments with a 50 overlapping elevation spectra were directly obtained from the dw data similarly for study case d16 elevation spectra are directly available for each sensor through the frf database wave bulk parameters are computed using the p th moments of each spectra defined as 23 m p f m i n f m a x f p e f d f for study case o10 the f m a x value was chosen in agreement with the upper cutoff frequency used to reconstruct the free surface elevation for the two pressure sensors and it was also set to 0 2 hz for dw spectra this conservative cut off frequency for the dw spectra was constrained by a seemingly unphysical signal at higher frequencies it was set to 0 3hz for every sensors of the d16 study case following roelvink and stive 1989 or hamm and peronnard 1997 an adaptive f m i n value was defined as half of the continuous peak frequency f p c computed at the offshore sensor dw and wr for study cases o10 and d16 respectively as 24 f p c m 0 2 m 2 m 1 finally the significant wave height and the mean wave period were respectively computed as 25 h m 0 4 m 0 26 t m 0 2 m 0 m 2 3 2 modelling system the third generation wind wave model wwm roland et al 2012 is used within the schism framework zhang et al 2016 to simulate the generation propagation and transformation of short waves in the nearshore the full coupling between the 2dh circulation model and the wave model is made at the source code level the same unstructured mesh and domain decomposition are shared by both models for both study cases the atmospheric forcing consisted of mean sea level pressure and wind speed at 10m for the case d16 hourly data originating from the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2011 were interpolated on a 0 2 regular grid for the case o10 the three hourly data from the integrated forecasting system of the european center for medium range weather forecast were used owens and hewson 2018 these are extracted from a 0 125 regular grid at the offshore domain boundaries wwm was forced with timeseries of energy spectra obtained from a north atlantic application of the spectral wave model wavewatch iii ww3 tolman 1991 for the case o10 the tidal forcing was computed by considering the 16 main tidal constituents linearly interpolated from the regional tidal model of bertin et al 2012 for the case d16 water levels were forced with the measurements from the as sensor in order to account for the surge that developed at the scale of the whole continental shelf which is not entirely represented in the computational grid thus atmospheric forcing was switched off for the circulation model for both wwm and wwiii models the wind input and dissipation by whitecapping were formulated according to the parameterization of ardhuin et al 2010 non linear quadruplet interactions were taken into account following the approach of hasselmann and hasselmann 1985 in wwm the non linear triad interactions were parameterized following eldeberky s approach eldeberky 1997 and the jonswap parameterization for the bottom friction was used with a coefficient γ 0 038 m 2 s 3 hasselmann et al 1973 depth induced breaking source term was computed following the approach of eldeberky and battjes 1996 as described in section 2 4 finally the θ σ space was discretized in 36 directions and 24 frequencies ranging from 0 02 to 0 4hz 3 3 results assessment model results are compared to observations by means of bulk parameters computed with moments integrated over the same frequency range as the data the results on the significant wave height h m 0 are the most relevant to assess depth induced breaking model performances whereas the results on t p c and t m 02 bring insight respectively on the energy peak and the higher frequency components of the energy spectrum which are expected to be affected by non linear triad interactions furthermore as depth induced breaking models rely on a representative frequency of the energy spectrum either f p or f m e a n the model performances regarding the period should also be assessed the overall model error is quantified with the normalized root mean square error nrmse 27 nrmse x i 1 n x i ˆ x i 2 i 1 n x i 2 100 where x and x ˆ respectively correspond to the vectors of measured and modelled bulk parameters of sample size n in order to assess model performances for storm waves the normalized bias nb and the nrmse on h m 0 are also computed on the 25 highest values assuming x and x ˆ stand for measured h m 0 values sorted in ascending order and the corresponding model results respectively these indicators are given by 28 nb 3 q x i 3 n 4 n x ˆ i x i i 3 n 4 n x i 100 nrmse 3 q x i 3 n 4 n x i ˆ x i 2 i 3 n 4 n x i 2 100 the resulting values presented in the following section are gathered in tables 3 and 4 4 results 4 1 wave forcing assessment in nearshore application with barely no local wave growth due to weak local winds as during the two study cases considered here wave transformation processes are mostly dissipative as the dominant source terms induce the dissipation of wave energy therefore it is essential to assess the wave forcing originating from ww3 application as it accounts for most of the energy income for the case o10 ww3 results are assessed with offshore biscay buoy measurements see fig 1a for its location for the case d16 data from the waverider buoy located inside the computational domain in intermediate depth 17 m water depth are used there is an overall good agreement for each parameter as shown in fig 3 however for the case d16 a strong underestimation of h m 0 t m 02 and t p c is noticeable after the peak of the storm around october the 10th the underestimation of h m 0 reaches 0 9m 25 locally as storm waves for the case d16 were produced by tropical hurricane matthew which passed only a few hundred kilometres from the study site a small error on the storm track in the cfsr reanalysis could easily explain these larger errors but addressing this problem is outside the scope of the present study 4 2 predictive skills of depth induced breaking with default parameterizations the four depth induced breaking models presented above namely bj78 tg83 b98 and w10 were first tested on both study cases using their default parameterizations the values assigned to the different parameters of depth induced breaking formulations are recalled in table 2 the results presented hereafter with tg83 formulation were obtained with the first weight function i 0 in eq 14 but the model showed similar behaviour using one or the other expression it should be stressed that as an initial approach b is taken equal to unity in both tg83 and w10 models considering the lack of consensus for its optimal value cf sections 2 2 2 and 2 3 2 4 2 1 study case o10 firstly water levels are well reproduced by the model with a nrmse on surface elevation around 15 at vec and p3 locations see fig 4j k the results on wave parameters strongly vary depending on the depth induced breaking formulation used with tg83 and w10 formulations the results show a severe underestimation of wave energy at the peak of the storm which worsens closer to shore fig 4b and c the resulting nb 3 q on h m 0 reaches respectively 33 and 36 at vec location using the bj78 formulation reduces the underestimation of h m 0 across the instrumented profile during the storm peak but it is still observable and nb 3 q reaches 12 at vec location the b98 formulation slightly improves the results obtained with bj78 at each location the underestimation of wave energy at the peak of the storm undermines the overall nrmse on h m 0 as shown in tables 3 and 4 the results on wave periods are rather homogeneous the nrmse on t m 02 varies between 10 and 16 depending on the location and the formulation used whereas the nrmse on t p c approximately reaches 20 for each formulation 4 2 2 study case d16 for the case d16 water levels are also fairly well reproduced fig 5j k even though the uncertainty on the nominal bottom vertical location of the sensors undermines the nrmse on surface elevation 16 at the adop location for the four depth induced breaking formulations tested here the model results show a similar over dissipation of energy at the storm peak as found in the o10 case see fig 5a c when reaching the wr location a considerable fraction of the incident wave energy has already been dissipated with the tg83 formulation at the storm peak in intermediate depth fig 5a the resulting nb 3 q on h m 0 reaches 20 at as location the results show an underestimation of h m 0 at the peak of the storm for every models fig 5b and table 4 in shallower water at the adop location every formulations underestimate h m 0 even before the storm peak fig 5c the nrmse reaches 24 38 22 and 46 using bj78 tg83 b98 and w10 formulations respectively the over dissipation of incident wave energy at the peak of the storm coincides with a slight overestimation of the mean wave period the nrmse on t m 02 reaches 10 at the adop location with the w10 formulation 4 2 3 adaptive parameterizations for γ and γ t g several studies have pointed out the limitations of using a default parameterization in the bj78 formulation for instance groeneweg et al 2009 reported an underestimation of the significant wave height and of the mean period in storm conditions in finite depth conditions further for the tg83 formulation it was stressed that the ratio h r m s h in inner surf zones could vary with the beach morphology and with incident wave conditions sallenger and holman 1985 raubenheimer et al 1996 sénéchal et al 2001 to address these limitations several alternative parameterizations of the breaking index γ and γ t g have been proposed to improve depth induced breaking modelling with varying success e g see salmon et al 2015 for a review here the model sensitivity to the breaking index γ for bj78 and b98 models or γ t g for tg83 model was investigated using the most landward sensor at both field sites the parameter γ respectively γ t g was tuned in order to match the h m 0 observed at adop and vec location fig 6 these values considerably deviate from reference values e g up to a factor 2 for γ t g and their expected range of variation see for instance salmon et al 2015 and their fig 1 it is worth noting that opting for very large constant values to match the h m 0 observed in the outer surf zone is not a reasonable solution as it will result in excessive wave height in the inner surf zone for instance bertin et al 2009 showed that the adequate breaking index in the inner surf zone at oléron was 0 55 using bj78 formulation this tends to show the limitation of keeping γ respectively γ t g constant furthermore the results of this sensitivity test suggest that the local energy dissipation rate is not solely controlled by the parameterization of γ respectively γ t g indirectly highlighting the role of the breaking coefficient which is usually kept spatially constant around unity guérin et al 2018 already introduced a scaled adaptive parameterization of the tg83 formulation for both γ t g and b these two parameters were computed as a linear function of the bottom slope adjusted to give the best fit of wave heights when comparing with measurements from a field campaign carried out in february 2017 in the shoreface of oléron island 4 3 role of the breaking coefficient despite the differences between bj78 b98 models and tg83 w10 models the rate at which energy is dissipated is formulated with the same bore based approach and is parameterized with the breaking coefficient consequently the model performances using the adaptive parameterization of the breaking coefficient introduced in eq 6 are assessed it should be stressed that the introduction of the adaptive breaking coefficient in bj78 and b98 formulations would require a newly calibrated breaking index γ whereas for tg83 and w10 models the formulation of q b and its subsequent parameterization is based on observations collected in the surf zone or from laboratory experiments consequently the model performances using either tg83 w10 or bj78 b98 formulations with the adaptive parameterization of the breaking coefficient will be presented separately 4 3 1 an adaptive breaking coefficient for tg83 and w10 formulations for both study cases the model was run again using tg83 and w10 formulations with b 3 substituted by b whereas the other parameters were unchanged see table 2 for the case o10 the adaptive parameterization of the breaking coefficient removes the observed underestimations obtained with tg83 and w10 formulations fig 7a c and table 4 at the vec location the nrmse is reduced to 12 and 15 with both formulations respectively yet with the w10 formulation an overestimation of h m 0 is observed with nb 3 q reaching 5 the results on wave periods for both formulations are identical and remain very close to those obtained with the default parameterizations hence these are not reproduced here see table 3 for the case d16 the adaptive parameterization leads to an overall reduction of the negative bias on h m 0 and of the positive bias on t m 02 such that the resulting timeseries approximately overlap at the wr and as locations only shown for h m 0 see fig 7d e the nrmse on h m 0 and t m 02 are reduced at each location as shown in table 3 however the negative bias on h m 0 at the adop location remains high using tg83 and w10 formulations yielding a nrmse on h m 0 of 29 and 32 respectively 4 3 2 towards a new parameterization of bj78 and b98 formulations for the bj78 and b98 formulations the introduction of the adaptive breaking coefficient gives the same formulations for the total energy dissipation rates eqs 10 and 16 with α substituted by b furthermore if the topography of the two study areas is rather similar the study case o10 is characterized by higher peak periods see figs 4g i and 5g i therefore the contrasted results between the two study cases could presumably be related to the different incident wave conditions in order to investigate this hypothesis the dependency of the breaking index to the local non dimensional water depth k p h was investigated following the approach of ruessink et al 2003 when the breaking coefficient is taken constant the results are not improved with the parameterization of ruessink et al 2003 for the breaking index γ not shown yet the k p h dependency of γ is still expected to be valid with or without the adaptive breaking coefficient such that this parameterization could also be tested with the adaptive breaking coefficient note however that the calibration performed by ruessink et al 2003 did not employ the present adaptive breaking coefficient so that different coefficients as those originally found by these authors might be expected nevertheless finding an alternative calibration of the breaking index as defined in eq 17 falls outside the scope of the present study therefore the model was here run again with bj78 and b98 formulations by taking into account the adaptive breaking coefficient and γ as obtained by ruessink et al 2003 and given in eq 17 for the case o10 the new parameterization gives satisfactory results with the bj78 formulation the negative bias on h m 0 at the storm peak resulting from the use of the default parameterization is corrected however the dissipation is underestimated with the b98 formulation which results in an over estimation of h m 0 at vec location fig 8a c and see table 4 for the case d16 this parameterization reduces the negative bias on h m 0 during the storm peak at as location for both formulations see table 4 however the bias on h m 0 is still high at adop location fig 8f leading to a nrmse which reaches 26 and 21 respectively 5 discussion 5 1 the origin of the over dissipation obtained with default parameterizations the results show an almost systematic over dissipation of wave energy when using the default parameterizations of the four formulations for depth induced breaking source terms for both study cases the relative importance of the energy dissipation rates due to wave breaking over all source terms was computed in order to get insight into the spatial variations and the local dominance of breaking processes variation rates corresponding to the source terms associated with the energy input from the wind d i n and the energy dissipation due to whitecapping d d s bottom friction d b f and depth induced breaking d b r were extracted along a cross shore profile see figs 1b c and 2b c the relative contribution of depth induced breaking r b r was computed by normalizing the associated dissipation rate by the quadratic sum of each source term 29 r b r d b r d j 2 with d j σ m i n σ m a x 0 2 π σ s j σ θ d σ d θ where the subscript j represents either of the i n d s b f or b r subscripts for the study case o10 wave breaking induced energy dissipation modelled with the tg83 or w10 formulations is already substantial in intermediate depths 20 m and k p h 0 6 and it clearly dominates over any other dissipative processes left panels of fig 9 similar behaviour is observed for the bj78 and b98 formulations closer to shore slightly around p3 for the time displayed here left panels of fig 9 at p3 location a relatively strong divergence in terms of magnitude can be observed between the different formulations with a maximum value of 75w m 2 reached with the w10 formulation while the tg83 formulation predicts a dissipation approximately three times weaker for the case d16 the wave breaking induced energy dissipation predicted by the tg83 formulation considerably differs from the other configurations it shows a weak dissipation by depth induced breaking all along the profile even in intermediate depths k p h o 1 which seemingly explains the bias on h m 0 at wr location fig 5 in contrast the other formulations produce a sharp transition regarding depth induced breaking dominance right panels of fig 9 overall it appears that tg83 model and to a lesser extent w10 model induces a substantial over dissipation of wave energy for a wide range of k p h value starting at intermediate depths where wave breaking due to interactions with the bottom is not expected for the two other models the results for study case o10 tend to show that the over dissipation becomes substantial for k p h value of the order of 0 5 such conditions occur between as and adop locations for study case d16 the pragmatic solution proposed in this paper focuses on the role of the breaking coefficient in the formulation of the energy dissipation rate the default parameterization of each formulation only considers saturated breakers whereas the adaptive breaking coefficient in these very gently sloping shoreface area is o 0 1 which means that breakers are not saturated although the fraction of breaking waves is rather small and consequently the dissipation rates remain weak see fig 9a b once integrated up to the inner surf zone it results in a substantial dissipation of wave energy therefore the difference of the energy dissipated by a saturated breaker and a non saturated breaker explains the increasing over dissipation of wave energy which results in an underestimation of significant wave heights in the nearshore area figs 4a c and 5a c 5 2 remaining challenges the accuracy of the total wave energy dissipation rate estimates strongly depends on the fraction of breaking waves q b which remains a poorly understood quantity due to complications associated with its measurements and its natural variability e g see thornton and guza 1983 stringari and power 2019 martins et al 2020 on the one hand for tg83 and w10 models the formulation of q b and its subsequent parameterization rely on the fit of the observed fraction of breaking waves using for instance video recording e g boers 1996 to a local ratio constrained by the breaking process either the h r m s γ t g h ratio for tg83 formulation or the β β r e f ratio for w10 formulation for these two models the parameterization of q b depends both on the fitting coefficient n and on the aforementioned ratio either through γ t g or the value of β r e f the parameterizations of q b could be improved by taking into account a wider range of wave conditions and topographies for instance the reference biphase and the value of n in the weight function used for w10 model eq 18 were fitted to data from only three cases from a laboratory experiment see van der westhuysen 2010 and boers 1996 furthermore the model is particularly sensitive to the parameterization of the biphase higher value for the parameter δ could be expected according to the alternative parameterization given by doering and bowen 1995 the model was tested with δ 0 4 to assess this sensibility in the present case the corresponding results are shown fig 10 for the two study cases using δ 0 4 considerably improves the results for the d16 case whereas for the case o10 the beginning of the breaking is incorrectly predicted leading to an overestimation of significant wave heights although the biphase being a third order parameter has potential for designing a robust breaking criterion standing on physical ground more observations are probably required to improve its parameterization especially through δ on the other hand the bj78 and b98 models rely on the same miche type breaking criterion stating that a wave is breaking when its height exceeds some fraction of the local water depth given by the breaking index γ for both models the breaking index is the only parameter controlling q b it is rather questionable to ascertain a parameterization of such maximal wave height on the basis of observations outside a saturated surf zone consequently the parameterization of the breaking index typically results from calibrations or inverse modelling approach ruessink et al 2003 the counterpart is that the parameterization of the breaking index depends on the formulation used for the energy dissipation rate an explanation of the overall satisfactory results using the default parameterizations of these two formulations would be that too high breaking index partly compensates the excessive saturated dissipation rate furthermore it was shown that opting for a constant breaking index around its default value or higher could not give satisfactory results up to the inner surf zone where lower values are required bertin et al 2009 yet the adaptive parameterization of the breaking coefficient introduced in this paper is more robust physically and should be explicitly taken into account in bj78 and b98 formulations which consequently would require an adapted calibration of the breaking index it is worth noting that the pragmatic solution proposed in this study also faces the inherent limitations of bore based models for instance a number of field and laboratory observations have demonstrated that breaking processes have a certain inertia and keep being active as waves propagate in increasing water depths e g behind bars or reefs see scott et al 2005 the new parameterization of the breaking coefficient as any other existing parameterization does not account for such inertia processes surface roller models help representing these processes by slightly advecting the location where energy is actually dissipated towards the shoreline e g svendsen 1984 for instance the representation of surface rollers improve the predictions of longshore currents and their cross shore structure in the presence of sandbars in the nearshore smith et al 1993 reniers and battjes 1997 concerning the parameterization proposed in this study it is best to maintain b at a fixed level e g 0 1 over negative slopes as both study cases do not present such topographic features this solution could not be properly tested in particular this fixed value might show some site specificity and presumably needs adjustments 5 3 implications of this study the accurate modelling of storm waves has a direct impact on the computation of the wave setup which corresponds to the rise in mean water levels along the coast due to the forces exerted by short waves as they break the setup is a key component of extreme water levels and thus play an important role in coastal hazards e g guérin et al 2018 considering an alongshore uniform beach and neglecting the bottom stress the depth integrated momentum equation along a cross shore transect simplifies to a balance between the cross shore component of wave forces and the barotropic pressure gradient associated with the setup e g longuet higgins and stewart 1964 30 s x x x ρ g η h η x 0 where η corresponds to the sea surface elevation and s x x is the cross shore component of the radiation stress tensor which to first order is a direct function of the total wave energy density salmon and holthuijsen 2015 showed that inadequate depth induced breaking parameterization could lead to a local underestimation of wave forces by up to a factor of 2 this study further suggests that an early wave energy dissipation in intermediate depth should result in weaker wave forces yielding an underestimation of wave setup near the shoreline in order to verify this hypothesis we compare hereafter the wave setup computed at the coast using an adaptive parameterization of the breaking coefficient to that obtained with the default parameterization to account for various offshore wave conditions and topographies eq 30 was coupled with a 1d cross shore bulk wave model for a range of offshore wave conditions h r m s o ranging from 2 to 12 m and bottom slopes tan β ranging from 1 10000 to 1 100 a corresponding peak period was computed from h r m s o by considering an empirical shape for the energy spectrum proposed by pierson and moskowitz 1964 the resulting peak periods vary from 6 to 14 6s the wave energy dissipation by depth induced breaking was modelled after bj78 in which the maximal wave height is estimated through eq 8 with γ 0 73 this parameterization is intended to be representative of the usual implementation of depth induced breaking within spectral models for regional applications the wave setup computed at the coast is systematically higher with the depth induced breaking parameterized with the adaptive breaking coefficient fig 11 the model clearly shows a reduced energy dissipation by depth induced breaking for higher waves above gentle slopes when using the adaptive breaking coefficient such that the setup is uniform for given offshore wave conditions note that wave dissipation by bottom friction was neglected to focus on depth induced breaking but could slightly change numbers presented in this discussion particularly for the mildest slopes considered here nevertheless this result tends to show that wave setup would be substantially underestimated when using depth induced breaking default parameterization the increase of the wave setup exceeds 100 for a wide range of offshore conditions above the most gentle slopes such that it could result in a setup up to 0 5m higher fig 11b c over the last decade the increase in computational power allowed accounting for the contribution of wave breaking to storm surges at regional scale e g see dietrich et al 2011 bertin et al 2015 wu et al 2018 yet these studies presented wave setup contributions always lower than 1 m even when considering wave height reaching h r m s 12 m as these studies typically employed the bj78 model with default parameters it is expected that these values are underestimated it should be pointed out that previously published studies relying on 1d models raubenheimer et al 1996 apotsos et al 2007 reported severe underestimations of wave setup along the coast guérin et al 2018 proposed that this behaviour could be due to the wave driven depth varying circulation not accounted for in depth averaged approach of eq 30 this numerical experiment tends to show that inadequate parameterization of depth induced breaking could also result in a systematic underestimation of the wave setup under storm waves 6 conclusions in this study the third generation spectral model wwm fully coupled with a 2dh configuration of the circulation model schism was used to simulate nearshore dynamics under storm waves at two contrasting sites the results show a substantial over dissipation of wave energy by depth induced breaking using four state of the art formulations of the corresponding source terms these results highlight the limitations of the default parameterization of the depth induced breaking formulations alternatively on the basis of earlier work by le mehauté 1962 an adaptive parameterization of the breaking coefficient is introduced and leads to improved predictions in the nearshore area yet this solution will have to be verified in future studies especially over topographies presenting negative slopes e g barred beach and combined with further calibration of the fraction of breaking waves in order to be valid up to the shoreline among the possible implications of this study it is shown that the wave setup computed at the coast is significantly larger when using the adaptive parameterization for wave dissipation by breaking compared to that obtained with the default one credit authorship contribution statement m

23924,short waves are of key importance for nearshore dynamics particularly under storms where they contribute to extreme water levels and drive large morphological changes therefore it is crucial to model accurately the propagation and dissipation of storm waves in the nearshore area in this paper field observations collected in contrasted environments and conditions are combined with predictions from a third generation spectral wave model to evaluate four formulations of wave energy dissipation by depth induced breaking the results reveal a substantial over dissipation of incident wave energy occurring over the continental shelf resulting in a negative bias on significant wave height reaching up to 50 to overcome this problem a breaking coefficient dependent of the local bottom slope is introduced within depth induced breaking models in order to account for the varying degrees of saturation naturally found in breaking and broken waves this approach strongly reduces the negative bias observed in the shoreface compared to default parameterizations yielding significant improvements in the prediction of storm waves among the implications of this study our new parameterization of the breaking coefficient results in systematically increased predictions of the wave setup near the shoreline compared to the default parameterization this increase reaches a factor 2 for gently sloping beaches keywords spectral wave models depth induced breaking storm waves wave setup 1 introduction as storm waves contribute to extreme water levels dodet et al 2019 and drive large morphological changes wright and short 1984 coco et al 2014 castelle et al 2015 they are of paramount importance for coastal hazards in a context of sea level rise associated with climate change and a continuous increase of coastal populations neumann et al 2015 it is essential to model accurately the propagation transformation and dissipation of wind generated surface gravity waves hereafter short waves in the nearshore area in particular during storms regional applications of fully coupled ocean circulation and spectral wave numerical models have become widespread for all types of applications ranging from operational predictions to engineering or research purposes e g bidlot et al 2002 boudière et al 2013 guérin et al 2018 however the ability of these models to accurately simulate wave induced hydrodynamics during storms in the nearshore area remains uncertain which is partly explained by the scarcity of field observations required to verify numerical models especially in the surf zone in deep water the parameterizations of the physical processes contributing to wave generation by the wind and its subsequent propagation and transformation have benefited from decades of theoretical and practical developments e g hasselmann 1962 hasselmann and hasselmann 1985 the wamdi group 1988 cavaleri et al 2007 ardhuin et al 2010 and many others in the nearshore area dominant processes such as the adiabatic triad interactions and the dissipation due to depth induced wave breaking remain heavily parameterized in such models to the point that the current solutions are sometimes referred to as engineering solutions e g see cavaleri et al 2007 for a relatively recent review on spectral wave models and the parameterization of the different physical processes involved alternatively modelling chains that combine phase averaged model forcing local phase resolving models over a specific area e g see postacchini et al 2019 permit to describe the key processes associated with wave transformation in the nearshore while requiring little parameterizations however such application remains possible only locally as it is quite computationally expensive which prohibits this approach for operational applications at the regional scale close to shore short waves undergo complex transformations and dissipate their energy mostly through depth induced breaking in the absence of universal consensus on the criteria for wave breaking and on the spectral distribution of energy dissipation it is more convenient to model the macroscale effects in terms of the averaged loss of energy several formulations have been proposed in the literature to compute the average energy dissipation rate in a rayleigh distributed wave field based on the cross shore conservation of the bulk wave energy flux many of these formulations have subsequently been adapted to compute a corresponding source term for spectral modelling purposes the underlying approach of depth induced breaking models follows the seminal work of le mehauté 1962 in which the dissipation rate of a breaking or broken wave hereafter referred to as a breaker is approximated by that of a hydraulic jump of equivalent height bore based model the average energy dissipation rate is obtained by applying the dissipation rate of a breaker to the fraction of breaking or broken waves in the original wave field therefore the average energy dissipation rate is controlled by the computation of the fraction of breaking waves hereinafter q b and a breaking coefficient which is related to the degree of saturation of the breaker and hence controls its energy dissipation rate mostly the different models differ in the formulation of q b and numerous studies further aimed at improving the parameterization of q b through ad hoc scalings with the local bed slope and or local wave characteristics e g see salmon et al 2015 however the performance of these scalings remain uncertain at other sites especially under storm waves and admittedly lack physical grounds in contrast the breaking coefficient has received much less attention in such modelling approach it is generally kept constant in both time and space and is seen as a calibration factor in contrast with these class of depth induced breaking models it is worth noting that an alternative approach was proposed by filipot and ardhuin 2012 these authors introduced a unified formulation for wave breaking from deep ocean up to the inner surf zone in which a dissipation term is computed for each wave scale based on the decomposition of the frequency spectrum introduced by filipot et al 2010 although this formulation brought interesting insights and showed comparable predictive skills to those specific to deep or shallow water environments it remains scarcely used especially in studies related to coastal applications this study provides a critical and objective assessment of four specialized depth induced breaking models which rely on state of the art formulations of the fraction of breaking waves these models are implemented within the spectral model wwm iii roland et al 2012 fully coupled with a 2dh configuration of the circulation model schism zhang et al 2016 the model performances are assessed at two contrasting sites under high energy conditions the results with the default parameterizations show a systematic over dissipation of the incident wave energy over the inner continental shelf especially in high energy conditions in order to address the inherent limitations of the default parameterizations of these models which typically consider breakers as fully saturated bores a new parameterization of the breaking coefficient is introduced based on le méhauté s original work le mehauté 1962 the manuscript is organized as follows the theoretical background on depth induced breaking modelling in parametric models and its application to phase averaged models is reviewed in section 2 the two study cases and the model implementation are presented in section 3 in section 4 the different depth induced breaking formulations with their default parameterizations are firstly tested highlighting their poor predictive skills under high energy conditions then the performances of the adaptive parameterization of the breaking coefficient within the four models are assessed at the two sites considered here the results of this study and their implications are discussed in section 5 before the concluding remarks are provided in section 6 2 theoretical background 2 1 energy dissipation rate of a broken wave the analogy between turbulent bores hydraulic jumps and individual breakers is often used to compute the associated energy dissipation rate per unit span d e g see lubin and chanson 2017 for a recent review on these non linear processes and their similitude the expression for the energy dissipation rate per unit span by a bore d b o r e is given by stoker 1957 1 d b o r e ρ g q h 0 h 1 3 4 h 1 h 0 ρ g 4 g h 0 h 1 2 h 1 h 0 h 0 h 1 3 where ρ is the water density g is the gravitational acceleration q is the discharge in m 2 s and h 0 h 1 are the local water heights upstream and downstream of the discontinuity respectively le mehauté 1962 formulated an analogous expression for breakers denoted with the subscript w b by using the discharge given by solitary wave theory this author further introduced a breaking coefficient here denoted by δ l m which is closely related to the fraction of the active breaking region over the whole wave face in order to express the energy dissipation rate by a breaker of height h d l m 2 d l m δ l m d w b δ l m 1 corresponds to a saturated breaker where the active breaking region extends over the whole wave face while δ l m 0 corresponds to situations without breaking le mehauté 1962 as h 0 and h 1 are a priori not known in statistical or phase averaged numerical models it is convenient to use the following approximations introduced by battjes and janssen 1978 3 h 0 h 1 h g h 1 h 0 2 h 1 h 0 g h where h is the mean water depth when replaced in eq 1 these approximations allow to estimate the energy dissipation rate per unit span by a breaker of height h as 4 d b j 78 1 4 ρ g h 3 g h α 4 ρ g h 3 g h where α is a tuning coefficient of the order of 1 battjes and janssen 1978 in order to account for the differences in various breaker types and variability in the breaking regime saturated non saturated thornton and guza 1983 proposed the following alternative expression 5 d t g 83 1 4 ρ g b h 3 g h considering the above formulations and approximations used it is clear that both α and b hereafter referred to as breaking coefficient are related to the degree of saturation of the breaker on the basis of this assessment and considering le méhauté s analytical developments the following expression is introduced as an alternative to eqs 4 and 5 see appendix for the derivation 6 d n e w b 4 ρ g h 3 g h with b 40 tan β where tan β is the local bottom slope this new formulation incorporates the effect of the bottom slope on the local rate of energy dissipation in a breaker an illustrative evidence of such dependency can be found in martins et al 2018 who performed high resolution measurements of broken waves propagating in the inner surf zone with a lidar scanner see their fig 3 extracting the breaker properties height roller angle and length one can notice that beach slope variations yield changes in roller geometrical properties which subsequently control the rate at which the energy is dissipated furthermore this parameterization is consistent with the bottom slope dependency of the parameter α discussed by hamm 1995 although b can theoretically grow to infinite it is physically bound to 0 1 which means that the breaker saturation is reached over slopes equal to or steeper than 1 40 2 2 total energy dissipation rate of random breaking waves the original approach to model the transformation of random waves in the nearshore typically assumes the wave field to be rayleigh distributed and narrow banded in both frequency and direction as only bulk parameters are simulated the representative period remains constant over space with this approach on sandy shores the cross shore evolution of the wave energy flux is principally controlled by the depth induced breaking intensity given by the local mean period averaged rate of energy dissipation per unit area of breaking or broken waves d b r this term is computed by dividing the energy dissipation rate per unit span by a breaker e g eqs 4 5 or 6 by a representative shallow water wave length λ g h f where f is a representative frequency of the energy spectrum applied to the fraction of breaking and broken waves of the original wave field 2 2 1 battjes and janssen 1978 model bj78 battjes and janssen 1978 assumed that the height of all breakers equals a local maximum possible wave height h m estimated by means of a parameterized miche type criterion 7 h m 0 88 k tanh γ k h 0 88 where k is the wavenumber and γ is the breaking index an adjustable coefficient to allow for effects of bottom slope compared to the theoretical value of 0 88 given by the miche criterion derived for a flat bottom miche 1944 in shallow water k h 1 eq 7 reduces to 8 h m γ h as a result the rayleigh s probability density function of wave heights is clipped at h h m with a delta function according to their analytical developments the fraction of breaking waves q b is consequently computed by means of 9 1 q b ln q b h r m s h m 2 where h r m s is the root mean square wave height assuming h m h o 1 where the dissipation occurs the local mean rate of energy dissipation per unit area finally reads 10 d b r b j 78 α 4 ρ g f m e a n q b h m 2 where f m e a n is a mean frequency which is typically computed from the t m 0 1 wave period defined as m 0 m 1 see eq 23 in section 3 1 3 battjes and stive 1985 performed an extensive calibration and verification of this model using a variety of experimental and field observations although the original model was developed using a mean frequency it should be pointed out that these authors used the peak frequency f p instead of f m e a n in eq 10 with the calibration coefficient α kept at 1 the values for the breaking index γ ranged from 0 60 to 0 83 with an average of 0 73 in the original paper battjes and janssen 1978 used γ 0 8 and α 1 from these results battjes and stive 1985 found a relation between γ and the offshore wave steepness s o which was later adjusted by nairn 1990 11 γ 0 39 0 56 tanh 33 s o with s o h r m s o λ o h r m s o 2 π f p 2 g 2 2 2 thornton and guza 1983 model tg83 based on their field observations thornton and guza 1983 suggested that the wave field was also rayleigh distributed in the surf zone these authors expressed the distribution of breaking wave heights p b h as a weighting of the rayleigh probability density function for all wave heights p h by means of a function w h such that 12 q b 0 p b h d h 0 w h p h d h the total energy dissipation is obtained by integrating the energy dissipation for a single broken wave of height h eq 5 multiplied by p b h thornton and guza 1983 this reads 13 d b r t g 83 0 f p g h d t g 83 w h p h d h b 3 4 ρ g f p h 0 h 3 w h p h d h two expressions for the weight function were proposed in terms of the ratio h r m s h to fit the observed fraction of breaking waves from a field campaign conducted at soldiers beach california thornton and guza 1983 this follows thornton and guza 1982 who showed the depth limited character of inner surf zone waves and found a linear relationship between h r m s and h for brevity the single expression introduced by battjes and janssen 2009 is used 14 w t g 83 i h 1 exp h γ t g h 2 i h r m s γ t g h n i for i 0 w t g 83 0 is independent of the wave height whereas for i 1 the distribution of broken waves is skewed towards the largest waves i e they are more likely to break the coefficient γ t g is set to 0 42 according to thornton and guza 1982 whereas depending on the weight function used the most accurate description of the distribution of breaking waves was obtained using n 0 4 or n 1 2 substituting eq 14 for i 0 1 in eq 13 yields 15 d b r t g 83 i 3 π 16 b 3 f p ρ g h r m s 3 h 1 1 h r m s γ t g h 2 5 2 i h r m s γ t g h n i the model has only one adjustable parameter b introduced in eq 5 whose optimal values ranged from 0 8 to 1 7 depending on the dataset whether field or lab based observations and the weight function thornton and guza 1983 considering that the coefficient is used at power 3 it is worth noting that the resulting value for d b r t g 83 can vary by up to a factor 10 2 2 3 baldock et al 1998 model b98 the model originally proposed by baldock et al 1998 borrows from bj78 and tg83 models it uses a heavyside step function shifted in h m to weigh the rayleigh s probability density function janssen and battjes 2007 reported an inconsistency in the original analytical developments and proposed a corrected expression for the local mean rate of energy dissipation per unit area which reads 16 d b r b 98 3 π 16 α f p ρ g h r m s 3 h 1 4 3 π r 3 3 r 2 exp r 2 erf r where r h m h r m s erf is the error function and h m is computed according to eq 8 the formulation based on the offshore wave steepness eq 11 was used in both papers to compute γ 2 3 recent developments on the parameterization of q b 2 3 1 alternative parameterizations of the breaking index a dependency of the breaking index to the local non dimensional depth was investigated by ruessink et al 2003 who introduced a parameterization of γ which linearly increases with the local non dimensional depth based on the peak period k p h 17 γ 0 76 k p h 0 29 this parameterization is based on the calibration through an inverse modelling approach of a 1d cross shore bulk wave model in which depth induced breaking is modelled according to baldock s original formulation baldock et al 1998 this parameterization of the breaking index has been implemented within spectral models yielding a substantial improvement in model results van der westhuysen 2010 more recently alternative parameterizations of the breaking index with both local bottom slope and non dimensional depth were proposed salmon et al 2015 lin and sheng 2017 with a calibration performed with spectral models against extensive datasets these parameterizations follow earlier experimental studies in which the dependency of the wave height over depth ratio in the inner surf zone to these two parameters was already pointed out raubenheimer et al 1996 sénéchal et al 2001 2 3 2 westhuysen 2010 model w10 van der westhuysen 2010 further investigated breaker index parameterization based on wavefield nonlinearity and introduced an alternative parameterization of q b which relies on the biphase β i a third order quantity that informs on the phase coupling between triads and is thus related to the wave skewness and asymmetry e g see hasselmann et al 1963 elgar and guza 1985 as spectral wave models do not represent quantities at this order β i is generally approximated from a linear estimate of the ursell number u r eldeberky 1997 doering and bowen 1995 following the approach of thornton and guza 1983 the following expression for the weight function w was proposed 18 w w 10 h β i β i r e f n with β i π 2 π 2 tanh δ u r where δ 0 2 according to eldeberky 1997 and u r is computed with its bulk formulation 19 u r g 8 2 π 2 h m 0 t m 0 1 2 h 2 by construction when β i 0 i e waves are symmetric along the vertical axis the percent of broken waves equals zero when β i tends to π 2 waves become more asymmetric i e pitched forward e g see elgar and guza 1985 and the percent of broken waves increases however as all waves tend to break before the limit is reached a scaled limit β i r e f was introduced in the expression of the weighting function in the study by van der westhuysen 2010 the coefficients β i r e f and n were respectively set to 4 π 9 and 2 5 in order to fit the observed fraction of breakers in the lab experiment of boers 1996 using eq 5 the local mean rate of energy dissipation per unit area is finally given by 20 d b r w 10 3 π 16 b 3 ρ g f m e a n h β i β i r e f n h r m s 3 where f m e a n is the mean frequency computed from the t m 0 1 wave period as for the tg83 model b is the only adjustable parameters according to van der westhuysen 2010 it resulted from calibrations that the value of b varied over the range 0 5 to 1 5 2 4 depth induced breaking in spectral models spectral wave models are based on a decomposition of the sea surface elevation in a sum of linear components across relative angular frequencies σ and directions θ these models solve a balance equation for the wave action density spectrum n which is related to the wave energy density spectrum e by n e σ e g see komen et al 1994 21 n t x c g u n σ n σ θ n θ s t o t the left hand side of eq 21 contains the change of wave action in time the advection in the geographical space at a velocity given by the intrinsic group speed vector c g plus an advective current velocity vector u for each spectral component which theoretically depends on the current profile andrews and mcintyre 1978 and on the amplitude of all waves components willebrand 1975 in practice these latter effects are often neglected such that within numerical models u is generally taken as the surface current velocity vector or for coastal applications the depth averaged current cavaleri et al 2007 in wwm iii u is approximated to be the surface current velocity vector roland et al 2012 the last two terms correspond to the advection in spectral space where σ and θ are the propagation velocities in frequencies and directions respectively the evolution of the action spectrum due to a variety of physical phenomena is represented through source terms summed in the right hand side of eq 21 in deep water wind driven wave growth s i n dissipation by whitecapping s d s and non linear quadruplet interactions s n l 4 are the dominant processes transforming the wave field in shallow water three additional processes are considered namely the bottom friction s b f non linear interactions between triads s n l 3 and depth induced breaking s b r the main approach to compute the depth induced breaking source term follows the work of eldeberky and battjes 1996 in which the local mean rate of energy dissipation is distributed over frequencies and directions in proportion to the spectral action density 22 s b r d b r e t o t n where e t o t ρ g σ θ e d σ d θ consequently the aforementioned formulations of the local mean rate of energy dissipation per unit area could be introduced into spectral models it is worth noting that for the bj78 and b98 original models the parameterizations of the breaking index based on offshore wave parameters eq 11 see also apotsos et al 2008 who proposed a parameterization with the offshore significant wave height are not convenient for spectral models applied at regional scale this contrasts with one dimensional smaller scale models based on the cross shore balance of the wave energy flux and which obtained satisfactory results with such parameterizations following the approach of the swan group booij et al 1999 a constant value of γ 0 73 consistent with the results of battjes and stive 1985 is usually used to compute h m by means of eq 8 3 methods the present study is supported with field measurements from two study areas the oléron island france and duck north carolina this section presents the two study cases underlying their contrasting features the model implementation and the result assessment methodology are subsequently described 3 1 study cases 3 1 1 oléron 2010 o10 the first study area is located along the south west coast of the oléron island in the central part of the french atlantic coast see fig 1a this area is characterized by a very gently sloping shoreface where the bottom slope is of the order of 1 1000 and a non barred dissipative beach where bottom slope approximately reaches 1 100 fig 1c tides are semi diurnal and range from 1 5m during neap tides to 5 5m during spring tides which corresponds to a macrotidal regime dodet et al 2019 recently analysed wave regimes along the 30m isobath of the french metropolitan coast in this area the yearly mean wave conditions reported are characterized by a significant wave height of 1 6m a mean wave period of 5 9s and a direction of 285 from the true north this case study is supported by observations from a field campaign carried out by the french hydrographic and oceanographic office in february 2010 during the studied period offshore waves were characterized by a significant wave height reaching 9 5m at biscay buoy location which corresponds to a yearly return period nicolae lerma et al 2015 while the local wave growth in the nearshore area is negligible due to weak local wind the dataset includes data from a datawell buoy dw and two pressure sensors vec and p3 mounted on a structure dropped on the seabed see fig 1b c for their respective location the dw wave bulk parameters at the peak of the storm are given in table 1 3 1 2 duck 2016 d16 the second study area is located on the shoreface surrounding the field research facility frf near duck nc see fig 2a the frf is maintained by the u s army corps of engineers and has focused for many decades the effort of the coastal researcher s community through major field campaigns in particular as topographic surveys are being performed regularly and nearshore current wave and water level data are continuously collected and available to the community this site often serves as a benchmark for numerical models around the frf the bottom topography is quite alongshore uniform fig 2b and is characterized by a steep foreshore generally flanked by a flat terrace sandbar system o 100m in length e g see gallagher et al 1998 beyond which the slope is gentle and decreases monotonically from 1 200 to 1 1000 fig 2c as large morphological changes of the sandbar take place under storm waves while we used a fixed bathymetry in this study only the observations available seaward of the bar are presently considered i e minimum water depth of 3m the d16 case study focuses on high energetic sea states associated with hurricane matthew over the period from october the 3 rd to the 11th and is supported with data from the frf database the dataset includes measurements from a waverider buoy wr in intermediate depth in addition of two other sensors a pressure sensors array deployed in 8m depth as and a current profiler deployed in 3 5m depth adop fig 2b and c the wr wave bulk parameters at the peak of the storm are given in table 1 in particular it is stressed that significant wave height reaching approximately 5m typically occurred one or two times per year over the last decade furthermore spectra timeseries not shown show a slight contribution of locally generated waves superimposed to the incoming swell during the studied period 3 1 3 computation of bulk parameters for study case o10 sub surface pressure timeseries from the two pressure sensors were split into 20 minute long bursts pressure measurements were corrected for sea level atmospheric pressure and detrended then the free surface elevation signal was reconstructed using the transfer function method based on linear wave theory tfm e g see bishop and donelan 1987 this method requires an upper cutoff frequency for not correcting and amplifying noise in the pressure data at high frequencies a problem which increases exponentially with depth the cutoff frequency was set to 0 2hz for p3 and vec sensors which roughly corresponds to an amplification factor up to 50 a value well below the threshold of 100 recommended by smith 2002 finally the sea surface elevation density spectra e f were computed by means of a fast fourier transform on 10 hanning windowed segments with a 50 overlapping elevation spectra were directly obtained from the dw data similarly for study case d16 elevation spectra are directly available for each sensor through the frf database wave bulk parameters are computed using the p th moments of each spectra defined as 23 m p f m i n f m a x f p e f d f for study case o10 the f m a x value was chosen in agreement with the upper cutoff frequency used to reconstruct the free surface elevation for the two pressure sensors and it was also set to 0 2 hz for dw spectra this conservative cut off frequency for the dw spectra was constrained by a seemingly unphysical signal at higher frequencies it was set to 0 3hz for every sensors of the d16 study case following roelvink and stive 1989 or hamm and peronnard 1997 an adaptive f m i n value was defined as half of the continuous peak frequency f p c computed at the offshore sensor dw and wr for study cases o10 and d16 respectively as 24 f p c m 0 2 m 2 m 1 finally the significant wave height and the mean wave period were respectively computed as 25 h m 0 4 m 0 26 t m 0 2 m 0 m 2 3 2 modelling system the third generation wind wave model wwm roland et al 2012 is used within the schism framework zhang et al 2016 to simulate the generation propagation and transformation of short waves in the nearshore the full coupling between the 2dh circulation model and the wave model is made at the source code level the same unstructured mesh and domain decomposition are shared by both models for both study cases the atmospheric forcing consisted of mean sea level pressure and wind speed at 10m for the case d16 hourly data originating from the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2011 were interpolated on a 0 2 regular grid for the case o10 the three hourly data from the integrated forecasting system of the european center for medium range weather forecast were used owens and hewson 2018 these are extracted from a 0 125 regular grid at the offshore domain boundaries wwm was forced with timeseries of energy spectra obtained from a north atlantic application of the spectral wave model wavewatch iii ww3 tolman 1991 for the case o10 the tidal forcing was computed by considering the 16 main tidal constituents linearly interpolated from the regional tidal model of bertin et al 2012 for the case d16 water levels were forced with the measurements from the as sensor in order to account for the surge that developed at the scale of the whole continental shelf which is not entirely represented in the computational grid thus atmospheric forcing was switched off for the circulation model for both wwm and wwiii models the wind input and dissipation by whitecapping were formulated according to the parameterization of ardhuin et al 2010 non linear quadruplet interactions were taken into account following the approach of hasselmann and hasselmann 1985 in wwm the non linear triad interactions were parameterized following eldeberky s approach eldeberky 1997 and the jonswap parameterization for the bottom friction was used with a coefficient γ 0 038 m 2 s 3 hasselmann et al 1973 depth induced breaking source term was computed following the approach of eldeberky and battjes 1996 as described in section 2 4 finally the θ σ space was discretized in 36 directions and 24 frequencies ranging from 0 02 to 0 4hz 3 3 results assessment model results are compared to observations by means of bulk parameters computed with moments integrated over the same frequency range as the data the results on the significant wave height h m 0 are the most relevant to assess depth induced breaking model performances whereas the results on t p c and t m 02 bring insight respectively on the energy peak and the higher frequency components of the energy spectrum which are expected to be affected by non linear triad interactions furthermore as depth induced breaking models rely on a representative frequency of the energy spectrum either f p or f m e a n the model performances regarding the period should also be assessed the overall model error is quantified with the normalized root mean square error nrmse 27 nrmse x i 1 n x i ˆ x i 2 i 1 n x i 2 100 where x and x ˆ respectively correspond to the vectors of measured and modelled bulk parameters of sample size n in order to assess model performances for storm waves the normalized bias nb and the nrmse on h m 0 are also computed on the 25 highest values assuming x and x ˆ stand for measured h m 0 values sorted in ascending order and the corresponding model results respectively these indicators are given by 28 nb 3 q x i 3 n 4 n x ˆ i x i i 3 n 4 n x i 100 nrmse 3 q x i 3 n 4 n x i ˆ x i 2 i 3 n 4 n x i 2 100 the resulting values presented in the following section are gathered in tables 3 and 4 4 results 4 1 wave forcing assessment in nearshore application with barely no local wave growth due to weak local winds as during the two study cases considered here wave transformation processes are mostly dissipative as the dominant source terms induce the dissipation of wave energy therefore it is essential to assess the wave forcing originating from ww3 application as it accounts for most of the energy income for the case o10 ww3 results are assessed with offshore biscay buoy measurements see fig 1a for its location for the case d16 data from the waverider buoy located inside the computational domain in intermediate depth 17 m water depth are used there is an overall good agreement for each parameter as shown in fig 3 however for the case d16 a strong underestimation of h m 0 t m 02 and t p c is noticeable after the peak of the storm around october the 10th the underestimation of h m 0 reaches 0 9m 25 locally as storm waves for the case d16 were produced by tropical hurricane matthew which passed only a few hundred kilometres from the study site a small error on the storm track in the cfsr reanalysis could easily explain these larger errors but addressing this problem is outside the scope of the present study 4 2 predictive skills of depth induced breaking with default parameterizations the four depth induced breaking models presented above namely bj78 tg83 b98 and w10 were first tested on both study cases using their default parameterizations the values assigned to the different parameters of depth induced breaking formulations are recalled in table 2 the results presented hereafter with tg83 formulation were obtained with the first weight function i 0 in eq 14 but the model showed similar behaviour using one or the other expression it should be stressed that as an initial approach b is taken equal to unity in both tg83 and w10 models considering the lack of consensus for its optimal value cf sections 2 2 2 and 2 3 2 4 2 1 study case o10 firstly water levels are well reproduced by the model with a nrmse on surface elevation around 15 at vec and p3 locations see fig 4j k the results on wave parameters strongly vary depending on the depth induced breaking formulation used with tg83 and w10 formulations the results show a severe underestimation of wave energy at the peak of the storm which worsens closer to shore fig 4b and c the resulting nb 3 q on h m 0 reaches respectively 33 and 36 at vec location using the bj78 formulation reduces the underestimation of h m 0 across the instrumented profile during the storm peak but it is still observable and nb 3 q reaches 12 at vec location the b98 formulation slightly improves the results obtained with bj78 at each location the underestimation of wave energy at the peak of the storm undermines the overall nrmse on h m 0 as shown in tables 3 and 4 the results on wave periods are rather homogeneous the nrmse on t m 02 varies between 10 and 16 depending on the location and the formulation used whereas the nrmse on t p c approximately reaches 20 for each formulation 4 2 2 study case d16 for the case d16 water levels are also fairly well reproduced fig 5j k even though the uncertainty on the nominal bottom vertical location of the sensors undermines the nrmse on surface elevation 16 at the adop location for the four depth induced breaking formulations tested here the model results show a similar over dissipation of energy at the storm peak as found in the o10 case see fig 5a c when reaching the wr location a considerable fraction of the incident wave energy has already been dissipated with the tg83 formulation at the storm peak in intermediate depth fig 5a the resulting nb 3 q on h m 0 reaches 20 at as location the results show an underestimation of h m 0 at the peak of the storm for every models fig 5b and table 4 in shallower water at the adop location every formulations underestimate h m 0 even before the storm peak fig 5c the nrmse reaches 24 38 22 and 46 using bj78 tg83 b98 and w10 formulations respectively the over dissipation of incident wave energy at the peak of the storm coincides with a slight overestimation of the mean wave period the nrmse on t m 02 reaches 10 at the adop location with the w10 formulation 4 2 3 adaptive parameterizations for γ and γ t g several studies have pointed out the limitations of using a default parameterization in the bj78 formulation for instance groeneweg et al 2009 reported an underestimation of the significant wave height and of the mean period in storm conditions in finite depth conditions further for the tg83 formulation it was stressed that the ratio h r m s h in inner surf zones could vary with the beach morphology and with incident wave conditions sallenger and holman 1985 raubenheimer et al 1996 sénéchal et al 2001 to address these limitations several alternative parameterizations of the breaking index γ and γ t g have been proposed to improve depth induced breaking modelling with varying success e g see salmon et al 2015 for a review here the model sensitivity to the breaking index γ for bj78 and b98 models or γ t g for tg83 model was investigated using the most landward sensor at both field sites the parameter γ respectively γ t g was tuned in order to match the h m 0 observed at adop and vec location fig 6 these values considerably deviate from reference values e g up to a factor 2 for γ t g and their expected range of variation see for instance salmon et al 2015 and their fig 1 it is worth noting that opting for very large constant values to match the h m 0 observed in the outer surf zone is not a reasonable solution as it will result in excessive wave height in the inner surf zone for instance bertin et al 2009 showed that the adequate breaking index in the inner surf zone at oléron was 0 55 using bj78 formulation this tends to show the limitation of keeping γ respectively γ t g constant furthermore the results of this sensitivity test suggest that the local energy dissipation rate is not solely controlled by the parameterization of γ respectively γ t g indirectly highlighting the role of the breaking coefficient which is usually kept spatially constant around unity guérin et al 2018 already introduced a scaled adaptive parameterization of the tg83 formulation for both γ t g and b these two parameters were computed as a linear function of the bottom slope adjusted to give the best fit of wave heights when comparing with measurements from a field campaign carried out in february 2017 in the shoreface of oléron island 4 3 role of the breaking coefficient despite the differences between bj78 b98 models and tg83 w10 models the rate at which energy is dissipated is formulated with the same bore based approach and is parameterized with the breaking coefficient consequently the model performances using the adaptive parameterization of the breaking coefficient introduced in eq 6 are assessed it should be stressed that the introduction of the adaptive breaking coefficient in bj78 and b98 formulations would require a newly calibrated breaking index γ whereas for tg83 and w10 models the formulation of q b and its subsequent parameterization is based on observations collected in the surf zone or from laboratory experiments consequently the model performances using either tg83 w10 or bj78 b98 formulations with the adaptive parameterization of the breaking coefficient will be presented separately 4 3 1 an adaptive breaking coefficient for tg83 and w10 formulations for both study cases the model was run again using tg83 and w10 formulations with b 3 substituted by b whereas the other parameters were unchanged see table 2 for the case o10 the adaptive parameterization of the breaking coefficient removes the observed underestimations obtained with tg83 and w10 formulations fig 7a c and table 4 at the vec location the nrmse is reduced to 12 and 15 with both formulations respectively yet with the w10 formulation an overestimation of h m 0 is observed with nb 3 q reaching 5 the results on wave periods for both formulations are identical and remain very close to those obtained with the default parameterizations hence these are not reproduced here see table 3 for the case d16 the adaptive parameterization leads to an overall reduction of the negative bias on h m 0 and of the positive bias on t m 02 such that the resulting timeseries approximately overlap at the wr and as locations only shown for h m 0 see fig 7d e the nrmse on h m 0 and t m 02 are reduced at each location as shown in table 3 however the negative bias on h m 0 at the adop location remains high using tg83 and w10 formulations yielding a nrmse on h m 0 of 29 and 32 respectively 4 3 2 towards a new parameterization of bj78 and b98 formulations for the bj78 and b98 formulations the introduction of the adaptive breaking coefficient gives the same formulations for the total energy dissipation rates eqs 10 and 16 with α substituted by b furthermore if the topography of the two study areas is rather similar the study case o10 is characterized by higher peak periods see figs 4g i and 5g i therefore the contrasted results between the two study cases could presumably be related to the different incident wave conditions in order to investigate this hypothesis the dependency of the breaking index to the local non dimensional water depth k p h was investigated following the approach of ruessink et al 2003 when the breaking coefficient is taken constant the results are not improved with the parameterization of ruessink et al 2003 for the breaking index γ not shown yet the k p h dependency of γ is still expected to be valid with or without the adaptive breaking coefficient such that this parameterization could also be tested with the adaptive breaking coefficient note however that the calibration performed by ruessink et al 2003 did not employ the present adaptive breaking coefficient so that different coefficients as those originally found by these authors might be expected nevertheless finding an alternative calibration of the breaking index as defined in eq 17 falls outside the scope of the present study therefore the model was here run again with bj78 and b98 formulations by taking into account the adaptive breaking coefficient and γ as obtained by ruessink et al 2003 and given in eq 17 for the case o10 the new parameterization gives satisfactory results with the bj78 formulation the negative bias on h m 0 at the storm peak resulting from the use of the default parameterization is corrected however the dissipation is underestimated with the b98 formulation which results in an over estimation of h m 0 at vec location fig 8a c and see table 4 for the case d16 this parameterization reduces the negative bias on h m 0 during the storm peak at as location for both formulations see table 4 however the bias on h m 0 is still high at adop location fig 8f leading to a nrmse which reaches 26 and 21 respectively 5 discussion 5 1 the origin of the over dissipation obtained with default parameterizations the results show an almost systematic over dissipation of wave energy when using the default parameterizations of the four formulations for depth induced breaking source terms for both study cases the relative importance of the energy dissipation rates due to wave breaking over all source terms was computed in order to get insight into the spatial variations and the local dominance of breaking processes variation rates corresponding to the source terms associated with the energy input from the wind d i n and the energy dissipation due to whitecapping d d s bottom friction d b f and depth induced breaking d b r were extracted along a cross shore profile see figs 1b c and 2b c the relative contribution of depth induced breaking r b r was computed by normalizing the associated dissipation rate by the quadratic sum of each source term 29 r b r d b r d j 2 with d j σ m i n σ m a x 0 2 π σ s j σ θ d σ d θ where the subscript j represents either of the i n d s b f or b r subscripts for the study case o10 wave breaking induced energy dissipation modelled with the tg83 or w10 formulations is already substantial in intermediate depths 20 m and k p h 0 6 and it clearly dominates over any other dissipative processes left panels of fig 9 similar behaviour is observed for the bj78 and b98 formulations closer to shore slightly around p3 for the time displayed here left panels of fig 9 at p3 location a relatively strong divergence in terms of magnitude can be observed between the different formulations with a maximum value of 75w m 2 reached with the w10 formulation while the tg83 formulation predicts a dissipation approximately three times weaker for the case d16 the wave breaking induced energy dissipation predicted by the tg83 formulation considerably differs from the other configurations it shows a weak dissipation by depth induced breaking all along the profile even in intermediate depths k p h o 1 which seemingly explains the bias on h m 0 at wr location fig 5 in contrast the other formulations produce a sharp transition regarding depth induced breaking dominance right panels of fig 9 overall it appears that tg83 model and to a lesser extent w10 model induces a substantial over dissipation of wave energy for a wide range of k p h value starting at intermediate depths where wave breaking due to interactions with the bottom is not expected for the two other models the results for study case o10 tend to show that the over dissipation becomes substantial for k p h value of the order of 0 5 such conditions occur between as and adop locations for study case d16 the pragmatic solution proposed in this paper focuses on the role of the breaking coefficient in the formulation of the energy dissipation rate the default parameterization of each formulation only considers saturated breakers whereas the adaptive breaking coefficient in these very gently sloping shoreface area is o 0 1 which means that breakers are not saturated although the fraction of breaking waves is rather small and consequently the dissipation rates remain weak see fig 9a b once integrated up to the inner surf zone it results in a substantial dissipation of wave energy therefore the difference of the energy dissipated by a saturated breaker and a non saturated breaker explains the increasing over dissipation of wave energy which results in an underestimation of significant wave heights in the nearshore area figs 4a c and 5a c 5 2 remaining challenges the accuracy of the total wave energy dissipation rate estimates strongly depends on the fraction of breaking waves q b which remains a poorly understood quantity due to complications associated with its measurements and its natural variability e g see thornton and guza 1983 stringari and power 2019 martins et al 2020 on the one hand for tg83 and w10 models the formulation of q b and its subsequent parameterization rely on the fit of the observed fraction of breaking waves using for instance video recording e g boers 1996 to a local ratio constrained by the breaking process either the h r m s γ t g h ratio for tg83 formulation or the β β r e f ratio for w10 formulation for these two models the parameterization of q b depends both on the fitting coefficient n and on the aforementioned ratio either through γ t g or the value of β r e f the parameterizations of q b could be improved by taking into account a wider range of wave conditions and topographies for instance the reference biphase and the value of n in the weight function used for w10 model eq 18 were fitted to data from only three cases from a laboratory experiment see van der westhuysen 2010 and boers 1996 furthermore the model is particularly sensitive to the parameterization of the biphase higher value for the parameter δ could be expected according to the alternative parameterization given by doering and bowen 1995 the model was tested with δ 0 4 to assess this sensibility in the present case the corresponding results are shown fig 10 for the two study cases using δ 0 4 considerably improves the results for the d16 case whereas for the case o10 the beginning of the breaking is incorrectly predicted leading to an overestimation of significant wave heights although the biphase being a third order parameter has potential for designing a robust breaking criterion standing on physical ground more observations are probably required to improve its parameterization especially through δ on the other hand the bj78 and b98 models rely on the same miche type breaking criterion stating that a wave is breaking when its height exceeds some fraction of the local water depth given by the breaking index γ for both models the breaking index is the only parameter controlling q b it is rather questionable to ascertain a parameterization of such maximal wave height on the basis of observations outside a saturated surf zone consequently the parameterization of the breaking index typically results from calibrations or inverse modelling approach ruessink et al 2003 the counterpart is that the parameterization of the breaking index depends on the formulation used for the energy dissipation rate an explanation of the overall satisfactory results using the default parameterizations of these two formulations would be that too high breaking index partly compensates the excessive saturated dissipation rate furthermore it was shown that opting for a constant breaking index around its default value or higher could not give satisfactory results up to the inner surf zone where lower values are required bertin et al 2009 yet the adaptive parameterization of the breaking coefficient introduced in this paper is more robust physically and should be explicitly taken into account in bj78 and b98 formulations which consequently would require an adapted calibration of the breaking index it is worth noting that the pragmatic solution proposed in this study also faces the inherent limitations of bore based models for instance a number of field and laboratory observations have demonstrated that breaking processes have a certain inertia and keep being active as waves propagate in increasing water depths e g behind bars or reefs see scott et al 2005 the new parameterization of the breaking coefficient as any other existing parameterization does not account for such inertia processes surface roller models help representing these processes by slightly advecting the location where energy is actually dissipated towards the shoreline e g svendsen 1984 for instance the representation of surface rollers improve the predictions of longshore currents and their cross shore structure in the presence of sandbars in the nearshore smith et al 1993 reniers and battjes 1997 concerning the parameterization proposed in this study it is best to maintain b at a fixed level e g 0 1 over negative slopes as both study cases do not present such topographic features this solution could not be properly tested in particular this fixed value might show some site specificity and presumably needs adjustments 5 3 implications of this study the accurate modelling of storm waves has a direct impact on the computation of the wave setup which corresponds to the rise in mean water levels along the coast due to the forces exerted by short waves as they break the setup is a key component of extreme water levels and thus play an important role in coastal hazards e g guérin et al 2018 considering an alongshore uniform beach and neglecting the bottom stress the depth integrated momentum equation along a cross shore transect simplifies to a balance between the cross shore component of wave forces and the barotropic pressure gradient associated with the setup e g longuet higgins and stewart 1964 30 s x x x ρ g η h η x 0 where η corresponds to the sea surface elevation and s x x is the cross shore component of the radiation stress tensor which to first order is a direct function of the total wave energy density salmon and holthuijsen 2015 showed that inadequate depth induced breaking parameterization could lead to a local underestimation of wave forces by up to a factor of 2 this study further suggests that an early wave energy dissipation in intermediate depth should result in weaker wave forces yielding an underestimation of wave setup near the shoreline in order to verify this hypothesis we compare hereafter the wave setup computed at the coast using an adaptive parameterization of the breaking coefficient to that obtained with the default parameterization to account for various offshore wave conditions and topographies eq 30 was coupled with a 1d cross shore bulk wave model for a range of offshore wave conditions h r m s o ranging from 2 to 12 m and bottom slopes tan β ranging from 1 10000 to 1 100 a corresponding peak period was computed from h r m s o by considering an empirical shape for the energy spectrum proposed by pierson and moskowitz 1964 the resulting peak periods vary from 6 to 14 6s the wave energy dissipation by depth induced breaking was modelled after bj78 in which the maximal wave height is estimated through eq 8 with γ 0 73 this parameterization is intended to be representative of the usual implementation of depth induced breaking within spectral models for regional applications the wave setup computed at the coast is systematically higher with the depth induced breaking parameterized with the adaptive breaking coefficient fig 11 the model clearly shows a reduced energy dissipation by depth induced breaking for higher waves above gentle slopes when using the adaptive breaking coefficient such that the setup is uniform for given offshore wave conditions note that wave dissipation by bottom friction was neglected to focus on depth induced breaking but could slightly change numbers presented in this discussion particularly for the mildest slopes considered here nevertheless this result tends to show that wave setup would be substantially underestimated when using depth induced breaking default parameterization the increase of the wave setup exceeds 100 for a wide range of offshore conditions above the most gentle slopes such that it could result in a setup up to 0 5m higher fig 11b c over the last decade the increase in computational power allowed accounting for the contribution of wave breaking to storm surges at regional scale e g see dietrich et al 2011 bertin et al 2015 wu et al 2018 yet these studies presented wave setup contributions always lower than 1 m even when considering wave height reaching h r m s 12 m as these studies typically employed the bj78 model with default parameters it is expected that these values are underestimated it should be pointed out that previously published studies relying on 1d models raubenheimer et al 1996 apotsos et al 2007 reported severe underestimations of wave setup along the coast guérin et al 2018 proposed that this behaviour could be due to the wave driven depth varying circulation not accounted for in depth averaged approach of eq 30 this numerical experiment tends to show that inadequate parameterization of depth induced breaking could also result in a systematic underestimation of the wave setup under storm waves 6 conclusions in this study the third generation spectral model wwm fully coupled with a 2dh configuration of the circulation model schism was used to simulate nearshore dynamics under storm waves at two contrasting sites the results show a substantial over dissipation of wave energy by depth induced breaking using four state of the art formulations of the corresponding source terms these results highlight the limitations of the default parameterization of the depth induced breaking formulations alternatively on the basis of earlier work by le mehauté 1962 an adaptive parameterization of the breaking coefficient is introduced and leads to improved predictions in the nearshore area yet this solution will have to be verified in future studies especially over topographies presenting negative slopes e g barred beach and combined with further calibration of the fraction of breaking waves in order to be valid up to the shoreline among the possible implications of this study it is shown that the wave setup computed at the coast is significantly larger when using the adaptive parameterization for wave dissipation by breaking compared to that obtained with the default one credit authorship contribution statement m
