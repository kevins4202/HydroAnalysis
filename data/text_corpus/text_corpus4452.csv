22260,the response of near field seabed under wave loads is important to the safety of subsea structures and foundations this study investigates the wave induced response of sandy seabed adjacent a water intake through a series of large scale model tests the tests are conducted at currently the world s largest wave flume the spatial and temporal distribution of dynamic sandy seabed response under regular and irregular waves is investigated the change in excess pore water pressure and effective stress within the sandy seabed is studied through direct test measurement and combination of measurement and analytical solutions the influences of wave height wave period and overlaid armor stones on the response of soil close to the water intake are analyzed attenuation and phase lag of oscillatory pore pressure in the seabed with respect to depth is observed in the tests and the presence of the water intake amplifies the excess pore pressure in the upstream direction analysis of the effective stress shows that the principal axes of stress in the soil is subjected to continuous rotation under wave loading residual excess pore water pressure is generated in the tests of irregular

are constructed in the coastal areas with offshore water intakes which are important components of the cooling system of power generating facilities water intakes are submerged and subjected to dynamic loadings including waves currents turbulent flow and other forces during operation to enhance its stability water intakes are usually buried or semi buried in soil the generation of excess pore pressure and decease in effective stress within the soil surrounding the structure under cyclic wave loading especially during storm surges may cause degradation and even liquefaction of the soil threatening the stability of these marine structures clausen et al 1975 damgaard et al 2006 kaynia 2018 2019 on the other hand loss of effective stress within the soil may contribute to increasing sediment transport and sediment at the water intake affecting its effective operation michell et al 2006 wave induced excess pore pressure in sandy seabed has been decomposed into oscillatory pore pressure and residual pore pressure which could lead to momentary liquefaction and residual liquefaction in the soil respectively sumer 2014 the former is related to upward pore pressure gradient in the soil which usually occurs during the passage of the wave trough jeng 2003 qi and gao 2018 qi et al 2019 the latter is related to the buildup of excess pore pressure due to the contraction tendency of soil under cyclic loadings under limiting drainage conditions a large amount of research has been conducted on oscillatory pore pressure via field observations laboratory experiments analytical solutions and numerical simulations tsui and steven 1983 conducted a series of wave flume model tests and pointed out that the phase lag between the wave pressure at the seabed surface and the wave induced oscillatory pore pressure in the sandy seabed is an important factor in the wave induced instability of sandy seabed verified by okusa 1985 and liu et al 2015 through field and laboratory experiment observations zen and yamazaki 1990 suggested that the propagation of wave pressure into the seabed soil is subjected to damping and phase lag based on biot s consolidation theory 1941 and the assumption that the seabed is a poro elastic material researchers proposed analytical solutions for wave induced changes in excess pore pressure and effective stresses in the seabed soil madsen 1978 yamamoto et al 1978 hsu and jeng 1994 tsai and lee 1995 etc for the residual pore pressure simplified analytical solutions have been proposed under the framework of biot s consolidation theory mcdougal et al 1989 jeng et al 2007 jeng 2012 guo et al 2019b and numerical simulations have been conducted using various constitutive models yang and ye 2018 centrifuge wave flume tests have been conducted by sassa and sekiguchi 1999 and miyamoto et al 2004 to provide experimental data on the generation of residual pore pressure in sandy seabed soils due to the small dimensions of centrifuge models only relatively few transducers can be placed for data acquisition in such tests 1 g laboratory tests can provide a means to facilitate more systematic data acquisition plans but due to the limitations in wave flume size and wave generation capability reports on investigation into residual pore pressure in 1 g laboratory wave tests are scarce in chang et al 2007 s large wave tests oscillatory pore pressure is analyzed although much research has been conducted on the interactions of seabed and structures under wave loading including pipelines macpherson 1978 gao and wu 2006 lin et al 2016 guo et al 2019a sun et al 2019 mono piles lin et al 2017 hong et al 2017a sui et al 2017 2019 and breakwaters mizutani et al 1998 jeng et al 2013 liao et al 2018 the dynamic responses of sandy seabed near water intakes has seldom been investigated the wave pressure wave currents and interaction of wave structure around a water intake induced by wave loadings are unique due to its configuration and function possibly resulting in different upstream and downstream excess pore pressure response in the soil affecting the stability of the structure therefore the response of sandy seabed adjacent water intake structures should be evaluated in this study large scale wave flume tests are conducted based on a power station project at the coast of the persian gulf to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of dynamic sandy seabed response under regular and irregular waves adjacent a water intake of the power station the influences of wave height wave period and overlaid armor stones on the excess pore pressure generation within the soil close to the water intake are analyzed 1 1 test setup the large scale wave flume facility at tianjin research institute of water transport engineering tiwte is used to conduct the tests in this study which is currently the world s largest and has the strongest wave generation capability the length width and the largest depth of the wave flume are 456 m 5 m and 12 m respectively the large wave flume consists of three sections i e wave generation section experiment section and wave absorbing section the depth and width of the wave paddle in the wave generation section are 11 m and 5 m which can generate regular and irregular waves with common wave spectra for regular waves the maximum wave height can reach 3 5 m with the wave period between 2s and 10s the tests are conducted in the experiment section of the flume within a trench excavated with length width and depth of 2 85 m 5 m and 0 78 m respectively a cross section of the model in the wave propagation direction is illustrated in fig 1 in laboratory tests scaling laws are adopted to simulate the model in prototype which are different for gravitation force friction elastic force and surface tension however for tests on pressure dependent materials such as soil 1 g reduced scale models are often inadequate in reproducing their realistic behavior by using the large wave flume in tiwte the influence of inconsistent scale effects can be limited to a minimum under existing technological conditions aiding the acquisition of more realistic test data zhang and geng 2015 the tests conducted in this study are based on a particular power station water intake project with the model to prototype scale of 1 8 in this study all reported dimensions and results are measurements in the model scale without any upscaling wave induced excess pore pressure and liquefaction in saturated or nearly saturated sandy seabed mainly occur in shallow depths therefore the transducers within the soil are mainly located in shallow depths figs 1 and 2 two types of transducers are adopted one being pore pressure transducers ppt buried in sandy seabed the other being water pressure transducers wpt placed at the surfaces of the armor stones and the sandy seabed the ppts and wpts used in this study are cylinders 0 8 cm in diameter and 1 2 cm tall the ppts have 40 kpa and 50 kpa capacities and accuracy of 0 2 the capacity and accuracy of the wpt are 30 kpa and 0 5 respectively the small dimension of the transducer minimizes its influence on soil response fig 2 provides the locations of transducers within the model fig 3 shows photos of the wave flume tests the water intake is modelled using a concrete cylinder with diameter and height of 1 m and 1 65 m respectively and can be separated into a top and a bottom half a circular roof with diameter of 1 94 m is connected to the top of the water intake the top half of the water intake is open supported by columns allowing water to flow through fig 3 and has limited influence on wave progression the bottom half is a closed cylinder the water intake is embedded in sand and armor stones the thickness width and base length of the sandy seabed are 0 58 m 5 0 m and 2 85 m respectively during the construction of the test model the bottom half of the water intake is first placed at the middle of the trench fig 3 a the trench is then filled with sand under pluviation and compaction to reach the desired density fig 3 b upon connecting the top half of the water intake to its bottom half armor stones are overlaid around the water intake fig 3 c finally water is filled into the flume to saturate the soil and armor stones the sand used in the tests has specific gravity g s 2 64 mean grain size d 50 0 26 mm maximum void ratio e max 0 973 and minimum void ratio e m in 0 50 for the tests in this study relative density d r 74 6 and void ratio e 0 62 are achieved at which state the soil permeability k is 1 15 10 4 m s table 1 lists the 20 wave flume tests conducted and analyzed in this paper including 13 tests under regular waves r 1 to r 13 and 7 tests under irregular waves ir 1 to ir 7 for the regular wave flume tests the water depth is 2 31 m with wave height ranging from 6 3 cm to 37 5 cm and wave period between 2 8s and 4 9s the tests are conducted both with and without overlaid armor stones the regular waves in this study are stokes s 2nd order waves lé mehauté 1976 for which the water surface elevation dispersion relation and the wave pressure p b at the seabed surface excluding the hydrostatic pressure can be expressed by eq 1 eq 2 and eq 3 respectively 1 η h 2 cos k x ω t π h 8 h l cosh k h cos 2 k h 2 sinh 3 k h cos 2 k x ω t 2 ω 2 g k tanh k h 3 p b γ w h 2 1 cosh k h cos k x ω t 3 γ w π h 2 4 l 1 sinh 2 k h 1 sinh 2 k h 1 3 cos 2 k x ω t in which η is the wave elevation h is wave height h is water depth l is wavelength the wave number k 2 π l the wave radian frequency ω 2 π t with t being the wave period g is gravitational acceleration γ w is the unit weight of water compared with progressive linear wave the stokes s 2nd order wave is non linear with a second order term so the wave crest and trough are not symmetric with respect to the still water level and the height of the wave crest is usually larger than that of the wave trough for the irregular wave tests the random wave is generated using the jonswap joint north sea wave project spectrum which illustrates an empirical relationship between energy and wave frequency in ocean environments according to hasselmann et al 1973 energy s f can be expressed as 4 s f β j h s 2 t p 4 f 5 exp 1 25 t p f 4 γ exp t p f 1 2 2 s 2 in which 5 β j 0 0624 1 094 0 01915 ln γ 0 23 0 0336 γ 0

frequency corresponding to the spectral peak the peak wave period t p 1 f p γ is the peak enhancement factor controlling the sharpness of the spectral peak which is 3 3 in the tests of this study for the irregular wave flume tests the water depth is 2 31 m or 2 16 m with significant wave height ranging from 12 5 cm to 51 cm and significant wave period between 3 0s and 4 0s the tests are conducted with overlaid armor stones 1 2 transient dynamic responses close to the water intake under regular waves once waves are applied to the seabed surface excess pore pressure propagates transiently in the seabed soil generating excess pore pressure gradient and subsequent seepage force on the soil skeleton resulting in change of effective stresses when the soil is under the wave crest seepage force is downwards leading to an increase in vertical effective stress when the soil is under the wave trough seepage force is upwards leading to a decrease in vertical effective stress once the upward seepage force exceeds the initial vertical effective stress of the seabed soil momentary liquefaction occurs and soil may reach and leave the state of liquefaction periodically under continued wave loadings in a poro elastic seabed here the basic transient pore pressure response of the sandy seabed under regular waves close to the water intake is presented in detail for the typical wave flume test r 1 in test r 1 the progressive regular wave has water depth h wave height h and wave period t of 2 31 m 37 5 cm and 4 9s respectively the total duration of the flume test is 25 wave periods and the wave pressure was measured when the amplitude of the generated wave reaches a stable value according to the dispersion equation in eq 2 the corresponding wavelength l is 21 8 m which is much greater than the diameter of the water intake after wave generation it immediately propagates to the top of armor stones and then downwards to the sandy seabed fig 4 shows the wave pressure p b at the top and bottom of armor stones for a typical time frame of 30s 40s as shown in fig 2 a7 1 and a7 are upstream of the water intake while b7 1 and b7 are in the symmetrical downstream positions the wave pressure at the upstream and the downstream have a phase lag δt 1 0s based on the stokes 2nd order wave theory the wave velocity of test r 1 is approximately 4 4 m s the horizontal distance between a7 1 and b7 1 is 3 9 m thus the calculated phase lag δt 0 9s which is close to the measured result for one period from 31s to 35 9s at a7 1 the wave reaches its trough and crest at 31 66s of 1 806 kpa and at 34 52s of 2 081 kpa respectively while at a7 wave reaches its trough and crest at 31 70s of 1 709 kpa and at 34 53s of 1 923 kpa respectively it can be seen that the wave pressures at the bottom of the armor stones are slightly smaller than the ones at the top of armor stones showing marginal attenuation of water pressure and almost no phase lag from z 20 cm to z 0 cm within the armor stones the time history of wave induced water pressure at a1 in test r 1 is plotted in fig 5 a the water pressure time histories at other horizontal surface positions are qualitatively alike and not presented for conciseness fig 5 b plots the wave pressure at the trough p b 1 and wave pressure at the crest p b 2 at various locations during the time frame of 20s 40s the water pressure relative to the still water pressure at the crest is always larger compared with that at the corresponding trough at the seabed surface the amplitude of water pressure increases slightly from a7 to a3 and decreases slightly from a3 to b7 at position a3 just upstream of the water intake roof the water pressure reaches maximum which is likely due to the reflection of the progressive wave at position a1 where the seabed soil is the closest to the water intake the wave pressure is the smallest at the upstream of the water intake due to the influence of the intake roof however it should be pointed out that since the top half of the water intake cylinder is open allowing water to flow through fig 2 the influence of refection waves above seabed is limited which is backed by the only slight change in wave amplitude along the seabed in fig 5 b the evolution of surface water pressure generates excess pore pressure within the soil which is measured with pore pressure transducers ppt the excess pore pressure time histories at z 10cm for various locations are plotted in fig 6 showing largely transient fluctuation in test r 1 without accumulation which is consistent for all of the ppt measurements in this test irrespective of the location and depth these results indicate that the excess pore pressure induced by the regular wave in this test is mainly oscillatory pore pressure at each location in fig 6 the excess pore pressure p 1 at the trough and p 2 at the crest at z 10cm is indicated corresponding to p b 1 and p b 2 at the surface in fig 5 a it can be seen that the amplitude of excess pore pressure fluctuation on the upstream side becomes greater with decreasing distance from the water intake fig 6 a i e from x 110cm to x 10cm jeng et al 2005 suggested that the interaction between an incident wave and its reflected waves from a vertical wall could increase the pore pressure amplitude within the sandy seabed in this study the bottom half of the water intake which is a closed cylinder embedded in soil acts as a vertical wall generating reflected waves on the upstream side causing the observed increase in pore pressure in adjacent soil the excess pore pressure fluctuation amplitude in the downstream side is much smaller compared with the symmetrical positions in the upstream fig 6 b as reflection does not occur downstream the excess pore pressure within the time frame from 30s to 40 s at various locations in test r 1 are plotted in fig 7 to investigate the phase lag and attenuation of the excess pore pressure at different locations it can be seen that at the same horizontal position the wave induced excess pore pressure in the sandy seabed reaches its crest or trough at different moments for different depths for x 10cm the wave induced excess pore pressure reaches p 2 at moments 35 14s 35 46s 36 02s and 36 16 s at z 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm and 40cm respectively u11 u12 u13 and u14 compared with u11 the phase lags of u12 u13 and u14 are 0 32s 0 88s and 1 02s respectively for x 30cm x 50cm x 70cm and x 150 cm the phase lags of excess pore pressure between z 10cm and z 30cm are all around 0 9s according to the theoretical solutions of madsen 1978 and hsu and jeng 1994 while fully saturated sandy seabed should exhibit no phase lag in excess pore pressure at different depths even a small air content could lead to the observed phase lag in the tests this indicates that although the sandy seabed is immersed in the water for 30 days before the tests full saturation is not still achieved the regular waves conducted in the wave flume tests satisfy the stokes 2nd order theory and the elevations of wave crest and trough are not symmetrical a normalized oscillatory pore pressure value p p 1 p b 1 p 2 p b 2 2 is evaluated which also reflects the attenuation rate of excess pore pressure smaller p indicates greater attenuation to further investigate the attenuation pattern of the oscillatory pore pressure attenuation rates at z 10cm are analyzed in table 2 including p 1 p b 1 p 2 p b 2 and p it can be seen that the oscillatory pore pressure attenuation is least significant close to the water intake fig 6 a and table 2 due to effects of reflection it is also observed in fig 7 that the wave induced excess pore pressure attenuates gradually with increasing depth the vertical distribution of normalized wave induced excess pore pressure p for x 10cm x 30cm x 50cm and x 70cm is shown in fig 8 the wave induced excess pore pressure attenuates significantly in the shallow seabed especially at x 70cm and p is less than 0 1 when the soil is deeper than z 30cm showing that there is almost no wave induced excess pore pressure in the deeper seabed due to the significant interaction of soil and wave in the shallow sandy seabed it should be noted that the degree of saturation s r of soil is difficult to measure precisely in the field we determined the overall s r 97 by matching hsu and jeng 1994 s analytical solutions with the measure data p table 2 and fig 8 in all of the tests conducted in this study the maximum measured displacement of the water intake itself is 0 22 mm in test ir 1 therefore it is safe to assume that the influence of structure displacement on the response within the seabed soil is trivial compared to that of the wave load and is neglected in this study 1 3 analysis of wave induced effective stress change the excess pore pressure influences effective stress of the soil since effective stress cannot be directly measured in the tests to investigate the wave induced effective stress change in the sandy seabed of test r 1 solutions by zen and yamazaki 1990 and hsu and jeng 1994 are adopted 1 3 1 zen and yamazaki 1990 s simplified method zen and yamazaki 1990 proposed a simplified equation for the wave induced change of soil vertical effective stress δ σ v in eq 8 represented by the difference between wave pressure p b and excess pore pressure p and suggested the criterion for momentary liquefaction in eq 9 when the upward seepage force induced by waves exceed the initial vertical effective stress of seabed soil 8 δ σ v p b p 9 σ v 0 p b p 0 here σ v 0 is the initial vertical effective stress for the test conditions in this study the initial vertical effective stress can be calculated by 10 σ v 0 γ s a t γ w z 1 γ s t o n e γ w z 2 where γ s a t and γ s t o n e are the saturated unit weight of sand and armor stones respectively z 1 and z 2 are the thickness of sand and armor stones respectively in the shallow sandy seabed σ v 0 at u11 u21 or u31 is almost as twice as σ v 0 at u41 u51 or u61 due to greater armor stone layer thickness fig 9 plots the wave induced water pressure at seabed surface excess pore pressure and effective stress changes at z 10cm in test r 1 at a typical position with x 50cm the water pressure at a3 excess pore pressure at u31 and the corresponding δ σ v time histories at z 10cm are plotted in fig 9 a it can be seen that δ σ v fluctuates transiently and periodically with the minimal and maximal values occurring near the wave trough and crest respectively during 30s 40s in close up in fig 9 b δ σ v 1 and δ σ v 2 are the minimum and maximum δ σ v corresponding to the wave trough p b 1 and peak p b 2 respectively the absolute values of δ σ v 1 and δ σ v 2 are smaller than those of p b 1 and p b 2 due to the attenuation of wave induced excess pore pressure p based on eq 9 momentary liquefaction has higher potential to occur when δ σ v δ p p b p reaches its minimum the initial vertical effective stress and wave induced minimum δ σ v are also plotted in fig 9 c for comparison there is no occurrence of momentary liquefaction in the shallow sandy seabed of test r 1 even though the vertical effective stress at u51 can decrease to approximately 1 kpa 1 3 2 hsu and jeng 1994 s theoretical solutions zen and yamazaki 1990 s method can only evaluate wave induced vertical effective stress hsu and jeng 1994 developed a more generalized theory for wave induced changes in pore pressures and effective stresses including vertical and horizontal normal stresses and shear stress based on biot s consolidation theory biot 1941 for a compressible pore fluid in an elastic porous medium the parameters needed for test r 1 in hsu and jeng 1994 s analytical solutions are listed in table 3 in this study the wave and seabed related parameters are obtained from the test configurations the soil porosity n is calculated after sample preparation while the soil permeability k x and k z are assumed to be the same as that measured in constant water head tests elastic parameters μ and g are determined based on triaxial laboratory experiments hong et al 2017b the calculated wave induced amplitude of vertical normal stress horizontal normal stress and shear stress expressed in terms of δ σ v a p 0 δ σ h a p 0 and τ v h a p 0 with p 0 being the maximum wave pressure at the seabed surface at different horizontal positions at z 10cm upstream of the water intake in test r 1 are plotted in fig 10 a based on hsu and jeng 1994 s analytical solutions and are compared with the excess pore pressure attenuation p normalized oscillatory pore pressure the smaller p is due to attenuation with respect to depth the greater the changes in effective stress in terms of δ σ v a p 0 and δ σ h a p 0 are evident from fig 10 a the normalized shear stress τ v h a p 0 is much smaller compared with δ σ v a p 0 and δ σ h a p 0 compared with zen and yamazaki 1990 s simplified method hsu and jeng 1994 s solution yields slightly larger change in vertical effective stress but with similar patterns in general fig 10 b hsu and jeng 1994 s solution has the advantage in allowing the analysis of the evolution of the full stress path which is shown in fig 11 in terms of τ v h a p 0 versus δ σ v δ σ h 2 p 0 clear evidence of principal stress axes rotation induced by waves is observed a phenomenon first analyzed by ishihara 1983 for seabed subjected to wave loads which has been indicated to have significant influence on the mechanical behavior of sand wang et al 2019 xue et al 2019 in fig 11 the three values for p are chosen as p 0 113 at u51 p 0 446 at u11 and p 1 0 to illustrate its influence on the stress path with smaller p the deviation stress δ σ v δ σ h 2 becomes greater and the stress path in fig 11 becomes more elongated in the lateral direction 1 4 parametric analysis for regular waves the soil response under regular waves can be affected by the wave characteristics and seabed profile to investigate the influence of some of these factors on the oscillatory pore pressure in the sandy seabed tests with various wave heights and periods r 1 to r 9 and with and without armor stones at seabed surface r 1 to r 4 and r 10 to r 13 are conducted as listed in table 1 1 4 1 wave height for the tests with different wave heights r 1 r 5 to r 9 the horizontal distribution of normalized oscillatory pore pressure p at z 10cm is plotted in fig 12 the influence of wave height on the distribution of p is negligible though the absolute value of excess pore pressure p becomes greater with increasing wave height due to the increase in wave pressure the increase in p with decreasing distance to the water intake again shows that the attenuation of excess pore pressure becomes weaker close to the water intake the upstream excess pore pressure is in general greater than its downstream counterpart 1 4 2 wave period the influence of wave period on the horizontal distribution of p at z 10cm is investigated through tests r 1 to r 4 fig 13 the overall horizontal distribution of p is similar for different wave periods though p decreases slightly with decreasing wave period according to eq 2 when the wave period decreases from t 4 9s to t 2 8s the wavelength decreases from 21 8 m to 10 7 m resulting in the increase in wave number k based on the solution of hsu and jeng 1994 wave induced excess pore pressure attenuation in the shallow seabed is greater for larger wave number k 1 4 3 armor stones the overlaid armor stones at the seabed surface can enhance the stability of the water intake by generating extra effective stress in the seabed around to investigate the influence of the armor stones on the horizontal distribution of pore pressure attenuation rate p in the sandy seabed tests r 10 to r 13 without the armor stones are conducted in direct comparison with tests r 1 to r 4 compared with the results in fig 13 without the armor stone the upstream p becomes smaller as shown in fig 14 especially its maximum value at x 10cm indicating stronger pore pressure attenuation and change in soil effective stress these parametric studies indicate that the wave height almost has little influence on the spatial distribution of p close to the water intake and p declines slightly with decreasing wave period the overlaid armor stones has significant influence on the spatial distribution of p close to the water intake 1 5 analysis of excess pore pressure under random wave loadings 1 5 1 spatial distribution of excess pore pressure under random wave loadings in most of the regular wave flume tests conducted and analyzed in this study little to no residual pore pressure is observed in actual ocean environments large waves with irregular wave heights and wave periods can generate significant residual pore pressure test ir 1 is conducted with random waves generated by the jonswap spectrum with larger wave height than the tests under regular waves to investigate the spatial distribution of random wave induced excess pore pressure and especially residual excess pore pressure generation close to the water intake in test ir 1 table 1 the water depth h significant wave height h s and significant wave period t s are 2 31 m 51 0 cm and 3 6s respectively fig 15 a plots the full time history of the seabed surface wave pressure at location a7 to depict a whole picture for the random wave the maximum wave pressure reaches 3 168 kpa and the minimum wave pressure reaches 2 616 kpa close ups of the wave pressure at typical positions of a1 a7 a7 1 and b7 during 50s 100s are further plotted in fig 15 b showing similar wave amplitudes at each location comparison of a7 1 and a7 shows that the time histories of random wave pressures at the top and bottom of the armor stones are similar with negligible attenuation the random wave pressures at a7 and b7 have a phase lag of approximately 1 4s the random wave s form changes slightly during wave propagation which is different to the unchanged form of the regular waves in fig 4 as shown in fig 16 due to the wave reflection by the water intake the amplitude of random wave induced excess pore pressure on the upstream side is greatest at u11 closest to the water intake while on the downstream side the amplitude of excess pore pressure is smaller than that at upstream positions symmetrical with respect to the water intake a significant difference between the results from test ir 1 from the regular wave tests is the accumulation of excess pore pressures at several locations at u51 d11 and d31 the residual pore pressure is 0 4 kpa 0 45 kpa and 0 1 kpa respectively at these locations the attenuation of oscillatory pore pressure is stronger than that at other horizontal positions at the same seabed depth as shown in fig 11 stronger attenuation of oscillatory pore pressure generates greater cyclic loading which would induce stronger shearing and contraction in the sand resulting in excess pore pressure accumulation although residual pore pressure is measured in this tests its value does not reach the initial vertical effective stress and residual liquefaction not occurs under the test conditions note that in the regular wave tests when the wave period frequency is relatively large e g test r 4 very slight accumulation of excess pore pressure is also observed at u51 d11 and d13 locations 1 5 2 parametric analysis for random waves to investigate the influence of significant wave height on random wave induced residual pore pressure another six random waves are conducted as listed in table 1 in test ir 2 and ir 3 the water depth h 2 31 m and significant wave period t s 3 4 s are the same while significant wave height h s of 37 5 cm and 25 0 cm respectively excess pore pressure of test ir 2 also accumulates at u51 d11 and d13 which has greater wave height compared with test ir 3 the comparison of typical results from test ir 2 and test ir 3 is shown in fig 17 fig 17 a illustrates that variations of the generated wave pressure for the two tests are almost identical except for the magnitudes of the wave amplitude based on the significant wave height at u41 in the upstream of the water intake random wave induced excess pore pressure of test ir 2 and test ir 3 only oscillate transiently where greater fluctuations are observed for test ir 2 fig 17 b at d11 in the downstream of the water intake the residual pore pressure of test ir 2 is approximately twice as that of test ir 3 fig 17 c showing that with larger significant wave height the random wave induced residual pore pressure tends to be greater in other random wave tests ir 4 to ir 7 listed in table 1 the water depth h is 2 16 m in test ir 4 the random wave induced excess pore pressure also accumulates at d13 in the downstream of the water intake fig 18 a in test ir 5 test ir 6 and test ir 7 with greater significant wave period t s 4 0 s the significant wave heights h s are 37 5 cm 25 0 cm and 12 5 cm respectively at d31 in the downstream of the water intake residual pore pressure only occurs in test ir 5 with greater significant wave height in the tests conducted in this study the pore pressure transducers and water pressure transducers are embedded and not fixed the pore pressure transducers are buried at depth greater or equal to 10 cm where the soil does not liquefy based on observations during the tests very limited amount of particles at the interface between sand and armor stones move therefore the movement of the ppts along with the soil particle is negligible the wpts at z 0 cm are positioned under armor stones where the effects of scour or sand movement are limited after the tests without armor stones the wpts are checked showing that the initial positions are maintained 2 conclusions the behavior of sandy seabed subjected to wave loads adjacent a water intake is investigated in this study through 20 large scale laboratory model tests conducted at the large wave flume facility at tianjin research institute of water transport engineering tiwte the temporal and spatial evolution of pore water pressure and stresses within the soil is analyzed under different test configurations including different wave and soil setups attenuation and phase lag of oscillatory pore pressure are observed along the depth of the sandy seabed in the wave flume tests the oscillatory pore pressure attenuates significantly at shallow depths the presence of the water intake affects the horizontal distribution of excess pore pressure amplitude in adjacent soils on the upstream side increasing excess pore pressure is observed in the seabed soil with decreasing distance to the intake on the downstream side the excess pore pressure is smaller than that on the upstream side detailed analysis of wave induced effective stress in one typical test is conducted through zen and yamazaki 1990 s simplified method and hsu and jeng 1994 s analytical solution both methods yield similar results for the evolution of vertical effective stress during the tests furthermore hsu and jeng 1994 s analytical solution provides a means to assess the horizontal stress and shear stress along with the vertical stress which shows that the principal axes of stress within the seabed rotates continuously under wave loads residual pore pressure is observed in the tests induced by irregular waves with relatively large heights and regular waves with relatively high frequencies at certain locations in the seabed where attenuation of oscillatory pore pressure is more significant which induces stronger shearing and contraction in the sand a parametric study is conducted to investigate the influence of wave heights wave periods and seabed setups on the response of soil close to the water intake it is observed that while the wave height affects the value of pore pressure in the soil it does not influence the spatial distribution pattern of normalized oscillatory pore pressure p p decreases slightly with decreasing wave period overlaid armor stones above the seabed can significantly reduce pore pressure attenuation resulting in reduced cyclic loading in the soil in the wave flume tests conducted in this study the wave intensity is limited to a maximum of 51 cm and a sand with relatively high permeability is used resulting in small residual pore pressure and no occurrence of liquefaction future studies should be conducted with stronger waves and finer sand and also more wave spectra types to investigate the influence of soil liquefaction on the stability of the water

22260,the response of near field seabed under wave loads is important to the safety of subsea structures and foundations this study investigates the wave induced response of sandy seabed adjacent a water intake through a series of large scale model tests the tests are conducted at currently the world s largest wave flume the spatial and temporal distribution of dynamic sandy seabed response

oscillatory pore pressure in the seabed with respect to depth is observed in the tests and the presence of the water intake amplifies the excess pore pressure in the upstream direction analysis of the

are constructed in the coastal areas with offshore water intakes which are important components of the cooling system of power generating facilities water intakes are submerged and subjected to dynamic loadings including waves currents turbulent flow and other forces during operation to enhance its stability water intakes are usually buried or semi buried in soil the generation of excess pore pressure and decease in effective stress within the soil surrounding the structure under cyclic wave loading especially during storm surges may cause degradation and even liquefaction of the soil threatening the stability of these marine structures clausen et al 1975 damgaard et al 2006 kaynia 2018 2019 on the other hand loss of effective stress within the soil may contribute to increasing sediment transport and sediment at the water intake affecting its effective operation michell et al 2006 wave induced excess pore pressure in sandy seabed has been decomposed into oscillatory pore pressure and residual pore pressure which could lead to momentary liquefaction and residual liquefaction in the soil respectively sumer 2014 the former is related to upward pore pressure gradient in the soil which usually occurs during the passage of the wave trough jeng 2003 qi and gao 2018 qi et al 2019 the latter is related to the buildup of excess pore pressure due to the contraction tendency of soil under cyclic loadings under limiting drainage conditions a large amount of research has been conducted on oscillatory pore pressure via field observations laboratory experiments analytical solutions and numerical simulations tsui and steven 1983 conducted a series of wave flume model tests and pointed out that the phase lag between the wave pressure at the seabed surface and the wave induced oscillatory pore pressure in the sandy seabed is an important factor in the wave induced instability of sandy seabed verified by okusa 1985 and liu et al 2015 through field and laboratory experiment observations zen and yamazaki 1990 suggested that the propagation of wave pressure into the seabed soil is subjected to damping and phase lag based on biot s consolidation theory 1941 and the assumption that the seabed is a poro elastic material researchers proposed analytical solutions for wave induced changes in excess pore pressure and effective stresses in the seabed soil madsen 1978 yamamoto et al 1978 hsu and jeng 1994 tsai and lee 1995 etc for the residual pore pressure simplified analytical solutions have been proposed under the framework of biot s consolidation theory mcdougal et al 1989 jeng et al 2007 jeng 2012 guo et al 2019b and numerical simulations have been conducted using various constitutive models yang and ye 2018 centrifuge wave flume tests have been conducted by sassa and sekiguchi 1999 and miyamoto et al 2004 to provide experimental data on the generation of residual pore pressure in sandy seabed soils due to the small dimensions of centrifuge models only relatively few transducers can be placed for data acquisition in such tests 1 g laboratory tests can provide a means to facilitate more systematic data acquisition plans but due to the limitations in wave flume size and wave generation capability reports on investigation into residual pore pressure in 1 g laboratory wave tests are scarce in chang et al 2007 s large wave tests oscillatory pore pressure is analyzed although much research has been conducted on the interactions of seabed and structures under wave loading including pipelines macpherson 1978 gao and wu 2006 lin et al 2016 guo et al 2019a sun et al 2019 mono piles lin et al 2017 hong et al 2017a sui et al 2017 2019 and breakwaters mizutani et al 1998 jeng et al 2013 liao et al 2018 the dynamic responses of sandy seabed near water intakes has seldom been investigated the wave pressure wave currents and interaction of wave structure around a water intake induced by wave loadings are unique due to its configuration and function possibly resulting in different upstream and downstream excess pore pressure response in the soil affecting the stability of the structure therefore the response of sandy seabed adjacent water intake structures should be evaluated in this study large scale wave flume tests are conducted based on a power station project at the coast of the persian gulf to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of dynamic sandy seabed response under regular and irregular waves adjacent a water intake of the power station the influences of wave height wave period and overlaid armor stones on the excess pore pressure generation within the soil close to the water intake are analyzed 1 1 test setup the large scale wave flume facility at tianjin research institute of water transport engineering tiwte is used to conduct the tests in this study which is currently the world s largest and has the strongest wave generation capability the length width and the largest depth of the wave flume are 456 m 5 m and 12 m respectively the large wave flume consists of three sections i e wave generation section experiment section and wave absorbing section the depth and width of the wave paddle in the wave generation section are 11 m and 5 m which can generate regular and irregular waves with common wave spectra for regular waves the maximum wave height can reach 3 5 m with the wave period between 2s and 10s the tests are conducted in the experiment section of the flume within a trench excavated with length width and depth of 2 85 m 5 m and 0 78 m respectively a cross section of the model in the wave propagation direction is illustrated in fig 1 in laboratory tests scaling laws are adopted to simulate the model in prototype which are different for gravitation force friction elastic force and surface tension however for tests on pressure dependent materials such as soil 1 g reduced scale models are often inadequate in reproducing their realistic behavior by using the large wave flume in tiwte the influence of inconsistent scale effects can be limited to a minimum under existing technological conditions aiding the acquisition of more realistic test data zhang and geng 2015 the tests conducted in this study are based on a particular power station water intake project with the model to prototype scale of 1 8 in this study all reported dimensions and results are measurements in the model scale without any upscaling wave induced excess pore pressure and liquefaction in saturated or nearly saturated sandy seabed mainly occur in shallow depths therefore the transducers within the soil are mainly located in shallow depths figs 1 and 2 two types of transducers are adopted one being pore pressure transducers ppt buried in sandy seabed the other being water pressure transducers wpt placed at the surfaces of the armor stones and the sandy seabed the ppts and wpts used in this study are cylinders 0 8 cm in diameter and 1 2 cm tall the ppts have 40 kpa and 50 kpa capacities and accuracy of 0 2 the capacity and accuracy of the wpt are 30 kpa and 0 5 respectively the small dimension of the transducer minimizes its influence on soil response fig 2 provides the locations of transducers within the model fig 3 shows photos of the wave flume tests the water intake is modelled using a concrete cylinder with diameter and height of 1 m and 1 65 m respectively and can be separated into a top and a bottom half a circular roof with diameter of 1 94 m is connected to the top of the water intake the top half of the water intake is open supported by columns allowing water to flow through fig 3 and has limited influence on wave progression the bottom half is a closed cylinder the water intake is embedded in sand and armor stones the thickness width and base length of the sandy seabed are 0 58 m 5 0 m and 2 85 m respectively during the construction of the test model the bottom half of the water intake is first placed at the middle of the trench fig 3 a the trench is then filled with sand under pluviation and compaction to reach the desired density fig 3 b upon connecting the top half of the water intake to its bottom half armor stones are overlaid around the water intake fig 3 c finally water is filled into the flume to saturate the soil and armor stones the sand used in the tests has specific gravity g s 2 64 mean grain size d 50 0 26 mm maximum void ratio e max 0 973 and minimum void ratio e m in 0 50 for the tests in this study relative density d r 74 6 and void ratio e 0 62 are achieved at which state the soil permeability k is 1 15 10 4 m s table 1 lists the 20 wave flume tests conducted and analyzed in this paper including 13 tests under regular waves r 1 to r 13 and 7 tests under irregular waves ir 1 to ir 7 for the regular wave flume tests the water depth is 2 31 m with wave height ranging from 6 3 cm to 37 5 cm and wave period between 2 8s and 4 9s the tests are conducted both with and without overlaid armor stones the regular waves in this study are stokes s 2nd order waves lé mehauté 1976 for which the water surface elevation dispersion relation and the wave pressure p b at the seabed surface excluding the hydrostatic pressure can be expressed by eq 1 eq 2 and eq 3 respectively 1 η h 2 cos k x ω t π h 8 h l cosh k h cos 2 k h 2 sinh 3 k h cos 2 k x ω t 2 ω 2 g k tanh k h 3 p b γ w h 2 1 cosh k h cos k x ω t 3 γ w π h 2 4 l 1 sinh 2 k h 1 sinh 2 k h 1 3 cos 2 k x ω t in which η is the wave elevation h is wave height h is water depth l is wavelength the wave number k 2 π l the wave radian frequency ω 2 π t with t being the wave period g is gravitational acceleration γ w is the unit weight of water compared with progressive linear wave the stokes s 2nd order wave is non linear with a second order term so the wave crest and trough are not symmetric with respect to the still water level and the height of the wave crest is usually larger than that of the wave trough for the irregular wave tests the random wave is generated using the jonswap joint north sea wave project spectrum which illustrates an empirical relationship between energy and wave frequency in ocean environments according to hasselmann et al 1973 energy s f can be expressed as 4 s f β j h s 2 t p 4 f 5 exp 1 25 t p f 4 γ exp t p f 1 2 2 s 2 in which 5 β j 0 0624 1 094 0 01915 ln γ 0 23 0 0336 γ 0

frequency corresponding to the spectral peak the peak wave period t p 1 f p γ is the peak enhancement factor controlling the sharpness of the spectral peak which is 3 3 in the tests of this study for the irregular wave flume tests the water depth is 2 31 m or 2 16 m with significant wave height ranging from 12 5 cm to 51 cm and significant wave period between 3 0s and 4 0s the tests are conducted with overlaid armor stones 1 2 transient dynamic responses close to the water intake under regular waves once waves are applied to the seabed surface excess pore pressure propagates transiently in the seabed soil generating excess pore pressure gradient and subsequent seepage force on the soil skeleton resulting in change of effective stresses when the soil is under the wave crest seepage force is downwards leading to an increase in vertical effective stress when the soil is under the wave trough seepage force is upwards leading to a decrease in vertical effective stress once the upward seepage force exceeds the initial vertical effective stress of the seabed soil momentary liquefaction occurs and soil may reach and leave the state of liquefaction periodically under continued wave loadings in a poro elastic seabed here the basic transient pore pressure response of the sandy seabed under regular waves close to the water intake is presented in detail for the typical wave flume test r 1 in test r 1 the progressive regular wave has water depth h wave height h and wave period t of 2 31 m 37 5 cm and 4 9s respectively the total duration of the flume test is 25 wave periods and the wave pressure was measured when the amplitude of the generated wave reaches a stable value according to the dispersion equation in eq 2 the corresponding wavelength l is 21 8 m which is much greater than the diameter of the water intake after wave generation it immediately propagates to the top of armor stones and then downwards to the sandy seabed fig 4 shows the wave pressure p b at the top and bottom of armor stones for a typical time frame of 30s 40s as shown in fig 2 a7 1 and a7 are upstream of the water intake while b7 1 and b7 are in the symmetrical downstream positions the wave pressure at the upstream and the downstream have a phase lag δt 1 0s based on the stokes 2nd order wave theory the wave velocity of test r 1 is approximately 4 4 m s the horizontal distance between a7 1 and b7 1 is 3 9 m thus the calculated phase lag δt 0 9s which is close to the measured result for one period from 31s to 35 9s at a7 1 the wave reaches its trough and crest at 31 66s of 1 806 kpa and at 34 52s of 2 081 kpa respectively while at a7 wave reaches its trough and crest at 31 70s of 1 709 kpa and at 34 53s of 1 923 kpa respectively it can be seen that the wave pressures at the bottom of the armor stones are slightly smaller than the ones at the top of armor stones showing marginal attenuation of water pressure and almost no phase lag from z 20 cm to z 0 cm within the armor stones the time history of wave induced water pressure at a1 in test r 1 is plotted in fig 5 a the water pressure time histories at other horizontal surface positions are qualitatively alike and not presented for conciseness fig 5 b plots the wave pressure at the trough p b 1 and wave pressure at the crest p b 2 at various locations during the time frame of 20s 40s the water pressure relative to the still water pressure at the crest is always larger compared with that at the corresponding trough at the seabed surface the amplitude of water pressure increases slightly from a7 to a3 and decreases slightly from a3 to b7 at position a3 just upstream of the water intake roof the water pressure reaches maximum which is likely due to the reflection of the progressive wave at position a1 where the seabed soil is the closest to the water intake the wave pressure is the smallest at the upstream of the water intake due to the influence of the intake roof however it should be pointed out that since the top half of the water intake cylinder is open allowing water to flow through fig 2 the influence of refection waves above seabed is limited which is backed by the only slight change in wave amplitude along the seabed in fig 5 b the evolution of surface water pressure generates excess pore pressure within the soil which is measured with pore pressure transducers ppt the excess pore pressure time histories at z 10cm for various locations are plotted in fig 6 showing largely transient fluctuation in test r 1 without accumulation which is consistent for all of the ppt measurements in this test irrespective of the location and depth these results indicate that the excess pore pressure induced by the regular wave in this test is mainly oscillatory pore pressure at each location in fig 6 the excess pore pressure p 1 at the trough and p 2 at the crest at z 10cm is indicated corresponding to p b 1 and p b 2 at the surface in fig 5 a it can be seen that the amplitude of excess pore pressure fluctuation on the upstream side becomes greater with decreasing distance from the water intake fig 6 a i e from x 110cm to x 10cm jeng et al 2005 suggested that the interaction between an incident wave and its reflected waves from a vertical wall could increase the pore pressure amplitude within the sandy seabed in this study the bottom half of the water intake which is a closed cylinder embedded in soil acts as a vertical wall generating reflected waves on the upstream side causing the observed increase in pore pressure in adjacent soil the excess pore pressure fluctuation amplitude in the downstream side is much smaller compared with the symmetrical positions in the upstream fig 6 b as reflection does not occur downstream the excess pore pressure within the time frame from 30s to 40 s at various locations in test r 1 are plotted in fig 7 to investigate the phase lag and attenuation of the excess pore pressure at different locations it can be seen that at the same horizontal position the wave induced excess pore pressure in the sandy seabed reaches its crest or trough at different moments for different depths for x 10cm the wave induced excess pore pressure reaches p 2 at moments 35 14s 35 46s 36 02s and 36 16 s at z 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm and 40cm respectively u11 u12 u13 and u14 compared with u11 the phase lags of u12 u13 and u14 are 0 32s 0 88s and 1 02s respectively for x 30cm x 50cm x 70cm and x 150 cm the phase lags of excess pore pressure between z 10cm and z 30cm are all around 0 9s according to the theoretical solutions of madsen 1978 and hsu and jeng 1994 while fully saturated sandy seabed should exhibit no phase lag in excess pore pressure at different depths even a small air content could lead to the observed phase lag in the tests this indicates that although the sandy seabed is immersed in the water for 30 days before the tests full saturation is not still achieved the regular waves conducted in the wave flume tests satisfy the stokes 2nd order theory and the elevations of wave crest and trough are not symmetrical a normalized oscillatory pore pressure value p p 1 p b 1 p 2 p b 2 2 is evaluated which also reflects the attenuation rate of excess pore pressure smaller p indicates greater attenuation to further investigate the attenuation pattern of the oscillatory pore pressure attenuation rates at z 10cm are analyzed in table 2 including p 1 p b 1 p 2 p b 2 and p it can be seen that the oscillatory pore pressure attenuation is least significant close to the water intake fig 6 a and table 2 due to effects of reflection it is also observed in fig 7 that the wave induced excess pore pressure attenuates gradually with increasing depth the vertical distribution of normalized wave induced excess pore pressure p for x 10cm x 30cm x 50cm and x 70cm is shown in fig 8 the wave induced excess pore pressure attenuates significantly in the shallow seabed especially at x 70cm and p is less than 0 1 when the soil is deeper than z 30cm showing that there is almost no wave induced excess pore pressure in the deeper seabed due to the significant interaction of soil and wave in the shallow sandy seabed it should be noted that the degree of saturation s r of soil is difficult to measure precisely in the field we determined the overall s r 97 by matching hsu and jeng 1994 s analytical solutions with the measure data p table 2 and fig 8 in all of the tests conducted in this study the maximum measured displacement of the water intake itself is 0 22 mm in test ir 1 therefore it is safe to assume that the influence of structure displacement on the response within the seabed soil is trivial compared to that of the wave load and is neglected in this study 1 3 analysis of wave induced effective stress change the excess pore pressure influences effective stress of the soil since effective stress cannot be directly measured in the tests to investigate the wave induced effective stress change in the sandy seabed of test r 1 solutions by zen and yamazaki 1990 and hsu and jeng 1994 are adopted 1 3 1 zen and yamazaki 1990 s simplified method zen and yamazaki 1990 proposed a simplified equation for the wave induced change of soil vertical effective stress δ σ v in eq 8 represented by the difference between wave pressure p b and excess pore pressure p and suggested the criterion for momentary liquefaction in eq 9 when the upward seepage force induced by waves exceed the initial vertical effective stress of seabed soil 8 δ σ v p b p 9 σ v 0 p b p 0 here σ v 0 is the initial vertical effective stress for the test conditions in this study the initial vertical effective stress can be calculated by 10 σ v 0 γ s a t γ w z 1 γ s t o n e γ w z 2 where γ s a t and γ s t o n e are the saturated unit weight of sand and armor stones respectively z 1 and z 2 are the thickness of sand and armor stones respectively in the shallow sandy seabed σ v 0 at u11 u21 or u31 is almost as twice as σ v 0 at u41 u51 or u61 due to greater armor stone layer thickness fig 9 plots the wave induced water pressure at seabed surface excess pore pressure and effective stress changes at z 10cm in test r 1 at a typical position with x 50cm the water pressure at a3 excess pore pressure at u31 and the corresponding δ σ v time histories at z 10cm are plotted in fig 9 a it can be seen that δ σ v fluctuates transiently and periodically with the minimal and maximal values occurring near the wave trough and crest respectively during 30s 40s in close up in fig 9 b δ σ v 1 and δ σ v 2 are the minimum and maximum δ σ v corresponding to the wave trough p b 1 and peak p b 2 respectively the absolute values of δ σ v 1 and δ σ v 2 are smaller than those of p b 1 and p b 2 due to the attenuation of wave induced excess pore pressure p based on eq 9 momentary liquefaction has higher potential to occur when δ σ v δ p p b p reaches its minimum the initial vertical effective stress and wave induced minimum δ σ v are also plotted in fig 9 c for comparison there is no occurrence of momentary liquefaction in the shallow sandy seabed of test r 1 even though the vertical effective stress at u51 can decrease to approximately 1 kpa 1 3 2 hsu and jeng 1994 s theoretical solutions zen and yamazaki 1990 s method can only evaluate wave induced vertical effective stress hsu and jeng 1994 developed a more generalized theory for wave induced changes in pore pressures and effective stresses including vertical and horizontal normal stresses and shear stress based on biot s consolidation theory biot 1941 for a compressible pore fluid in an elastic porous medium the parameters needed for test r 1 in hsu and jeng 1994 s analytical solutions are listed in table 3 in this study the wave and seabed related parameters are obtained from the test configurations the soil porosity n is calculated after sample preparation while the soil permeability k x and k z are assumed to be the same as that measured in constant water head tests elastic parameters μ and g are determined based on triaxial laboratory experiments hong et al 2017b the calculated wave induced amplitude of vertical normal stress horizontal normal stress and shear stress expressed in terms of δ σ v a p 0 δ σ h a p 0 and τ v h a p 0 with p 0 being the maximum wave pressure at the seabed surface at different horizontal positions at z 10cm upstream of the water intake in test r 1 are plotted in fig 10 a based on hsu and jeng 1994 s analytical solutions and are compared with the excess pore pressure attenuation p normalized oscillatory pore pressure the smaller p is due to attenuation with respect to depth the greater the changes in effective stress in terms of δ σ v a p 0 and δ σ h a p 0 are evident from fig 10 a the normalized shear stress τ v h a p 0 is much smaller compared with δ σ v a p 0 and δ σ h a p 0 compared with zen and yamazaki 1990 s simplified method hsu and jeng 1994 s solution yields slightly larger change in vertical effective stress but with similar patterns in general fig 10 b hsu and jeng 1994 s solution has the advantage in allowing the analysis of the evolution of the full stress path which is shown in fig 11 in terms of τ v h a p 0 versus δ σ v δ σ h 2 p 0 clear evidence of principal stress axes rotation induced by waves is observed a phenomenon first analyzed by ishihara 1983 for seabed subjected to wave loads which has been indicated to have significant influence on the mechanical behavior of sand wang et al 2019 xue et al 2019 in fig 11 the three values for p are chosen as p 0 113 at u51 p 0 446 at u11 and p 1 0 to illustrate its influence on the stress path with smaller p the deviation stress δ σ v δ σ h 2 becomes greater and the stress path in fig 11 becomes more elongated in the lateral direction 1 4 parametric analysis for regular waves the soil response under regular waves can be affected by the wave characteristics and seabed profile to investigate the influence of some of these factors on the oscillatory pore pressure in the sandy seabed tests with various wave heights and periods r 1 to r 9 and with and without armor stones at seabed surface r 1 to r 4 and r 10 to r 13 are conducted as listed in table 1 1 4 1 wave height for the tests with different wave heights r 1 r 5 to r 9 the horizontal distribution of normalized oscillatory pore pressure p at z 10cm is plotted in fig 12 the influence of wave height on the distribution of p is negligible though the absolute value of excess pore pressure p becomes greater with increasing wave height due to the increase in wave pressure the increase in p with decreasing distance to the water intake again shows that the attenuation of excess pore pressure becomes weaker close to the water intake the upstream excess pore pressure is in general greater than its downstream counterpart 1 4 2 wave period the influence of wave period on the horizontal distribution of p at z 10cm is investigated through tests r 1 to r 4 fig 13 the overall horizontal distribution of p is similar for different wave periods though p decreases slightly with decreasing wave period according to eq 2 when the wave period decreases from t 4 9s to t 2 8s the wavelength decreases from 21 8 m to 10 7 m resulting in the increase in wave number k based on the solution of hsu and jeng 1994 wave induced excess pore pressure attenuation in the shallow seabed is greater for larger wave number k 1 4 3 armor stones the overlaid armor stones at the seabed surface can enhance the stability of the water intake by generating extra effective stress in the seabed around to investigate the influence of the armor stones on the horizontal distribution of pore pressure attenuation rate p in the sandy seabed tests r 10 to r 13 without the armor stones are conducted in direct comparison with tests r 1 to r 4 compared with the results in fig 13 without the armor stone the upstream p becomes smaller as shown in fig 14 especially its maximum value at x 10cm indicating stronger pore pressure attenuation and change in soil effective stress these parametric studies indicate that the wave height almost has little influence on the spatial distribution of p close to the water intake and p declines slightly with decreasing wave period the overlaid armor stones has significant influence on the spatial distribution of p close to the water intake 1 5 analysis of excess pore pressure under random wave loadings 1 5 1 spatial distribution of excess pore pressure under random wave loadings in most of the regular wave flume tests conducted and analyzed in this study little to no residual pore pressure is observed in actual ocean environments large waves with irregular wave heights and wave periods can generate significant residual pore pressure test ir 1 is conducted with random waves generated by the jonswap spectrum with larger wave height than the tests under regular waves to investigate the spatial distribution of random wave induced excess pore pressure and especially residual excess pore pressure generation close to the water intake in test ir 1 table 1 the water depth h significant wave height h s and significant wave period t s are 2 31 m 51 0 cm and 3 6s respectively fig 15 a plots the full time history of the seabed surface wave pressure at location a7 to depict a whole picture for the random wave the maximum wave pressure reaches 3 168 kpa and the minimum wave pressure reaches 2 616 kpa close ups of the wave pressure at typical positions of a1 a7 a7 1 and b7 during 50s 100s are further plotted in fig 15 b showing similar wave amplitudes at each location comparison of a7 1 and a7 shows that the time histories of random wave pressures at the top and bottom of the armor stones are similar with negligible attenuation the random wave pressures at a7 and b7 have a phase lag of approximately 1 4s the random wave s form changes slightly during wave propagation which is different to the unchanged form of the regular waves in fig 4 as shown in fig 16 due to the wave reflection by the water intake the amplitude of random wave induced excess pore pressure on the upstream side is greatest at u11 closest to the water intake while on the downstream side the amplitude of excess pore pressure is smaller than that at upstream positions symmetrical with respect to the water intake a significant difference between the results from test ir 1 from the regular wave tests is the accumulation of excess pore pressures at several locations at u51 d11 and d31 the residual pore pressure is 0 4 kpa 0 45 kpa and 0 1 kpa respectively at these locations the attenuation of oscillatory pore pressure is stronger than that at other horizontal positions at the same seabed depth as shown in fig 11 stronger attenuation of oscillatory pore pressure generates greater cyclic loading which would induce stronger shearing and contraction in the sand resulting in excess pore pressure accumulation although residual pore pressure is measured in this tests its value does not reach the initial vertical effective stress and residual liquefaction not occurs under the test conditions note that in the regular wave tests when the wave period frequency is relatively large e g test r 4 very slight accumulation of excess pore pressure is also observed at u51 d11 and d13 locations 1 5 2 parametric analysis for random waves to investigate the influence of significant wave height on random wave induced residual pore pressure another six random waves are conducted as listed in table 1 in test ir 2 and ir 3 the water depth h 2 31 m and significant wave period t s 3 4 s are the same while significant wave height h s of 37 5 cm and 25 0 cm respectively excess pore pressure of test ir 2 also accumulates at u51 d11 and d13 which has greater wave height compared with test ir 3 the comparison of typical results from test ir 2 and test ir 3 is shown in fig 17 fig 17 a illustrates that variations of the generated wave pressure for the two tests are almost identical except for the magnitudes of the wave amplitude based on the significant wave height at u41 in the upstream of the water intake random wave induced excess pore pressure of test ir 2 and test ir 3 only oscillate transiently where greater fluctuations are observed for test ir 2 fig 17 b at d11 in the downstream of the water intake the residual pore pressure of test ir 2 is approximately twice as that of test ir 3 fig 17 c showing that with larger significant wave height the random wave induced residual pore pressure tends to be greater in other random wave tests ir 4 to ir 7 listed in table 1 the water depth h is 2 16 m in test ir 4 the random wave induced excess pore pressure also accumulates at d13 in the downstream of the water intake fig 18 a in test ir 5 test ir 6 and test ir 7 with greater significant wave period t s 4 0 s the significant wave heights h s are 37 5 cm 25 0 cm and 12 5 cm respectively at d31 in the downstream of the water intake residual pore pressure only occurs in test ir 5 with greater significant wave height in the tests conducted in this study the pore pressure transducers and water pressure transducers are embedded and not fixed the pore pressure transducers are buried at depth greater or equal to 10 cm where the soil does not liquefy based on observations during the tests very limited amount of particles at the interface between sand and armor stones move therefore the movement of the ppts along with the soil particle is negligible the wpts at z 0 cm are positioned under armor stones where the effects of scour or sand movement are limited after the tests without armor stones the wpts are checked showing that the initial positions are maintained 2 conclusions the behavior of sandy seabed subjected to wave loads adjacent a water intake is investigated in this study through 20 large scale laboratory model tests conducted at the large wave flume facility at tianjin research institute of water transport engineering tiwte the temporal and spatial evolution of pore water pressure and stresses within the soil is analyzed under different test configurations including different wave and soil setups attenuation and phase lag of oscillatory pore pressure are observed along the depth of the sandy seabed in the wave flume tests the oscillatory pore pressure attenuates significantly at shallow depths the presence of the water intake affects the horizontal distribution of excess pore pressure amplitude in adjacent soils on the upstream side increasing excess pore pressure is observed in the seabed soil with decreasing distance to the intake on the downstream side the excess pore pressure is smaller than that on the upstream side detailed analysis of wave induced effective stress in one typical test is conducted through zen and yamazaki 1990 s simplified method and hsu and jeng 1994 s analytical solution both methods yield similar results for the evolution of vertical effective stress during the tests furthermore hsu and jeng 1994 s analytical solution provides a means to assess the horizontal stress and shear stress along with the vertical stress which shows that the principal axes of stress within the seabed rotates continuously under wave loads residual pore pressure is observed in the tests induced by irregular waves with relatively large heights and regular waves with relatively high frequencies at certain locations in the seabed where attenuation of oscillatory pore pressure is more significant which induces stronger shearing and contraction in the sand a parametric study is conducted to investigate the influence of wave heights wave periods and seabed setups on the response of soil close to the water intake it is observed that while the wave height affects the value of pore pressure in the soil it does not influence the spatial distribution pattern of normalized oscillatory pore pressure p p decreases slightly with decreasing wave period overlaid armor stones above the seabed can significantly reduce pore pressure attenuation resulting in reduced cyclic loading in the soil in the wave flume tests conducted in this study the wave intensity is limited to a maximum of 51 cm and a sand with relatively high permeability is used resulting in small residual pore pressure and no occurrence of liquefaction future studies should be conducted with stronger waves and finer sand and also more wave spectra types to investigate the influence of soil liquefaction on the stability of the water intake numerical investigations should also be conducted for this problem in future efforts with the experimental data serving as basis for validation declaration of competing interest the authors

22261,earthquake source details can hardly be determined accurately in a short time window after an earthquake for rapid tsunami warning purposes rupture parameters for a given earthquake magnitude are estimated using empirical scaling relations in this paper we evaluate the effectiveness of several commonly used scaling relations it is found that for the 2011 tohoku earthquake most scaling relations overestimate the rupture area and underestimate the average rupture slip resulting in predictions of earlier wave arrivals and smaller wave amplitudes in comparison to recordings the scaling relation that uses asperity size instead of actual rupture area presents a smaller rupture area and a larger average slip leading to better tsunami predictions while for the 2014 iquique and 2015 illapel tsunamis of relatively smaller earthquake magnitude different scaling relations lead to comparable tsunami predictions we further implement these scaling relations to study a potential earthquake in the manila subduction zone results show that different scaling relations cause significant differences in the tsunami arrival time and wave amplitude at coastal cities especially in the along trench direction thus to access the tsunami threat from mega earthquakes and build early warning systems it is necessary to select the appropriate scaling relations keywords tsunamis tsunami warning scaling relations 1 introduction most devastating tsunamis in history are caused by thrust earthquakes in subduction zones leading to severe damage to the coastal community such as the 1960 m w 9 5 chile earthquake cisternas et al 2005 the 1964 m w 9 2 alaska earthquake reimnitz and marshall 1965 ichinose et al 2007 the 2004 m w 9 1 sumatra earthquake lay et al 2005 titov et al 2005 the 2011 m w 9 1 tohoku earthquake simons et al 2011 fujii et al 2011 satake et al 2013 and two recent chilean tsunamis in 2014 and 2015 the 2014 iquique earthquake occurred in the northern portion of the 1877 earthquake seismic gap in northern chile slip deficit of about 6 to 9 m may have accumulated since 1877 post event analysis of tsunami records shows that the shallow rupture near the trench is very small lay et al 2014 an et al 2014 which may otherwise cause significantly larger tsunamis as is the case for the tohoku event the 2015 illapel tsunami was recorded by more than 20 gauges but most of the gauges were located along the coastline as a result studies show large variance in the east west location of the fault rupture and it is still not clearly understood if there was significant shallow rupture near the trench tilmann et al 2016 li et al 2016 melgar et al 2016 an et al 2017 an and meng 2017 for the most recent tsunamis in light of the deployment of seismometers tsunami buoys and other types of sensors various data of the earthquakes and tsunamis are recorded and they can be utilized to infer the earthquake rupture process and source parameters in particular the deep ocean assessment and reporting of tsunami dart project provides real time tsunami measurements in the open ocean including such data in finite fault inversions can promisingly recover the tsunami source and reproduce the tsunami recordings satake 1987 fujii et al 2011 satake et al 2013 an et al 2014 heidarzadeh et al 2016 an et al 2017 on such basis for early tsunami warning purposes the pacific tsunami warning centre ptwc conducts finite fault inversions by making use of the dart data and issues accurate tsunami predictions wei et al 2003 2008 however in areas where there lacks tsunami buoys such as the south china sea tsunami measurements are not available as a result most local tsunami warning systems rely on a different approach which is called the tsunami scenario strategy in such a strategy for subduction zones with potential tsunami genesis uniform slip models are constructed before an earthquake occurs and the corresponding tsunamis are numerically simulated after an earthquake tsunami warnings are issued based on the scenario with the most similar earthquake magnitude to construct the uniform slip models fault rupture parameters are obtained from a given earthquake magnitude according to empirical scaling relations wells and coppersmith 1994 blaser et al 2010 strasser et al 2010 murotani et al 2008 2013 thingbaijam et al 2017 tsunami sources in reality involve temporal processes regarding earthquake ruptures for example ren et al 2019 evaluated the impact of kinetic rupture on tsunami generation and propagation during the 2004 sumatra and 2011 tohoku tsunamis however tsunami warning systems ignore such effects for the purpose of rapid warning scaling relations provide a quantitative relationship between rupture parameters e g length width slip and earthquake magnitude they are usually derived from the regression of large databases of historical earthquakes due to the different database used and different type of earthquakes studies often obtain similar but slightly different scaling relations for instance wells and coppersmith 1994 compiled the source parameters of 244 global earthquakes classified them according to their focal mechanism and derived scaling relations for different types of earthquakes even though the moment magnitude of earthquakes ranges m w 5 8 in their study the scaling relations obtained for thrust earthquakes have been widely used to access the tsunami hazards for magnitude 8 or larger earthquakes liu et al 2009 wu and huang 2009 nguyen et al 2014 blaser et al 2010 extended the earthquake catalog adopted by wells and coppersmith 1994 from 244 to 283 earthquakes by adding more subduction earthquakes of relatively higher moment magnitude up to m w 9 5 they derived a new set of scaling relations with special focus on the large subduction zone earthquakes strasser et al 2010 obtained similar scaling relations as blaser et al 2010 s by compiling 95 inter plate earthquakes in addition to wells and coppersmith 1994 s earthquake catalogue with magnitude ranging from m w 6 3 to m w 9 4 murotani et al 2008 2013 collected the finite fault slip models of plate boundary earthquakes m w 6 7 9 2 in the vicinity of japan that occurred from 1923 to 2011 and derived a scaling relation between the conventional rupture area s and the seismic moment m 0 particularly they also proposed a scaling relation between the asperity rupture area s a and the seismic moment where s a is defined as the fault area with slip 1 5 times the average slip or larger a most recent study by thingbaijam et al 2017 observed that the scaling behavior of the rupture area to moment is consistent for all cases except normal faulting earthquakes empirical scaling relations are widely used to assess regional tsunami hazards liu et al 2009 wu and huang 2009 nguyen et al 2014 ren et al 2017 in addition local tsunami warning systems also depend on such scaling relations for instance the south china sea tsunami warning system operated by national marine environment forecasting center china adopts the scaling relations given by wells and coppersmith 1994 and ren et al 2014 the japan tsunami warning system operated by the japan meteorological agency jma kamigaichi 2009 uses the following scaling relations log l 0 5 m w 1 8 and l 2 w l rupture length w rupture width m w earthquake magnitude it should be noted that most of these scaling relations are derived from seismic data there have been very few studies that quantitatively evaluate their effectiveness in generating tsunamis in a most recent study an et al 2018 demonstrated that slip heterogeneity can largely be ignored for tsunami warning purposes and they also derived a scaling relation suitable for tsunami generation in this study we test the performance of four representative and commonly used scaling relations given by wells and coppersmith 1994 hereafter referred to as wells1994 blaser et al 2010 hereafter blaser2010 strasser et al 2010 hereafter strasser2010 and murotani et al 2013 hereafter murotani2013 respectively by applying them to the 2011 tohoku 2014 iquique and 2015 illapel tsunamis stirling et al 2013 compiled a worldwide set of scaling relations and evaluated their relevance to a range of tectonic regimes they pointed out that the wells1994 scaling relations are out of date in terms of data and hence should not be used if more modern scaling relations are available however since the wells1994 scaling relations are still widely adopted by tsunami modelers it is included in the analysis of this study the results of strasser2010 are found to be very similar to that of blaser2010 so it is excluded from the main text but provided in the supplementary information and discussed in the discussion section the numerically simulated tsunami waves from scaling relations are compared to the tsunami recordings at various sensors south china sea has drawn many research interests due to its potential of large tsunamis and a local warning system is in need lin et al 2015 thus we apply the three scaling relations in a virtual earthquake scenario of m w 9 0 in the manila subduction zone tsunami arrival time and wave heights are analyzed near the coastlines surrounding the south china sea which will be useful for future design of tsunami warning systems 2 rupture parameters from different scaling relations we select three well documented tsunami events to evaluate the effectiveness of different scaling relations on the generation of tsunamis they are the 2011 tohoku earthquake fig 1 the 2014 iquique and the 2015 illapel earthquakes fig 2 the scaling relations adopted in this study are those given by wells and coppersmith 1994 blaser et al 2010 and murotani et al 2013 the source parameters derived from these scaling relations for the three earthquakes are shown in table 1 the seismic moment for the three earthquakes is obtained from finite fault inversions of tsunami data it is 2 25 1 0 22 nm m w 8 9 for the 2011 tohoku earthquake an et al 2018 1 22 1 0 21 nm m w 8 0 for the 2014 iquique earthquake an et al 2014 and 2 46 1 0 21 nm m w 8 2 for the 2015 illapel earthquake an et al 2017 respectively we note here that for each earthquake event we use the scaling relations to calculate the rupture dimension first rupture area s length l and width w and the average slip d is then calculated by m μ s d m seismic moment μ earth rigidity the earth rigidity used in this study which varies in depth is extracted from the preliminary reference earth model prem dziewonski and anderson 1981 murotani et al 2013 provided two different scaling relations to the earthquake moment regarding the conventional rupture area and the asperity size respectively here we use the formulas regarding the asperity size in addition the ratio of rupture length and width is not given by murotani et al 2013 and here we use a ratio of 1 0 which is found to be the optimum ratio for tsunami generation an et al 2018 other ratios have also been addressed and the results are given in the supplementary information more discussions about the conventional rupture area and different length width ratios are provided in the discussion section for the 2011 tohoku earthquake we assume a single fault plane with a strike angle of 198 and dip angle of 14 fujii et al 2011 for the 2014 iquique and the 2015 illapel earthquakes the strike angle is 340 and 4 respectively and the dip angle is extracted from the local slab geometry slab 1 0 hayes et al 2012 the rake angle is set to 90 to represent thrust focal mechanism the center of each rupture model is located at the global cmt centroid which is derived from long period seismic waves and may better represent the location of the final slip than the epicenter an et al 2018 all the fault parameters are provided in the supplementary information by applying the okada s analytical solution okada 1985 to the source parameters the static seafloor deformation is calculated and the corresponding initial sea surface elevation mimics the seafloor profile upon the assumption of instant rupture and incompressible water the propagation of tsunami waves is then numerically simulated using the software package funwave tvd shi et al 2012 kirby et al 2013 which solves nonlinear boussinesq equations the computational domain for the 2011 tohoku tsunami extends from 127 e to 160 e 27 5 n to 47 5 n and the total grid number is 3960 2400 the computational domain for the 2014 iquique tsunami extends from 90 w to 65 w 30 s to 15 s and the total grid number is 3000 1800 the computational domain for the 2015 illapel tsunami extends from 85 w to 65 w 40 s to 15 s and the total grid number is 2400 3000 the global bathymetry data gebco 2014 general bathymetric chart of the oceans www gebco net with a uniform resolution of 30 arcsec are used we have carried out convergence tests using the murotani2013 model for each tsunami event with grid sizes of 90 60 and 30 arcsec respectively the results are provided in figs s1 s2 and s3 for the tohoku iquique and illapel earthquakes respectively it is seen that 30 arcsec is sufficiently good for simulations of the tsunami waves at dart stations in deep water and the first waves at most of the coastal stations we point out that the bathymetry resolution of 30 arcsec could be too coarse to resolve the complex local bathymetry features at some coastal gauges but at most stations the tsunami waves can be well modeled using grid size of 30 arcsec e g heidarzadeh et al 2016 melgar et al 2016 an et al 2017 the courant friedrichs lewy c f l number in the simulation is 0 5 the coefficient of bottom friction is 0 015 sponge layers are imposed to absorb reflected wave at the computational boundaries and the thickness of the sponge layers is 200 km 3 comparison of tsunami waveforms with observations we first compare the initial sea surface deformation resulted from the three different scaling relations shown in fig 3 for all the three earthquakes it is observed that the wells1994 scaling relations lead to narrow and long rupture areas due to the selected length width ratio of 1 0 the rupture areas from the murotani2013 scaling relations are concentrated in square zones results of different ratios are discussed in the discussion section consequently the initial sea surface elevation is also narrow and long for the wells1994 models and relatively short for the murotani2013 models besides for the same earthquake the rupture area is estimated to be larger using the wells1994 scaling relations than using the murotani2013 scaling relations and the maximum initial wave height is therefore smaller in the wells1994 models than in the murotani2013 models for all the three earthquakes the blaser2010 scaling relations lead to even larger rupture area and smaller maximum initial wave height than the wells1994 models albeit still very similar to the results of wells1994 we then compare the tsunami waves generated from the three slip models with recordings at various stations the location of the dart buoys and coastal stations is given in fig 1 for the 2011 tohoku event and fig 2 for the 2014 iquique and 2015 illapel events the comparison of tsunami waves is shown in figs 4 6 for the 2011 tohoku 2014 iquique and 2015 illapel event respectively it is seen from the top panel of fig 4 that for the 2011 tohoku earthquake the models of wells1994 and blaser2010 predict much earlier wave arrivals than the recordings at stations to the north and south of the earthquake source such as stations 613 202 and 203 in the north stations 407 815 and 812 in the south this is due to the elongated rupture area estimated using the scaling relations of wells1994 and blaser2010 fig 3a on the other hand the arrival time predicted by the murotani2013 model is similar to the recordings at most of the stations besides we also observe that the predicted wave heights by the wells1994 and blaser2010 models are smaller than recorded at most of the stations while the predicted amplitudes by the murotani2013 model agree well with the recordings thus it can be inferred that the wells1994 and blaser2010 models underestimate the initial wave height and the murotani2013 model leads to initial wave height similar to reality this is also demonstrated by the bottom panel of fig 4 which shows the relative error of the first wave arrival time and amplitude predicted by the three slip models at most stations the murotani2013 model produces clearly smaller errors than the other two models for the 2014 iquique earthquake shown in fig 5 it is found that the predictions from the three slip models present less significant differences compared to the 2011 tohoku event at some stations e g mata pata toco meji anto the results of wells1994 and blaser2010 have earlier wave arrivals and smaller first wave amplitudes than the results of murotani2013 however the overall discrepancies are less observable than those in the 2011 tohoku earthquake this is also shown in the bottom panel of fig 5 which plots the relative error of first wave arrival time and amplitude the reason is that the magnitude of the 2014 iquique earthquake is much smaller than the 2011 tohoku earthquake and hence the rupture dimension of the 2014 iquique earthquake is also much smaller thus the absolute differences of rupture dimension estimated from different scaling relations are also smaller leading to smaller discrepancies of first wave arrival time and amplitude for the 2015 illapel earthquake the magnitude is smaller than the 2011 tohoku earthquake and larger than the 2014 iquique earthquake therefore the discrepancies among the three scaling relations are less significant than those in the 2011 tohoku earthquake and more significant than those in the 2014 iquique earthquake respectively the results are shown in fig 6 from figs 4 6 it can be concluded that the larger the earthquake magnitude the more significant the discrepancies of tsunami waves predicted from different scaling relations in addition based on the results of the three investigated earthquakes for earthquakes of larger magnitude the scaling relations of murotani2013 with a length width ratio of 1 0 lead to better tsunami predictions than other scaling relations 4 assessment of potential megatsunamis near the manila trench the manila trench is an oceanic trench along which the eurasian plate is subducting eastward underneath the luzon volcanic arc on the philippine sea plate there have been many studies to investigate its potential to produce large earthquakes and tsunamis galgana et al 2007 utilized regional gps velocities and focal mechanism data to constrain the tectonic deformation along the manila subduction zone and results suggested that the manila trench could be possibly poorly coupled similarly hsu et al 2012 used gps data trench parallel gravity anomaly and bathymetry to infer plate coupling patterns along the manila subduction zone they derived a maximum plate coupling ratio of 0 4 between the west luzon trough and the scarborough seamount and concluded that megathrust rupture along the entire manila subduction zone is not likely nevertheless people are still concerned about mega earthquakes and tsunami in this zone liu et al 2009 megawati et al 2009 and nguyen et al 2014 simulated the tsunami waves generated by earthquakes of various magnitudes near the manila trench propagating to the coast of china vietnam and philippine ren et al 2015 2017 and li et al 2018 investigated the characteristics of the evolution of tsunami waves over the mild slope in the south china sea including wave dispersion nonlinearity and wave splitting liu et al 2009 proposed a tsunami warning strategy based on finite fault inversion theory most of the above mentioned studies adopt uniform slip models to calculate the tsunami waves generated from an earthquake the parameters of the uniform slip models are obtained from a given earthquake magnitude using different scaling relations here we quantify the impact of different scaling relations on the generated tsunami waves in the south china sea by numerically simulating an artificial earthquake and the following tsunami we artificially impose a giant earthquake on the fault of the manila trench with the same seismic moment as the 2011 tohoku earthquake m w 8 9 we point out that the largest earthquake in the manila subduction zone that caused a known tsunami in history had a magnitude of 7 9 which occurred on february 14 1934 noaa 2019 however larger earthquakes could also possibly happen for example the magnitude of the 2011 tohoku earthquake was not expected before the earthquake kido et al 2011 lay et al 2011 previous works have considered m w 9 or larger earthquakes in the manila subduction zone wu and huang 2009 megawati et al 2009 nguyen et al 2014 the fault geometry is inferred from the earthquake focal mechanisms in the time period between 1973 and 2010 hsu et al 2012 which consists of three major segments with uniform strike angle and an averaged dip angle in depth for each segment the artificial earthquake is located in the middle segment the rupture dimension and average slip can be calculated using different scaling relations and the results are the same as the tohoku event shown in table 1 the focal depth is determined such that the top edge of the rupture area reaches the trench note that the strike angle in the models of wells1994 and blaser2010 varies in order to follow the curvature of the trench all the fault parameters are provided in the supplementary information we then simulate and analyze the tsunami waves propagating from the manila trench to the surrounding countries fig 7 by adopting the half space elastic dislocation model okada 1985 the coseismic seafloor deformation and the initial water elevation are calculated shown in the left panels of fig 8 similar to the tohoku case it is observed that the wells1994 result presents an elongated zone of water elevation and relatively small maximum wave height while the murotani2013 result shows a compact zone of relatively large wave height the blaser2010 model leads to an even larger area of water elevation with smaller wave height compared to the wells1994 model the right panels in fig 8 display the first wave amplitude resulted from the three scaling relations it is found that in the direction perpendicular to the strike of the trench where the tsunami energy is mostly concentrated the murotani2013 model impacts a wider area along the chinese coast with higher wave height than the other two models it seems to be the same for the coastal area along vietnam and taiwan which is more clearly demonstrated in fig 9 we note here that the wells1994 and balser2010 models have curved strike direction which can lead to different energy focusing compared to uniform strike however it is observed in fig 8 that the direction of energy concentration is still largely determined by the middle rupture zone fig 9 shows the simulated first wave arrival time and amplitude along the coastlines surrounding the south china sea the top panel shows the results along the coastline of western philippines which is near the tsunami source it is found that although the wells1994 model presents smaller maximum initial water height than the murotani2013 model the wave height along the coastline is somewhat larger this is possibly because the wells1994 model has a longer zone of water elevation extending to the south so the coastline where the first wave amplitude is analyzed is closer to the tsunami source the second panel provides the results along the coastline of southern china which is in the direction of tsunami energy focus the arrival time is almost identical because the edge of the initial water elevation starts from the trench in all the three models the murotani2013 model predicts large first wave amplitude in a larger area than the wells1994 model while the blaser2010 model leads to the smallest amplitude among the three models in the third panel the first wave arrival time and amplitude along the coastline of western taiwan is plotted since the murotani2013 model has a significantly smaller zone of tsunami source than the other two models the arrival time is predicted to be clearly later in addition the first wave amplitude given by the murotani2013 model is also obviously larger and it can be 1 5 to 2 times the amplitude predicted by the other two models this is consistent with our previous analysis of the tohoku iquique and illapel tsunamis for the three previous tsunamis most of the observation stations are located along the coast which is parallel to the trench axis in this synthetic test taiwan is also in the strike direction of the trench where the murotani2013 model predicts later arrival time and higher amplitude than the other two models in the bottom panel of fig 9 along the coastline of western vietnam which is approximately parallel to the trench strike the murotani2013 model predicts slightly later first wave arrivals and larger wave amplitude than the other two models 5 discussion in the previous sections we have evaluated three scaling relations proposed by wells and coppersmith 1994 blaser et al 2010 and murotani et al 2013 on the generation of tsunami waves another widely used scaling relation was derived by strasser et al 2010 here we also analyze this scaling relation and compare the results with the three above mentioned scaling relations the results are found to be almost identical as the blaser2010 results for all the three tsunami events for example for the tohoku tsunami the blaser2010 model and strasser et al s 2010 model lead to an averaged relative error of the first wave arrival time of 20 and 21 respectively and an averaged relative error of the first wave amplitude of 53 and 54 respectively details are provided in the supplementary information tables s1 s2 figs s4 s5 s6 s7 besides in addition to the scaling relation regarding the asperity size murotani et al 2013 also obtained a scaling relation between the conventional rupture area and the earthquake magnitude hence we also adopt this scaling relation and simulate the tsunami waves for the tohoku iquique and illapel events the results are found to be similar to the blaser2010 results tables s3 s4 figs s8 s9 s10 and s11 in the supplementary information thus although they vary in details all the scaling relations including those given by wells and coppersmith 1994 blaser et al 2010 strasser et al 2010 and murotani et al 2013 produce comparable tsunami simulation results except the one related to asperity size proposed by murotani et al 2013 compared to other scaling relations the murotani2013 scaling relation regarding the asperity rupture area leads to smaller zone of initial water elevation with higher amplitude resulting in later tsunami arrivals and larger first wave amplitude near coastlines especially in the direction of trench axis murotani et al 2013 provided only the scaling relation between the earthquake magnitude and the rupture area without determining the rupture length width ratio in this study we adopt the length width ratio of 1 0 which was found to be the optimum ratio for the three selected tsunamis by an et al 2018 here we also test a more widely used value 2 0 for the length width ratio the fault parameters with a length width ratio of 2 0 are listed in table s5 and the relative errors are given in table s6 in fig s12 we observe that the results of ratio 2 0 have a more elongated zone of elevated water because most of the stations are located in the along trench direction the first wave arrivals are earlier using ratio 2 0 than 1 0 as shown in figs s13 s14 and s15 overall the results of ratio 2 0 match the recordings worse than the results of ratio 1 0 which can also be seen from the arrival time and first wave amplitude at observation stations besides it is also found that the error of ratio 2 0 is more significant for the tohoku event and it decreases with the earthquake magnitude this is attributed to the decrease of absolute rupture dimension table 2 summarizes the averaged relative errors of the first wave amplitude and arrival time in the 2011 tohoku 2014 iquique and 2015 illapel tsunamis using different scaling relations 6 conclusions in this study we evaluate the impact of scaling relations of earthquake source parameters on the generation of tsunamis four commonly used scaling relations proposed by wells and coppersmith 1994 blaser et al 2010 strasser et al 2010 and murotani et al 2013 are studied by applying them to the 2011 tohoku 2014 iquique 2015 illapel tsunamis the resulted tsunami waves are compared with tsunami recordings at various observation stations the main findings are summarized as follows wells and coppersmith 1994 blaser et al 2010 and strasser et al 2010 predict relatively large source areas and small initial wave height leading to early first wave arrivals and small wave height especially in the direction of trench axis the scaling relation regarding the asperity size givenby murotani et al 2013 produces a compact rupture area with relatively large initial water elevation and the predicted tsunami waves match the recordings with significantly smaller errors in comparison to other scaling relations the discrepancies among the scaling relations are more significant for earthquakes of higher magnitude e g the 2011 tohoku earthquake and less observable for smaller earthquakes e g the 2014 iquique earthquake for an artificial earthquake of magnitude m w 9 in the manila subduction zone different scaling relations also result in different tsunami simulation results the largest discrepancies appear at the coastlines of western taiwan the arrival time predicted by the murotani2013 scaling relation is significantly later and the first wave amplitude can be 1 5 to 2 times that given by the other scaling relations along the coastlines of western vietnam and southern china only part of the coastal area is affected by the different scaling relations as the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco opened the south china sea tsunami advisory center in may 2018 which is now in operation to issue tsunami warnings for countries surrounding the south china sea it is important to choose an appropriate scaling relation in order for high prediction accuracy we note that the conclusions are obtained based the three selected tsunamis recently it has been discussed that forcing the rupture area to be more compact than the conventional rupture area such as the asperity size adopted by murotani et al 2013 could be a good practical solution to predict tsunami waves melgar et al 2019 slip on the fault during an earthquake is heterogeneous in reality thus it reasonable that approximating the earthquake source using homogenous slip should also require approximations of the rupture area in this study we find that compact areas work well for the 2011 tohoku 2014 iquique and 2015 illapel tsunamis but further research might be necessary to verify if

22261,earthquake source details can hardly be determined accurately in a short time window after an earthquake for rapid tsunami warning purposes rupture parameters for a given earthquake magnitude are estimated using empirical scaling relations in this paper we evaluate the effectiveness of several commonly used scaling relations it is found that for the 2011 tohoku earthquake most scaling relations overestimate the rupture area and underestimate the average rupture slip resulting in predictions of earlier wave arrivals and smaller wave amplitudes in comparison to recordings the scaling relation that uses asperity size instead of actual rupture area presents a smaller rupture area and a larger average slip leading to better tsunami predictions while for the 2014 iquique and 2015 illapel tsunamis of relatively smaller earthquake magnitude different scaling relations lead to comparable tsunami predictions we further implement these scaling relations to study a potential earthquake in the manila subduction zone results show that different scaling relations cause significant differences in the tsunami arrival time and wave amplitude at coastal cities especially in the along trench direction thus to access the tsunami threat from mega earthquakes and build early warning systems it is necessary to select the appropriate scaling relations keywords tsunamis tsunami warning scaling relations 1 introduction most devastating tsunamis in history are caused by thrust earthquakes in subduction zones leading to severe damage to the coastal community such as the 1960 m w 9 5 chile earthquake cisternas et al 2005 the 1964 m w 9 2 alaska earthquake reimnitz and marshall 1965 ichinose et al 2007 the 2004 m w 9 1 sumatra earthquake lay et al 2005 titov et al 2005 the 2011 m w 9 1 tohoku earthquake simons et al 2011 fujii et al 2011 satake et al 2013 and two recent chilean tsunamis in 2014 and 2015 the 2014 iquique earthquake occurred in the northern portion of the 1877 earthquake seismic gap in northern chile slip deficit of about 6 to 9 m may have accumulated since 1877 post event analysis of tsunami records shows that the shallow rupture near the trench is very small lay et al 2014 an et al 2014 which may otherwise cause significantly larger tsunamis as is the case for the tohoku event the 2015 illapel tsunami was recorded by more than 20 gauges but most of the gauges were located along the coastline as a result studies show large variance in the east west location of the fault rupture and it is still not clearly understood if there was significant shallow rupture near the trench tilmann et al 2016 li et al 2016 melgar et al 2016 an et al 2017 an and meng 2017 for the most recent tsunamis in light of the deployment of seismometers tsunami buoys and other types of sensors various data of the earthquakes and tsunamis are recorded and they can be utilized to infer the earthquake rupture process and source parameters in particular the deep ocean assessment and reporting of tsunami dart project provides real time tsunami measurements in the open ocean including such data in finite fault inversions can promisingly recover the tsunami source and reproduce the tsunami recordings satake 1987 fujii et al 2011 satake et al 2013 an et al 2014 heidarzadeh et al 2016 an et al 2017 on such basis for early tsunami warning purposes the pacific tsunami warning centre ptwc conducts finite fault inversions by making use of the dart data and issues accurate tsunami predictions wei et al 2003 2008 however in areas where there lacks tsunami buoys such as the south china sea tsunami measurements are not available as a result most local tsunami warning systems rely on a different approach which is called the tsunami scenario strategy in such a strategy for subduction zones with potential tsunami genesis uniform slip models are constructed before an earthquake occurs and the corresponding tsunamis are numerically simulated after an earthquake tsunami warnings are issued based on the scenario with the most similar earthquake magnitude to construct the uniform slip models fault rupture parameters are obtained from a given earthquake magnitude according to empirical scaling relations wells and coppersmith 1994 blaser et al 2010 strasser et al 2010 murotani et al 2008 2013 thingbaijam et al 2017 tsunami sources in reality involve temporal processes regarding earthquake ruptures for example ren et al 2019 evaluated the impact of kinetic rupture on tsunami generation and propagation during the 2004 sumatra and 2011 tohoku tsunamis however tsunami warning systems ignore such effects for the purpose of rapid warning scaling relations provide a quantitative relationship between rupture parameters e g length width slip and earthquake magnitude they are usually derived from the regression of large databases of historical earthquakes due to the different database used and different type of earthquakes studies often obtain similar but slightly different scaling relations for instance wells and coppersmith 1994 compiled the source parameters of 244 global earthquakes classified them according to their focal mechanism and derived scaling relations for different types of earthquakes even though the moment magnitude of earthquakes ranges m w 5 8 in their study the scaling relations obtained for thrust earthquakes have been widely used to access the tsunami hazards for magnitude 8 or larger earthquakes liu et al 2009 wu and huang 2009 nguyen et al 2014 blaser et al 2010 extended the earthquake catalog adopted by wells and coppersmith 1994 from 244 to 283 earthquakes by adding more subduction earthquakes of relatively higher moment magnitude up to m w 9 5 they derived a new set of scaling relations with special focus on the large subduction zone earthquakes strasser et al 2010 obtained similar scaling relations as blaser et al 2010 s by compiling 95 inter plate earthquakes in addition to wells and coppersmith 1994 s earthquake catalogue with magnitude ranging from m w 6 3 to m w 9 4 murotani et al 2008 2013 collected the finite fault slip models of plate boundary earthquakes m w 6 7 9 2 in the vicinity of japan that occurred from 1923 to 2011 and derived a scaling relation between the conventional rupture area s and the seismic moment m 0 particularly they also proposed a scaling relation between the asperity rupture area s a and the seismic moment where s a is defined as the fault area with slip 1 5 times the average slip or larger a most recent study by thingbaijam et al 2017 observed that the scaling behavior of the rupture area to moment is consistent for all cases except normal faulting earthquakes empirical scaling relations are widely used to assess regional tsunami hazards liu et al 2009 wu and huang 2009 nguyen et al 2014 ren et al 2017 in addition local tsunami warning systems also depend on such scaling relations for instance the south china sea tsunami warning system operated by national marine environment forecasting center china adopts the scaling relations given by wells and coppersmith 1994 and ren et al 2014 the japan tsunami warning system operated by the japan meteorological agency jma kamigaichi 2009 uses the following scaling relations log l 0 5 m w 1 8 and l 2 w l rupture length w rupture width m w earthquake magnitude it should be noted that most of these scaling relations are derived from seismic data there have been very few studies that quantitatively evaluate their effectiveness in generating tsunamis in a most recent study an et al 2018 demonstrated that slip heterogeneity can largely be ignored for tsunami warning purposes and they also derived a scaling relation suitable for tsunami generation in this study we test the performance of four representative and commonly used scaling relations given by wells and coppersmith 1994 hereafter referred to as wells1994 blaser et al 2010 hereafter blaser2010 strasser et al 2010 hereafter strasser2010 and murotani et al 2013 hereafter murotani2013 respectively by applying them to the 2011 tohoku 2014 iquique and 2015 illapel tsunamis stirling et al 2013 compiled a worldwide set of scaling relations and evaluated their relevance to a range of tectonic regimes they pointed out that the wells1994 scaling relations are out of date in terms of data and hence should not be used if more modern scaling relations are available however since the wells1994 scaling relations are still widely adopted by tsunami modelers it is included in the analysis of this study the results of strasser2010 are found to be very similar to that of blaser2010 so it is excluded from the main text but provided in the supplementary information and discussed in the discussion section the numerically simulated tsunami waves from scaling relations are compared to the tsunami recordings at various sensors south china sea has drawn many research interests due to its potential of large tsunamis and a local warning system is in need lin et al 2015 thus we apply the three scaling relations in a virtual earthquake scenario of m w 9 0 in the manila subduction zone tsunami arrival time and wave heights are analyzed near the coastlines surrounding the south china sea which will be useful for future design of tsunami warning systems 2 rupture parameters from different scaling relations we select three well documented tsunami events to evaluate the effectiveness of different scaling relations on the generation of tsunamis they are the 2011 tohoku earthquake fig 1 the 2014 iquique and the 2015 illapel earthquakes fig 2 the scaling relations adopted in this study are those given by wells and coppersmith 1994 blaser et al 2010 and murotani et al 2013 the source parameters derived from these scaling relations for the three earthquakes are shown in table 1 the seismic moment for the three earthquakes is obtained from finite fault inversions of tsunami data it is 2 25 1 0 22 nm m w 8 9 for the 2011 tohoku earthquake an et al 2018 1 22 1 0 21 nm m w 8 0 for the 2014 iquique earthquake an et al 2014 and 2 46 1 0 21 nm m w 8 2 for the 2015 illapel earthquake an et al 2017 respectively we note here that for each earthquake event we use the scaling relations to calculate the rupture dimension first rupture area s length l and width w and the average slip d is then calculated by m μ s d m seismic moment μ earth rigidity the earth rigidity used in this study which varies in depth is extracted from the preliminary reference earth model prem dziewonski and anderson 1981 murotani et al 2013 provided two different scaling relations to the earthquake moment regarding the conventional rupture area and the asperity size respectively here we use the formulas regarding the asperity size in addition the ratio of rupture length and width is not given by murotani et al 2013 and here we use a ratio of 1 0 which is found to be the optimum ratio for tsunami generation an et al 2018 other ratios have also been addressed and the results are given in the supplementary information more discussions about the conventional rupture area and different length width ratios are provided in the discussion section for the 2011 tohoku earthquake we assume a single fault plane with a strike angle of 198 and dip angle of 14 fujii et al 2011 for the 2014 iquique and the 2015 illapel earthquakes the strike angle is 340 and 4 respectively and the dip angle is extracted from the local slab geometry slab 1 0 hayes et al 2012 the rake angle is set to 90 to represent thrust focal mechanism the center of each rupture model is located at the global cmt centroid which is derived from long period seismic waves and may better represent the location of the final slip than the epicenter an et al 2018 all the fault parameters are provided in the supplementary information by applying the okada s analytical solution okada 1985 to the source parameters the static seafloor deformation is calculated and the corresponding initial sea surface elevation mimics the seafloor profile upon the assumption of instant rupture and incompressible water the propagation of tsunami waves is then numerically simulated using the software package funwave tvd shi et al 2012 kirby et al 2013 which solves nonlinear boussinesq equations the computational domain for the 2011 tohoku tsunami extends from 127 e to 160 e 27 5 n to 47 5 n and the total grid number is 3960 2400 the computational domain for the 2014 iquique tsunami extends from 90 w to 65 w 30 s to 15 s and the total grid number is 3000 1800 the computational domain for the 2015 illapel tsunami extends from 85 w to 65 w 40 s to 15 s and the total grid number is 2400 3000 the global bathymetry data gebco 2014 general bathymetric chart of the oceans www gebco net with a uniform resolution of 30 arcsec are used we have carried out convergence tests using the murotani2013 model for each tsunami event with grid sizes of 90 60 and 30 arcsec respectively the results are provided in figs s1 s2 and s3 for the tohoku iquique and illapel earthquakes respectively it is seen that 30 arcsec is sufficiently good for simulations of the tsunami waves at dart stations in deep water and the first waves at most of the coastal stations we point out that the bathymetry resolution of 30 arcsec could be too coarse to resolve the complex local bathymetry features at some coastal gauges but at most stations the tsunami waves can be well modeled using grid size of 30 arcsec e g heidarzadeh et al 2016 melgar et al 2016 an et al 2017 the courant friedrichs lewy c f l number in the simulation is 0 5 the coefficient of bottom friction is 0 015 sponge layers are imposed to absorb reflected wave at the computational boundaries and the thickness of the sponge layers is 200 km 3 comparison of tsunami waveforms with observations we first compare the initial sea surface deformation resulted from the three different scaling relations shown in fig 3 for all the three earthquakes it is observed that the wells1994 scaling relations lead to narrow and long rupture areas due to the selected length width ratio of 1 0 the rupture areas from the murotani2013 scaling relations are concentrated in square zones results of different ratios are discussed in the discussion section consequently the initial sea surface elevation is also narrow and long for the wells1994 models and relatively short for the murotani2013 models besides for the same earthquake the rupture area is estimated to be larger using the wells1994 scaling relations than using the murotani2013 scaling relations and the maximum initial wave height is therefore smaller in the wells1994 models than in the murotani2013 models for all the three earthquakes the blaser2010 scaling relations lead to even larger rupture area and smaller maximum initial wave height than the wells1994 models albeit still very similar to the results of wells1994 we then compare the tsunami waves generated from the three slip models with recordings at various stations the location of the dart buoys and coastal stations is given in fig 1 for the 2011 tohoku event and fig 2 for the 2014 iquique and 2015 illapel events the comparison of tsunami waves is shown in figs 4 6 for the 2011 tohoku 2014 iquique and 2015 illapel event respectively it is seen from the top panel of fig 4 that for the 2011 tohoku earthquake the models of wells1994 and blaser2010 predict much earlier wave arrivals than the recordings at stations to the north and south of the earthquake source such as stations 613 202 and 203 in the north stations 407 815 and 812 in the south this is due to the elongated rupture area estimated using the scaling relations of wells1994 and blaser2010 fig 3a on the other hand the arrival time predicted by the murotani2013 model is similar to the recordings at most of the stations besides we also observe that the predicted wave heights by the wells1994 and blaser2010 models are smaller than recorded at most of the stations while the predicted amplitudes by the murotani2013 model agree well with the recordings thus it can be inferred that the wells1994 and blaser2010 models underestimate the initial wave height and the murotani2013 model leads to initial wave height similar to reality this is also demonstrated by the bottom panel of fig 4 which shows the relative error of the first wave arrival time and amplitude predicted by the three slip models at most stations the murotani2013 model produces clearly smaller errors than the other two models for the 2014 iquique earthquake shown in fig 5 it is found that the predictions from the three slip models present less significant differences compared to the 2011 tohoku event at some stations e g mata pata toco meji anto the results of wells1994 and blaser2010 have earlier wave arrivals and smaller first wave amplitudes than the results of murotani2013 however the overall discrepancies are less observable than those in the 2011 tohoku earthquake this is also shown in the bottom panel of fig 5 which plots the relative error of first wave arrival time and amplitude the reason is that the magnitude of the 2014 iquique earthquake is much smaller than the 2011 tohoku earthquake and hence the rupture dimension of the 2014 iquique earthquake is also much smaller thus the absolute differences of rupture dimension estimated from different scaling relations are also smaller leading to smaller discrepancies of first wave arrival time and amplitude for the 2015 illapel earthquake the magnitude is smaller than the 2011 tohoku earthquake and larger than the 2014 iquique earthquake therefore the discrepancies among the three scaling relations are less significant than those in the 2011 tohoku earthquake and more significant than those in the 2014 iquique earthquake respectively the results are shown in fig 6 from figs 4 6 it can be concluded that the larger the earthquake magnitude the more significant the discrepancies of tsunami waves predicted from different scaling relations in addition based on the results of the three investigated earthquakes for earthquakes of larger magnitude the scaling relations of murotani2013 with a length width ratio of 1 0 lead to better tsunami predictions than other scaling relations 4 assessment of potential megatsunamis near the manila trench the manila trench is an oceanic trench along which the eurasian plate is subducting eastward underneath the luzon volcanic arc on the philippine sea plate there have been many studies to investigate its potential to produce large earthquakes and tsunamis galgana et al 2007 utilized regional gps velocities and focal mechanism data to constrain the tectonic deformation along the manila subduction zone and results suggested that the manila trench could be possibly poorly coupled similarly hsu et al 2012 used gps data trench parallel gravity anomaly and bathymetry to infer plate coupling patterns along the manila subduction zone they derived a maximum plate coupling ratio of 0 4 between the west luzon trough and the scarborough seamount and concluded that megathrust rupture along the entire manila subduction zone is not likely nevertheless people are still concerned about mega earthquakes and tsunami in this zone liu et al 2009 megawati et al 2009 and nguyen et al 2014 simulated the tsunami waves generated by earthquakes of various magnitudes near the manila trench propagating to the coast of china vietnam and philippine ren et al 2015 2017 and li et al 2018 investigated the characteristics of the evolution of tsunami waves over the mild slope in the south china sea including wave dispersion nonlinearity and wave splitting liu et al 2009 proposed a tsunami warning strategy based on finite fault inversion theory most of the above mentioned studies adopt uniform slip models to calculate the tsunami waves generated from an earthquake the parameters of the uniform slip models are obtained from a given earthquake magnitude using different scaling relations here we quantify the impact of different scaling relations on the generated tsunami waves in the south china sea by numerically simulating an artificial earthquake and the following tsunami we artificially impose a giant earthquake on the fault of the manila trench with the same seismic moment as the 2011 tohoku earthquake m w 8 9 we point out that the largest earthquake in the manila subduction zone that caused a known tsunami in history had a magnitude of 7 9 which occurred on february 14 1934 noaa 2019 however larger earthquakes could also possibly happen for example the magnitude of the 2011 tohoku earthquake was not expected before the earthquake kido et al 2011 lay et al 2011 previous works have considered m w 9 or larger earthquakes in the manila subduction zone wu and huang 2009 megawati et al 2009 nguyen et al 2014 the fault geometry is inferred from the earthquake focal mechanisms in the time period between 1973 and 2010 hsu et al 2012 which consists of three major segments with uniform strike angle and an averaged dip angle in depth for each segment the artificial earthquake is located in the middle segment the rupture dimension and average slip can be calculated using different scaling relations and the results are the same as the tohoku event shown in table 1 the focal depth is determined such that the top edge of the rupture area reaches the trench note that the strike angle in the models of wells1994 and blaser2010 varies in order to follow the curvature of the trench all the fault parameters are provided in the supplementary information we then simulate and analyze the tsunami waves propagating from the manila trench to the surrounding countries fig 7 by adopting the half space elastic dislocation model okada 1985 the coseismic seafloor deformation and the initial water elevation are calculated shown in the left panels of fig 8 similar to the tohoku case it is observed that the wells1994 result presents an elongated zone of water elevation and relatively small maximum wave height while the murotani2013 result shows a compact zone of relatively large wave height the blaser2010 model leads to an even larger area of water elevation with smaller wave height compared to the wells1994 model the right panels in fig 8 display the first wave amplitude resulted from the three scaling relations it is found that in the direction perpendicular to the strike of the trench where the tsunami energy is mostly concentrated the murotani2013 model impacts a wider area along the chinese coast with higher wave height than the other two models it seems to be the same for the coastal area along vietnam and taiwan which is more clearly demonstrated in fig 9 we note here that the wells1994 and balser2010 models have curved strike direction which can lead to different energy focusing compared to uniform strike however it is observed in fig 8 that the direction of energy concentration is still largely determined by the middle rupture zone fig 9 shows the simulated first wave arrival time and amplitude along the coastlines surrounding the south china sea the top panel shows the results along the coastline of western philippines which is near the tsunami source it is found that although the wells1994 model presents smaller maximum initial water height than the murotani2013 model the wave height along the coastline is somewhat larger this is possibly because the wells1994 model has a longer zone of water elevation extending to the south so the coastline where the first wave amplitude is analyzed is closer to the tsunami source the second panel provides the results along the coastline of southern china which is in the direction of tsunami energy focus the arrival time is almost identical because the edge of the initial water elevation starts from the trench in all the three models the murotani2013 model predicts large first wave amplitude in a larger area than the wells1994 model while the blaser2010 model leads to the smallest amplitude among the three models in the third panel the first wave arrival time and amplitude along the coastline of western taiwan is plotted since the murotani2013 model has a significantly smaller zone of tsunami source than the other two models the arrival time is predicted to be clearly later in addition the first wave amplitude given by the murotani2013 model is also obviously larger and it can be 1 5 to 2 times the amplitude predicted by the other two models this is consistent with our previous analysis of the tohoku iquique and illapel tsunamis for the three previous tsunamis most of the observation stations are located along the coast which is parallel to the trench axis in this synthetic test taiwan is also in the strike direction of the trench where the murotani2013 model predicts later arrival time and higher amplitude than the other two models in the bottom panel of fig 9 along the coastline of western vietnam which is approximately parallel to the trench strike the murotani2013 model predicts slightly later first wave arrivals and larger wave amplitude than the other two models 5 discussion in the previous sections we have evaluated three scaling relations proposed by wells and coppersmith 1994 blaser et al 2010 and murotani et al 2013 on the generation of tsunami waves another widely used scaling relation was derived by strasser et al 2010 here we also analyze this scaling relation and compare the results with the three above mentioned scaling relations the results are found to be almost identical as the blaser2010 results for all the three tsunami events for example for the tohoku tsunami the blaser2010 model and strasser et al s 2010 model lead to an averaged relative error of the first wave arrival time of 20 and 21 respectively and an averaged relative error of the first wave amplitude of 53 and 54 respectively details are provided in the supplementary information tables s1 s2 figs s4 s5 s6 s7 besides in addition to the scaling relation regarding the asperity size murotani et al 2013 also obtained a scaling relation between the conventional rupture area and the earthquake magnitude hence we also adopt this scaling relation and simulate the tsunami waves for the tohoku iquique and illapel events the results are found to be similar to the blaser2010 results tables s3 s4 figs s8 s9 s10 and s11 in the supplementary information thus although they vary in details all the scaling relations including those given by wells and coppersmith 1994 blaser et al 2010 strasser et al 2010 and murotani et al 2013 produce comparable tsunami simulation results except the one related to asperity size proposed by murotani et al 2013 compared to other scaling relations the murotani2013 scaling relation regarding the asperity rupture area leads to smaller zone of initial water elevation with higher amplitude resulting in later tsunami arrivals and larger first wave amplitude near coastlines especially in the direction of trench axis murotani et al 2013 provided only the scaling relation between the earthquake magnitude and the rupture area without determining the rupture length width ratio in this study we adopt the length width ratio of 1 0 which was found to be the optimum ratio for the three selected tsunamis by an et al 2018 here we also test a more widely used value 2 0 for the length width ratio the fault parameters with a length width ratio of 2 0 are listed in table s5 and the relative errors are given in table s6 in fig s12 we observe that the results of ratio 2 0 have a more elongated zone of elevated water because most of the stations are located in the along trench direction the first wave arrivals are earlier using ratio 2 0 than 1 0 as shown in figs s13 s14 and s15 overall the results of ratio 2 0 match the recordings worse than the results of ratio 1 0 which can also be seen from the arrival time and first wave amplitude at observation stations besides it is also found that the error of ratio 2 0 is more significant for the tohoku event and it decreases with the earthquake magnitude this is attributed to the decrease of absolute rupture dimension table 2 summarizes the averaged relative errors of the first wave amplitude and arrival time in the 2011 tohoku 2014 iquique and 2015 illapel tsunamis using different scaling relations 6 conclusions in this study we evaluate the impact of scaling relations of earthquake source parameters on the generation of tsunamis four commonly used scaling relations proposed by wells and coppersmith 1994 blaser et al 2010 strasser et al 2010 and murotani et al 2013 are studied by applying them to the 2011 tohoku 2014 iquique 2015 illapel tsunamis the resulted tsunami waves are compared with tsunami recordings at various observation stations the main findings are summarized as follows wells and coppersmith 1994 blaser et al 2010 and strasser et al 2010 predict relatively large source areas and small initial wave height leading to early first wave arrivals and small wave height especially in the direction of trench axis the scaling relation regarding the asperity size givenby murotani et al 2013 produces a compact rupture area with relatively large initial water elevation and the predicted tsunami waves match the recordings with significantly smaller errors in comparison to other scaling relations the discrepancies among the scaling relations are more significant for earthquakes of higher magnitude e g the 2011 tohoku earthquake and less observable for smaller earthquakes e g the 2014 iquique earthquake for an artificial earthquake of magnitude m w 9 in the manila subduction zone different scaling relations also result in different tsunami simulation results the largest discrepancies appear at the coastlines of western taiwan the arrival time predicted by the murotani2013 scaling relation is significantly later and the first wave amplitude can be 1 5 to 2 times that given by the other scaling relations along the coastlines of western vietnam and southern china only part of the coastal area is affected by the different scaling relations as the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco opened the south china sea tsunami advisory center in may 2018 which is now in operation to issue tsunami warnings for countries surrounding the south china sea it is important to choose an appropriate scaling relation in order for high prediction accuracy we note that the conclusions are obtained based the three selected tsunamis recently it has been discussed that forcing the rupture area to be more compact than the conventional rupture area such as the asperity size adopted by murotani et al 2013 could be a good practical solution to predict

22262,short term deterministic wave prediction has gained increasing interest recently this paper presents a framework on the use of data driven model based on artificial neural network ann in predicting the spatial temporal evolution of wavefields in real time from a given wavefield record upstream we choose a wave environment south of albany western australia which is known to be swell dominated and simulate many realisations of long crested random waves using higher order spectral method hosm for each sea state sampled from the scatter diagrams of that particular location several scenarios based on the number and arrangement of wave probes providing the upstream wavefield information are considered the performance of the ann model after training process is compared with a model based on linear wave theory lwt and expressed in terms of normalised prediction error taking the simulated wavefields from hosm as the reference we will show that the use of ann model is promising in that it is able to provide reasonable prediction with error within 20 over a large distance downstream keywords deterministic wave prediction predictable zone linear wave theory artificial neural network higher order spectral method south coast of western australia 1 introduction phase averaged wave forecasting has advanced over the decades and state of the art third generation models such as wam wamdi 1988 wavewatch iii tolman et al 2009 and swan booij et al 1999 have been commonly used however as they do not resolve any information on the wave phases no deterministic prediction of the evolution of wavefield is possible only statistical quantities taken as a representative of a sea state defined in 1 or 3 h are available typical quantities include significant wave height h s peak spectral wave period t p and mean wave direction with the recent advances in computing technologies phase resolved simulations of fully nonlinear wavefields are now feasible and short term deterministic wave prediction becomes possible short term deterministic wave prediction has many important applications in marine and offshore context the main driver is to improve the efficiency of certain operations which only take couple of minutes if not seconds to less than an hour this includes float over installation equipment lifting remotely operated vehicle rov operations helicopter or air craft take off and landing dynamic positioning of vessels such as for side by side tethered floating systems and rescue operations in marine renewable energy context some drivers include installation of wind turbines and reactive control of renewable wave energy converters wec in emerging technology such as for autonomous or remotely operated vessels wave prediction capability is important in order to chart out effective route planning as well as to avoid freak waves we consider an initial set of measured wave data either temporal or spatial or both upstream and perform deterministic prediction of what the wavefield would look like at a distance downstream in real time hence this is different to phase resolved wave forecasting based on time series analysis commonly applied for reactive control of wec where the only wave measurement available is at the wec itself e g see fusco and ringwood 2010 in our case the prediction process consists of two stages the first stage is on the extraction of initial conditions from measurement data wave reconstruction or also called the assimilation process once a set of initial conditions satisfying the measured wavefield is obtained the subsequent stage on forward integration or wave propagation in space and time can be carried out the second stage can be further classified into whether linear or nonlinear models are used for the wave propagation or evolution using linear model based on linear wave theory linear wave dispersion can be used to propagate the upstream information towards downstream although this will only work for sea states with small steepness and limited to very short term prediction examples of linear predictions are given in morris et al 1998 naaijen and huijsmans 2008 wijaya et al 2015 and ruban 2016 as the steepness increases nonlinear wave wave interaction dominates and linear wave model will not be adequate although the prediction can be achieved in real time nonlinear models which solve the wave evolution equation at third order or beyond can achieve better accuracy and longer prediction range compared to the linear model most of the work focus on the development of higher order deterministic prediction model based on the use of higher order spectral method hosm which is an efficient numerical tool for fully nonlinear wavefield simulations but restricted to potential flow theory assumption dommermuth and yue 1987 west et al 1987 examples of nonlinear predictions are given in wu 2004 blondel et al 2010 blondel couprie et al 2013 and köllisch et al 2018 another prediction model based on nonlinear schrodinger equation is outlined by simanesew et al 2017 however obtaining results faster than real time is challenging as köllisch et al 2018 claimed apparently the long computational times required for nonlinear models are mostly due to the data assimilation procedure rather than the forward integration in time which is a more straightforward process therefore in recent years the focus is more on deriving efficient data assimilation procedure such as köllisch et al 2018 who introduces assimilation procedure based on the use of newton krylov subspace projections and for real ocean applications the focus is on coupling the data assimilation process with measured wave return signals from marine radar see e g aragh et al 2008 to bring the deterministic wave prediction closer to real time we use a data driven model based on artificial neural network ann in particular a simple three layer feed forward ann has been shown to be able to achieve sufficient accuracy for both long term and short term wave forecasting fernandez et al 2013 deo et al 2001 makarynskyy 2004 ren et al 2018 what ann is good at after being trained is mapping or correlating the incident wavefield instantaneously to what it should look like at some locations downstream and hence eliminating the typical two stage prediction process the emphasis is on real time prediction with sufficient accuracy and we demonstrate how a simple feed forward ann which is purely data driven at this moment can be usefully applied in a close to unidirectional and swell dominated wave environment south of albany western australia through this study 2 environmental setting we consider h s t p scatter diagrams produced from a wave buoy at a location off albany s 3 5 2 1 e 11 7 5 3 3 3 see http www transport wa gov au imarine albany tide and wave asp so off the south coast of western australia the data was downloaded from the australian department of transportation dot website the dot buoy is in 60 m of water approximately 15 km off the beach the location is known to be swell dominated with mean wave period of over 10 s so the assumption of unidirectional wavefields is reasonable the scatter diagrams record the density of historical occurrence of any possible sea states at the location which is from 31 aug 2008 15 june 2017 fig 1 shows the h s t p scatter diagrams of albany measured by the dot buoy the two lines represent lines of constant steepness defined as s h s t p 2 solid line for the constant limiting steepness s 0 0584 for albany and dashed line for the constant mean steepness s 0 0149 for albany the limiting steepness line in one sense represents the most severe historical sea states ever predicted at that location during the period of the available data from the scatter diagrams we produce a large number of nonlinear random wave simulations along the two steepness lines using higher order spectral numerical wave tank hos nwt see bonnefoy et al 2010 and ducrozet et al 2012 with a range of periods bounded by the bold solid lines along limiting steepness and the bold dashed line along mean steepness in fig 1 the range is from 8 to 16 s along the mean steepness line and from 8 to 12 s along the limiting steepness line we assume a jonswap spectral shape with peak enhancement factor of 3 3 and randomly seed the wave phase for each simulation we consider a domain with uniform water depth of 60 m and with a length of 3500 m whereby the waves are generated at x 0 m and fully absorbed from x 2800 m onwards each simulation is run for 1 h simulation time which corresponds to a sea state and it takes 50 min computational time to generate each sea state using a single core in intel xeon e5 2690 v3 2 60 ghz 3 methodology 3 1 linear wave theory lwt deterministic wave prediction can be achieved using linear wave dispersion theory where ω 2 g k tanh k h where ω is the wave frequency g is the gravitational acceleration k is the wavenumber and h is the water depth the measured surface elevation time history at a probe say at x 0 taken as the input for prediction can be transformed into spectral components for instance each component can be propagated in space following linear dispersion theory as follows 1 η δ x re n a n exp i ω n t exp i k n δ x where η δ x is the predicted surface elevation as a function of relative distance from the probe δ x a n is the amplitude of each component expressed as complex number and t is the time 3 2 artificial neural network ann ann is a computing system that establishes correlation between its input and output according to a given set of data its basic component is a neuron which applies an activation function f on the weighted sum of several inputs x i and obtains an output y as follows 2 y f w 0 i 1 n w i x i where w 0 is the bias x i i 1 n is the input the activation function such as rectifier linear unit sigmoid or others allows the neuron to establish the non linearity correlation between input and output by connecting several neurons into a neural network it forms a multivariate function which can be expressed as 3 y f x w where x and y are the arrays of input and respective output and w is the array of weights in the network the function f depends on the configuration of the neural network which includes but not limited to dense convolutional recurrent nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs narx and any of their combinations an ann model is trained by adjusting the weight w such that the difference between the predicted output and the desired output is minimised the choice of the configuration depends on the purpose for instance convolutional network is suitable for image processing narx is suitable for autoregressive time series prediction recurrent network is suitable for language processing in this study our objective is to predict the surface elevation time history at a downstream probe η in real time using only the surface elevation time history at an upstream probe η 1 this can be translated into setting up an ann to map the surface elevation history at the upstream probe η 1 t i i m 1 m 2 m m to the downstream probe η t i i n 1 n 2 n n i e 4 η t i i n 1 n 2 n n f η 1 t i i m 1 m 2 m m w where t i 1 t i δ t where 1 δ t is the sampling rate t i i m 1 m 2 m m is the time instance where surface elevation at the upstream probe is collected t i i n 1 n 2 n n is the time instance where surface elevation at the downstream probe is predicted by ann in this case a deep feed forward neural network is considered to be a good choice to approximate the function f as it correlates every input to output without making assumptions its schematic diagram is shown in fig 2 note that a normalisation is conducted on the input to ensure a faster convergence of weights in ann the normalisation factor is chosen as 2 σ 1 where σ 1 is the standard deviation of the input η 1 t i i m 1 m 2 m m this factor is effectively equal to h s 2 which is consistent with the normalised error to be defined in eq 6 in this work we focus on training an ann model that is able to predict the surface elevation for sea states with a constant steepness in particular we train two separate models for each of the limiting steepness line at h s t p 0 0148 and the mean steepness line at 0 0584 shown in fig 1 for each steepness 2000 realisations with varying periods are generated using hos where half of them are used as the training data set for ann to adjust its weights while the other half of them are used to evaluate the error of predicted surface elevation it has been shown in previous studies that a three layer feed forward neural network one input layer one hidden layer and one output layer with sufficient neurons 2 m 1 where m is the number of input in the hidden layer is capable of establishing a satisfactory correlation between input and output deo et al 2001 ren et al 2018 huang and foo 2002 nevertheless we conducted a sensitivity check to determine the configuration of ann which gives a better prediction the result is shown in fig 3 and their performance is quantified using prediction error in eq 7 at x 500 m it is observed that the prediction error is similar for different number of neurons in the hidden layer on the other hand the prediction error decreases moderately from one hidden layer to two hidden layers and continue to decrease marginally as the number of hidden layers increases based on the sensitivity check we choose a feed forward neural network with 2 hidden layers each with 903 neurons three times of the number of input for our study the number of samples used to train the ann is 1000 and these samples are trained for 1000 epochs the chosen configuration takes 10 5 h to train the ann network over 1000 realisations using a nvidia tesla k40t graphics card 3 3 error assessment to quantify the error between the predicted surface elevation η and the measured surface elevation taken as the reference η r the following expression following wu 2004 is used over large n s samples 5 e x t 1 n s n 1 n s ϵ n 2 x t where ϵ n x t is the normalised error between predicted and reference wavefield for n th realisation it is defined as 6 ϵ n x t η n r x t η n x t h s n 2 essentially the root mean square rms error is normalised with a denominator which is 2 σ where σ is the standard deviation of the underlying wavefield to assess the convergence of the simulations as a function of a number of samples n s another error similar to wu 2004 is used 7 e d x d x t e x t d t d x t d t where d x t is the spatial temporal domain size of a predictable zone defined in the next subsection we will use eq 7 to check the convergence of predictable zone derived from either lwt or ann model as well as to establish the convergence of the number of samples required to train the ann model 3 4 predictable zone following wu 2004 and recently qi et al 2018 a theoretical predictable zone can be obtained from the maximum and minimum group velocity of a random wave group group velocity is used since the energy content of a wavefield propagates with group velocity the group velocity is computed using the following form 8 c g ω k 1 2 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h for a given recorded or measured data of limited time or space sample both the maximum and minimum group velocities have to be derived the identification of such group velocities within a real sea states or wavefield is somewhat ad hoc in our approach we first transform the temporal or spatial domain series into frequency or wavenumber domain spectrum and subsequently find the lower and upper cut off frequency or wavenumber that would produce at least 85 of the total energy of the recorded data the choice of 85 seems arbitrary but it is worth noting that higher percentage requirement would yield very low and high cut off frequency this translates to very slow and very fast group velocity of which the theoretical predictable zone would become very small also note that wu 2004 used the input frequency range of any theoretical spectrum which they used to simulate random waves to determine the maximum and minimum group velocities here the necessary information is derived solely from the measured data without any prior knowledge of the input as an alternative to the theoretical approach one can also obtain the predictable zone numerically by simulating synthetic random waves based on linear superposition and performing deterministic wave prediction using linear wave theory the predictable zone for different scenarios is as follows case 1 a single probe measuring over time at a fixed position assuming a single probe exists at a fixed position and that it has been measuring surface elevation of random waves over a time interval τ a predictable zone bounded by the maximum and minimum group velocities of the particular wave record can be constructed as shown in fig 4 the probe position is at x 0 and the measurement intervals are from τ 1000 1100 s or over 100 s period as well as over 300 s period the contour is plotted in terms of prediction error e x t as shown in eq 5 a predictable zone can be categorised into three distinct parts within a measured time interval τ the predictable zone along the distance axis can be considered as wave reconstruction or nowcasting beyond τ the predictable zone is considered as wave prediction or forecasting before the measurement interval τ the predictable zone although this is not shown is regarded as hindcasting in this paper we only present results for both wave reconstruction and prediction the good agreement between the numerical and theoretical predictable zones demonstrates that the cut off value of 85 of total energy to derive the maximum and minimum group velocity forming the theoretical predictable zone is entirely appropriate comparing fig 4 a and b it is obvious that a simple way to increase the current spatial temporal predictable zone is by extending the measurement interval alternatively the use of multiple probes can also extend the current predictable zone as demonstrated in the next scenario case 2 two probes measuring over same time interval at two fixed positions assuming that there are now two probes adjacent to each other and both have been measuring the surface elevation over a same time interval τ a predictable zone for each probe can be constructed just as the previous result and if the group velocity remains largely unchanged at the two probe locations the shape of the two predictable zones will be very similar to each other if the two predictable zones overlap the predictable zone can be extended as shown in fig 5 a the assumption here is that only forward wave propagation is accounted for where information travels with increasing time and distance and hence the predictable zone of the first probe at x 0 m is indifferent to that of the same probe at the previous scenario if backward wave propagation is considered the information from probe 2 at x 500 m can be used to reconstruct the wavefields in between the two probes and a more complete predictable zone can be constructed in conjunction with the wave prediction using forward wave propagation the result is shown in fig 5 b where the predictable zone of probe 1 is now different to that of the same probe at the previous scenario therefore it should be possible to reconstruct the whole wavefields by combining wave measurements at several discrete locations and this will be investigated in future work case 3 multiple probes measuring at a time instant over a range of fixed positions now consider a scenario where multiple probes over a range of fixed positions are used to measure a spatial profile of the surface elevation at a time instant a snapshot in time for example by using a marine radar to scan over a close to unidirectional sea state for a case where the measurement spans across 1500 m the predictable zone is as shown in fig 6 the combined predictable zone can be interpreted as a combination of two zones the first zone is derived by propagating in space and time the initial spatial profile using the mean group velocity to the last probe location which is at x 1500 m this results in predicted surface elevation time history with τ 100 s and the subsequent predictable zone is then consistent with the single probe scenario as shown in fig 4 a 4 nonlinear random wave simulations here a large number of nonlinear random wave realisations are simulated using hosm and the performance of the lwt and ann method in real time deterministic wave prediction is assessed and compared 4 1 a single probe measuring over time at a fixed position we consider a scenario where an upstream probe at x 250 m has been measuring wavefield in time over 300 s i e from 1000 1300 s and then use both the lwt and ann models to provide predictions in real time on what the wavefield will look like in space and time downstream of the probe the ann model is used to cover prediction over 500 s thus there is no time lag imposed to account for the time needed for the wave group to propagate from upstream probe to the locations of interest this is to allow the ann model to produce its predictable zone and assess whether the zone is at least better than what the lwt model would produce in theory fig 7 presents a comparison between the two models at x 500 m for a realisation along limiting steepness line with the simulated waves using hos nwt taken as the reference it can be observed from the figure that the ann model gives a better prediction compared to lwt model both qualitatively and quantitatively an interesting feature is the ability of the ann model to capture the zero crossing periods of the surface elevation time history although there are occasional mismatches in some of the wave crests and troughs this is not observed in the lwt model where there is a phase difference between its prediction and the reference waves the phase difference is attributed by the assumption of linear dispersion in the lwt model fig 8 summarises the results for all the 1000 realisations under the same scenario for sea states along mean and limiting steepness lines the prediction error obtained using the lwt model is plotted as background contour while the zone obtained using the ann model is plotted as vertical strips over eight discrete locations downstream of the probe note the colour code represents the normalised rms error for each model which is plotted from 0 to 0 5 scale it can be seen from the figure that the prediction error between the two models is comparable for the mean steepness line and within the theoretical predictable zone both models are able to yield error less than 15 for limiting steepness line the prediction error for the lwt model increases considerably demonstrating the inadequacy of the model as the wavefields within the sea states become highly non linear and close to breaking on the other hand the ann model which has been previously trained for large samples along each steepness line is able to provide reasonable prediction with error within 20 over a large distance downstream beyond if not bounded by the theoretical zone this demonstrates that the use of ann model is promising in this aspect it is worth remarking that within the theoretical predictable zone it is possible to minimise the prediction error such as by using nonlinear wave evolution equation to propagate the wavefields as demonstrated in wu 2004 however the challenge is to bring the prediction to if not faster than real time with the use of ann model real time prediction within an acceptable level of accuracy seems possible although arguably whether or not a prediction error of 20 is acceptable would have to depend on the application it is worth noting that the size of the two theoretical predictable zones enclosed by solid white lines are comparable as expected since the range of peak wave periods t p used to simulate the two different steepness lines are also comparable to one another fig 9 plots the distribution of ϵ between the predicted wavefield from the ann model and the reference wavefield at x 500 m for all the sea states along the limiting steepness line also shown is the fitted theoretical normal distribution it can be seen that ϵ is normally distributed with zero mean and standard deviation of 0 158 which compares well with e contour plot in fig 8 b this also demonstrates that the current data driven model contains no bias fig 10 shows the convergence test of the simulations as a function of a number of samples n s using eq 7 as the number of simulations approach 1000 samples the error converges rather quickly with that we set n s 1000 samples as the minimum sample size for each scenarios 4 2 two probes measuring over same time interval at two fixed positions we then consider a scenario where now there are two upstream probes at x 250 and 750 m 500 m apart which have been measuring wavefield in time over 300 s i e from 1000 1300 s the predictable zones for sea states along both steepness lines are shown in fig 11 with background contour the prediction error from the lwt model and vertical strips from the ann model similar results can be seen in that for mean steepness line the prediction error of both models is comparable while for limiting steepness line the ann model performs better similar to the previous one probe case the prediction error of the ann model within the theoretical predictable zone is within 20 having an additional probe both enhances and extends the predictable zone of the ann model at downstream locations as can be observed by comparing the prediction error between the two scenarios one probe vs two probes the additional probe also enables the ann model to reconstruct the wavefields at locations in between the two adjacent probes with sufficient accuracy consider a common location such as at x 500 m between the two scenarios and it can be seen that the prediction improves with an additional probe the results also demonstrate that the ann model is unable to reconstruct the wavefield beyond the downstream probe location or beyond the two bounding adjacent probes where there is insufficient information to perform any meaningful prediction the promising use of the ann model to reconstruct the whole spatial wavefields from a given set of wave measurements at several discrete locations will be further explored in future study 4 3 multiple probes measuring at a time instant snapshot spanning over a range of fixed positions we consider the last scenario of multiple probes measuring a spatial profile of wavefield at a time instant fig 12 presents the prediction error for a case where the measurement spans across 1000 m for sea states along both steepness lines whereby the background contour is derived from the lwt model and vertical strips from the ann model similar results can be observed in that the ann model performs better than the lwt model as the sea state steepness increases also the prediction error of the ann model within the theoretical predictable zone is within 20 4 4 on the choice of universal or multiple ann models the results so far are presented for two separate or specific ann models for two steepness lines while in reality h s t p diagrams representing all possible sea states in a location are highly scattered instead of training multiple ann models for multiple steepness lines a simple brute force approach can be implemented by training a universal ann model to cover all the possible h s t p combinations to briefly investigate the performance of these two approaches we consider the scenario where only a limited set of training data is available assuming that the training data contains only 500 realisations of limiting steepness sea state and 500 realisations of mean steepness sea state the first approach is to use 500 realisations of each steepness to train two specific ann models while the second approach is to train a universal ann model with all 1000 realisations the configurations of both ann models remain identical thus the computational time taken to train a specific ann model is around half of that of a universal ann model their performance is evaluated by comparing their prediction error computed using eq 5 over other 1000 realisations of the corresponding steepness the comparison is shown in fig 13 where the prediction error e of both models for a single probe scenario located at x 250 m as in section 4 1 is plotted at x 500 m it can be observed that the prediction error increases slightly by going from a specific shown as red line to a universal shown as blue line ann model in particular the mean error of the universal ann model within predictable zone is increased by 0 015 and 0 018 relative to the specific ann models trained at limiting and mean steepness lines respectively given that the difference is marginal the result suggests that it is possible to train a universal ann model to account for all possible sea state combinations this would be a more practical solution when there is limited measurement available but at the expense of reduced prediction accuracy 5 conclusions a short term deterministic or phase resolved wave prediction in real time has been demonstrated using both linear wave theory lwt and artificial neural network ann model sea states along two steepness lines from scatter diagrams of h s t p at albany are simulated using higher order spectral method hosm assuming uniform water depth with no wave breaking nor presence of current a range of scenarios are considered from a single probe to multiple probe scenarios and the concept of theoretical predictable zone based on the maximum and minimum group velocity first proposed by wu 2004 is applied for sea states containing a range of t p for sea states along mean steepness line the prediction error between lwt and ann model is comparable and within the theoretical predictable zone the prediction errors of both models are less than 15 for sea states along limiting steepness line the performance of the lwt model decreases considerably as expected on the other hand the performance of ann model is reasonable with prediction error within 20 over a large distance downstream for real time prediction application the use of ann model seems promising of course the prediction error requirement and the exact arrangement of probes locations and sampling period would depend on the actual application it is worth re emphasising on the several key assumptions used in the current study first is on the assumption of uniformity in water depth for an application with depth variation or changing bathymetry the effect of wave shoaling and wave breaking has to be accounted for second is on the assumption of unidirectional waves the effect of wave directionality spread sea is expected to reduce the performance of the present ann model and this will be assessed in the near future a key limitation is that the proposed approach is purely data driven at the moment hence the performance is limited to scenarios the model has previously encountered through the training process an improvement of the present model to account for physics of nonlinear wave evolution is being investigated such capability is expected to minimise the prediction error further acknowledgements we thank jeff hansen and prof paul taylor of university

models are used for the wave propagation or evolution using linear model based on linear wave theory linear wave dispersion can be used to propagate the upstream information towards downstream although this will only work for sea states with small steepness and limited to very short term prediction examples of linear predictions are given in morris et al 1998 naaijen and huijsmans 2008 wijaya et al 2015 and ruban 2016 as the steepness increases nonlinear wave wave interaction dominates and linear wave model will not be adequate although the prediction can be achieved in real time nonlinear models which solve the wave evolution equation at third order or beyond can achieve better accuracy and longer prediction range compared to the linear model most of the work focus on the development of higher order deterministic prediction model based on the use of higher order spectral method hosm which is an efficient numerical tool for fully nonlinear wavefield simulations but

to be able to achieve sufficient accuracy for both long term and short term wave forecasting fernandez et al 2013 deo et al 2001 makarynskyy 2004 ren et al 2018 what ann is good at after being trained is mapping or correlating the incident wavefield instantaneously to what it should look like at some locations downstream and hence eliminating the typical two stage prediction process the emphasis is on real time prediction with sufficient accuracy and we demonstrate how a simple feed forward ann which is purely data driven at this moment can be usefully applied in a close to unidirectional and swell dominated wave environment south of albany western australia through this study 2 environmental setting we consider h s t p scatter diagrams produced from a wave buoy at a location off albany s 3 5 2 1 e 11 7 5 3 3 3 see http www transport wa gov au imarine albany tide and wave asp so off the south coast of western australia the data was downloaded from the australian department of transportation dot website the dot buoy is in 60 m of water approximately 15 km off the beach the location is known to be swell dominated with mean wave period of over 10 s so the assumption of unidirectional wavefields is reasonable the scatter diagrams record the density of historical occurrence of any possible sea states at the location which is from 31 aug 2008 15 june 2017 fig 1 shows the h s t p scatter diagrams of albany measured by the dot buoy the two lines represent lines of constant steepness defined as s h s t p 2 solid line for the constant limiting steepness s 0 0584 for albany and dashed line for the constant mean steepness s 0 0149 for albany the limiting steepness line in one sense represents the most severe historical sea states ever predicted at that location during the period of the available data from the scatter diagrams we produce a large number of nonlinear random wave simulations along the two steepness lines using higher order spectral numerical wave tank hos nwt see bonnefoy et al 2010 and ducrozet et al 2012 with a range of periods bounded by the bold solid lines along limiting steepness and the bold dashed line along mean steepness in fig 1 the range is from 8 to 16 s along the mean steepness line and from 8 to 12 s along the limiting steepness line we assume a jonswap spectral shape with peak enhancement factor of 3 3 and randomly seed the wave phase for each simulation we consider a domain with uniform water depth of 60 m and with a length of 3500 m whereby the waves are generated at x 0 m and fully absorbed from x 2800 m onwards each simulation is run for 1 h simulation time which corresponds to a sea state and it takes 50 min computational time to generate each sea state using a single core in intel xeon e5 2690 v3 2 60 ghz 3 methodology 3 1 linear wave theory lwt deterministic wave prediction can be achieved using linear wave dispersion theory where ω 2 g k tanh k h where ω is the wave frequency g is the gravitational acceleration k is the wavenumber and h is the water depth the measured surface elevation time history at a probe say at x 0 taken as the input for prediction can be transformed into spectral components for instance each component can be propagated in space following linear dispersion theory as follows 1 η δ x re n a n exp i ω n t exp i k n δ x where η δ x is the predicted surface elevation as a function of relative distance from the probe δ x a n is the amplitude of each component expressed as complex number and t is the time 3 2 artificial neural network ann ann is a computing system that establishes correlation between its input and output according to a given set of data its basic component is a neuron which applies an activation function f on the weighted sum of several inputs x i and obtains an output y as follows 2 y f w 0 i 1 n w i x i where w 0 is the bias x i i 1 n is the input the activation function such as rectifier linear unit sigmoid or others allows the neuron to establish the non linearity correlation between input and output by connecting several neurons into a neural network it forms a multivariate function which can be expressed as 3 y f x w where x and y are the arrays of input and respective output and w is the array of weights in the network the function f depends on the configuration of the neural network which includes but not limited to dense convolutional recurrent nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs narx and any of their combinations an ann model is trained by adjusting the weight w such that the difference between the predicted output and the desired output is minimised the choice of the configuration depends on the purpose for instance convolutional network is suitable for image processing narx is suitable for autoregressive time series prediction recurrent network is suitable for language processing in this study our objective is to predict the surface elevation time history at a downstream probe η in real time using only the surface elevation time history at an upstream probe η 1 this can be translated into setting up an ann to map the surface elevation history at the upstream probe η 1 t i i m 1 m 2 m m to the downstream probe η t i i n 1 n 2 n n i e 4 η t i i n 1 n 2 n n f η 1 t i i m 1 m 2 m m w where t i 1 t i δ t where 1 δ t is the sampling rate t i i m 1 m 2 m m is the time instance where surface elevation at the upstream probe is collected t i i n 1 n 2 n n is the time instance where surface elevation at the downstream probe is predicted by ann in this case a deep feed forward neural network is considered to be a good choice to approximate the function f as it correlates every input to output without making assumptions its schematic diagram is shown in fig 2 note that a normalisation is conducted on the input to ensure a faster convergence of weights in ann the normalisation factor is chosen as 2 σ 1 where σ 1 is the standard deviation of the input η 1 t i i m 1 m 2 m m this factor is effectively equal to h s 2 which is consistent with the normalised error to be defined in eq 6 in this work we focus on training an ann model that is able to predict the surface elevation for sea states with a constant steepness in particular we train two separate models for each of the limiting steepness line at h s t p 0 0148 and the mean steepness line at 0 0584 shown in fig 1 for each steepness 2000 realisations with varying periods are generated using hos where half of them are used as the training data set for ann to adjust its weights while the other half of them are used to evaluate the error of predicted surface elevation it has been shown in previous studies that a three layer feed forward neural network one input layer one hidden layer and one output layer with sufficient neurons 2 m 1 where m is the number of input in the hidden layer is capable of establishing a satisfactory correlation between input and output deo et al 2001 ren et al 2018 huang and foo 2002 nevertheless we conducted a sensitivity check to determine the configuration of ann which gives a better prediction the result is shown in fig 3 and their performance is quantified using prediction error in eq 7 at x 500 m it is observed that the prediction error is similar for different number of neurons in the hidden layer on the other hand the prediction error decreases moderately from one hidden layer to two hidden layers and continue to decrease marginally as the number of hidden layers increases based on the sensitivity check we choose a feed forward neural network with 2 hidden layers each with 903 neurons three times of the number of input for our study the number of samples used to train the ann is 1000 and these samples are trained for 1000 epochs the chosen configuration takes 10 5 h to train the ann network over 1000 realisations using a nvidia tesla k40t graphics card 3 3 error assessment to quantify the error between the predicted surface elevation η and the measured surface elevation taken as the reference η r the following expression following wu 2004 is used over large n s samples 5 e x t 1 n s n 1 n s ϵ n 2 x t where ϵ n x t is the normalised error between predicted and reference wavefield for n th realisation it is defined as 6 ϵ n x t η n r x t η n x t h s n 2 essentially the root mean square rms error is normalised with a denominator which is 2 σ where σ is the standard deviation of the underlying wavefield to assess the convergence of the simulations as a function of a number of samples n s another error similar to wu 2004 is used 7 e d x d x t e x t d t d x t d t where d x t is the spatial temporal domain size of a predictable zone defined in the next subsection we will use eq 7 to check the convergence of predictable zone derived from either lwt or ann model as well as to establish the convergence of the number of samples required to train the ann model 3 4 predictable zone following wu 2004 and recently qi et al 2018 a theoretical predictable zone can be obtained from the maximum and minimum group velocity of a random wave group group velocity is used since the energy content of a wavefield propagates with group velocity the group velocity is computed using the following form 8 c g ω k 1 2 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h for a given recorded or measured data of limited time or space sample both the maximum and minimum group velocities have to be derived the identification of such group velocities within a real sea states or wavefield is somewhat ad hoc in our approach we first transform the temporal or spatial domain series into frequency or wavenumber domain spectrum and subsequently find the lower and upper cut off frequency or wavenumber that would produce at least 85 of the total energy of the recorded data the choice of 85 seems arbitrary but it is worth noting that higher percentage requirement would yield very low and high cut off frequency this translates to very slow and very fast group velocity of which the theoretical predictable zone would become very small also note that wu 2004 used the input frequency range of any theoretical spectrum which they used to simulate random waves to determine the maximum and minimum group velocities here the necessary information is derived solely from the measured data without any prior knowledge of the input as an alternative to the theoretical approach one can also obtain the predictable zone numerically by simulating synthetic random waves based on linear superposition and performing deterministic wave prediction using linear wave theory the predictable zone for different scenarios is as follows case 1 a single probe measuring over time at a fixed position assuming a single probe exists at a fixed position and that it has been measuring surface elevation of random waves over a time interval τ a predictable zone bounded by the maximum and minimum group velocities of the particular wave record can be constructed as shown in fig 4 the probe position is at x 0 and the measurement intervals are from τ 1000 1100 s or over 100 s period as well as over 300 s period the contour is plotted in terms of prediction error e x t as shown in eq 5 a predictable zone can be categorised into three distinct parts within a measured time interval τ the predictable zone along the distance axis can be considered as wave reconstruction or nowcasting beyond τ the predictable zone is considered as wave prediction or forecasting before the measurement interval τ the predictable zone although this is not shown is regarded as hindcasting in this paper we only present results for both wave reconstruction and prediction the good agreement between the numerical and theoretical predictable zones demonstrates that the cut off value of 85 of total energy to derive the maximum and minimum group velocity forming the theoretical predictable zone is entirely appropriate comparing fig 4 a and b it is obvious that a simple way to increase the current spatial temporal predictable zone is by extending the measurement interval alternatively the use of multiple probes can also extend the current predictable zone as demonstrated in the next scenario case 2 two probes measuring over same time interval at two fixed positions assuming that there are now two probes adjacent to each other and both have been measuring the surface elevation over a same time interval τ a predictable zone for each probe can be constructed just as the previous result and if the group velocity remains largely unchanged at the two probe locations the shape of the two predictable zones will be very similar to each other if the two predictable zones overlap the predictable zone can be extended as shown in fig 5 a the assumption here is that only forward wave propagation is accounted for where information travels with increasing time and distance and hence the predictable zone of the first probe at x 0 m is indifferent to that of the same probe at the previous scenario if backward wave propagation is considered the information from probe 2 at x 500 m can be used to reconstruct the wavefields in between the two probes and a more complete predictable zone can be constructed in conjunction with the wave prediction using forward wave propagation the result is shown in fig 5 b where the predictable zone of probe 1 is now different to that of the same probe at the previous scenario therefore it should be possible to reconstruct the whole wavefields by combining wave measurements at several discrete locations and this will be investigated in future work case 3 multiple probes measuring at a time instant over a range of fixed positions now consider a scenario where multiple probes over a range of fixed positions are used to measure a spatial profile of the surface elevation at a time instant a snapshot in time for example by using a marine radar to scan over a close to unidirectional sea state for a case where the measurement spans across 1500 m the predictable zone is as shown in fig 6 the combined predictable zone can be interpreted as a combination of two zones the first zone is derived by propagating in space and time the initial spatial profile using the mean group velocity to the last probe location which is at x 1500 m this results in predicted surface elevation time history with τ 100 s and the subsequent predictable zone is then consistent with the single probe scenario as shown in fig 4 a 4 nonlinear random wave simulations here a large number of nonlinear random wave realisations are simulated using hosm and the performance of the lwt and ann method in real time deterministic wave prediction is assessed and compared 4 1 a single probe measuring over time at a fixed position we consider a scenario where an upstream probe at x 250 m has been measuring wavefield in time over 300 s i e from 1000 1300 s and then use both the lwt and ann models to provide predictions in real time on what the wavefield will look like in space and time downstream of the probe the ann model is used to cover prediction over 500 s thus there is no time lag imposed to account for the time needed for the wave group to propagate from upstream probe to the locations of interest this is to allow the ann model to produce its predictable zone and assess whether the zone is at least better than what the lwt model would produce in theory fig 7 presents a comparison between the two models at x 500 m for a realisation along limiting steepness line with the simulated waves using hos nwt taken as the reference it can be observed from the figure that the ann model gives a better prediction compared to lwt model both qualitatively and quantitatively an interesting feature is the ability of the ann model to capture the zero crossing periods of the surface elevation time history although there are occasional mismatches in some of the wave crests and troughs this is not observed in the lwt model where there is a phase difference between its prediction and the reference waves the phase difference is attributed by the assumption of linear dispersion in the lwt model fig 8 summarises the results for all the 1000 realisations under the same scenario for sea states along mean and limiting steepness lines the prediction error obtained using the lwt model is plotted as background contour while the zone obtained using the ann model is plotted as vertical strips over eight discrete locations downstream of the probe note the colour code represents the normalised rms error for each model which is plotted from 0 to 0 5 scale it can be seen from the figure that the prediction error between the two models is comparable for the mean steepness line and within the theoretical predictable zone both models are able to yield error less than 15 for limiting steepness line the prediction error for the lwt model increases considerably demonstrating the inadequacy of the model as the wavefields within the sea states become highly non linear and close to breaking on the other hand the ann model which has been previously trained for large samples along each steepness line is able to provide reasonable prediction with error within 20 over a large distance downstream beyond if not bounded by the theoretical zone this demonstrates that the use of ann model is promising in this aspect it is worth remarking that within the theoretical predictable zone it is possible to minimise the prediction error such as by using nonlinear wave evolution equation to propagate the wavefields as demonstrated in wu 2004 however the challenge is to bring the prediction to if not faster than real time with the use of ann model real time prediction within an acceptable level of accuracy seems possible although arguably whether or not a prediction error of 20 is acceptable would have to depend on the application it is worth noting that the size of the two theoretical predictable zones enclosed by solid white lines are comparable as expected since the range of peak wave periods t p used to simulate the two different steepness lines are also comparable to one another fig 9 plots the distribution of ϵ between the predicted wavefield from the ann model and the reference wavefield at x 500 m for all the sea states along the limiting steepness line also shown is the fitted theoretical normal distribution it can be seen that ϵ is normally distributed with zero mean and standard deviation of 0 158 which compares well with e contour plot in fig 8 b this also demonstrates that the current data driven model contains no bias fig 10 shows the convergence test of the simulations as a function of a number of samples n s using eq 7 as the number of simulations approach 1000 samples the error converges rather quickly with that we set n s 1000 samples as the minimum sample size for each scenarios 4 2 two probes measuring over same time interval at two fixed positions we then consider a scenario where now there are two upstream probes at x 250 and 750 m 500 m apart which have been measuring wavefield in time over 300 s i e from 1000 1300 s the predictable zones for sea states along both steepness lines are shown in fig 11 with background contour the prediction error from the lwt model and vertical strips from the ann model similar results can be seen in that for mean steepness line the prediction error of both models is comparable while for limiting steepness line the ann model performs better similar to the previous one probe case the prediction error of the ann model within the theoretical predictable zone is within 20 having an additional probe both enhances and extends the predictable zone of the ann model at downstream locations as can be observed by comparing the prediction error between the two scenarios one probe vs two probes the additional probe also enables the ann model to reconstruct the wavefields at locations in between the two adjacent probes with sufficient accuracy consider a common location such as at x 500 m between the two scenarios and it can be seen that the prediction improves with an additional probe the results also demonstrate that the ann model is unable to reconstruct the wavefield beyond the downstream probe location or beyond the two bounding adjacent probes where there is insufficient information to perform any meaningful prediction the promising use of the ann model to reconstruct the whole spatial wavefields from a given set of wave measurements at several discrete locations will be further explored in future study 4 3 multiple probes measuring at a time instant snapshot spanning over a range of fixed positions we consider the last scenario of multiple probes measuring a spatial profile of wavefield at a time instant fig 12 presents the prediction error for a case where the measurement spans across 1000 m for sea states along both steepness lines whereby the background contour is derived from the lwt model and vertical strips from the ann model similar results can be observed in that the ann model performs better than the lwt model as the sea state steepness increases also the prediction error of the ann model within the theoretical predictable zone is within 20 4 4 on the choice of universal or multiple ann models the results so far are presented for two separate or specific ann models for two steepness lines while in reality h s t p diagrams representing all possible sea states in a location are highly scattered instead of training multiple ann models for multiple steepness lines a simple brute force approach can be implemented by training a universal ann model to cover all the possible h s t p combinations to briefly investigate the performance of these two approaches we consider the scenario where only a limited set of training data is available assuming that the training data contains only 500 realisations of limiting steepness sea state and 500 realisations of mean steepness sea state the first approach is to use 500 realisations of each steepness to train two specific ann models while the second approach is to train a universal ann model with all 1000 realisations the configurations of both ann models remain identical thus the computational time taken to train a specific ann model is around half of that of a universal ann model their performance is evaluated by comparing their prediction error computed using eq 5 over other 1000 realisations of the corresponding steepness the comparison is shown in fig 13 where the prediction error e of both models for a single probe scenario located at x 250 m as in section 4 1 is plotted at x 500 m it can be observed that the prediction error increases slightly by going from a specific shown as red line to a universal shown as blue line ann model in particular the mean error of the universal ann model within predictable zone is increased by 0 015 and 0 018 relative to the specific ann models trained at limiting and mean steepness lines respectively given that the difference is marginal the result suggests that it is possible to train a universal ann model to account for all possible sea state combinations this would be a more practical solution when there is limited measurement available but at the expense of reduced prediction accuracy 5 conclusions a short term deterministic or phase resolved wave prediction in real time has been demonstrated using both linear wave theory lwt and artificial neural network ann model sea states along two steepness lines from scatter diagrams of h s t p at albany are simulated using higher order spectral method hosm assuming uniform water depth with no wave breaking nor presence of current a range of scenarios are considered from a single probe to multiple probe scenarios and the concept of theoretical predictable zone based on the maximum and minimum group velocity first proposed by wu 2004 is applied for sea states containing a range of t p for sea states along mean steepness line the prediction error between lwt and ann model is comparable and within the theoretical predictable zone the prediction errors of both models are less than 15 for sea states along limiting steepness line the performance of the lwt model decreases considerably as expected on the other hand the performance of ann model is reasonable with prediction error within 20 over a large distance downstream for real time prediction application the use of ann model seems promising of course the prediction error requirement and the exact arrangement of probes locations and sampling period would depend on the actual application it is worth re emphasising on the several key assumptions used in the current study first is on the assumption of uniformity in water depth for an application with depth variation or changing bathymetry the effect of wave shoaling and wave breaking has to be accounted for second is on the assumption of unidirectional waves the effect of wave directionality spread sea is expected to reduce the performance of the present ann model and this will be assessed in the near future a key limitation is that the proposed approach is purely data driven at the moment hence the performance is limited to scenarios the model has previously encountered through the training process an improvement of the present model to account for physics of nonlinear wave evolution is being investigated such capability is expected to minimise the prediction error further acknowledgements we thank jeff hansen and prof paul taylor of university

22263,quantifying the uncertainty in experimental results is a critical step in properly validating numerical simulation tools for designing floating wind turbines without a good understanding of the experimental uncertainties it is impossible to determine if numerical simulation tools can capture the physics with acceptable accuracy recent validation studies suggest that the wave induced low frequency surge and pitch motions of semisubmersible type floating wind turbines are consistently underpredicted by numerical simulations but it has not been possible to state whether or not this underprediction is within the level of experimental error in the present work previously assessed systematic uncertainty components in hydrodynamic tests of the oc5 deepcwind semisubmersible are propagated to response metrics of interest using numerical simulation tools and combined with the system s random uncertainty to obtain the total experimental uncertainty the uncertainty in the low frequency response metrics is found to be most sensitive to the system properties e g mooring stiffness and center of gravity and also the wave elevation the results of the present study suggest that the underprediction of the low frequency response behavior observed in previous validation studies is larger than the experimental uncertainty keywords floating offshore wind uncertainty analysis oc5 validation nonlinear wave mechanics 1 introduction floating wind turbines fwts represent a growing area of both academic and industrial interest and a wide range of numerical tools have been developed to predict their responses in wind and waves recently participants in the international offshore code comparison collaboration continued with correlation oc5 project attempted to validate models of a floating semisubmersible tested in the offshore basin at marin in may 2013 by the deepcwind consortium goupee et al 2014 although state of the art tools captured some of the dynamics and loads of the complex floating wind turbine there were persistent differences between the simulated results and measurements the reasons for which could not be ascertained the discrepancies are exemplified by an under prediction of the ultimate and fatigue loads across multiple load cases which were shown to be dominated by the under prediction of the loads at the pitch and tower natural frequencies robertson et al 2017 similar discrepancies in the low frequency response of other model scale semisubmersible platforms for offshore wind have also been observed cermelli and roddier 2005 philippe et al 2013 berthelsen et al 2016 in order to assess whether or not the observed differences between numerical and experimental results are meaningful an assessment of the level of experimental uncertainty in the response behavior needs to be determined to that end additional testing of the semisubmersible structure from the oc5 study in a simplified configuration was carried out at marin through the marinet2 grant these simplified tests were aimed toward better understanding the hydrodynamic loading and assessing uncertainty in the test campaign the generic open access design oc5 deepcwind floating semisubmersible was tested at 1 50 scale with the same floating substructure as was examined in oc5 but with a rigid tower a mass representing the rotor nacelle assembly and with a simplified soft spring mooring system representing the linear stiffness of the original catenary configuration the wind turbine and flexible tower were replaced by rigid components to limit uncertainty sources and better focus on the hydrodynamic loading on the structure due to the limited testing time in the basin a single configuration was considered and a limited number of wave conditions were tested gueydon 2017 extensive repetition tests were included in the test matrix to assess the random uncertainty in the experiment response metrics low dimensional representations of the important features of the time series of results are used to represent the results and the associated uncertainty the experimental uncertainty originates from uncertainties in the excitation of the system and the properties of the test specimen and the accuracy and precision of the measurement equipment several standards provide guidance on uncertainty assessment such as the international standards organization iso 1993 american society of mechanical engineers asme 2013 and the international towing tank conference ittc 2008 here we apply the asme terminology categorizing the sources of uncertainty as either random or systematic systematic uncertainties may result in an unknown bias in the test while random uncertainties result in randomly varying uncertainties which can be measured through repetition tests the contributions to the experimental uncertainty in the new set of tests were identified and documented in previous work robertson et al 2018 among the main findings it was shown that the uncertainty in the wave elevation was small and was dominated by random uncertainty it should be noted however that the uncertainties in the wave loads not measured may be larger than the uncertainties in the wave elevation the physical properties of the model itself were found to have more significant systematic uncertainties and the measurement cable contributed significantly to the uncertainty in the mass and in the center of mass the measurement of motion responses was precise while the tension measurements had relatively high random uncertainty the present work seeks to identify the total uncertainty of the response metrics of interest this is accomplished by first propagating the systematic uncertainties to the response metrics through numerical simulations and then combining with the calculated random uncertainty three state of the art simulation tools applied by four different users and considering several modeling approaches were used to assess the consequences of changes in the input parameters corresponding to the systematic uncertainty levels on responses such as the low frequency surge and pitch motions and wave frequency surge and pitch motions in the remainder of the paper the model tests and response metrics of interest are briefly described sections 2 and 3 next the uncertainty sources identified by robertson et al 2018 are summarized and the most important of these are identified section 4 the methodology for propagating systematic uncertainties is explained and the total uncertainty is examined sections 5 and 6 2 test description the floating semisubmersible model consisted of the existing marin model 9697 whose geometry corresponds to the deepcwind semisubmersible floater goupee et al 2012 at 1 50 scale and a rigid aluminum tower designed to mimic the mass and inertia of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine tower and rotor nacelle assembly jonkman et al 2009 jonkman 2010 a brief overview of the model setup fig 1 is given here additional details may be found in robertson et al 2018 the test setup and all results are presented at full scale following froude scaling the difference in density between sea water 1025 kg m3 and fresh water in the basin 998 6 kg m3 is accounted for in the scaling of masses inertias forces moments and derived quantities a simplified mooring system was designed and constructed for the new tests three mooring lines consisting of a soft spring and rigid wire were attached to the model a pulley system was used such that the spring could be vertical and dry while the anchor positions were low enough that the surge pitch coupling from the mooring system was similar to the original catenary system 2 1 model properties the main characteristics of the floater geometry are shown in table 1 while the hydrodynamic properties and mass properties are given in table 2 and table 3 respectively the mooring system which included thin wires attached to springs is described in table 4 when modelling the system numerically we strived to use the properties of the system as measured where possible for a floating system the first step is to ensure that the system is in equilibrium for the prescribed values of the draft mass mooring tensions and displaced water volume for this test we directly measured the draft mass and tensions the displaced water volume can be calculated from the geometry but since it is not directly measured we considered this property as the most unknown we did not tune the other properties mentioned but set the displaced water volume such that the system was in equilibrium table 5 2 2 test matrix the tests in this campaign included a hammer test free decay tests and wave excitation tests only the wave excitation tests are of interest here and are summarized in table 6 as shown multiple repetitions were carried out for the model in waves which will be used to assess the random uncertainty in the response behavior the repetitions were performed with the same wave realization with the goal of having identical wave time series 3 response metrics the objective of the larger validation campaign related to these experiments is to better understand the ability of simulation tools to predict the response of the oc5 deepcwind semisubmersible to hydrodynamic loading especially the low frequency resonant responses in pitch and surge to assess the capabilities of the tools in this area response metrics were identified to represent these important physical quantities of interest the response metrics are scalar values that can be computed from the time series results from either simulations or experiments a simulation tool that can reproduce the response metrics within the obtained uncertainty bounds can then be considered validated the response metrics in the present work focus on the surge heave and pitch responses of the semisubmersible in particular the mean response in surge and the wave frequency and low frequency responses in all three degrees of freedom the response metrics are chosen with the objective of representing these different response components rather than selecting metrics that are useful for design such as the 90th percentile maximum 3 h motions but do not distinguish among different frequency ranges the response metrics in the present work are m1 rao the response amplitude operator rao in surge heave and pitch at 6 discrete frequency points within the wave energy range m2 psd sum low frequencies the integral of the power spectral density psd of surge and pitch motions over the low frequency range m3 psd sum wave frequencies the integral of the psd of surge and pitch motions over the wave frequency range and m4 mean surge offset for all of the metrics only a limited time window of the analysis is considered table 7 in an attempt to focus on data after start up transient behavior and also address the effect of reflected waves the irregular wave window consists of the last 3 h after reflections are established while the regular wave window includes 10 min of data once the ramp in the waves has passed but before any reflections arrive from the beach or wavemaker furthermore all of the time series are resampled with a time step of 0 1 s prior to computing any metrics response metrics m2 and m3 are only computed for the irregular wave cases metric m1 the rao is defined as the amplitude of the response divided by the amplitude of the incoming wave at a given frequency six discrete frequencies are considered for the rao calculations as shown in table 8 the algorithm applied for computing the rao denoted h ω is based on the cross spectral density h y u u u where u and y are the fourier transforms of the wave elevation and the motion response respectively and the asterisk indicates the complex conjugate the integrals of the psds of the response referred to as psd sums metrics m2 and m3 are chosen to capture frequency dependent responses both inside and outside the wave frequency range in irregular sea states compared to other possible metrics such as rms values this approach keeps some frequency information when calculating the psd sums all time series measured and simulated are first cut and sampled such that they have identical discretization in time time step and duration the same psd calculation algorithm without smoothing is then applied to all time series the psd sums are computed based on the one sided unsmoothed discrete power density functions s s u m i j k s r e s p f i δ f where s r e s p is the discrete power spectral density of the response at frequency f i δ f is the corresponding frequency increment j is the index of the first frequency of interest and k is the index of the last frequency of interest the frequency limits for the low m2 and wave frequency m3 components of the spectrum are given in table 9 these are based on identifying the ranges over which the wave spectra were defined and then encompassing the lower frequencies below that range without considering the zero frequency mean value 4 uncertainty sources 4 1 random uncertainty robertson et al 2018 identified a number of sources for random uncertainty in the response metrics however since repeated measurements of the quantities of interest were available the random uncertainty could be calculated directly from the measurements without the need to assess the source of the uncertainties the random standard uncertainty s x is calculated as the standard deviation s x of the metric x across the repeated tests divided by the square root of the number of observations n s x s x n 4 2 systematic uncertainty systematic uncertainty is a representation of the possible bias in a test campaign and cannot be calculated directly from measurements instead the sources of systematic uncertainty throughout the test must be identified their individual effect on the metrics calculated and then those effects combined the sources of systematic uncertainty in this test campaign include the wave excitation system properties and configuration and output measurements expert analysis of the systematic uncertainties in the test campaign identified 24 separate parameters with significant levels of systematic uncertainty these parameters are listed in table 10 robertson et al 2018 provide a thorough discussion on the assessment of the uncertainty levels for these parameters from this original set of systematic uncertainty sources the parameters were down selected based on their influence on the response metrics they were thresholded by examining the total combined estimated systematic uncertainty of the response metrics parameters whose effect on the change across all metrics was less than 10 were removed in the end the original set of 24 parameters was down selected to 8 which are summarized in table 11 note that only parameters related to the system properties and configuration remain in the list and no measurement or wave excitation uncertainties are included in this new list when the platform mass was changed the displaced volume was adjusted to ensure the heave equilibrium position was not altered the goal was to have each of these parameters be independent of one another if just the mass were altered the draft would have changed which is a separate parameter for many of these parameters varying them will change the response of the system without directly changing the wave excitation variation 1 increases the cross coupling of inertia contributions e g surge pitch heave pitch variations 2 and 7 change the inertia moment in pitch and consequently the pitch natural period variation 3 results in a change of the surge natural period on the other hand variations 4 and 5 directly affect the wave excitation by changing the volume exposed to the waves while also changing the pitch natural period for variation 4 the pitch period is modified through the shift of the buoyancy point and the variation of displacement variation 5 results in a change in the metacentric height and hence in the pitch period variation 8 affects the surge and heave natural periods while variation 6 only affects the wave excitation 5 uncertainty propagation uncertainty propagation is determining the sensitivity of the output response to the input and model uncertainties if a closed form solution is known for this relationship then the uncertainty can be propagated analytically however for complex problems such as the dynamics of a floating offshore wind system a closed form solution may not be available in these situations numerical methods can be used instead a common approach is to use a monte carlo approach to sample the input uncertainty distribution and calculate the effective output distribution the calculation itself can be accomplished through simulation of a numerical model of the system reduced order models are often used because of their computational efficiency e g polynomial chaos expansion murcia et al 2016 and machine learning techniques clifton et al 2014 an even simpler method is sequential perturbation manteufel 2012 figliola and beasley 2011 which requires just two simulations at the bounds of the input or model uncertainty to assess the uncertainty bounds on the response metric of interest sequential perturbation is used here to limit the computation time and maintain the use of sufficiently accurate models the process of using a model to propagate uncertainty can be problematic because it relies on the use of the modeling tools that are to be validated to perform the uncertainty propagation if the tools do not represent the phenomena of interest accurately they may not provide an accurate assessment of the sensitivity of parameter variations on that phenomena to address this issue multiple numerical modeling tools and multiple modeling approaches were used to propagate the uncertainties in this work the largest positive and negative contributions out of all simulation approaches are then used as the sensitivity coefficient for each parameter of interest within the limits of the numerical models this approach is expected to give a conservative estimate of the uncertainty for validation purposes 5 1 approach the systematic uncertainty of an output response metric b r is calculated by combining each of the elemental systematic output standard uncertainties b i b r 2 i 1 n b i 2 for the systematic uncertainties related to the input waves or model properties these uncertainty values d i must be first propagated to their effect on the response metric uncertainty b i θ i d i where θ i x p i are the sensitivity coefficients of individual parameters p i on the metric of interest x and d i are the elemental input model systematic uncertainties as summarized in table 11 once propagated each of the output metric uncertainty sources may be summed the sensitivity coefficients represent the influence that the input model uncertainties have on the output metrics and are typically calculated analytically but if that is not possible numerical models of the system can be used to estimate them in this work the systematic uncertainty of the response metrics due to a given uncertainty source is estimated by sequential perturbation by first simulating the model using the baseline properties and calculating the associated response metrics then the system is simulated using a new value for one of the six uncertain parameters based on the uncertainty level described in table 11 changes are made in both the positive and negative directions and the response metrics are again calculated the difference between the response metrics calculated using the baseline properties and when changing one of the uncertain parameters is the systematic uncertainty for that parameter systematic uncertainties will be calculated based on both a positive and negative change in the parameter and the resulting level of propagated uncertainty may not be the same see section 5 2 this process is repeated for all six parameters and then those individual uncertainty sources combined in quadrature this method assumes that each of the systematic uncertainty sources in table 11 are independent of each other 5 2 asymmetric uncertainty the propagation results in non symmetric uncertainty bounds for the metrics meaning that the uncertainty on the positive end is sometimes different from the uncertainty on the negative end of the metric value this situation creates a complication in combining the different systematic uncertainty sources as the straightforward method of adding them in quadrature no longer works different approaches can be used to address this the simplest approach is to add the negative uncertainty bounds in quadrature and the positive uncertainty bounds in quadrature separately but this approach has been shown to be inaccurate another approach is proposed by dieck 2007 and uses the calculation of a central value for the nonsymmetric uncertainty bounds which is then used to adjust the final uncertainty summed across multiple sources this approach was used here the systematic uncertainty response metric b i for an individual parameter i is calculated as b i x b i x b i 2 where x is the mean measured value for a given metric the total estimated systematic standard uncertainty b r is then calculated the asymmetry of the systematic uncertainty is further addressed in the calculation of the total uncertainty section 6 1 5 3 modeling tools and methods three different simulation tools were used to propagate the systematic uncertainty in the model properties to the response metrics and several different users contributed results a variety of tools and users were employed since the approach used to model the behavior of the floating wind system could affect the propagation of uncertainty ideally the modeling tools that are to be validated would not be the same ones used to perform the uncertainty propagation but this is the only option for a complex system such as a floating wind turbine the largest propagated uncertainty found across the different tools and users was used to help assuage this limitation all of the simulation approaches represent the floating wind system as a rigid body with linear elastic mooring lines for the hydrodynamic loading second order diffraction is considered in addition to first order potential flow contributions added mass radiation damping and excitation the smaller braces and pontoons were ignored in the potential flow solution different meshes and potential flow solvers were used wamit from wamit 2011 and diffrac from buchner et al 2001 and so the first and second order potential flow solutions differ among the simulation approaches overall when the same modeling approach is used but different modeling tools there is reasonable agreement of the wave and low frequency motions gueydon et al 2014 however differences in the modeling of the first order and second order wave excitations and damping lead to differences in the motion responses especially around the resonance frequencies in surge heave and roll pitch robertson et al 2017 for this study five modeling approaches were followed with three distinct simulation tools to propagate deviations in the set of parameters of table 11 the main differences between these modeling approaches are summarized in table 12 two fundamentally different approaches were used to account for linear and quadratic damping effects a subset of the numerical models used morison type drag to compute quadratic damping loads on the substructure members fast sima anysim while another subset of models used a tuned linear p and quadratic damping q matrix fast pq anysim pq also referred to as the pq approach in this paper the tuning was conducted based on decay tests in surge heave and pitch the pq approach was included here because it has demonstrated improved model predictions for the low frequency pitch motion response of the system in past projects gueydon 2016 the corresponding damping matrices are shown in table 13 furthermore the models using morison elements don t apply the coefficients identically the location of these elements and values of the coefficients are different while all five models accounted for second order difference frequency diffraction the quadratic transfer functions qtf are different the quadratic terms of the qtf used in the anysim and anysim pq simulations were updated based on the motion rao of the floater of the present study while all other simulations were performed with qtfs based on the oc5 deepcwind system robertson et al 2017 even though none of these models are perfect it is assumed that the choice of several tools and modeling approaches should enable an assessment of realistic trends for the propagation of the uncertainty linked to the 8 most influential parameters of table 11 fig 2 5 show a comparison of the psds of the surge and pitch responses for the experimental measurements and the baseline simulations the integration limits for the low frequency and wave frequency psd sums are illustrated using the colored pink and blue regions in the plots as shown the responses around the natural frequencies in surge 0 01 hz and pitch 0 03 hz are significant compared to the wave frequency responses and the experimental measurements show high levels of repeatability in the experiments fig 6 compares the psd sum metrics calculated from these values between experiment and baseline simulations the wave frequency surge and pitch responses are captured fairly well by all of the approaches though the pq approaches tend to underpredict the pitch response in this frequency range due to the resonance small deviations of the wave loads and or the damping can result in differences among simulations every modeler was free to choose their own approach to account for the damping and the wave excitation as a consequence the predictions of the responses around the resonance frequencies in surge and pitch are far less consistent between the different simulation tools than those in the wave frequency region as evident from the response metrics in fig 6 this discrepancy represents an important limitation in the propagation of systematic uncertainty through the use of simulation models can a simulation tool accurately propagate uncertainty in a metric that it does not accurately represent as shown in fig 6 there is varying levels of agreement for the low frequency psd sums between simulation and experiment with the simulations sometimes over predicting the metric value e g fast and fast pq for the white noise cases but mostly under prediction since there is a reasonable level of agreement for some tools it is assumed that the physics included in the numerical simulation tools should be able to capture the relative change in platform responses due to small modifications in the input the consistency of the propagated uncertainty between different modeling approaches will be examined later to assess the validity of this statement 5 4 implementation of parameter variations in numerical models the parameter variations considered for the assessment of the systematic uncertainty were implemented with different approaches in the different numerical models differences arose because every numerical model has inherently different ways of specifying key modelling parameters the goal was to isolate modifications to the model properties to only one parameter at a time but based on the modeling approach employed this was not always possible the different realizations of the model parameter variations for each modelling tool are outlined below variation 1 cm x direction variation 2 cm z direction variation 7 inertia iyy the systematic uncertainty related to variations in the offset of the system center off mass in the x and z directions is investigated with variation 1 and variation 2 respectively the x offset value was specified as 0 22 m and the z offset was specified as 0 21 m respectively fast and sima for the cm change only the cm is moved there is no change in the moment of inertia similarly for variation 7 only the inertia is changed anysim in marin s simulation tool the inertia moments are defined at the center of mass as a consequence shifting the cm resulted in a change of moments of inertia for instance variation 1 resulted in a change in the pitch period of about 2 for variation 7 the inertia is changed independently of the mass by defining a new radius of inertia for the pitch rotation the pitch period varied of 0 3 as a result of this inertia variation variation 3 mooring stiffness for variation 3 the systematic uncertainty related to variations in the mooring stiffness is investigated fast and sima for variation 3 the mooring line stiffness was varied by changing ea together with the unstretched line length 2 732 m to ensure that the mooring pre tension did not change anysim variation 3 led to a small change of the pitch period of about 0 02 the simulation tool accepts the stiffness and pre tension directly as input parameters while the unstretched length is automatically adjusted variation 4 draft variation 5 column diameter the systematic uncertainty related to variations in the platform draft 0 25 m and column diameter 0 1 m are investigated with variation 4 and variation 5 fast and sima to model the impact of changes in the platform draft and column diameter on the hydrodynamic loads without adjusting any additional model parameters e g mass or line tension the first order potential flow solution was updated by adjusting the platform geometry mesh that is used in wamit this leads to updated hydrodynamic databases for the radiation and diffraction loads the hydrostatic restoring matrix is also updated to account for the changes in buoyancy force center of buoyancy and waterplane moment of inertia the morison type drag forces on the columns were also updated to reflect the changes in geometry note that the 2nd order solution was not updated anysim for variations 4 and 5 the corresponding change of volume was used to scale the potential flow database based on the displacement for the draft variation the volume was estimated to vary by 0 7 for the column diameter variation the volume was estimated to vary by 1 2 froude scaling was applied to all quantities resulting from the potential flow calculation i e 1st order quantities and the quadratic transfer functions the linear hydrostatics were updated based on the new submerged geometry displacement center of buoyancy waterline area second moment while the position of the center of mass with respect to the keel was kept unchanged when used the diameter of the morison elements representing the heave plates was changed with the same value as the diameter of the columns variation 6 wave elevation all a potential 3 cm drift in the wave elevation measurement was estimated based on measurements before and after the wavemaker started this uncertainty was addressed by adjusting the input wave elevation by a multiplicative factor this multiplicative factor considered the 3 cm drift as the error in a representative wave amplitude for the irregular waves with 7 1 m wave height this factor was thus 1 0 00845 variation 8 mass fast and sima the mass of the floater was adjusted based on the assessed uncertainty to avoid changing the draft of the structure another parameter needed to be adjusted to achieve the same equilibrium position since the displaced volume of the structure was not directly measured it was determined to alter this value in conjunction with the mass the displaced volume was altered by 85 4 m3 in order to maintain the same equilibrium position the wave excitation loads were not modified due to the change in volume anysim in the same way as for fast and sima the displacement was modified in conjunction with the mass to avoid changing the draft moreover the radius of inertia was altered to keep the moment of inertia unchanged this was done for roll pitch and yaw 6 total uncertainty 6 1 combining all uncertainty sources once the total estimated systematic and random uncertainty values are calculated they are combined to determine the total combined uncertainty u c for a given output metric u c b r 2 s x 2 confidence intervals are then assigned to this uncertainty to define the expanded uncertainty u u k u c where k is the coverage factor when the expected distribution of the measured data is approximately normal and the effective degrees of freedom dof are large confidence intervals of 95 99 are typically used which results in a coverage factor of approximately 2 to be applied to the uncertainty bound kim and hermansky 2014 a representation of a response metric x is then given as x x u where x is the best available estimate of the measurement x is the mean of the response metric u is the expanded uncertainty and x u and x u define the uncertainty bounds that would include a large portion of the possible occurrences of the response metric however when there is asymmetry in the uncertainties the definition of the expanded uncertainty bounds must be adjusted this is accomplished by defining a displacement q between the center of each nonsymmetrical systematic uncertainty interval and the average q i x b i x b i 2 x this displacement value is used to reinsert the asymmetry so that the total uncertainty interval is nonsymmetrical x x i 1 n q i u when there is more than one nonsymmetrical uncertainty source the q values are summed algebraically to provide an overall asymmetry level across all nonsymmetrical sources in the present work when accounting for the uncertainty contributions from different simulation tools the largest positive and negative contributions out of all simulation approaches are kept for each parameter variation 6 2 total uncertainty values the calculated uncertainty values for each of the four metrics are shown in fig 7 fig 9 the mean metric values shown as a square are calculated from the response measurements averaged over all of the repeated tests the calculated uncertainty bands are shown using error bars and represent the expanded uncertainty u that includes both systematic and random uncertainty sources fig 7 shows significant uncertainty in the mean surge metric especially for the regular wave cases the mean surge value was typically small so small changes due to parameter variations can create significant levels of uncertainty in this metric the main source of the uncertainty in mean surge position was related to the center of mass in the x direction cmx for regular wave case 1 while the mooring pretension and stiffness also contributed for the other waves the uncertainty in mean surge in regular wave case 1 is probably overstated the large variation was only seen for one of the simulation tools and much of the difference is likely related to static effects which would have been zeroed out in the experimental measurements fig 8 shows the experimentally obtained raos for the irregular and white noise waves averaged over the repetitions and smoothed plotted on top of these curves are the six frequency points computed for each of the waves including the expanded uncertainty where multiple repetitions are available the mean of all of the repetitions is shown there is generally good agreement in the experimentally obtained raos between different wave conditions although some larger discrepancies can be observed in the pitch rao at a given frequency individual wave rao values fit within the error bars for other wave rao values the uncertainty level depends on the frequency the uncertainty in the low frequency responses is larger than the uncertainty at higher frequencies the trend toward higher uncertainty at low frequencies is observed in most of the uncertainty parameters suggesting that the main reason may be related to the increasing importance of 1 damping since the excitation frequency approaches the natural frequency especially in heave and pitch and 2 cancellation effects in the excitation which depend strongly on the geometry although the uncertainty level at a given frequency is similar for all considered waves it is not identically reproduced the main conclusions from fig 8 are that the uncertainty in the wave frequency responses is generally small for wave periods shorter than approximately 14 s and that the pitch responses are more uncertain than surge responses the focus of this test campaign is on the low frequency response of the wind turbine in the surge and pitch dofs fig 9 shows the psd sum metric for both the irregular and white noise wave in these two dofs in both the wave and low frequency regions the uncertainty levels vary between the two irregular waves irregular and white noise the difference is especially pronounced in the low frequency surge metric the amplitude of the total uncertainty in the wave frequency psd sum metric is less than 20 while the low frequency psd sum metric for surge is on the order of 30 50 and the low frequency psd sum metric for pitch is approximately 40 for the white noise wave case 6 3 contributions to uncertainty to understand what is driving these uncertainties the individual uncertainty sources b i and s x are shown in fig 10 this figure indicates that the high uncertainty levels in the surge direction come from uncertainty in the mooring stiffness for the low frequency response and from the wave elevation column diameter and mass buoyancy for the wave frequency response in the pitch direction uncertainty in the center of mass offset and also column diameter and draft create the largest levels of uncertainty in the response these results highlight the fact that the low frequency responses which are primarily resonant responses are especially sensitive to parameters that affect the stiffness and the inertia of the system changes in stiffness or changes in inertia may shift the natural frequency slightly and the level of excitation at the resulting natural frequency may differ compared to the original system fig 10 also confirms that the contribution of the random uncertainty to the total uncertainty is negligible compared to the systematic uncertainty fig 11 and fig 12 examine the variability in the level of propagated uncertainty for these uncertainty sources based on which modeling tool is used considering two of the low frequency response metrics with large uncertainty surge in the irregular wave in fig 11 and pitch in the white noise wave in fig 12 the contributions from each tool for each parameter variation both positive and negative are included the different simulation tools generally agree regarding which parameters give the largest contributions to uncertainty such as the mooring stiffness and pretension for the low frequency surge and mostly agree on the direction of the largest changes i e positive or negative change in the metric on the other hand there are significant variations in the magnitude of the changes in the metric depending on which simulation tool is applied it is important to note that the changes in metrics from different parameter variations are additive and that only the largest variations among different simulation tools are used in the calculation of total uncertainty as a result the total uncertainty in this study is more conservative than if one had only used a single simulation tool there is not a clear pattern suggesting that the pq or morison type approaches give larger uncertainty for particular parameter variations but a closer correlation can be noted based on simulations using the same modelling tools comparing for example surge results with anysim pq and anysim or results from fast and fast pq nonetheless it is impossible to determine whether or not the use of engineering models to predict low frequency responses will give a conservative or non conservative estimate of the total uncertainty 6 4 application to oc5 results in order to understand the magnitude of the experimental uncertainty with respect to numerical simulations the original oc5 study results robertson et al 2017 are re visited here the experimental tests which were studied in the oc5 project correspond to a different physical model in a different basin but under similar wave conditions lc3 3 from robertson et al 2017 as shown in fig 13 and fig 14 the psd sums were computed for both the experimental and numerical results in the oc5 study and the relative uncertainty from the present tests was applied to the original experimental results for the low frequency surge metric only one of the numerical results out of 21 participant results was within the error bounds on the experimental result even after several iterations and tuning none of the simulation tools predicted the low frequency pitch response within the experimental uncertainty it should be noted that the tuned pq approach used for the uncertainty propagation in this paper which shows promise in estimating these low frequency metrics is not represented in the oc5 study this modeling approach as well as others was developed as a direct consequence of the issues identified in oc5 7 conclusions the total experimental uncertainty in a set of hydrodynamics model tests with a rigid semisubmersible wind turbine has been estimated through propagation of the systematic uncertainties using several numerical simulation tools considering response metrics which give an indication of the wave frequency and low frequency responses of the system the wave frequency responses are found to have relatively small uncertainty while the uncertainty in the low frequency responses is somewhat higher 20 40 in the integral of power spectral density over a defined low frequency range the random uncertainty which was found through repeated measurements is negligible compared to the estimated systematic uncertainty the main contributions to the propagated systematic uncertainty in low frequency responses were primarily model characteristics that affected the stiffness mooring system stiffness for the surge response and platform draft and vertical center of gravity for the pitch response in addition uncertainty in the wave amplitude also had an impact the simulation tools applied in the study showed good agreement regarding which parameters were most important although the magnitude of the propagated uncertainty differed significantly among participants a major limitation in the present work is the use of simulation tools for uncertainty propagation the inconsistent estimation of the baseline value of the low frequency psd sums suggests that the modelling tools may not be sufficiently accurate to be used for uncertainty propagation at present however these tools represent the state of the art and the results of the present study suggest that the differences between experiments and simulations are larger than the uncertainty in the experimental results the results from this study give a measurement of uncertainty that can be used in future validation efforts the data from the present tests will be studied further using both engineering and high fidelity models through the oc6 extension of the offshore code comparison collaboration through the international energy agency additional tests where wave and radiation loads were measured directly on the fixed structure will also be incorporated in the oc6 project in order to better understand the reasons for discrepancies between simulations and experiments

22263,quantifying the uncertainty in experimental results is a critical step in properly validating numerical simulation tools for designing floating wind turbines without a good understanding of the experimental uncertainties it is impossible to determine if numerical simulation tools can capture the physics with acceptable accuracy recent validation studies suggest that the wave induced low frequency surge and pitch motions of semisubmersible type floating wind turbines are consistently underpredicted by numerical simulations but it has not been possible to state whether or not this underprediction is within the level of experimental error in the present work previously assessed systematic uncertainty components in hydrodynamic tests of the oc5 deepcwind semisubmersible are propagated to response metrics of interest using numerical simulation tools and combined with the system s random uncertainty to obtain the total experimental uncertainty the uncertainty in the low frequency response metrics is found to be most sensitive to the system properties e g mooring stiffness and center of gravity and also the wave elevation the results of the present study suggest that the underprediction of the low frequency response behavior observed in previous validation studies is larger than the experimental uncertainty keywords floating offshore wind uncertainty analysis oc5 validation nonlinear wave mechanics 1 introduction floating wind turbines fwts represent a growing area of both academic and industrial interest and a wide range of numerical tools have been developed to predict their responses in wind and waves recently participants in the international offshore code comparison collaboration continued with correlation oc5 project attempted to validate models of a floating semisubmersible tested in the offshore basin at marin in may 2013 by the deepcwind consortium goupee et al 2014 although state of the art tools captured some of the dynamics and loads of the complex floating wind turbine there were persistent differences between the simulated results and measurements the reasons for which could not be ascertained the discrepancies are exemplified by an under prediction of the ultimate and fatigue loads across multiple load cases which were shown to be dominated by the under prediction of the loads at the pitch and tower natural frequencies robertson et al 2017 similar discrepancies in the low frequency response of other model scale semisubmersible platforms for offshore wind have also been observed cermelli and roddier 2005 philippe et al 2013 berthelsen et al 2016 in order to assess whether or not the observed differences between numerical and experimental results are meaningful an assessment of the level of experimental uncertainty in the response behavior needs to be determined to that end additional testing of the semisubmersible structure from the oc5 study in a simplified configuration was carried out at marin through the marinet2 grant these simplified tests were aimed toward better understanding the hydrodynamic loading and assessing uncertainty in the test campaign the generic open access design oc5 deepcwind floating semisubmersible was tested at 1 50 scale with the same floating substructure as was examined in oc5 but with a rigid tower a mass representing the rotor nacelle assembly and with a simplified soft spring mooring system representing the linear stiffness of the original catenary configuration the wind turbine and flexible tower were replaced by rigid components to limit uncertainty sources and better focus on the hydrodynamic loading on the structure due to the limited testing time in the basin a single configuration was considered and a limited number of wave conditions were tested gueydon 2017 extensive repetition tests were included in the test matrix to assess the random uncertainty in the experiment response metrics low dimensional representations of the important features of the time series of results are used to represent the results and the associated uncertainty the experimental uncertainty originates from uncertainties in the excitation of the system and the properties of the test specimen and the accuracy and precision of the measurement equipment several standards provide guidance on uncertainty assessment such as the international standards organization iso 1993 american society of mechanical engineers asme 2013 and the international towing tank conference ittc 2008 here we apply the asme terminology categorizing the sources of uncertainty as either random or systematic systematic uncertainties may result in an unknown bias in the test while random uncertainties result in randomly varying uncertainties which can be measured through repetition tests the contributions to the experimental uncertainty in the new set of tests were identified and documented in previous work robertson et al 2018 among the main findings it was shown that the uncertainty in the wave elevation was small and was dominated by random uncertainty it should be noted however that the uncertainties in the wave loads not measured may be larger than the uncertainties in the wave elevation the physical properties of the model itself were found to have more significant systematic uncertainties and the measurement cable contributed significantly to the uncertainty in the mass and in the center of mass the measurement of motion responses was precise while the tension measurements had relatively high random uncertainty the present work seeks to identify the total uncertainty of the response metrics of interest this is accomplished by first propagating the systematic uncertainties to the response metrics through numerical simulations and then combining with the calculated random uncertainty three state of the art simulation tools applied by four different users and considering several modeling approaches were used to assess the consequences of changes in the input parameters corresponding to the systematic uncertainty levels on responses such as the low frequency surge and pitch motions and wave frequency surge and pitch motions in the remainder of the paper the model tests and response metrics of interest are briefly described sections 2 and 3 next the uncertainty sources identified by robertson et al 2018 are summarized and the most important of these are identified section 4 the methodology for propagating systematic uncertainties is explained and the total uncertainty is examined sections 5 and 6 2 test description the floating semisubmersible model consisted of the existing marin model 9697 whose geometry corresponds to the deepcwind semisubmersible floater goupee et al 2012 at 1 50 scale and a rigid aluminum tower designed to mimic the mass and inertia of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine tower and rotor nacelle assembly jonkman et al 2009 jonkman 2010 a brief overview of the model setup fig 1 is given here additional details may be found in robertson et al 2018 the test setup and all results are presented at full scale following froude scaling the difference in density between sea water 1025 kg m3 and fresh water in the basin 998 6 kg m3 is accounted for in the scaling of masses inertias forces moments and derived quantities a simplified mooring system was designed and constructed for the new tests three mooring lines consisting of a soft spring and rigid wire were attached to the model a pulley system was used such that the spring could be vertical and dry while the anchor positions were low enough that the surge pitch coupling from the mooring system was similar to the original catenary system 2 1 model properties the main characteristics of the floater geometry are shown in table 1 while the hydrodynamic properties and mass properties are given in table 2 and table 3 respectively the mooring system which included thin wires attached to springs is described in table 4 when modelling the system numerically we strived to use the properties of the system as measured where possible for a floating system the first step is to ensure that the system is in equilibrium for the prescribed values of the draft mass mooring tensions and displaced water volume for this test we directly measured the draft mass and tensions the displaced water volume can be calculated from the geometry but since it is not directly measured we considered this property as the most unknown we did not tune the other properties mentioned but set the displaced water volume such that the system was in equilibrium table 5 2 2 test matrix the tests in this campaign included a hammer test free decay tests and wave excitation tests only the wave excitation tests are of interest here and are summarized in table 6 as shown multiple repetitions were carried out for the model in waves which will be used to assess the random uncertainty in the response behavior the repetitions were performed with the same wave realization with the goal of having identical wave time series 3 response metrics the objective of the larger validation campaign related to these experiments is to better understand the ability of simulation tools to predict the response of the oc5 deepcwind semisubmersible to hydrodynamic loading especially the low frequency resonant responses in pitch and surge to assess the capabilities of the tools in this area response metrics were identified to represent these important physical quantities of interest the response metrics are scalar values that can be computed from the time series results from either simulations or experiments a simulation tool that can reproduce the response metrics within the obtained uncertainty bounds can then be considered validated the response metrics in the present work focus on the surge heave and pitch responses of the semisubmersible in particular the mean response in surge and the wave frequency and low frequency responses in all three degrees of freedom the response metrics are chosen with the objective of representing these different response components rather than selecting metrics that are useful for design such as the 90th percentile maximum 3 h motions but do not distinguish among different frequency ranges the response metrics in the present work are m1 rao the response amplitude operator rao in surge heave and pitch at 6 discrete frequency points within the wave energy range m2 psd sum low frequencies the integral of the power spectral density psd of surge and pitch motions over the low frequency range m3 psd sum wave frequencies the integral of the psd of surge and pitch motions over the wave frequency range and m4 mean surge offset for all of the metrics only a limited time window of the analysis is considered table 7 in an attempt to focus on data after start up transient behavior and also address the effect of reflected waves the irregular wave window consists of the last 3 h after reflections are established while the regular wave window includes 10 min of data once the ramp in the waves has passed but before any reflections arrive from the beach or wavemaker furthermore all of the time series are resampled with a time step of 0 1 s prior to computing any metrics response metrics m2 and m3 are only computed for the irregular wave cases metric m1 the rao is defined as the amplitude of the response divided by the amplitude of the incoming wave at a given frequency six discrete frequencies are considered for the rao calculations as shown in table 8 the algorithm applied for computing the rao denoted h ω is based on the cross spectral density h y u u u where u and y are the fourier transforms of the wave elevation and the motion response respectively and the asterisk indicates the complex conjugate the integrals of the psds of the response referred to as psd sums metrics m2 and m3 are chosen to capture frequency dependent responses both inside and outside the wave frequency range in irregular sea states compared to other possible metrics such as rms values this approach keeps some frequency information when calculating the psd sums all time series measured and simulated are first cut and sampled such that they have identical discretization in time time step and duration the same psd calculation algorithm without smoothing is then applied to all time series the psd sums are computed based on the one sided unsmoothed discrete power density functions s s u m i j k s r e s p f i δ f where s r e s p is the discrete power spectral density of the response at frequency f i δ f is the corresponding frequency increment j is the index of the first frequency of interest and k is the index of the last frequency of interest the frequency limits for the low m2 and wave frequency m3 components of the spectrum are given in table 9 these are based on identifying the ranges over which the wave spectra were defined and then encompassing the lower frequencies below that range without considering the zero frequency mean value 4 uncertainty sources 4 1 random uncertainty robertson et al 2018 identified a number of sources for random uncertainty in the response metrics however since repeated measurements of the quantities of interest were available the random uncertainty could be calculated directly from the measurements without the need to assess the source of the uncertainties the random standard uncertainty s x is calculated as the standard deviation s x of the metric x across the repeated tests divided by the square root of the number of observations n s x s x n 4 2 systematic uncertainty systematic uncertainty is a representation of the possible bias in a test campaign and cannot be calculated directly from measurements instead the sources of systematic uncertainty throughout the test must be identified their individual effect on the metrics calculated and then those effects combined the sources of systematic uncertainty in this test campaign include the wave excitation system properties and configuration and output measurements expert analysis of the systematic uncertainties in the test campaign identified 24 separate parameters with significant levels of systematic uncertainty these parameters are listed in table 10 robertson et al 2018 provide a thorough discussion on the assessment of the uncertainty levels for these parameters from this original set of systematic uncertainty sources the parameters were down selected based on their influence on the response metrics they were thresholded by examining the total combined estimated systematic uncertainty of the response metrics parameters whose effect on the change across all metrics was less than 10 were removed in the end the original set of 24 parameters was down selected to 8 which are summarized in table 11 note that only parameters related to the system properties and configuration remain in the list and no measurement or wave excitation uncertainties are included in this new list when the platform mass was changed the displaced volume was adjusted to ensure the heave equilibrium position was not altered the goal was to have each of these parameters be independent of one another if just the mass were altered the draft would have changed which is a separate parameter for many of these parameters varying them will change the response of the system without directly changing the wave excitation variation 1 increases the cross coupling of inertia contributions e g surge pitch heave pitch variations 2 and 7 change the inertia moment in pitch and consequently the pitch natural period variation 3 results in a change of the surge natural period on the other hand variations 4 and 5 directly affect the wave excitation by changing the volume exposed to the waves while also changing the pitch natural period for variation 4 the pitch period is modified through the shift of the buoyancy point and the variation of displacement variation 5 results in a change in the metacentric height and hence in the pitch period variation 8 affects the surge and heave natural periods while variation 6 only affects the wave excitation 5 uncertainty propagation uncertainty propagation is determining the sensitivity of the output response to the input and model uncertainties if a closed form solution is known for this relationship then the uncertainty can be propagated analytically however for complex problems such as the dynamics of a floating offshore wind system a closed form solution may not be available in these situations numerical methods can be used instead a common approach is to use a monte carlo approach to sample the input uncertainty distribution and calculate the effective output distribution the calculation itself can be accomplished through simulation of a numerical model of the system reduced order models are often used because of their computational efficiency e g polynomial chaos expansion murcia et al 2016 and machine learning techniques clifton et al 2014 an even simpler method is sequential perturbation manteufel 2012 figliola and beasley 2011 which requires just two simulations at the bounds of the input or model uncertainty to assess the uncertainty bounds on the response metric of interest sequential perturbation is used here to limit the computation time and maintain the use of sufficiently accurate models the process of using a model to propagate uncertainty can be problematic because it relies on the use of the modeling tools that are to be validated to perform the uncertainty propagation if the tools do not represent the phenomena of interest accurately they may not provide an accurate assessment of the sensitivity of parameter variations on that phenomena to address this issue multiple numerical modeling tools and multiple modeling approaches were used to propagate the uncertainties in this work the largest positive and negative contributions out of all simulation approaches are then used as the sensitivity coefficient for each parameter of interest within the limits of the numerical models this approach is expected to give a conservative estimate of the uncertainty for validation purposes 5 1 approach the systematic uncertainty of an output response metric b r is calculated by combining each of the elemental systematic output standard uncertainties b i b r 2 i 1 n b i 2 for the systematic uncertainties related to the input waves or model properties these uncertainty values d i must be first propagated to their effect on the response metric uncertainty b i θ i d i where θ i x p i are the sensitivity coefficients of individual parameters p i on the metric of interest x and d i are the elemental input model systematic uncertainties as summarized in table 11 once propagated each of the output metric uncertainty sources may be summed the sensitivity coefficients represent the influence that the input model uncertainties have on the output metrics and are typically calculated analytically but if that is not possible numerical models of the system can be used to estimate them in this work the systematic uncertainty of the response metrics due to a given uncertainty source is estimated by sequential perturbation by first simulating the model using the baseline properties and calculating the associated response metrics then the system is simulated using a new value for one of the six uncertain parameters based on the uncertainty level described in table 11 changes are made in both the positive and negative directions and the response metrics are again calculated the difference between the response metrics calculated using the baseline properties and when changing one of the uncertain parameters is the systematic uncertainty for that parameter systematic uncertainties will be calculated based on both a positive and negative change in the parameter and the resulting level of propagated uncertainty may not be the same see section 5 2 this process is repeated for all six parameters and then those individual uncertainty sources combined in quadrature this method assumes that each of the systematic uncertainty sources in table 11 are independent of each other 5 2 asymmetric uncertainty the propagation results in non symmetric uncertainty bounds for the metrics meaning that the uncertainty on the positive end is sometimes different from the uncertainty on the negative end of the metric value this situation creates a complication in combining the different systematic uncertainty sources as the straightforward method of adding them in quadrature no longer works different approaches can be used to address this the simplest approach is to add the negative uncertainty bounds in quadrature and the positive uncertainty bounds in quadrature separately but this approach has been shown to be inaccurate another approach is proposed by dieck 2007 and uses the calculation of a central value for the nonsymmetric uncertainty bounds which is then used to adjust the final uncertainty summed across multiple sources this approach was used here the systematic uncertainty response metric b i for an individual parameter i is calculated as b i x b i x b i 2 where x is the mean measured value for a given metric the total estimated systematic standard uncertainty b r is then calculated the asymmetry of the systematic uncertainty is further addressed in the calculation of the total uncertainty section 6 1 5 3 modeling tools and methods three different simulation tools were used to propagate the systematic uncertainty in the model properties to the response metrics and several different users contributed results a variety of tools and users were employed since the approach used to model the behavior of the floating wind system could affect the propagation of uncertainty ideally the modeling tools that are to be validated would not be the same ones used to perform the uncertainty propagation but this is the only option for a complex system such as a floating wind turbine the largest propagated uncertainty found across the different tools and users was used to help assuage this limitation all of the simulation approaches represent the floating wind system as a rigid body with linear elastic mooring lines for the hydrodynamic loading second order diffraction is considered in addition to first order potential flow contributions added mass radiation damping and excitation the smaller braces and pontoons were ignored in the potential flow solution different meshes and potential flow solvers were used wamit from wamit 2011 and diffrac from buchner et al 2001 and so the first and second order potential flow solutions differ among the simulation approaches overall when the same modeling approach is used but different modeling tools there is reasonable agreement of the wave and low frequency motions gueydon et al 2014 however differences in the modeling of the first order and second order wave excitations and damping lead to differences in the motion responses especially around the resonance frequencies in surge heave and roll pitch robertson et al 2017 for this study five modeling approaches were followed with three distinct simulation tools to propagate deviations in the set of parameters of table 11 the main differences between these modeling approaches are summarized in table 12 two fundamentally different approaches were used to account for linear and quadratic damping effects a subset of the numerical models used morison type drag to compute quadratic damping loads on the substructure members fast sima anysim while another subset of models used a tuned linear p and quadratic damping q matrix fast pq anysim pq also referred to as the pq approach in this paper the tuning was conducted based on decay tests in surge heave and pitch the pq approach was included here because it has demonstrated improved model predictions for the low frequency pitch motion response of the system in past projects gueydon 2016 the corresponding damping matrices are shown in table 13 furthermore the models using morison elements don t apply the coefficients identically the location of these elements and values of the coefficients are different while all five models accounted for second order difference frequency diffraction the quadratic transfer functions qtf are different the quadratic terms of the qtf used in the anysim and anysim pq simulations were updated based on the motion rao of the floater of the present study while all other simulations were performed with qtfs based on the oc5 deepcwind system robertson et al 2017 even though none of these models are perfect it is assumed that the choice of several tools and modeling approaches should enable an assessment of realistic trends for the propagation of the uncertainty linked to the 8 most influential parameters of table 11 fig 2 5 show a comparison of the psds of the surge and pitch responses for the experimental measurements and the baseline simulations the integration limits for the low frequency and wave frequency psd sums are illustrated using the colored pink and blue regions in the plots as shown the responses around the natural frequencies in surge 0 01 hz and pitch 0 03 hz are significant compared to the wave frequency responses and the experimental measurements show high levels of repeatability in the experiments fig 6 compares the psd sum metrics calculated from these values between experiment and baseline simulations the wave frequency surge and pitch responses are captured fairly well by all of the approaches though the pq approaches tend to underpredict the pitch response in this frequency range due to the resonance small deviations of the wave loads and or the damping can result in differences among simulations every modeler was free to choose their own approach to account for the damping and the wave excitation as a consequence the predictions of the responses around the resonance frequencies in surge and pitch are far less consistent between the different simulation tools than those in the wave frequency region as evident from the response metrics in fig 6 this discrepancy represents an important limitation in the propagation of systematic uncertainty through the use of simulation models can a simulation tool accurately propagate uncertainty in a metric that it does not accurately represent as shown in fig 6 there is varying levels of agreement for the low frequency psd sums between simulation and experiment with the simulations sometimes over predicting the metric value e g fast and fast pq for the white noise cases but mostly under prediction since there is a reasonable level of agreement for some tools it is assumed that the physics included in the numerical simulation tools should be able to capture the relative change in platform responses due to small modifications in the input the consistency of the propagated uncertainty between different modeling approaches will be examined later to assess the validity of this statement 5 4 implementation of parameter variations in numerical models the parameter variations considered for the assessment of the systematic uncertainty were implemented with different approaches in the different numerical models differences arose because every numerical model has inherently different ways of specifying key modelling parameters the goal was to isolate modifications to the model properties to only one parameter at a time but based on the modeling approach employed this was not always possible the different realizations of the model parameter variations for each modelling tool are outlined below variation 1 cm x direction variation 2 cm z direction variation 7 inertia iyy the systematic uncertainty related to variations in the offset of the system center off mass in the x and z directions is investigated with variation 1 and variation 2 respectively the x offset value was specified as 0 22 m and the z offset was specified as 0 21 m respectively fast and sima for the cm change only the cm is moved there is no change in the moment of inertia similarly for variation 7 only the inertia is changed anysim in marin s simulation tool the inertia moments are defined at the center of mass as a consequence shifting the cm resulted in a change of moments of inertia for instance variation 1 resulted in a change in the pitch period of about 2 for variation 7 the inertia is changed independently of the mass by defining a new radius of inertia for the pitch rotation the pitch period varied of 0 3 as a result of this inertia variation variation 3 mooring stiffness for variation 3 the systematic uncertainty related to variations in the mooring stiffness is investigated fast and sima for variation 3 the mooring line stiffness was varied by changing ea together with the unstretched line length 2 732 m to ensure that the mooring pre tension did not change anysim variation 3 led to a small change of the pitch period of about 0 02 the simulation tool accepts the stiffness and pre tension directly as input parameters while the unstretched length is automatically adjusted variation 4 draft variation 5 column diameter the systematic uncertainty related to variations in the platform draft 0 25 m and column diameter 0 1 m are investigated with variation 4 and variation 5 fast and sima to model the impact of changes in the platform draft and column diameter on the hydrodynamic loads without adjusting any additional model parameters e g mass or line tension the first order potential flow solution was updated by adjusting the platform geometry mesh that is used in wamit this leads to updated hydrodynamic databases for the radiation and diffraction loads the hydrostatic restoring matrix is also updated to account for the changes in buoyancy force center of buoyancy and waterplane moment of inertia the morison type drag forces on the columns were also updated to reflect the changes in geometry note that the 2nd order solution was not updated anysim for variations 4 and 5 the corresponding change of volume was used to scale the potential flow database based on the displacement for the draft variation the volume was estimated to vary by 0 7 for the column diameter variation the volume was estimated to vary by 1 2 froude scaling was applied to all quantities resulting from the potential flow calculation i e 1st order quantities and the quadratic transfer functions the linear hydrostatics were updated based on the new submerged geometry displacement center of buoyancy waterline area second moment while the position of the center of mass with respect to the keel was kept unchanged when used the diameter of the morison elements representing the heave plates was changed with the same value as the diameter of the columns variation 6 wave elevation all a potential 3 cm drift in the wave elevation measurement was estimated based on measurements before and after the wavemaker started this uncertainty was addressed by adjusting the input wave elevation by a multiplicative factor this multiplicative factor considered the 3 cm drift as the error in a representative wave amplitude for the irregular waves with 7 1 m wave height this factor was thus 1 0 00845 variation 8 mass fast and sima the mass of the floater was adjusted based on the assessed uncertainty to avoid changing the draft of the structure another parameter needed to be adjusted to achieve the same equilibrium position since the displaced volume of the structure was not directly measured it was determined to alter this value in conjunction with the mass the displaced volume was altered by 85 4 m3 in order to maintain the same equilibrium position the wave excitation loads were not modified due to the change in volume anysim in the same way as for fast and sima the displacement was modified in conjunction with the mass to avoid changing the draft moreover the radius of inertia was altered to keep the moment of inertia unchanged this was done for roll pitch and yaw 6 total uncertainty 6 1 combining all uncertainty sources once the total estimated systematic and random uncertainty values are calculated they are combined to determine the total combined uncertainty u c for a given output metric u c b r 2 s x 2 confidence intervals are then assigned to this uncertainty to define the expanded uncertainty u u k u c where k is the coverage factor when the expected distribution of the measured data is approximately normal and the effective degrees of freedom dof are large confidence intervals of 95 99 are typically used which results in a coverage factor of approximately 2 to be applied to the uncertainty bound kim and hermansky 2014 a representation of a response metric x is then given as x x u where x is the best available estimate of the measurement x is the mean of the response metric u is the expanded uncertainty and x u and x u define the uncertainty bounds that would include a large portion of the possible occurrences of the response metric however when there is asymmetry in the uncertainties the definition of the expanded uncertainty bounds must be adjusted this is accomplished by defining a displacement q between the center of each nonsymmetrical systematic uncertainty interval and the average q i x b i x b i 2 x this displacement value is used to reinsert the asymmetry so that the total uncertainty interval is nonsymmetrical x x i 1 n q i u when there is more than one nonsymmetrical uncertainty source the q values are summed algebraically to provide an overall asymmetry level across all nonsymmetrical sources in the present work when accounting for the uncertainty contributions from different simulation tools the largest positive and negative contributions out of all simulation approaches are kept for each parameter variation 6 2 total uncertainty values the calculated uncertainty values for each of the four metrics are shown in fig 7 fig 9 the mean metric values shown as a square are calculated from the response measurements averaged over all of the repeated tests the calculated uncertainty bands are shown using error bars and represent the expanded uncertainty u that includes both systematic and random uncertainty sources fig 7 shows significant uncertainty in the mean surge metric especially for the regular wave cases the mean surge value was typically small so small changes due to parameter variations can create significant levels of uncertainty in this metric the main source of the uncertainty in mean surge position was related to the center of mass in the x direction cmx for regular wave case 1 while the mooring pretension and stiffness also contributed for the other waves the uncertainty in mean surge in regular wave case 1 is probably overstated the large variation was only seen for one of the simulation tools and much of the difference is likely related to static effects which would have been zeroed out in the experimental measurements fig 8 shows the experimentally obtained raos for the irregular and white noise waves averaged over the repetitions and smoothed plotted on top of these curves are the six frequency points computed for each of the waves including the expanded uncertainty where multiple repetitions are available the mean of all of the repetitions is shown there is generally good agreement in the experimentally obtained raos between different wave conditions although some larger discrepancies can be observed in the pitch rao at a given frequency individual wave rao values fit within the error bars for other wave rao values the uncertainty level depends on the frequency the uncertainty in the low frequency responses is larger than the uncertainty at higher frequencies the trend toward higher uncertainty at low frequencies is observed in most of the uncertainty parameters suggesting that the main reason may be related to the increasing importance of 1 damping since the excitation frequency approaches the natural frequency especially in heave and pitch and 2 cancellation effects in the excitation which depend strongly on the geometry although the uncertainty level at a given frequency is similar for all considered waves it is not identically reproduced the main conclusions from fig 8 are that the uncertainty in the wave frequency responses is generally small for wave periods shorter than approximately 14 s and that the pitch responses are more uncertain than surge responses the focus of this test campaign is on the low frequency response of the wind turbine in the surge and pitch dofs fig 9 shows the psd sum metric for both the irregular and white noise wave in these two dofs in both the wave and low frequency regions the uncertainty levels vary between the two irregular waves irregular and white noise the difference is especially pronounced in the low frequency surge metric the amplitude of the total uncertainty in the wave frequency psd sum metric is less than 20 while the low frequency psd sum metric for surge is on the order of 30 50 and the low frequency psd sum metric for pitch is approximately 40 for the white noise wave case 6 3 contributions to uncertainty to understand what is driving these uncertainties the individual uncertainty sources b i and s x are shown in fig 10 this figure indicates that the high uncertainty levels in the surge direction come from uncertainty in the mooring stiffness for the low frequency response and from the wave elevation column diameter and mass buoyancy for the wave frequency response in the pitch direction uncertainty in the center of mass offset and also column diameter and draft create the largest levels of uncertainty in the response these results highlight the fact that the low frequency responses which are primarily resonant responses are especially sensitive to parameters that affect the stiffness and the inertia of the system changes in stiffness or changes in inertia may shift the natural frequency slightly and the level of excitation at the resulting natural frequency may differ compared to the original system fig 10 also confirms that the contribution of the random uncertainty to the total uncertainty is negligible compared to the systematic uncertainty fig 11 and fig 12 examine the variability in the level of propagated uncertainty for these uncertainty sources based on which modeling tool is used considering two of the low frequency response metrics with large uncertainty surge in the irregular wave in fig 11 and pitch in the white noise wave in fig 12 the contributions from each tool for each parameter variation both positive and negative are included the different simulation tools generally agree regarding which parameters give the largest contributions to uncertainty such as the mooring stiffness and pretension for the low frequency surge and mostly agree on the direction of the largest changes i e positive or negative change in the metric on the other hand there are significant variations in the magnitude of the changes in the metric depending on which simulation tool is applied it is important to note that the changes in metrics from different parameter variations are additive and that only the largest variations among different simulation tools are used in the calculation of total uncertainty as a result the total uncertainty in this study is more conservative than if one had only used a single simulation tool there is not a clear pattern suggesting that the pq or morison type approaches give larger uncertainty for particular parameter variations but a closer correlation can be noted based on simulations using the same modelling tools comparing for example surge results with anysim pq and anysim or results from fast and fast pq nonetheless it is impossible to determine whether or not the use of engineering models to predict low frequency responses will give a conservative or non conservative estimate of the total uncertainty 6 4 application to oc5 results in order to understand the magnitude of the experimental uncertainty with respect to numerical simulations the original oc5 study results robertson et al 2017 are re visited here the experimental tests which were studied in the oc5 project correspond to a different physical model in a different basin but under similar wave conditions lc3 3 from robertson et al 2017 as shown in fig 13 and fig 14 the psd sums were computed for both the experimental and numerical results in the oc5 study and the relative uncertainty from the present tests was applied to the original experimental results for the low frequency surge metric only one of the numerical results out of 21 participant results was within the error bounds on the experimental result even after several iterations and tuning none of the simulation tools predicted the low frequency pitch response within the experimental uncertainty it should be noted that the tuned pq approach used for the uncertainty propagation in this paper which shows promise in estimating these low frequency metrics is not represented in the oc5 study this modeling approach as well as others was developed as a direct consequence of the issues identified in oc5 7 conclusions the total experimental uncertainty in a set of hydrodynamics model tests with a rigid semisubmersible wind turbine has been estimated through propagation of the systematic uncertainties using several numerical simulation tools considering response metrics which give an indication of the wave frequency and low frequency responses of the system the wave frequency responses are found to have relatively small uncertainty while the uncertainty in the low frequency responses is somewhat higher 20 40 in the integral of power spectral density over a defined low frequency range the random uncertainty which was found through repeated measurements is negligible compared to the estimated systematic uncertainty the main contributions to the propagated systematic uncertainty in low frequency responses were primarily model characteristics that affected the stiffness mooring system stiffness for the surge response and platform draft and vertical center of gravity for the pitch response in addition uncertainty in the wave amplitude also had an impact the simulation tools applied in the study showed good agreement regarding which parameters were most important although the magnitude of the propagated uncertainty differed significantly among participants a major limitation in the present work is the use of simulation tools for uncertainty propagation the inconsistent estimation of the baseline value of the low frequency psd sums suggests that the modelling tools may not be sufficiently accurate to be used for uncertainty propagation at present however these tools represent the state of the art and the results of the present study suggest that the differences between experiments and simulations are larger than the uncertainty in the experimental results the results from this study give a measurement of uncertainty that can be used in future validation efforts the data from the present tests will be studied further using both engineering and high fidelity models through the oc6 extension of the offshore code comparison collaboration through the international energy agency additional tests where wave and radiation loads were measured directly on the fixed structure will also be incorporated in the oc6 project in order to better understand the reasons for discrepancies between simulations and experiments

22264,a double wavy dw disturbance is newly proposed to obtain the reduction of drag and the fluctuating lift as the passive control for the bluff body flow the present study expanded the asymmetry of yoon et al 2017 and combined two optimum wavelengths in the short and long wavelength ranges of lam and lin 2008 and lin et al 2016 to realize the dw geometric disturbance eventually the flow past the dw cylinder was computed at the subcritical reynolds number of 3000 using a large eddy simulation the dw cylinder achieved the significant reduction of drag and fluctuating lift compared to those of the smooth cylinder it is noted that the dw cylinder achieved more reduction of drag and lift fluctuation than the wavy cylinder with the optimum wavelength the dw cylinder formed the common characteristics of flow which associates with the reduction of drag and the fluctuating lift the dw cylinder showed the double wavy profile of vortex formation length which is due to the double wavy distribution of flow interestingly the dw geometry gives a shorter wavy effect on the formation length namely the saddle plane forms a longer formation length than the nodal plane keywords double wavy

is one of the most commonly encountered structures in the real life industries and academics in the fluid mechanics the bluff body is characterized by vortex shedding beyond the critical reynolds number the various methods to control vortex shedding which derives a large portion of the drag noise vibration to bodies have been suggested among the flow control methods the shape modification is adopted as geometric disturbances zdravkovich 1981 naudascher and rockwell 2005 ekmekci and rockwell 2010 in nature the unique geometries have been found to be applied as the bluff body flow control classified as the biomimetics the daffodil stem contributes to design the helically twisted elliptic hte cylinder eventually the hte geometry is confirmed by the effective passive control method kim et al 2012 2016 wei et al 2016 jung and yoon 2014 recently the unique shape of a harbor seal vibrissa was introduced as a tool for viv vortex induced vibration hanke et al 2010 and hydrodynamic forces hans et al 2013 but the detail researches in the view of fluid dynamics are very seldom wang and liu 2016 kim and yoon 2017 2018 in this regard yoon et al 2017 considered the asymmetry to find the effect of the asymmetry on the fluid flow the harbor seal vibrissa come up this asymmetry they considered the symmetric wavy cylinder to apply the asymmetry the symmetric wavy cylinder is confirmed as a good passive control by many researches jung and yoon 2014 ahmed et al 1993 lam and lin 2009 lin et al 2016 ahmed and bays muchmore 1992 lam et al 2004a 2004b lee and nguyen 2007 zhang and lee 2005 xu et al 2010 for the first time yoon et al 2017 considered an asymmetric wavy disturbance as the passive control they considered that the optimum wavelength of λ d m 6 06 for the wavy cylinder gives a decrease in fluid forces lin et al 2016 where d m is the mean value of the maximum and minimum diameters lam and lin 2007 2008 2009 reported the optimal wavelengths for the maximum reduction of forces in the laminar and subcritical regimes the present study intends to expand the asymmetry of yoon et al 2017 and combine two optimum wavelengths of λ d m 2 0 and λ d m 6 06 of lam and lin 2009 and lin et al 2016 for the geometric disturbance we simply call this modified geometric disturbance as a double wavy dw disturbance which will be precisely described in a chapter of the identification of geometries to our knowledge the present study is an original research which applies the double wavy geometry as the passive control to the bluff body flow the main purpose of the present study is to evaluate the feasibility of the double wavy geometry as the passive control by the geometric disturbance to the circular cylinder therefore we estimate the time variation of the drag and lift due to vortex shedding and their mean values additionally in order to estimate the efficiency of the double wavy geometry force coefficient of the double wavy dw geometry are compared with those of the smooth and symmetric wavy cy and wc geometries therefore flows around three different geometries cy wc and dw are computationally simulated the present study considers the subcritical reynolds number of 3000 where wake flow is fully turbulent resulting in using the large eddy simulation les the present wavelength and amplitude of wc are the same as lin et al 2016 where identified the long optimal wavelength as λ d m 6 06 which minimizes the force coefficients as mentioned above in order to test the feasibility of dw geometry as the passive control we consider the optimal wavelength of wc in future the wavelength amplitude and reynolds number should be considered to generalize the performance of dw as the passive control 2 numerical details 2 1 governing equations and numerical methods for the large eddy simulation the grid filters are used for navier stokes and continuity equations under the assumptions of the unsteady three dimensional incompressible flow the governing equations are as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u i u j x j p x i 1 re 2 u i x j x j τ i j x j where the overbar denotes the resolved scale in equations t x i u i and p are the time cartesian coordinates the corresponding velocity components and the pressure respectively the τ i j is the subgrid scale stress tensor the details of the present les model can be referred in authors previous works jung and yoon 2014 germano et al 1991 lilly 1992 the spatial discretization is done by a second order central difference scheme based on finite volume method the crank nicolson scheme and a second order adams bashforth scheme are adopted for the diffusion and convection terms respectively for the temporal discretization these numerical methods have been successfully used in yoon et al 2009 and yoon et al 2017 2 2 definition of the geometries fig 1 shows three different shapes of the cy wc and dw cylinders the local diameter d z of the wc cylinder is defined as follows 3 d z d m 2 a cos 2 π z λ 1 where λ 1 and a are the wavelength and amplitude respectively the d m is the mean diameter of the maximum and minimum local diameters d max and d min which is the same as the diameter of the cy cylinder the abbreviations n node m middle and s saddle marked in fig 2 a correspond to the positions at these local diameters d max d m and d min respectively the λ 1 is an optimum wavelength of λ d m 6 06 for the wc cylinder lin et al 2016 thus the present study choose the optimum wavelength of λ d m 6 06 and wave amplitude of a d m 0 152 these the optimum conditions provided the maximum reduction of force coefficients for the wc cylinder lin et al 2016 eventually using these optimum conditions we can evaluate whether the dw geometry can provide the additional reduction recently yoon et al 2017 considered the asymmetric wavy geometric disturbance for flow control they also used this optimum wavelength of λ 1 the double wavy geometry in fig 2 b is formed by two different wavelengths as follows 4 d z d m a cos 2 π z λ 1 cos 2 π z λ 2 where λ 2 is λ 1 3 of the wavelength of the wc cylinder thus λ 2 is λ d m 2 02 which is about the optimum wavelength in the small wavelength region lam and lin 2008 the double wavy geometry is shown in fig 2 b for the dw cylinder there are two node and saddle positions in the half wavelengths thus the positions at the maximum and minimum local diameters of the dw cylinder are named n1 node1 and s2 saddle2 respectively another node and saddle positions of the middle part of the half cylinder are named n2 node2 and s1 saddle1 respectively as shown in fig 2 b each node and saddle has double wavy formation therefore the double wavy geometry reflects the asymmetry of yoon et al 2017 and the combination of two optimum wavelengths of λ d m 2 02 and λ d m 6 06 of lam and lin 2009 and lin et al 2016 for the geometric disturbance 2 3 boundary conditions grid and validation the computational domain and boundary conditions adopted in the present study is presented in fig 3 the size of domain is 24 d m 16 d m and 6 06 d m λ along the streamwise transverse and spanwise direction respectively the cylinder is set to the location with a distance of 8 d m and 16 d m from the inflow and outflow boundaries respectively the fluid flow uniformly in the inflow boundary and the symmetry and periodic boundary conditions were imposed in the transverse and spanwise directions a convective boundary condition u i t c u i x 0 where c is the space averaged streamwise outlet velocity was imposed for velocity and neumann condition was used for pressure on the outflow region no slip and no penetration conditions were applied at the cylinder surface in this present study the typical grid distribution of the oh type is considered including an o type grid distribution around the cylinder for the purpose of refining the mesh in normal and circumferential directions in the spanwise direction the grid distributed uniformly in order to verify the present numerical method and grid system the comparisons with the previous researches for the time averaged drag coefficient c d root mean square rms of lift fluctuation c l r m s and strouhal number s t and also grid dependency test have been carried out the definitions of c d c l r m s and s t can be found in jung and yoon 2014 yoon et al 2009 2017 first the present results of three different grid systems coarse medium and fine are compared with those of experiments norberg 1987 2003 and computation lam and lin 2008 for the cy cylinder and les results jung and yoon 2014 yoon et al 2017 lin et al 2016 for the wc cylinder as arranged in table 1 these grid systems consist of 2 5 3 5 and 4 5 million grids respectively the results of the present computations agree well with those of the previous experimental and numerical researches also the results for three different grid systems have the nearly same values in addition by using the medium grid system the comparison of the present profiles of mean u u and the r m s u u of the streamwise velocity along the crosswise direction at different downstream locations with the results of experiments lam et al 2004b norberg 1987 and computation yoon et al 2017 is shown in fig 4 regardless of the streamwise location both of u u and the r m s u u give a good agreement with those of the previous studies as shown in fig 4 additionally for the dw cylinder which has no previous data the computations of three grid systems have been carried out to evaluate the dependence of the solutions on the grid as listed in table 2 similarly the discrepancies of the results among those grid systems are negligible therefore the medium grid system was employed to discuss the following results dealt with in next chapter 3 results and discussion 3 1 force coefficients and strouhal number the drag and lift coefficients c d and c l are usually considered as the objectives of the flow control to mainly reduce these force coefficients therefore first time histories of c d and c l for the cy wc and dw cylinders are illustrated in fig 5 the wc cylinder gives smaller c d and c l compared to the cy cylinder which well regenerates the results of lin et al 2016 the optimum wavelength of λ d m 6 06 lin et al 2016 is consistent with darekar and sherwin 2000 who achieved a large reduction in c d for a front and rear face wavy square cylinder the dw cylinder provides a significant reduction of c d and c l in comparison with the smooth cylinder in fig 5 a b especially the dw cylinder gives more reduction of c d and c l than the optimal wc cylinder lin et al 2016 table 3 shows mean force coefficients of c d and c l r m s the wc cylinder provides about 13 05 and 88 26 reduction of c d and c l r m s respectively in comparison with the cy cylinder the dw cylinder gives approximately 16 74 and 97 27 respectively in comparison with the cy cylinder therefore the dw cylinder provides more reduction than the optimal wc cylinder the strouhal numbers s t for different cylinders are achieved by performing the fourier transform of the time history of the lift coefficient to evaluate the effect of the dw shape on the vortex shedding frequency fig 6 presents the power spectral densities of the time histories of the lift coefficients for different cylinders the values of the smooth cylinder and the symmetric wavy cylinder are 0 21 and 0 18 as early in table 1 the dw cylinder provides almost the same as the wc cylinder as shown in fig 6 as a result the of the wc and dw cylinders is smaller than that of a smooth cylinder at this re for the wc cylinder lin et al ahmed and bays muchmore 1992 reported that the greatest deviation of between the wc and cy cylinder takes place at the optimum values of wavelength 2 0 and 6 0 thus the present result is consistent with the finding of lin et al ahmed and bays muchmore 1992 the geometric disturbances of helically twisted elliptic shape the symmetric waviness and the asymmetric waviness jung and yoon 2014 yoon et al 2017 lin et al 2016 provide smaller than the smooth cylinder which is associated with the suppression of vortex shedding in the near wake the dw shape is also related to the lower frequency by the suppressed vortex shedding in the near wake which will be identified by the instantaneous flow structures later 3 2 common characteristics of flow structures for force reduction the drag reduction and the suppression of the lift fluctuation by the wavy helical and spiral type of the geometric disturbance for the bluff body are associated with generally the common flow characteristics such as the shear layer elongation a longer vortex formation length elongation the spanwise wavy fashion of the flow the regimes of the zero the new transverse and streamwise vorticities 3 2 1 delay of the vortex roll up the retard of the vortex roll up and almost the disappearance of the vortex shedding in near wake are derived by the passive flow control using the surface modifications of the wc cylinder jung and yoon 2014 lin et al 2016 lam et al 2004b zhang and lee 2005 xu et al 2010 lam and lin 2008 the helically twisted elliptic hte cylinder kim et al 2016 wei et al 2016 jung and yoon 2014 stranded cable models nebres et al 1993 and asymmetric wavy asw cylinder yoon et al 2017 this delay of the vortex roll up contributes to the drag reduction and the suppression of the lift fluctuation because the dw cylinder as a passive control based on the surface modification gives rise to the reduction of the force coefficients as shown in fig 5 and table 3 we observe the instantaneous 3d vortical structures and the 2d vorticity distribution to identify the feature of the vortex roll up and vortex shedding in order to define these 3 d vortical structures we adopted the swirl strength given by zhou et al 1999 they defined a vortical region as a region with negative λ 2 the second largest eigenvalue of s i j 2 ω i j 2 where s i j 2 and ω i j 2 are the strain rate tensor and rotation rate tensor respectively the smooth cylinder clearly forms that large scale kármán vortices in the near wake region as shown in fig 7 a however the separated shear layer from the wc and dw cylinders are considerably elongated to the downstream as shown in fig 7 b and c respectively thus the vortex roll up of the separated shear layer from the wc and dw cylinders is delayed to a downstream position which is well identified by the distribution of the spanwise vorticity in x y plane in fig 8 therefore the vortex shedding nearly disappears in the near wake of the wc and dw cylinders and reappears weakly in the far wake compared to the smooth cylinder this modification of the vortical structures due to waviness is consistent with the findings from previous studies wei et al 2016 jung and yoon 2014 yoon et al 2017 lam et al 2004b zhang and lee 2005 xu et al 2010 lam and lin 2008 in addition the transverse and streamwise vorticities additionally appear over the surface of the wc and dw cylinders as shown in fig 9 b c e and f respectively these long additional vortices over the surface of the wc and dw cylinders attenuate the spanwise vortices which contributes to the delay of the vortex roll up 3 2 2 additional vorticities and regimes of the zero vorticity the streamwise and transverse vorticities additionally appear over the surface of the wc asw and hte cylinders these additional vortices are formed by three dimensional geometric effect on the flow separation jung and yoon 2014 yoon et al 2017 lin et al 2016 generally the additional vorticities on wc surface in fig 9 b and e elongate to downstream and then they are split in several branches the additional appearance of the streamwise and transverse vorticities over the modified surfaces show the very weak dependence on the time and space particularly these additional streamwise and transverse vorticities are formed periodically in the spanwise direction over the time as shown in fig 9 b and c and 9 e f for the wc and dw cylinders respectively eventually these additional vorticities are spatially and temporally locked and stabilize the shear layers to farther downstream and retard vortices roll up lin et al 2016 these distributions of additional vorticities can also be observed in fig 10 e and f for the contours of the transverse vorticity these spatially and temporally locked vortices are clearly confirmed in the time averaged flow filed in fig 11 the double wavy configuration of the dw cylinder forms alternatively the vorticities with the positive and negative sign along the span as shown in fig 9 c and f these vorticities are much closer to each other than the wc cylinder thus the wider spanwise regions of the wake are covered by these vorticities originated from the surface as a result these stabilized additional vorticities delay vortices roll up associating to more drag reduction and the suppression of the lift fluctuation the regions of zero vorticity were also formed by the wc fig 9 b and e and asw cylinders jung and yoon 2014 yoon et al 2017 lam and lin 2008 and hte cylinder wei et al 2016 jung and yoon 2014 the present dw geometry forms the regions of the zero vorticities which are associated by the elongated shear layer and the delay of vortex shedding in fig 9 c and f 3 2 3 formation of jet like flow the smooth cylinder forms the positive and negative vorticities in the instantaneous velocity field of the smooth cylinder they are distributed in a seemingly random manner especially near the rear stagnation point zhang and lee 2005 lin et al 1995 as shown in fig 10 a and d the wc asw and hte cylinders form the local acceleration and deceleration flow owing to the spanwise dependent diameter which roles to block and suck the flow along the span jung and yoon 2014 thus in contrast to the smooth cylinder in fig 10 a the wc forms the jet like flow in fig 10 b showing the instantaneous velocity vectors in the horizontal x z plane at y d m 0 6 the magnitude of the velocity vectors near wake for wc is smaller than that of the smooth cylinder also the elongated shear layer is dominant to the near wake therefore the near wake of the wc is more stable than that of the smooth cylinder especially the dw cylinder shows that jet like flow covers wider wake region and sustains downstream as shown in fig 10 c and f additionally the jet like flow of the dw cylinder creates the spatially locked vorticities to farther downstream as shown in fig 10 f behind the rear surface of the dw the vorticities are much sparser than the smooth cylinder and also the wc cylinder which associates to wider zero vorticity region for the dw cylinder from the patterns behind the dw cylinder the separated free shear layers are relatively more stable and then roll up into vortices farther downstream leading to a reduction of the suction near the base region of the twisted cylinder this stabilized wake also associates to the large reduction of the turbulent kinetic energy behind the dw cylinder which will be discussed in later fig 10 shows the mean velocity vectors and vorticity contours in the horizontal x z plane at y d m 0 6 for the wc and dw cylinders these mean velocity vectors and contours of vorticities clarify the temporal and spatially lock especially the dw cylinder shows the extension of the streamwise spatial lock compared to the wc which clarified by the contours of vorticities in fig 10 b and c and 8 e f for the wc and the dw cylinders respectively the dw cylinder forms the double wavy formation of vorticities like the asw cylinder yoon et al 2017 due to the relatively high and low speed flows by different spanwise geometric gradients 3 2 4 a longer vortex formation length elongation a longer vortex formation length associating with the drag reduction and the suppression of the lift fluctuation has been found by the wc cylinder lam and lin 2008 the asw cylinder yoon et al 2017 and hte cylinder wei et al 2016 jung and yoon 2014 the vortex formation length can be evaluated along its centerline the wake closure length l f c corresponds to the location of the time averaged closure point where the mean streamwise velocity on the wake centerline is zero is considered in this study to quantitatively identify and compare the spanwise vortex formation lengths for 3 d geometric disturbances recently many researches have used the wake closure length l f c to measure the formation length jung and yoon 2014 yoon et al 2017 lam et al 2004b lam and lin 2008 norberg 1998 even the definition of the vortex formation length is not universal the dependence of the recovery location of u u on the spanwise geometric disturbances is assured in fig 12 where the previous results for the cy and wc cylinders are included for the purpose of the comparison additionally the vortex formation length l f c as s function of the spanwise direction is presented in fig 12 for the wc with long wavy length the zero position moves downstream with moving from the saddle to the node which is consistent with that of lin et al 2016 as shown in figs 12 and 13 thus the nodal plane forms a larger reversal flow region than the saddle plane for the asw cylinder the l f c has an asymmetric profile along the spanwise direction yoon et al 2017 the dw cylinder shows the double wavy profile of l f c in each half wavelength which is due to the double wavy distribution of flow as indicated in the velocity vectors and the transverse vorticity contours in the horizontal x z plane interestingly the dw geometry gives a shorter wavy effect on the formation length namely in contrast to a longer wavelength the saddle plane forms a longer formation length than the nodal plane lin et al 2016 as shown in figs 12 and 13 the dw cylinder also identified by the mean spanwise vorticity in fig 14 the dw shape generates longer vorticity than the wc geometry over the span the vortex formation length is strongly related to the force coefficients and pressure therefore the dw cylinder gain more force reduction than the wc cylinder the largest mean base pressure of the dw cylinder confirm the association of the vortex formation length as shown in fig 15 3 2 5 turbulence suppression figs 16 and 17 show the contours of the turbulent kinetic energy tke for three cylinders in the x y plane and x z plane respectively in cases of wc and dw cylinders different spanwise planes are considered due to three dimensional geometries in addition the profiles of tke along the spanwise direction at different streamwise directions are plotted in fig 18 turbulent fluctuations are also associated with the variation of the fluctuating forces exerted on a body wu et al 2007 the wc cylinder in fig 16 b d exhibits negligibly small tke in the near wake in comparison with the cy cylinder in fig 16 a regardless of the spanwise direction for the wc cylinder this wide region covered by minor tke is clearly identified in fig 17 b in comparison with the cy cylinder in fig 17 a in the near wake the appearance of the minor tke along the span at x d m 1 for the wc is identified in fig 18 a the maximum tke of the cy cylinder appears at about x d m 2 0 in fig 18 b otherwise the tke of the wc cylinder at x d m 2 0 is much smaller than that of the cy cylinder the positions of the maximum tke are farther from the back of the wc cylinder than from that of the cy cylinder the maximum tke of the wc cylinder appears at about x d m 3 5 in fig 18 d generally the wc cylinder forms the periodic variations of tke distribution along the spanwise direction and resembles the geometric shape of the cylinder thus the positon of the maximum tke for the wc cylinder is dependent on the spanwise direction as shown in figs 17 b and 18 d this spanwise dependence of the maximum tke position is associated with the vortex formation length and the shear layer elongation due to the 3d geometric disturbance the longer vortex formation length and the elongated shear layer contribute to the delay of the vortex roll up and the late vortex shedding which weaken the tke and leads to the relatively stable flow these characteristics of the tke distribution of the wc cylinder are consistent with the findings of zhang et al zhang and lee 2005 and lam and lin 2008 the tke behind the dw cylinder exhibits the similar distribution with the wc cylinder therefore the positions of the maximum tke values are farther from the back of the dw cylinder than from those of the cy as shown in fig 16 e h the dw cylinder forms wider region with very small tke than the wc cylinder as shown in fig 17 b and c this weak tke is clearly identify by the spanwise profiles of tke at different streamwise positions in fig 18 the overall values of tke for the dw cylinder near the wake region are smaller than those of the cy and wc cylinders consequently the significant reduction in tke in the near wake of the dw cylinder contributes to a reduction in the drag and fluctuating lift 4 conclusions for the first time a double wavy dw disturbance is introduced to achieve the drag reduction and the suppression of fluctuating lift as the passive control for the bluff body flow the present study expanded the asymmetry of yoon et al 2017 and combined two optimum wavelengths of λ d m 2 0 and λ d m 6 06 of lam and lin 2009 and lin et al 2016 for the geometric disturbance we simply call this modified geometric disturbance as a double wavy disturbance eventually we numerically investigated flow past as a double wavy cylinder at re 3000 using les the dw geometric disturbance achieved the significant reduction of drag and the suppression of fluctuating lift compared to those of the cy cylinder the dw cylinder gave a reduction of 16 74 of c d and 97 27 of c l r m s in comparison with the cy cylinder it is noted that the dw cylinder achieved more reduction of c d and c l r m s than the wc cylinder with long optimum wavy length where the maximum reduction of c d and c l r m s is achieved lin et al 2016 the dw geometric disturbance formed the common characteristics of flow structures which associates with the drag reduction and the suppression of the lift fluctuation for the bluff body also the dw disturbance forms the additional streamwise and transverse vorticities by the 3d effect of the geometric disturbance on the flow separation these additional vorticities locked temporally and spatially and stabilize the shear layers to farther downstream and delay vortices roll up associating to more drag reduction and the suppression of the lift fluctuation the jet like flow of the dw cylinder creates the spatially locked vorticities to farther downstream which more stabilize the wake and achieves more reduction of the drag and lift fluctuation the dw cylinder forms the double wavy formation of vorticities due to the relatively high and low speed flows by different spanwise geometric gradients the dw cylinder shows also the double wavy profile of vortex formation length in each half wavelength which is due to the double wavy distribution of flow interestingly the dw geometry gives a shorter wavy effect on the formation length namely in contrast to a longer wavelength the saddle plane forms a longer formation length than the nodal plane lin et al 2016 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

22264,a double wavy dw disturbance is newly proposed to obtain the reduction of drag and the fluctuating lift as the passive control for the bluff body flow the present study expanded the asymmetry of yoon et al 2017 and combined two optimum wavelengths in the short and long wavelength ranges of lam and lin 2008 and lin et al 2016 to realize the dw geometric disturbance eventually the flow past the dw cylinder was computed at the subcritical reynolds number of 3000 using a large eddy simulation the dw cylinder achieved the significant reduction of drag and fluctuating lift compared to those of the smooth cylinder it is noted that the dw cylinder achieved more reduction of drag and lift fluctuation than the wavy cylinder with the optimum wavelength the dw cylinder formed the common characteristics of flow which associates with the reduction of drag and the fluctuating lift the dw cylinder showed the double wavy profile of vortex formation length which is due to the double wavy distribution of flow interestingly the dw geometry gives a shorter wavy effect on the formation length namely the saddle plane forms a longer formation length than the nodal plane keywords double wavy

is one of the most commonly encountered structures in the real life industries and academics in the fluid mechanics the bluff body is characterized by vortex shedding beyond the critical reynolds number the various methods to control vortex shedding which derives a large portion of the drag noise vibration to bodies have been suggested among the flow control methods the shape modification is adopted as geometric disturbances zdravkovich 1981 naudascher and rockwell 2005 ekmekci and rockwell 2010 in nature the unique geometries have been found to be applied as the bluff body flow control classified as the biomimetics the daffodil stem contributes to design the helically twisted elliptic hte cylinder eventually the hte geometry is confirmed by the effective passive control method kim et al 2012 2016 wei et al 2016 jung and yoon 2014 recently the unique shape of a harbor seal vibrissa was introduced as a tool for viv vortex induced vibration hanke et al 2010 and hydrodynamic forces hans et al 2013 but the detail researches in the view of fluid dynamics are very seldom wang and liu 2016 kim and yoon 2017 2018 in this regard yoon et al 2017 considered the asymmetry to find the effect of the asymmetry on the fluid flow the harbor seal vibrissa come up this asymmetry they considered the symmetric wavy cylinder to apply the asymmetry the symmetric wavy cylinder is confirmed as a good passive control by many researches jung and yoon 2014 ahmed et al 1993 lam and lin 2009 lin et al 2016 ahmed and bays muchmore 1992 lam et al 2004a 2004b lee and nguyen 2007 zhang and lee 2005 xu et al 2010 for the first time yoon et al 2017 considered an asymmetric wavy disturbance as the passive control they considered that the optimum wavelength of λ d m 6 06 for the wavy cylinder gives a decrease in fluid forces lin et al 2016 where d m is the mean value of the maximum and minimum diameters lam and lin 2007 2008 2009 reported the optimal wavelengths for the maximum reduction of forces in the laminar and subcritical regimes the present study intends to expand the asymmetry of yoon et al 2017 and combine two optimum wavelengths of λ d m 2 0 and λ d m 6 06 of lam and lin 2009 and lin et al 2016 for the geometric disturbance we simply call this modified geometric disturbance as a double wavy dw disturbance which will be precisely described in a chapter of the identification of geometries to our knowledge the present study is an original research which applies the double wavy geometry as the passive control to the bluff body flow the main purpose of the present study is to evaluate the feasibility of the double wavy geometry as the passive control by the geometric disturbance to the circular cylinder therefore we estimate the time variation of the drag and lift due to vortex shedding and their mean values additionally in order to estimate the efficiency of the double wavy geometry force coefficient of the double wavy dw geometry are compared with those of the smooth and symmetric wavy cy and wc geometries therefore flows around three different geometries cy wc and dw are computationally simulated the present study considers the subcritical reynolds number of 3000 where wake flow is fully turbulent resulting in using the large eddy simulation les the present wavelength and amplitude of wc are the same as lin et al 2016 where identified the long optimal wavelength as λ d m 6 06 which minimizes the force coefficients as mentioned above in order to test the feasibility of dw geometry as the passive control we consider the optimal wavelength of wc in future the wavelength amplitude and reynolds number should be considered to generalize the performance of dw as the passive control 2 numerical details 2 1 governing equations and numerical methods for the large eddy simulation the grid filters are used for navier stokes and continuity equations under the assumptions of the unsteady three dimensional incompressible flow the governing equations are as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u i u j x j p x i 1 re 2 u i x j x j τ i j x j where the overbar denotes the resolved scale in equations t x i u i and p are the time cartesian coordinates the corresponding velocity components and the pressure respectively the τ i j is the subgrid scale stress tensor the details of the present les model can be referred in authors previous works jung and yoon 2014 germano et al 1991 lilly 1992 the spatial discretization is done by a second order central difference scheme based on finite volume method the crank nicolson scheme and a second order adams bashforth scheme are adopted for the diffusion and convection terms respectively for the temporal discretization these numerical methods have been successfully used in yoon et al 2009 and yoon et al 2017 2 2 definition of the geometries fig 1 shows three different shapes of the cy wc and dw cylinders the local diameter d z of the wc cylinder is defined as follows 3 d z d m 2 a cos 2 π z λ 1 where λ 1 and a are the wavelength and amplitude respectively the d m is the mean diameter of the maximum and minimum local diameters d max and d min which is the same as the diameter of the cy cylinder the abbreviations n node m middle and s saddle marked in fig 2 a correspond to the positions at these local diameters d max d m and d min respectively the λ 1 is an optimum wavelength of λ d m 6 06 for the wc cylinder lin et al 2016 thus the present study choose the optimum wavelength of λ d m 6 06 and wave amplitude of a d m 0 152 these the optimum conditions provided the maximum reduction of force coefficients for the wc cylinder lin et al 2016 eventually using these optimum conditions we can evaluate whether the dw geometry can provide the additional reduction recently yoon et al 2017 considered the asymmetric wavy geometric disturbance for flow control they also used this optimum wavelength of λ 1 the double wavy geometry in fig 2 b is formed by two different wavelengths as follows 4 d z d m a cos 2 π z λ 1 cos 2 π z λ 2 where λ 2 is λ 1 3 of the wavelength of the wc cylinder thus λ 2 is λ d m 2 02 which is about the optimum wavelength in the small wavelength region lam and lin 2008 the double wavy geometry is shown in fig 2 b for the dw cylinder there are two node and saddle positions in the half wavelengths thus the positions at the maximum and minimum local diameters of the dw cylinder are named n1 node1 and s2 saddle2 respectively another node and saddle positions of the middle part of the half cylinder are named n2 node2 and s1 saddle1 respectively as shown in fig 2 b each node and saddle has double wavy formation therefore the double wavy geometry reflects the asymmetry of yoon et al 2017 and the combination of two optimum wavelengths of λ d m 2 02 and λ d m 6 06 of lam and lin 2009 and lin et al 2016 for the geometric disturbance 2 3 boundary conditions grid and validation the computational domain and boundary conditions adopted in the present study is presented in fig 3 the size of domain is 24 d m 16 d m and 6 06 d m λ along the streamwise transverse and spanwise direction respectively the cylinder is set to the location with a distance of 8 d m and 16 d m from the inflow and outflow boundaries respectively the fluid flow uniformly in the inflow boundary and the symmetry and periodic boundary conditions were imposed in the transverse and spanwise directions a convective boundary condition u i t c u i x 0 where c is the space averaged streamwise outlet velocity was imposed for velocity and neumann condition was used for pressure on the outflow region no slip and no penetration conditions were applied at the cylinder surface in this present study the typical grid distribution of the oh type is considered including an o type grid distribution around the cylinder for the purpose of refining the mesh in normal and circumferential directions in the spanwise direction the grid distributed uniformly in order to verify the present numerical method and grid system the comparisons with the previous researches for the time averaged drag coefficient c d root mean square rms of lift fluctuation c l r m s and strouhal number s t and also grid dependency test have been carried out the definitions of c d c l r m s and s t can be found in jung and yoon 2014 yoon et al 2009 2017 first the present results of three different grid systems coarse medium and fine are compared with those of experiments norberg 1987 2003 and computation lam and lin 2008 for the cy cylinder and les results jung and yoon 2014 yoon et al 2017 lin et al 2016 for the wc cylinder as arranged in table 1 these grid systems consist of 2 5 3 5 and 4 5 million grids respectively the results of the present computations agree well with those of the previous experimental and numerical researches also the results for three different grid systems have the nearly same values in addition by using the medium grid system the comparison of the present profiles of mean u u and the r m s u u of the streamwise velocity along the crosswise direction at different downstream locations with the results of experiments lam et al 2004b norberg 1987 and computation yoon et al 2017 is shown in fig 4 regardless of the streamwise location both of u u and the r m s u u give a good agreement with those of the previous studies as shown in fig 4 additionally for the dw cylinder which has no previous data the computations of three grid systems have been carried out to evaluate the dependence of the solutions on the grid as listed in table 2 similarly the discrepancies of the results among those grid systems are negligible therefore the medium grid system was employed to discuss the following results dealt with in next chapter 3 results and discussion 3 1 force coefficients and strouhal number the drag and lift coefficients c d and c l are usually considered as the objectives of the flow control to mainly reduce these force coefficients therefore first time histories of c d and c l for the cy wc and dw cylinders are illustrated in fig 5 the wc cylinder gives smaller c d and c l compared to the cy cylinder which well regenerates the results of lin et al 2016 the optimum wavelength of λ d m 6 06 lin et al 2016 is consistent with darekar and sherwin 2000 who achieved a large reduction in c d for a front and rear face wavy square cylinder the dw cylinder provides a significant reduction of c d and c l in comparison with the smooth cylinder in fig 5 a b especially the dw cylinder gives more reduction of c d and c l than the optimal wc cylinder lin et al 2016 table 3 shows mean force coefficients of c d and c l r m s the wc cylinder provides about 13 05 and 88 26 reduction of c d and c l r m s respectively in comparison with the cy cylinder the dw cylinder gives approximately 16 74 and 97 27 respectively in comparison with the cy cylinder therefore the dw cylinder provides more reduction than the optimal wc cylinder the strouhal numbers s t for different cylinders are achieved by performing the fourier transform of the time history of the lift coefficient to evaluate the effect of the dw shape on the vortex shedding frequency fig 6 presents the power spectral densities of the time histories of the lift coefficients for different cylinders the values of the smooth cylinder and the symmetric wavy cylinder are 0 21 and 0 18 as early in table 1 the dw cylinder provides almost the same as the wc cylinder as shown in fig 6 as a result the of the wc and dw cylinders is smaller than that of a smooth cylinder at this re for the wc cylinder lin et al ahmed and bays muchmore 1992 reported that the greatest deviation of between the wc and cy cylinder takes place at the optimum values of wavelength 2 0 and 6 0 thus the present result is consistent with the finding of lin et al ahmed and bays muchmore 1992 the geometric disturbances of helically twisted elliptic shape the symmetric waviness and the asymmetric waviness jung and yoon 2014 yoon et al 2017 lin et al 2016 provide smaller than the smooth cylinder which is associated with the suppression of vortex shedding in the near wake the dw shape is also related to the lower frequency by the suppressed vortex shedding in the near wake which will be identified by the instantaneous flow structures later 3 2 common characteristics of flow structures for force reduction the drag reduction and the suppression of the lift fluctuation by the wavy helical and spiral type of the geometric disturbance for the bluff body are associated with generally the common flow characteristics such as the shear layer elongation a longer vortex formation length elongation the spanwise wavy fashion of the flow the regimes of the zero the new transverse and streamwise vorticities 3 2 1 delay of the vortex roll up the retard of the vortex roll up and almost the disappearance of the vortex shedding in near wake are derived by the passive flow control using the surface modifications of the wc cylinder jung and yoon 2014 lin et al 2016 lam et al 2004b zhang and lee 2005 xu et al 2010 lam and lin 2008 the helically twisted elliptic hte cylinder kim et al 2016 wei et al 2016 jung and yoon 2014 stranded cable models nebres et al 1993 and asymmetric wavy asw cylinder yoon et al 2017 this delay of the vortex roll up contributes to the drag reduction and the suppression of the lift fluctuation because the dw cylinder as a passive control based on the surface modification gives rise to the reduction of the force coefficients as shown in fig 5 and table 3 we observe the instantaneous 3d vortical structures and the 2d vorticity distribution to identify the feature of the vortex roll up and vortex shedding in order to define these 3 d vortical structures we adopted the swirl strength given by zhou et al 1999 they defined a vortical region as a region with negative λ 2 the second largest eigenvalue of s i j 2 ω i j 2 where s i j 2 and ω i j 2 are the strain rate tensor and rotation rate tensor respectively the smooth cylinder clearly forms that large scale kármán vortices in the near wake region as shown in fig 7 a however the separated shear layer from the wc and dw cylinders are considerably elongated to the downstream as shown in fig 7 b and c respectively thus the vortex roll up of the separated shear layer from the wc and dw cylinders is delayed to a downstream position which is well identified by the distribution of the spanwise vorticity in x y plane in fig 8 therefore the vortex shedding nearly disappears in the near wake of the wc and dw cylinders and reappears weakly in the far wake compared to the smooth cylinder this modification of the vortical structures due to waviness is consistent with the findings from previous studies wei et al 2016 jung and yoon 2014 yoon et al 2017 lam et al 2004b zhang and lee 2005 xu et al 2010 lam and lin 2008 in addition the transverse and streamwise vorticities additionally appear over the surface of the wc and dw cylinders as shown in fig 9 b c e and f respectively these long additional vortices over the surface of the wc and dw cylinders attenuate the spanwise vortices which contributes to the delay of the vortex roll up 3 2 2 additional vorticities and regimes of the zero vorticity the streamwise and transverse vorticities additionally appear over the surface of the wc asw and hte cylinders these additional vortices are formed by three dimensional geometric effect on the flow separation jung and yoon 2014 yoon et al 2017 lin et al 2016 generally the additional vorticities on wc surface in fig 9 b and e elongate to downstream and then they are split in several branches the additional appearance of the streamwise and transverse vorticities over the modified surfaces show the very weak dependence on the time and space particularly these additional streamwise and transverse vorticities are formed periodically in the spanwise direction over the time as shown in fig 9 b and c and 9 e f for the wc and dw cylinders respectively eventually these additional vorticities are spatially and temporally locked and stabilize the shear layers to farther downstream and retard vortices roll up lin et al 2016 these distributions of additional vorticities can also be observed in fig 10 e and f for the contours of the transverse vorticity these spatially and temporally locked vortices are clearly confirmed in the time averaged flow filed in fig 11 the double wavy configuration of the dw cylinder forms alternatively the vorticities with the positive and negative sign along the span as shown in fig 9 c and f these vorticities are much closer to each other than the wc cylinder thus the wider spanwise regions of the wake are covered by these vorticities originated from the surface as a result these stabilized additional vorticities delay vortices roll up associating to more drag reduction and the suppression of the lift fluctuation the regions of zero vorticity were also formed by the wc fig 9 b and e and asw cylinders jung and yoon 2014 yoon et al 2017 lam and lin 2008 and hte cylinder wei et al 2016 jung and yoon 2014 the present dw geometry forms the regions of the zero vorticities which are associated by the elongated shear layer and the delay of vortex shedding in fig 9 c and f 3 2 3 formation of jet like flow the smooth cylinder forms the positive and negative vorticities in the instantaneous velocity field of the smooth cylinder they are distributed in a seemingly random manner especially near the rear stagnation point zhang and lee 2005 lin et al 1995 as shown in fig 10 a and d the wc asw and hte cylinders form the local acceleration and deceleration flow owing to the spanwise dependent diameter which roles to block and suck the flow along the span jung and yoon 2014 thus in contrast to the smooth cylinder in fig 10 a the wc forms the jet like flow in fig 10 b showing the instantaneous velocity vectors in the horizontal x z plane at y d m 0 6 the magnitude of the velocity vectors near wake for wc is smaller than that of the smooth cylinder also the elongated shear layer is dominant to the near wake therefore the near wake of the wc is more stable than that of the smooth cylinder especially the dw cylinder shows that jet like flow covers wider wake region and sustains downstream as shown in fig 10 c and f additionally the jet like flow of the dw cylinder creates the spatially locked vorticities to farther downstream as shown in fig 10 f behind the rear surface of the dw the vorticities are much sparser than the smooth cylinder and also the wc cylinder which associates to wider zero vorticity region for the dw cylinder from the patterns behind the dw cylinder the separated free shear layers are relatively more stable and then roll up into vortices farther downstream leading to a reduction of the suction near the base region of the twisted cylinder this stabilized wake also associates to the large reduction of the turbulent kinetic energy behind the dw cylinder which will be discussed in later fig 10 shows the mean velocity vectors and vorticity contours in the horizontal x z plane at y d m 0 6 for the wc and dw cylinders these mean velocity vectors and contours of vorticities clarify the temporal and spatially lock especially the dw cylinder shows the extension of the streamwise spatial lock compared to the wc which clarified by the contours of vorticities in fig 10 b and c and 8 e f for the wc and the dw cylinders respectively the dw cylinder forms the double wavy formation of vorticities like the asw cylinder yoon et al 2017 due to the relatively high and low speed flows by different spanwise geometric gradients 3 2 4 a longer vortex formation length elongation a longer vortex formation length associating with the drag reduction and the suppression of the lift fluctuation has been found by the wc cylinder lam and lin 2008 the asw cylinder yoon et al 2017 and hte cylinder wei et al 2016 jung and yoon 2014 the vortex formation length can be evaluated along its centerline the wake closure length l f c corresponds to the location of the time averaged closure point where the mean streamwise velocity on the wake centerline is zero is considered in this study to quantitatively identify and compare the spanwise vortex formation lengths for 3 d geometric disturbances recently many researches have used the wake closure length l f c to measure the formation length jung and yoon 2014 yoon et al 2017 lam et al 2004b lam and lin 2008 norberg 1998 even the definition of the vortex formation length is not universal the dependence of the recovery location of u u on the spanwise geometric disturbances is assured in fig 12 where the previous results for the cy and wc cylinders are included for the purpose of the comparison additionally the vortex formation length l f c as s function of the spanwise direction is presented in fig 12 for the wc with long wavy length the zero position moves downstream with moving from the saddle to the node which is consistent with that of lin et al 2016 as shown in figs 12 and 13 thus the nodal plane forms a larger reversal flow region than the saddle plane for the asw cylinder the l f c has an asymmetric profile along the spanwise direction yoon et al 2017 the dw cylinder shows the double wavy profile of l f c in each half wavelength which is due to the double wavy distribution of flow as indicated in the velocity vectors and the transverse vorticity contours in the horizontal x z plane interestingly the dw geometry gives a shorter wavy effect on the formation length namely in contrast to a longer wavelength the saddle plane forms a longer formation length than the nodal plane lin et al 2016 as shown in figs 12 and 13 the dw cylinder also identified by the mean spanwise vorticity in fig 14 the dw shape generates longer vorticity than the wc geometry over the span the vortex formation length is strongly related to the force coefficients and pressure therefore the dw cylinder gain more force reduction than the wc cylinder the largest mean base pressure of the dw cylinder confirm the association of the vortex formation length as shown in fig 15 3 2 5 turbulence suppression figs 16 and 17 show the contours of the turbulent kinetic energy tke for three cylinders in the x y plane and x z plane respectively in cases of wc and dw cylinders different spanwise planes are considered due to three dimensional geometries in addition the profiles of tke along the spanwise direction at different streamwise directions are plotted in fig 18 turbulent fluctuations are also associated with the variation of the fluctuating forces exerted on a body wu et al 2007 the wc cylinder in fig 16 b d exhibits negligibly small tke in the near wake in comparison with the cy cylinder in fig 16 a regardless of the spanwise direction for the wc cylinder this wide region covered by minor tke is clearly identified in fig 17 b in comparison with the cy cylinder in fig 17 a in the near wake the appearance of the minor tke along the span at x d m 1 for the wc is identified in fig 18 a the maximum tke of the cy cylinder appears at about x d m 2 0 in fig 18 b otherwise the tke of the wc cylinder at x d m 2 0 is much smaller than that of the cy cylinder the positions of the maximum tke are farther from the back of the wc cylinder than from that of the cy cylinder the maximum tke of the wc cylinder appears at about x d m 3 5 in fig 18 d generally the wc cylinder forms the periodic variations of tke distribution along the spanwise direction and resembles the geometric shape of the cylinder thus the positon of the maximum tke for the wc cylinder is dependent on the spanwise direction as shown in figs 17 b and 18 d this spanwise dependence of the maximum tke position is associated with the vortex formation length and the shear layer elongation due to the 3d geometric disturbance the longer vortex formation length and the elongated shear layer contribute to the delay of the vortex roll up and the late vortex shedding which weaken the tke and leads to the relatively stable flow these characteristics of the tke distribution of the wc cylinder are consistent with the findings of zhang et al zhang and lee 2005 and lam and lin 2008 the tke behind the dw cylinder exhibits the similar distribution with the wc cylinder therefore the positions of the maximum tke values are farther from the back of the dw cylinder than from those of the cy as shown in fig 16 e h the dw cylinder forms wider region with very small tke than the wc cylinder as shown in fig 17 b and c this weak tke is clearly identify by the spanwise profiles of tke at different streamwise positions in fig 18 the overall values of tke for the dw cylinder near the wake region are smaller than those of the cy and wc cylinders consequently the significant reduction in tke in the near wake of the dw cylinder contributes to a reduction in the drag and fluctuating lift 4 conclusions for the first time a double wavy dw disturbance is introduced to achieve the drag reduction and the suppression of fluctuating lift as the passive control for the bluff body flow the present study expanded the asymmetry of yoon et al 2017 and combined two optimum wavelengths of λ d m 2 0 and λ d m 6 06 of lam and lin 2009 and lin et al 2016 for the geometric disturbance we simply call this modified geometric disturbance as a double wavy disturbance eventually we numerically investigated flow past as a double wavy cylinder at re 3000 using les the dw geometric disturbance achieved the significant reduction of drag and the suppression of fluctuating lift compared to those of the cy cylinder the dw cylinder gave a reduction of 16 74 of c d and 97 27 of c l r m s in comparison with the cy cylinder it is noted that the dw cylinder achieved more reduction of c d and c l r m s than the wc cylinder with long optimum wavy length where the maximum reduction of c d and c l r m s is achieved lin et al 2016 the dw geometric disturbance formed the common characteristics of flow structures which associates with the drag reduction and the suppression of the lift fluctuation for the bluff body also the dw disturbance forms the additional streamwise and transverse vorticities by the 3d effect of the geometric disturbance on the flow separation these additional vorticities locked temporally and spatially and stabilize the shear layers to farther downstream and delay vortices roll up associating to more drag reduction and the suppression of the lift fluctuation the jet like flow of the dw cylinder creates the spatially locked vorticities to farther downstream which more stabilize the wake and achieves more reduction of the drag and lift fluctuation the dw cylinder forms the double wavy formation of vorticities due to the relatively high and low speed flows by different spanwise geometric gradients the dw cylinder shows also the double wavy profile of vortex formation length in each half wavelength which is due to the double wavy distribution of flow interestingly the dw geometry gives a shorter wavy effect on the formation length namely in contrast to a longer wavelength the saddle plane forms a longer formation length than the nodal
