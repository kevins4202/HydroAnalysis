a sea environment with a flat or sloping seabed using linear boundary conditions this problem is separated into steady and unsteady potential components the former accounts for the current flowing over the seabed or fixed body whereas the latter describes the wave interaction with the current through modification of the free surface boundary conditions both steady and unsteady problems are solved using a boundary element model incorporating a continuous rankine source method the developed numerical model is validated by comparison with published data where possible and the investigation extended to examine the hydrodynamic responses of a forced oscillating body subject to the combined interactions arising from the wave current and seabed keywords wave current seabed structure interactions steady and unsteady flows continuous rankine source 1 introduction accurate predictions of the hydrodynamic loads acting on floating structures operating in near shore or coastal waters subjected to wave and current are of practical importance in offshore engineering in such situations the typical offshore structures used by industry include floating bridges floating wind turbines fpso and lng vessels during loading and unloading operations etc in the absence of current a wide range of water wave problems involving a flat seabed has been extensively studied for example kim 1969 described the importance of seabed on the hydrodynamic response of a floating body by extending the free surface green function method associated with deep water to finite water depth tuck 1966 1970 investigated this problem by dividing the computational domain into inner and outer domains and using asymptotic expansion theory matching relationships at the interface a similar numerical procedure was used by yeung 1973 who adopted a rankine source method to describe the fluid behaviour in the inner domain whereas in the outer domain region it is represented by a set of eigenfunctions bai 1977 applied a similar hybrid method focusing on the behaviour of the hydrodynamic coefficients at zero frequency and concluded that the zero frequency added mass coefficient has its minimum value at a critical water depth the analysis of water wave problems involving a sloping seabed or variable seabed topography requires a more complex numerical method the previously described numerical approaches are not directly applicable to changing bottom contours buchner 2006 de hauteclocque et al 2009 ferreira and newman 2009 introduced a second body to describe the influence of the sloping seabed profile these studies found that the body motion responses are significantly higher in the presence of a sloping seabed than in a constant water depth environment athanassoulis and belibassakis 1999 belibassakis and athanassoulis 2004 belibassakis 2008 adopted a coupled mode theory to divide the fluid domain into an interior domain of variable water depth and an exterior domain of constant depth they introduced an extra term referred to as the sloping bottom mode to correct the incident wave potential so that it satisfies the seabed condition on the slope the numerical predictions of belibassakis 2005 2008 show that the sloping seabed significantly changes the body motion responses in lower frequency range in the presence of current in deep water haskind 1944 grue and palm 1985 investigated wave radiation and diffraction problems for a two dimensional submerged circular cylinder in the frequency domain by developing a forward speed green function zhao and faltinsen 1988 combined the rankine source model in the near field and a multipole expansion in the far field to analyse frequency domain problems involving the coexistence of wave and current wu and eatock taylor 1990 developed a new mathematical formulation based on a forward speed dependent perturbation series allowing evaluation of the hydrodynamic force directly nossen et al 1991 derived a green function assuming a small forward speed in the form of a zero speed green function and its derivatives based on a rankine source model applicable to the whole fluid field isaacson and cheung 1993 separated the boundary integral problem into a steady current problem with a rigid wall condition applied at the still water surface and an unsteady wave problem with modified free surface boundary conditions accounting for the disturbed wave field caused by the current numerical results were evaluated to describe radiation and diffraction problems in the time domain with good agreements observed in comparisons with the frequency domain results of zhao and faltinsen 1988 the rankine source method combined with other numerical techniques provides a numerical procedure to analyse a variety of boundary condition problems cao et al 1991 koo and kim 2007 zhang et al 2010 kim and kim 2013 in a previous study feng et al 2016 2017 developed a continuous rankine source model to solve wave body interaction problems involving various seabed conditions all the fluid domain surfaces free body seabed are discretized by continuous panels and the rankine source integral calculated analytically on each source panel feng et al 2016 2017 concluded that mean water depth has a significant influence on hydrodynamic responses and the effects of sloping seabed vary largely for different hydrodynamic responses feng and bai 2016 found that the current has limited effect on global hydrodynamic responses in the wave radiation problem but significantly changes the local hydrodynamic responses and alters the pressure distribution around the body surface in the direction of the current this investigation further develops and combines the numerical models established by feng and bai 2016 feng et al 2017 to assess wave current interaction problems involving a flat or sloping seabed environment this is achieved by constructing two boundary element equations to describe the steady and unsteady contributions to the overall problem the steady problem equation describes the current passing a fixed body above a flat or sloping seabed the unsteady problem equation solves the water wave problem with free surface boundary conditions modified to include current effects within the chosen seabed environment these two boundary integral equations are formulated by adopting the continuous rankine source method together with application of linear steady and unsteady boundary conditions to minimize errors in the numerical scheme of study the rankine source integral is analytically calculated on the free body and seabed surfaces numerical tests for convergence of solution are applied to the steady problem and results from the developed method compared with findings from published data in a limited validation process the influences of current and seabed on the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave amplitudes are studied and discussed for a semi circular cylinder experiencing both forced heave and sway oscillatory motions 2 mathematical formulation of the problem the proposed mathematical model deals with linear wave current structure seabed interaction problems that is the body boundary condition is satisfied on the mean wetted body surface and the linearized free surface boundary condition applied on the calm water surface at each time step 2 1 fluid motion equations fig 1 illustrates a coordinate frame of reference o x z with origin o at the centre of a two dimensional body floating in a fluid domain of finite water depth the fluid domain ω is bounded by a free surface s f body surface s b seabed surface s 0 and an enclosing surface at infinity s an ideal fluid flow is assumed which is described by the velocity potential ϕ satisfying the laplace equation 1 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ z 2 0 in the fluid domain ω the total velocity potential ϕ x z t is subject to physical boundary conditions on the body surface s b free surface s f and seabed s 0 these boundary conditions are expressed respectively as 2 ϕ n b v b n b on s b 3 ϕ z η t ϕ x η x 0 on s f 4 ϕ t 1 2 δ ϕ 2 g η c on s f 5 ϕ n 0 0 on s 0 here n b and n 0 denote normal vector on the body and seabed surfaces respectively v b denotes the body motion velocity η and g represent the free surface elevation and gravitational acceleration respectively c is the bernoulli constant including current flow energy the boundary condition applicable to the potential ϕ on the far field boundary at infinity requires that the generated wave moves towards infinity and never reflects backward by dividing the velocity field into a steady velocity field caused by the steady incoming current and an unsteady velocity field combing the effects of wave and current within the seabed environment we express the total velocity potential ϕ as 6 ϕ x z t ϕ s x z ϕ u x z t where the subscripts s and u indicate the steady and unsteady velocity potential respectively 2 2 steady potential problem the steady potential ϕ s x z describes the influence of the body fixed in the steady current the current speed u x is a variable in the fluid domain in the vicinity of the sloping seabed but assumed constant in the regions of constant water depth in all the illustrative examples described herein it is assumed that both the current speed and its rate of change are small quantities allowing development of a linear mathematical model this allows the steady potential to be expressed as the superposition of the steady current u x and steady disturbance potential ϕ b due to the presence of body in the current that is 7 ϕ s u x x ϕ b for this steady potential problem the current flows horizontally with no vertical motion and the free surface is a current flow surface being similar to the calm water surface s f in the unsteady potential problem as discussed by isaacson and cheung 1991 1993 cheung et al 1996 this boundary condition is referred to as the rigid wall condition a mirror image technique was applied to transform the semi circular cylinder into a circular cylinder in an unbounded fluid domain by this treatment the fluid domain can be expressed by superposition of a current flow passing a dipole newman 1977 pp 153 154 allowing the determination of an analytical solution however this mirror image method is not readily applicable if a seabed environment is involved the steady potential ϕ b satisfies the laplace equation and its form determined by solving the steady potential boundary conditions on s b s f and s 0 that is 8 ϕ b n b u x n b on s b 9 ϕ b n f 0 on s f 10 ϕ b n 0 0 on s 0 where n f denotes a normal vector on the free surface the far field boundary condition for ϕ b requires the current moves towards infinity and does not reflect backward a similar numerical technique is applied to satisfy this boundary condition as adopted for the unsteady potential and this is discussed in section 3 5 2 3 unsteady potential problem the unsteady potential ϕ u x z t accounts for the time dependent fluid flow field arising from the coupled interaction effects of wave current and seabed topography for a floating body experiencing forced heave or sway oscillatory motion the position of this body is given by the displacement function 11 z 0 z a sin ω t or z z a sin ω t 0 at time t for vertical or horizontal motions where z a and ω denote motion amplitude and oscillatory frequency respectively the corresponding velocity is 12 v b 0 z a ω cos ω t or v b z a ω cos ω t 0 in this mathematical model it is assumed that the amplitude of body motion z a is small compared to the characteristic dimension of the body a moderate size wave amplitude excited and the water depth is not small compared to a typical wavelength these allows the linear kinematic and dynamic free surface boundary conditions including current to be expressed respectively as 13 ϕ u z η t η x ϕ s x η 2 ϕ s z 2 on s f z 0 14 ϕ u t g η ϕ u x ϕ s x on s f z 0 the effects of current are accounted for by inclusion of the terms on the right hand side rhs of equations 13 and 14 as the steady potential is independent of time it is only calculated once in the numerical simulation when the current velocity u 0 all the terms on the rhs of equations 13 and 14 vanish and reduce to the version of free surface boundary conditions in the absence of current the far field radiation condition requires that the disturbed waves vanish in the far field in the numerical simulation discussed herein the source points are distributed in an exponential manner over a large section of the free surface this mechanism allows the generated waves to move towards the far field with no wave reflected as described in section 3 5 the free surface boundary conditions equations 13 and 14 together with the body boundary condition equation 2 and seabed condition equation 5 produce a closed boundary value formulation to describe the unsteady problem the steady potential provides no contribution to the free surface elevation which is investigated in the unsteady potential problem from equations 13 and 14 it is seen that both steady ϕ s and unsteady potential ϕ u are required to evaluate the unsteady problem however the position of free surface in the steady potential problem remains unchanged in the unsteady potential problem 3 rankine source boundary integral equation in this paper the continuous rankine source method is applied in the boundary integral equation the fluid domain surfaces are discretized into continuous panels rather than isolated points the rankine source points coincide with the control points and therefore no desingularized technique is required 3 1 boundary integral equation by utilizing the gauss divergence theorem and the application of the dirichlet boundary value problem to the exterior domain of the fluid field lamb 1945 pp 59 60 expressed the velocity potential ϕ as a boundary integral of rankine sources continuously distributed on the fluid boundary s s b s f s 0 in the form 15 ϕ x t s b σ b ln x x d s x s f σ f ln x x d s x s 0 σ 0 ln x x d s x here we denote control point x x z located on the middle point of a continuous panel the source point x x z the body source strength σ b σ x t free surface source strength σ f σ x t seabed source strength σ 0 σ x t and variable of integration d s x it should be noted that physically the free surface s f is of infinite length and the integral of this infinite domain is not possible by numerical technique for this reason the computational domain is truncated in the numerical simulations and the far field boundary condition is satisfied on this truncated free surface in the present study the rankine source panels are distributed in an exponential manner allowing the covering of a very large area of free surface and numerical computations completed before the surface wave reaches the truncated boundary the interested reader can find detailed information of this rankine source panel distribution approach in a previous study by feng et al 2016 let the integral domain boundary surfaces s b s f and s 0 be discretized by n b n f and n 0 panels respectively such that s b i 1 n b s i b s f j 1 n f s j f and s 0 k 1 n 0 s k 0 therefore equation 15 is expressed in the form 16 ϕ x t i 1 n b σ i b s i b ln x x i d s x j 1 n f σ j f s j f ln x x j d s x k 1 n 0 σ k 0 s k 0 ln x x k d s x 3 2 numerical discretization for steady problem let x i b s b x j f s f and x k 0 s 0 be collocation points for i 1 n b j 1 n f and k 1 n 0 for the steady problem by employing the boundary conditions expressed in equations 8 10 the discretized form of the boundary integral equation for the steady problem becomes 17 ϕ b x i b n b i 1 n b σ i b n b i s i b ln x i b x i d s x j 1 n f σ j f n b i s j f ln x i b x j d s x k 1 n 0 σ k 0 n b i s k 0 ln x i b x k d s x 18 ϕ b x j f n f i 1 n b σ i b n f j s i b ln x j f x i d s x j 1 n f σ j f n f j s j f ln x j f x j d s x k 1 n 0 σ k 0 n f j s k 0 ln x j f x k d s x 19 ϕ b x k 0 n 0 i 1 n b σ i b n 0 k s i b ln x k 0 x i d s x j 1 n f σ j f n 0 k s j f ln x k 0 x j d s x k 1 n 0 σ k 0 n 0 k s k 0 ln x k 0 x k d s x it is noticed that the free surface boundary condition is the solid wall condition as discussed by isaacson and cheung 1993 subscript f is adopted for simple annotation the neumann boundary condition is applicable for the steady problem and therefore there is no numerical divergence problem arising from the intersection point between free and body surfaces once σ b σ f and σ 0 are evaluated the velocity potential ϕ b can be calculated by equation 16 for any source panel on the fluid domain surfaces the values of velocity potential ϕ b only need calculating once at the initial time and then used at every following time step 3 3 numerical discretization for unsteady problem the body boundary condition described in equation 2 the free surface boundary conditions expressed in equations 13 and 14 and the seabed boundary condition of equation 5 allow equation 16 to be written as 20 ϕ u x i b t n b i 1 n b σ i b n b i s i b ln x i b x i d s x j 1 n f σ j f n b i s j f ln x i b x j d s x k 1 n 0 σ k 0 n b i s k 0 ln x i b x k d s x 21 ϕ u x j f t i 1 n b σ i b s i b ln x j f x i d s x j 1 n f σ j f s j f ln x j f x j d s x k 1 n 0 σ k 0 s k 0 ln x j f x k d s x 22 ϕ u x k 0 t n 0 i 1 n

dirichlet boundary conditions the intersection points between free and body surfaces require special numerical treatment which is described in detail by feng et al 2015b the symbols n b n f and n 0 are again used to represent the total sum of panels in each domain but they are of different values for unsteady and steady problems the calculation of the rankine source ln r integral in the boundary integral equations takes a significant portion of the computational effort in this study to reduce numerical error the continuous rankine source panel integral replaces the isolated rankine source approximation the calculation for the boundary integral is grouped into the integral of l n r over a panel together with its partial derivative to illustrate this procedure by way of example let us take the first panel integral on the rhs of equation 16 which can be analytically expressed as 23 i 1 n b σ i b s i b ln x i b x i d s x i 1 n b σ i b l b i re x x i 1 n b i ln x x i 1 x x i n b i ln x x i where l b i is the length of panel i on body surface and n b i denotes the conjugation of n b i on this panel let us continue this process by taking the first integral on the rhs of equation 20 namely the second group integral involving the partial derivative of the integral of ln r this is formulated analytically as 24 i 1 n b σ i b n b i s i b ln x i b x i d s x i 1 n b σ i b re n b i n b i ln x i b x i 1 x i b x i this numerical procedure improves numerical accuracy as illustrated it is an analytical integration carried out over the whole panel and therefore in this paper we define this technique as using a continuous rankine source panel 3 4 calculation for ϕ u x and η x the free surface source panels are not evenly distributed over the surface domain as discussed in section 3 5 experience shows that large numerical errors are generated if ϕ u x and η x in equations 13 and 14 are calculated by finite difference formulae from boundary integral equation 16 ϕ u x can be expressed as 25 ϕ u x j f t x f i 1 n b σ i b x f j s i b ln x j f x i d s x j 1 n f σ j f x f j s j f ln x j f x j d s x k 1 n 0 σ k 0 x f j s k 0 ln x j f x k d s x the calculation of the partial derivative of the integral of l n r is undertaken in a similar manner to equation 24 here source strength σ i b σ j f and σ k 0 are of the same values as those for the unsteady problem presented in section 3 3 ϕ u x can be calculated by equation 25 once σ i b σ j f σ k 0 are obtained by omitting the high order terms on the rhs of equation 14 we have 26 ϕ u t g η 0 on s f therefore η x can be expressed as 27 η x ϕ u t g x ϕ u x g t by choosing an even time interval δ t in the numerical simulation we can calculate η x to a high degree of accuracy by finite difference formulae provided that ϕ u x is determined by equation 25 3 5 boundary panel distribution the fluid domain surface is composed of a body surface s b a free surface s f and a seabed surface s 0 the distributed panels coincide with their respective surface profiles and the source point on each panel is located at the same position as a control point therefore no desingularized distance is required in the present numerical scheme of study the free surface is divided into inner and outer domains in the inner domain 140 source panels are distributed in ever increasing distances between one another while 40 source panels are distributed in an exponentially increasing manner in the outer domain about two wavelength distance is covered by source panels in the inner domain and the outer domain ranges over a distance more than 100 wavelengths a detailed discussion of this source panel distribution approach is provided by feng et al 2015a starting from x 0 on the rhs of s f the horizontal distances between neighbouring free surface source points are expressed in the form 28 x j f x j 1 f l b α j ω 2 in the inner domain 29 x j f x j 1 f l b α j ω 2 1 05 j j 1 2 in the outer domain where l b denotes the length of the body surface panel covering the intersection point of the body and free surfaces the parameters α j define separation distances between source points and are determined according to the method discussed by feng et al 2014 the rankine source panels on the left hand side lhs and rhs of the body are mirrored in an arrangement around the z axis the outer domain provides a large covering of the free surface and therefore the incoming current and generated wave move toward the far field of this enlarged computational domain numerical simulations are ended before the wave and current reach the far field border and therefore no wave and current are reflected back to disturb the fluid domain as discussed by feng et al 2016 2017 this efficient numerical procedure allows satisfaction of the radiation condition without the need to introduce artificial damping into the mathematical model in the present study the sloping seabed z h x is described mathematically as 30 h x h d 2 x l 2 h x tan β l 2 x l 2 h d 2 x l 2 where h is the mean water depth and β denotes the angle of the sloping seabed and defined as 31 β arctan d l fig 2 illustrates the wave current body sloping seabed interaction under investigation here l denotes the length of the slope in the x direction and d the height of the slope in the z direction the seabed is divided into three regions h 1 h 2 x and h 3 the parameters h 1 and h 3 denote the constant water depths above the flat seabed on either side of the slope with variable water depth h 2 x the distribution of the source panels on the seabed is similar in principle to the approach adopted to describe the free surface that is we divide the region into inner and outer domains because the seabed is assumed of equivalent expanse to the free surface however because of the asymmetric nature of the sloping seabed a mirror image approach is no longer valid and the procedure needs adjustment a parameter γ 1 tan β is introduced to deal with this asymmetric characteristic starting from x 0 on the rhs of s 0 the horizontal distances between neighbouring seabed control source points x k 0 are expressed in the form 32 x k 0 x k 1 0 l b α k γ ω 2 in the inner domain 33 x k 0 x k 1 0 l b α k γ ω 2 1 05 k k 1 2 in the outer domain and on the lhs of s 0 34 x k 0 x k 1 0 γ l b α k ω 2 in the inner domain 35 x k 0 x k 1 0 γ l b α k ω 2 1 05 k k 1 2 in the outer domain the parameters α k define the separation distances between source points and their values are chosen in the same manner as those on the free surface the vertical positions of each control point x 0 are calculated by equation 30 once their horizontal positions are known it is noted that for a flat seabed the angle β 0 and therefore γ 1 the sloping seabed panel distribution method developed here is now similar to the one devised for a flat seabed and therefore can deal with both flat and sloping seabed profiles 3 6 hydrodynamic forces the determination of strengths σ i b σ j f and σ k 0 by means of the boundary integral equations for both steady and unsteady problems allows their respective velocity potentials ϕ x i b t on the body surface s b to be expressed in the form 36 ϕ x i b t i 1 n b σ i b s i b ln x i b x i d s x j 1 n f σ j f s j f ln x i b x j d s x k 1 n 0 σ k 0 s k 0 ln x i b x k d s x the dynamic pressure p p x i b t on the body surface is evaluated by the bernoulli equation written as 37 p x i b t ρ ϕ x i b t t 1 2 ϕ x i b t 2 bearing in mind that ϕ x i b t ϕ s x i b t ϕ u x i b t we express the first order dynamic pressure p p x i b t explicitly as 38 p x i b t ρ ϕ u x i b t t ϕ s x i b ϕ u x i b t ϕ u x i b t t ϕ s x i b x ϕ u x i b t x ϕ s x i b z ϕ u x i b t z with 39 ϕ s x i b x u x x u x x ϕ b x i b x and 40 ϕ s x i b z ϕ b x i b z the dynamic force f t applied to the body surface is calculated by integrating the dynamic pressure p x i b t over the body surface and is given by 41 f t s b p x i b t n b d s the adoption of fourier series allows the frequency domain added mass a i j ω i j 1 3 and damping coefficient b i j ω i j 1 3 to be written in the forms 42 a i j ω 2 z a ω 2 t 0 0 t 0 f i j t sin ω t d t 43 b i j ω 2 z a ω t 0 0 t 0 f i j t cos ω t d t where the period of the body motion is denoted by t 0 here i j refer to the ith and jth degrees of freedom of the body motion 4 numerical convergence test for steady problem the steady problem relates to the interaction of a fixed body in a steady current confined within the seabed environment and free surface as shown in fig 2 the presence of the sloping seabed causes changes to the current speed above it this study assumes that no current reflects from the sloping seabed as discussed in section 2 2 for simplicity it is assumed that current speeds u 1 and u 3 are constant on the lhs x l 2 and the rhs x l 2 of the slope whereas u 2 x is variable in this sloping region l 2 x l 2 by the principle of mass conservation it follows that 44 u 1 h d 2 u 2 x h x tan β u 3 h d 2 in the following numerical simulation the froude number f r is defined as f r u 1 g r to denote the current speed numerical simulations are performed for a semi circular cylinder with radius r to draft t ratio r t 1 and surface area a 1 2 π r 2 this cylinder is located in an uniform current u over a flat seabed at water depth h 2 r for a semi circular cylinder body located in an uniform current u in deep water analytical results are readily available by considering this problem as current flow passing a dipole as discussed by newman 1977 pp 153 154 if a flat seabed is introduced at constant depth this problem can be solved by mirror image technique that is another dipole is introduced having the same dipole strength placed below the seabed creating a symmetric two dipole system about the seabed floor as shown in fig 3 through this means analytical results are obtained by superposition of these two dipoles fig 4 shows comparisons of ϕ x a and ϕ z b between analytical and numerical results for a fixed semi circular cylinder the body shape is described by body panel number n b 240 n b 120 and n b 60 respectively above a flat seabed at depth h 2 r in a fluid flow f r 0 064 for the case n b 240 the differences between analytical and numerical results are small for both ϕ x and ϕ z this agreement is further improved by increasing the value of n b but with increasing computer effort n b 240 is applied for both steady and unsteady problems through the present study it is noticed that to validate the developed mathematical model for the steady problem and to compare numerical and analytical results in the flat seabed case it is assumed that the current speed u 1 u 2 u 3 neglecting small changes to the current speed due to the presence of the body to further demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model numerical simulations are performed for this semi circular cylinder in a combined environment of uniform current froude number f r 0 064 over a flat seabed and sloping seabed in this numerical simulation the current speed is variable due to the presence of both cylinder and sloping seabed fig 5 shows comparisons of ϕ x a and ϕ z b for the semi circular cylinder over a flat seabed sloping seabed with sloping angles tan β 1 20 1 10 and 1 5 respectively at depth h 2 r it can be seen that as the sloping angle β decreases the values of ϕ x and ϕ z for the sloping seabed converge to values associated with the flat seabed it is observed that the value of ϕ z displays two peaks angle 0 8 and 2 3 which are not symmetrical due to a larger current speed existing on the rhs angle 0 8 than the lhs angle 2 3 of the circular cylinder 5 numerical results and discussion section 4 demonstrated the convergence of the numerical simulations and the accuracy of the proposed boundary integral equation method for the steady problem this forms the basis of the solution of the unsteady problem the superposition of steady and unsteady problems models the interactions between the wave current seabed structure investigated in this study all the numerical simulations are performed in the time domain and the results are transformed into the frequency domain for the purpose of direct comparisons 5 1 forced oscillatory motion of body in the presence of current or seabed effect to provide a measure of validity of the developed mathematical model numerical simulations of a semi circular cylinder experiencing forced harmonic heave or sway motion of amplitude z a 0 1 r were compared with numerical predictions determined by other investigators for example fig 6 illustrates the numerical results of heave added mass coefficient a 33 a and heave damping coefficient b 33 b these were derived by zhao and faltinsen 1988 for h f r 0 064 and by bai 1977 for a flat seabed with h 2 r f r 0 0 fig 7 shows the numerical results of sway added mass coefficient a 11 a and sway damping coefficient b 11 b these were determined by zhao and faltinsen 1988 for h f r 0 064 and anderson and he 1985 for a flat seabed with h 2 r f r 0 0 the numerical agreement between the different mathematical models provides confidence in the developed numerical scheme of study 5 2 the influence of seabed in the wave current structure problem to investigate the combined influence of the seabed and current we assume a uniform current speed u or f r 0 064 unless otherwise stated the seabed is flat positioned at depths h h 3 r h 2 r and the cylinder undergoes heave or sway oscillatory motion it is observed from the predictions that seabed depth has a significant influence on the heave and sway hydrodynamic characteristics for example fig 8 shows a comparison of the calculated heave added mass coefficient a 33 ω a and heave damping coefficient b 33 ω b the values of a 33 ω reduce in the lower frequency range whereas they increase in the higher frequency range with decreasing depth of seabed for b 33 ω the values increase noticeably across the frequency range as h decreases in magnitude fig 9 illustrates a comparison of sway added mass coefficient a 11 ω a and sway damping coefficient b 11 ω b under the same conditions this evidence indicates that the position of the seabed significantly influences the hydrodynamic responses of the sway motion the sway added mass coefficient a 11 ω reduces in the lower frequency range ω 2 b 2 g 1 2 and is constant in the frequency range ω 2 b 2 g 1 2 as water depth h decreases the profile of b 11 ω becomes flatter as h reduces fig 10 shows a comparison of heave sway added mass coefficient a 31 ω a and associated damping coefficient b 31 ω between numerical results derived by wu and eatock taylor 1990 and the current method it is observed that the water depth h plays a significant role in determining the values of these coupling hydrodynamic coefficients with both increasing in value with reducing water depth h fig 11 illustrates a comparison of sway heave added mass coefficient a 13 a and associated damping coefficient b 13 b for a flat seabed at depths h h 3 r and h 2 r froude number f r 0 064 with decreasing water depth h the added mass coefficient a 13 ω reduces slightly in the frequency range ω 2 b 2 g 1 2 but increase noticeably when ω 2 b 2 g 1 2 the absolute value of the damping coefficient b 13 ω increases significantly across the whole frequency range especially in shallow water depths for zero current and flat seabed the coupling hydrodynamic coefficients are of zero value because of the symmetric nature of the fluid domain and boundary conditions however the presence of current alters this symmetry and the presence of a seabed further enhances the asymmetry nature of the fluid domain resulting in an increased influence of a decreasing water depth on these coupled hydrodynamic coefficients in general with no current present the coupled hydrodynamic coefficients are approximately an order of magnitude smaller than the corresponding diagonal coefficients feng et al 2017 but as shown in this study the predicted values of these coupled hydrodynamic coefficients are of the same order of magnitude as the diagonal coefficients the combination of shallow water depth and current plays an important role in determining the values of these coupled coefficients fig 12 illustrates a comparison of heave added mass coefficient a 33 a and heave damping coefficient b 33 b for a flat seabed at depth h 2 r in addition to a sloping seabed with slope angle tan β 1 6 1 5 and 1 4 and average water depth h 2 r in a fluid flow defined by froude number f r 0 064 fig 13 illustrates a comparison of sway added mass coefficient a 11 a and sway damping coefficient b 11 b it is observed that the slope of the seabed significantly increases the heave added mass coefficient a 33 in the frequency range 0 3 ω 2 b 2 g 0 9 but has limited effect in the higher frequency range ω 0 9 the slope imposes only a limited effect on the heave damping coefficient b 33 the sway added mass coefficient a 11 reduces noticeably in magnitude in the frequency range ω 2 b 2 g 1 3 and is relatively constant in frequency range ω 2 b 2 g 1 3 as for the sway damping coefficient b 11 the peak value moves to a lower frequency as slope inclination increases 5 3 current influence on an oscillatory body in the presence of a sloping seabed numerical simulation were further performed to investigate the effect of current on a body experiencing forced heave or sway oscillatory motion in the presence of a sloping seabed fig 14 shows a comparison of heave added mass coefficient a 33 a and damping coefficient b 33 b at mean water depth h 2 r sloping seabed angle tan β 1 4 with froude number f r 0 0 f r 0 032 and f r 0 064 respectively the current speed has a noticeable influence on the heave added mass coefficient a 33 for frequency range ω 2 b 2 g 1 0 and a limited effect for frequency range ω 2 b 2 g 1 0 the heave damping coefficient b 33 reduces slightly as current speed increases across the frequency range adopting these seabed and current conditions fig 15 shows a comparison of sway added mass coefficient a 11 a and damping coefficient b 11 b for only the sloping seabed angle tan β 1 4 the current speed has a modest effect on the sway added mass coefficient a 11 and damping coefficient b 11 5 4 investigation of wave elevation using far field asymptotic behaviour of the radiation potential relationship newman 1962 derived a relationship between wave damping b i i and the radiated wave amplitude η in deep water condition without current in the form 45 1 2 b i i ω 2 z a 2 ρ g 2 η 2 2 ω to provide further validation of the proposed mathematical model an investigation of wave elevation was undertaken this was calculated using equation 45 and by direct free surface updating feng et al 2016 showed that the calculated wave damping demonstrated excellent agreement with the experimental data of vugts 1968 this is taken as the basis to validate the calculated data figs 16 and 17 show comparisons of wave elevation η calculated by the proposed method equation 45 and numerical results of isaacson and cheung 1993 the latter provides wave elevation data for upstream lhs η u and downstream rhs η d of a circular cylinder experiencing forced oscillatory heave fig 16 and sway fig 17 motions in deep water froude number f r 0 0 and f r 0 064 the present model shows good agreement with the numerical data of isaacson and cheung 1993 for these conditions it is observed that the proposed model shows excellent agreement with the data derived by equation 45 for both heave fig 16 and sway fig 17 motions this agreement further validates the accuracy of the proposed mathematical model it is noticed that newman 1962 derived equation 45 based on the assumptions of deep water and zero current based on the principle of energy conservation the mathematical analysis described in appendix a demonstrates that equation 45 is also valid for finite water depth and a flat seabed fig 18 illustrates a comparison of wave elevation η between predictions derived using equation 45 and a free surface updating technique incorporated into the proposed method for a circular cylinder experiencing oscillatory heave or sway motion at water depth h 3 r and froude number f r 0 0 the excellent agreement between these two sets of data further validates the proposed numerical model and also supplies numerical evidence for the validity of equation 45 in these investigated situations the presence of the current causes different wave elevations on the upstream and downstream sides of the body as shown in appendix the wave damping b i i is related to η u and η d through the expression 46 b i i ω 2 z a 2 ρ g 2 2 ω η u 2 η d 2 for both deep and finite water depths fig 19 shows comparisons of calculated wave elevation η on the upstream and downstream sides of the circular cylinder experiencing oscillatory heave motion at water depth h h 4 r and h 3 r respectively froude number f r 0 064 it is observed that η increases on both the upstream and downstream sides with decreasing water depth h the maximum discrepancy between the lhs and rhs of equation 46 is approximately 5 for all the water depth conditions examined across the frequency range this discrepancy is accounted for by numerical approximation and therefore the accuracy of the proposed model is reasonably validated when the current influence is included in the analysis a comparison of figs 16 and 19 reveals that the presence of the seabed significantly increases the wave elevations η u and η d as well as η its presence increases the radiated wave energy and therefore increases the radiated wave amplitude the current influences the differences in wave elevation values between upstream side η u and downstream side η d but has no effect on the radiated wave energy the slope of the seabed causes larger differences in the predicted values of η u and η d compared with a flat seabed because of changes in water depth on either side of the cylinder the wave elevation η increases in the shallower water depth but decreases in the deeper water fig 12 b shows that seabed slope has only very limited influence on the predicted damping coefficient and therefore only a marginal effect on the radiated wave energy present numerical results show that these differences are of order 5 10 between the lhs and rhs of equation 46 and this can be accounted for by possible numerical error wave shoaling and wave reflection on the sloping part of the seabed bottom for a typical offshore structure of breadth 40 m in a current u 1 3 m s or froude number f r 0 064 corresponding to a moderate to maximum value in most real ocean environments the presented analysis and results can provide valuable insights to the offshore industry for offshore structures moving in a transit condition their forward speeds are usually larger than this value but high speeds generate flow separation and the potential flow model becomes invalid for this condition as discussed by zhao and faltinsen 1988 isaacson and cheung 1993 zhao and faltinsen 1988 pointed out that the potential model produces valid results when current speed is less than 2 m s in this study the froude number f r is defined using the velocity u 1 see fig 2 which is smaller than u 2 and u 3 in the seabed slope region and beyond according to the principle of mass conservation as f r increases the current influence increases and the validity of the proposed mathematical model decreases for this reason in order to guarantee validity of the potential flow model f r 0 064 is the maximum froude number investigated in the present study furthermore provided flow separation does not occur around the body caused by abrupt changes to the geometry of the body ie sharp corners etc there are no limitations theoretical or numerically on the application of the proposed linear potential model to evaluate the behaviour of a floating structure in a shallow water environment with arbitrary seabed profile 6 conclusions two dimensional linear wave current seabed structure interaction problems are investigated by combining two boundary integral equations the first defines the steady potential problem and is constructed by satisfying the neumann boundary conditions whereas the second deals with the unsteady potential problem and is formulated as a mixed neumann dirichlet boundary condition the steady potential describes a fixed body in a steady current in the presence of a seabed environment the free surface boundary conditions are modified to include the current effect and the resulting wave current seabed structure interaction problem is solved as an unsteady problem continuous rankine source panel distributions are adopted to discretize the free body and seabed surfaces and the rankine source integral is determined analytically instead of using a numerical approximation the establishment of a boundary integral equation allows evaluation of the partial derivative of the unsteady potential on the free surface and this reduces numerical errors the developed mathematical model and associated numerical scheme of study are validated through a wide range of numerical predictions associated with a circular cylinder which compare favourably with the findings from other studies these results emphasize the importance of water depth seabed slope and current speed on the hydrodynamic responses of a floating body experiencing forced heave or sway oscillatory motion each impacts in different ways on the hydrodynamic characteristics associated with the body and hence on its hydrodynamic responses at different frequencies of oscillation for example with the reduction of water depth h the heave added mass coefficient a 33 decreases in the lower frequency range and increases in the higher frequency range whereas the damping coefficient b 33 increases significantly across the frequency range the sway added mass coefficient a 11 reduces in the higher frequency range and the shape of the sway damping coefficient b 11 curve becomes flatter as frequency increases the absolute values of the cross coupling coefficients a 31 b 31 a 13 and b 13 increase significantly in the higher frequency range when water depth h reduces the values of these coupling coefficients are almost of the same order of magnitude as the diagonal coefficients due to the coupled interaction effects of both seabed and current the slope of the seabed reduces the heave added mass coefficient a 33 in the lower frequency range significantly but it has only a limited effect in the higher frequency range as well as across the frequency range of b 33 the sway added mass coefficient a 11 reduces significantly in the lower frequency range but remains constant at higher frequencies whereas the peak value of the sway damping coefficient b 11 shifts towards higher frequencies as slope angle β increases the current in combination with a sloping seabed impose a noticeable influence on the heave added mass coefficient a 33 in the lower frequency range but only a very limited effect on the heave damping coefficient b 33 sway added mass coefficient a 11 and sway damping coefficient b 11 both seabed and current provide a significant effect on the wave elevation the presence of a seabed increases the radiated wave amplitude and wave energy and the current magnifies the differences between upstream η u and downstream η d wave elevations but has little effect on the radiated wave energy the numerical results confirm the newman relationship ie equation 45 between wave damping and generated wave amplitude in the deep water condition in the absence of current furthermore numerical simulations and mathematical derivation show that the expanded relationship ie equation 46 is also valid for finite water depth with or without current included the relationship can therefore be applied to check the numerical accuracy of solutions for this kind of problem the problem of a floating structure experiencing both wave and current is equivalent to the body moving with forward speed in waves by formulating the problem in terms of a reference frame moving with the same speed as the current however in a sloping seabed environment these two problems are not equivalent as the relative position of the body within the fluid domain continuously changes when body moves with forward speed appendix a relation between wave damping b i i and amplitude of radiated wave the analysis presented in this appendix validate the relationship between wave damping b i i and the amplitude of the radiated wave in deep and finite water depths with current excluded and included for the body experiencing forced oscillatory motion z z a sin ω t the equation describing the body motion is expressed as a 1 m i i z t b i i z t c i i z t f i i t here m i i denotes the body mass composed of the body mass m i i and added mass a i i b i i denotes the wave damping and c i i represents hydrostatic coefficient the acceleration velocity and displacement of the body are expressed by terms z t z t and z t respectively f i i t is the external force imposed on the body to maintain forced oscillatory motion here e w a v e i n e i n e r t i a l e d a m p i n g and e s p r i n g are introduced to denote the total energy energy generated by inertial force m i i z t damping force b i i z t and spring force c i i z t respectively and therefore a 2 e w a v e i n e i n e r t i a l e d a m p i n g e s p r i n g for the energy generated per unit of time during one period of oscillation t 0 we have a 3 e i n e r t i a l 1 t 0 0 t 0 m i

7 η η a sin ω t ε here η a is the wave amplitude and ε denotes a phase difference in the deep water case the body is assumed symmetric about z axis and therefore the generated waves in the upstream and downstream directions are symmetric the wave energy e w a v e o u t transported outward by the radiated wave is a 8 e w a v e o u t 2 1 t 0 1 2 ρ g η a 2 c g t 0 ρ g 2 η a 2 2 ω with wave group velocity c g g 2 ω when steady state occurs in the fluid domain the total energy e w a v e i n input by the body oscillatory motion equals the energy transported outward by the generated wave from the viewpoint of energy conservation so a 9 e w a v e i n e w a v e o u t this gives immediately a 10 b i i ω 3 z a 2 ρ g 2 η a 2 equation a 10 is exactly the same as equation 45 derived based on far field asymptotic behaviour of the radiation potential relationship as discussed by newman 1962 for finite water depth over a flat seabed the body is assumed symmetric about the z axis and therefore the generated waves on the upstream and downstream are symmetric newman 1977 pp 260 264 states that the wave energy e w a v e o u t can be expressed in a similar form to equation a 8 providing that a 11 ϕ n 0 0 on seabed s 0 this requirement is exactly the same as the seabed boundary condition presented in equation 5 therefore similarly to the deep water case equation a 10 holds true for finite water depth over a flat seabed however for finite water depth over a sloping seabed the radiated waves on the rhs and lhs are not symmetric with the sloping seabed producing wave shoaling and wave reflection as discussed by newman 1977 pp 265 266 and feng et al 2017 these make equation a 8 invalid and therefore the relationship a 10 is invalid in this situation when the current effect is included the current is a source of energy in the fluid domain on the lhs but extracts it from the rhs these two types of energy are denoted as e c i n and e c o u t which comprise both potential energy and kinematic energy figure a 20 schematically illustrates the energy flow in the wave current seabed body interaction problem investigated in present study let us consider an enclosed flow domain ω 0 as shown in figure a 20 according to energy conservation we have a 12 e w a v e i n e c i n e w a v e o u t e c o u t using the terminology defined in equation 44 current energy e c i n and e c o u t are expressed as a 13 e c i n 1 t 0 u 1 t 0 ρ 1 2 h d 2 g 1 2 u 1 t 0 ρ u 1 2 a 14 e c o u t 1 t 0 u 3 t 0 ρ 1 2 h d 2 g 1 2 u 3 t 0 ρ u 3 2 for deep water and finite water depth over a flat seabed we have d 0 and u 1 u 3 as defined in equation 44 therefore a 15 e c i n e c o u t this gives a 16 e w a v e i n e w a v e o u t both the upstream wave elevation η u and downstream wave elevation η d are of different values due to the effect of current similar to the case of no current the generated upstream and downstream waves are assumed harmonic in form so we have a 17 e w a v e

conclusion the relationship between hydrodynamic damping b i i and the radiated wave amplitude shown in equations a 10 and a 18 are valid for current excluded and included for both deep and finite water depths but are invalid when a sloping seabed is present

a sea environment with a flat or sloping seabed using linear boundary conditions this problem is separated into steady and unsteady potential components the former accounts for the current flowing over the seabed or fixed body whereas the latter describes the wave interaction with the current through modification of the free surface boundary conditions both steady and unsteady problems are solved using a boundary element model incorporating a continuous rankine source method the developed numerical model is validated by comparison with published data where possible and the investigation extended to examine the hydrodynamic responses of a forced oscillating body subject to the combined interactions arising from the wave current and seabed keywords wave current seabed structure interactions steady and unsteady flows continuous rankine source 1 introduction accurate predictions of the hydrodynamic loads acting on floating structures operating in near shore or coastal waters subjected to wave and current are of practical importance in offshore engineering in such situations the typical offshore structures used by industry include floating bridges floating wind turbines fpso and lng vessels during loading and unloading operations etc in the absence of current a wide range of water wave problems involving a flat seabed has been extensively studied for example kim 1969 described the importance of seabed on the hydrodynamic response of a floating body by extending the free surface green function method associated with deep water to finite water depth tuck 1966 1970 investigated this problem by dividing the computational domain into inner and outer domains and using asymptotic expansion theory matching relationships at the interface a similar numerical procedure was used by yeung 1973 who adopted a rankine source method to describe the fluid behaviour in the inner domain whereas in the outer domain region it is represented by a set of eigenfunctions bai 1977 applied a similar hybrid method focusing on the behaviour of the hydrodynamic coefficients at zero frequency and concluded that the zero frequency added mass coefficient has its minimum value at a critical water depth the analysis of water wave problems involving a sloping seabed or variable seabed topography requires a more complex numerical method the previously described numerical approaches are not directly applicable to changing bottom contours buchner 2006 de hauteclocque et al 2009 ferreira and newman 2009 introduced a second body to describe the influence of the sloping seabed profile these studies found that the body motion responses are significantly higher in the presence of a sloping seabed than in a constant water depth environment athanassoulis and belibassakis 1999 belibassakis and athanassoulis 2004 belibassakis 2008 adopted a coupled mode theory to divide the fluid domain into an interior domain of variable water depth and an exterior domain of constant depth they introduced an extra term referred to as the sloping bottom mode to correct the incident wave potential so that it satisfies the seabed condition on the slope the numerical predictions of belibassakis 2005 2008 show that the sloping seabed significantly changes the body motion responses in lower frequency range in the presence of current in deep water haskind 1944 grue and palm 1985 investigated wave radiation and diffraction problems for a two dimensional submerged circular cylinder in the frequency domain by developing a forward speed green function zhao and faltinsen 1988 combined the rankine source model in the near field and a multipole expansion in the far field to analyse frequency domain problems involving the coexistence of wave and current wu and eatock taylor 1990 developed a new mathematical formulation based on a forward speed dependent perturbation series allowing evaluation of the hydrodynamic force directly nossen et al 1991 derived a green function assuming a small forward speed in the form of a zero speed green function and its derivatives based on a rankine source model applicable to the whole fluid field isaacson and cheung 1993 separated the boundary integral problem into a steady current problem with a rigid wall condition applied at the still water surface and an unsteady wave problem with modified free surface boundary conditions accounting for the disturbed wave field caused by the current numerical results were evaluated to describe radiation and diffraction problems in the time domain with good agreements observed in comparisons with the frequency domain results of zhao and faltinsen 1988 the rankine source method combined with other numerical techniques provides a numerical procedure to analyse a variety of boundary condition problems cao et al 1991 koo and kim 2007 zhang et al 2010 kim and kim 2013 in a previous study feng et al 2016 2017 developed a continuous rankine source model to solve wave body interaction problems involving various seabed conditions all the fluid domain surfaces free body seabed are discretized by continuous panels and the rankine source integral calculated analytically on each source panel feng et al 2016 2017 concluded that mean water depth has a significant influence on hydrodynamic responses and the effects of sloping seabed vary largely for different hydrodynamic responses feng and bai 2016 found that the current has limited effect on global hydrodynamic responses in the wave radiation problem but significantly changes the local hydrodynamic responses and alters the pressure distribution around the body surface in the direction of the current this investigation further develops and combines the numerical models established by feng and bai 2016 feng et al 2017 to assess wave current interaction problems involving a flat or sloping seabed environment this is achieved by constructing two boundary element equations to describe the steady and unsteady contributions to the overall problem the steady problem equation describes the current passing a fixed body above a flat or sloping seabed the unsteady problem equation solves the water wave problem with free surface boundary conditions modified to include current effects within the chosen seabed environment these two boundary integral equations are formulated by adopting the continuous rankine source method together with application of linear steady and unsteady boundary conditions to minimize errors in the numerical scheme of study the rankine source integral is analytically calculated on the free body and seabed surfaces numerical tests for convergence of solution are applied to the steady problem and results from the developed method compared with findings from published data in a limited validation process the influences of current and seabed on the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave amplitudes are studied and discussed for a semi circular cylinder experiencing both forced heave and sway oscillatory motions 2 mathematical formulation of the problem the proposed mathematical model deals with linear wave current structure seabed interaction problems that is the body boundary condition is satisfied on the mean wetted body surface and the linearized free surface boundary condition applied on the calm water surface at each time step 2 1 fluid motion equations fig 1 illustrates a coordinate frame of reference o x z with origin o at the centre of a two dimensional body floating in a fluid domain of finite water depth the fluid domain ω is bounded by a free surface s f body surface s b seabed surface s 0 and an enclosing surface at infinity s an ideal fluid flow is assumed which is described by the velocity potential ϕ satisfying the laplace equation 1 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ z 2 0 in the fluid domain ω the total velocity potential ϕ x z t is subject to physical boundary conditions on the body surface s b free surface s f and seabed s 0 these boundary conditions are expressed respectively as 2 ϕ n b v b n b on s b 3 ϕ z η t ϕ x η x 0 on s f 4 ϕ t 1 2 δ ϕ 2 g η c on s f 5 ϕ n 0 0 on s 0 here n b and n 0 denote normal vector on the body and seabed surfaces respectively v b denotes the body motion velocity η and g represent the free surface elevation and gravitational acceleration respectively c is the bernoulli constant including current flow energy the boundary condition applicable to the potential ϕ on the far field boundary at infinity requires that the generated wave moves towards infinity and never reflects backward by dividing the velocity field into a steady velocity field caused by the steady incoming current and an unsteady velocity field combing the effects of wave and current within the seabed environment we express the total velocity potential ϕ as 6 ϕ x z t ϕ s x z ϕ u x z t where the subscripts s and u indicate the steady and unsteady velocity potential respectively 2 2 steady potential problem the steady potential ϕ s x z describes the influence of the body fixed in the steady current the current speed u x is a variable in the fluid domain in the vicinity of the sloping seabed but assumed constant in the regions of constant water depth in all the illustrative examples described herein it is assumed that both the current speed and its rate of change are small quantities allowing development of a linear mathematical model this allows the steady potential to be expressed as the superposition of the steady current u x and steady disturbance potential ϕ b due to the presence of body in the current that is 7 ϕ s u x x ϕ b for this steady potential problem the current flows horizontally with no vertical motion and the free surface is a current flow surface being similar to the calm water surface s f in the unsteady potential problem as discussed by isaacson and cheung 1991 1993 cheung et al 1996 this boundary condition is referred to as the rigid wall condition a mirror image technique was applied to transform the semi circular cylinder into a circular cylinder in an unbounded fluid domain by this treatment the fluid domain can be expressed by superposition of a current flow passing a dipole newman 1977 pp 153 154 allowing the determination of an analytical solution however this mirror image method is not readily applicable if a seabed environment is involved the steady potential ϕ b satisfies the laplace equation and its form determined by solving the steady potential boundary conditions on s b s f and s 0 that is 8 ϕ b n b u x n b on s b 9 ϕ b n f 0 on s f 10 ϕ b n 0 0 on s 0 where n f denotes a normal vector on the free surface the far field boundary condition for ϕ b requires the current moves towards infinity and does not reflect backward a similar numerical technique is applied to satisfy this boundary condition as adopted for the unsteady potential and this is discussed in section 3 5 2 3 unsteady potential problem the unsteady potential ϕ u x z t accounts for the time dependent fluid flow field arising from the coupled interaction effects of wave current and seabed topography for a floating body experiencing forced heave or sway oscillatory motion the position of this body is given by the displacement function 11 z 0 z a sin ω t or z z a sin ω t 0 at time t for vertical or horizontal motions where z a and ω denote motion amplitude and oscillatory frequency respectively the corresponding velocity is 12 v b 0 z a ω cos ω t or v b z a ω cos ω t 0 in this mathematical model it is assumed that the amplitude of body motion z a is small compared to the characteristic dimension of the body a moderate size wave amplitude excited and the water depth is not small compared to a typical wavelength these allows the linear kinematic and dynamic free surface boundary conditions including current to be expressed respectively as 13 ϕ u z η t η x ϕ s x η 2 ϕ s z 2 on s f z 0 14 ϕ u t g η ϕ u x ϕ s x on s f z 0 the effects of current are accounted for by inclusion of the terms on the right hand side rhs of equations 13 and 14 as the steady potential is independent of time it is only calculated once in the numerical simulation when the current velocity u 0 all the terms on the rhs of equations 13 and 14 vanish and reduce to the version of free surface boundary conditions in the absence of current the far field radiation condition requires that the disturbed waves vanish in the far field in the numerical simulation discussed herein the source points are distributed in an exponential manner over a large section of the free surface this mechanism allows the generated waves to move towards the far field with no wave reflected as described in section 3 5 the free surface boundary conditions equations 13 and 14 together with the body boundary condition equation 2 and seabed condition equation 5 produce a closed boundary value formulation to describe the unsteady problem the steady potential provides no contribution to the free surface elevation which is investigated in the unsteady potential problem from equations 13 and 14 it is seen that both steady ϕ s and unsteady potential ϕ u are required to evaluate the unsteady problem however the position of free surface in the steady potential problem remains unchanged in the unsteady potential problem 3 rankine source boundary integral equation in this paper the continuous rankine source method is applied in the boundary integral equation the fluid domain surfaces are discretized into continuous panels rather than isolated points the rankine source points coincide with the control points and therefore no desingularized technique is required 3 1 boundary integral equation by utilizing the gauss divergence theorem and the application of the dirichlet boundary value problem to the exterior domain of the fluid field lamb 1945 pp 59 60 expressed the velocity potential ϕ as a boundary integral of rankine sources continuously distributed on the fluid boundary s s b s f s 0 in the form 15 ϕ x t s b σ b ln x x d s x s f σ f ln x x d s x s 0 σ 0 ln x x d s x here we denote control point x x z located on the middle point of a continuous panel the source point x x z the body source strength σ b σ x t free surface source strength σ f σ x t seabed source strength σ 0 σ x t and variable of integration d s x it should be noted that physically the free surface s f is of infinite length and the integral of this infinite domain is not possible by numerical technique for this reason the computational domain is truncated in the numerical simulations and the far field boundary condition is satisfied on this truncated free surface in the present study the rankine source panels are distributed in an exponential manner allowing the covering of a very large area of free surface and numerical computations completed before the surface wave reaches the truncated boundary the interested reader can find detailed information of this rankine source panel distribution approach in a previous study by feng et al 2016 let the integral domain boundary surfaces s b s f and s 0 be discretized by n b n f and n 0 panels respectively such that s b i 1 n b s i b s f j 1 n f s j f and s 0 k 1 n 0 s k 0 therefore equation 15 is expressed in the form 16 ϕ x t i 1 n b σ i b s i b ln x x i d s x j 1 n f σ j f s j f ln x x j d s x k 1 n 0 σ k

the boundary conditions expressed in equations 8 10 the discretized form of the boundary integral equation for the steady problem becomes 17 ϕ b x i b n b i 1 n b σ i b n b i s i b ln x i b x i d s x

noticed that the free surface boundary condition is the solid wall condition as discussed by isaacson and cheung 1993 subscript f is adopted for simple annotation the neumann boundary condition is applicable for the steady problem and therefore there is no numerical divergence problem arising from the intersection point between free and body surfaces once σ b σ f and σ 0 are evaluated the velocity potential ϕ b can be calculated by equation 16 for any source panel on the fluid domain surfaces the values of velocity potential ϕ b only need calculating once at the initial time and then used at every following time step 3 3 numerical discretization for unsteady problem the body boundary condition described in equation 2 the free surface boundary conditions expressed in equations 13 and 14 and the seabed boundary condition of equation 5 allow equation 16 to be written as 20 ϕ u x i b t n b i 1 n b σ i b n b i s i b ln x i b x i d s x j 1 n f σ j f n b i s j f ln x i b x j d s x k

dirichlet boundary conditions the intersection points between free and body surfaces require special numerical treatment which is described in detail by feng et al 2015b the symbols n b n f and n 0 are again used to represent the total sum of panels in each domain but they are of different values for unsteady and steady problems the calculation of the rankine source ln r integral in the boundary integral equations takes a significant portion of the computational effort in this study to reduce numerical error the continuous rankine source panel integral replaces the isolated rankine source approximation the calculation for the boundary integral is grouped into the integral of l n r over a panel together with its partial derivative to illustrate this procedure by way of example let us take the first panel integral on the rhs of equation 16 which can be analytically expressed as 23 i 1 n b σ i b s i b ln x i b x i d s x i 1 n b σ i b l b i re x x i 1 n b i ln x x i 1 x x i n b i ln x x i where l b i is the length of panel i on body surface and n b i denotes the conjugation of n b i on this panel let us continue this process by taking the first integral on the rhs of equation 20 namely the second group integral involving the partial derivative of the integral of ln r this is formulated analytically as 24 i 1 n b σ i b n b i s i b ln x i b x i d s x i 1 n b σ i b re n b i n b i ln x i b x i 1 x i b x i this numerical procedure improves numerical accuracy as illustrated it is an analytical integration carried out over the whole panel and therefore in this paper we define this technique as using a continuous rankine source panel 3 4 calculation for ϕ u x and η x the free surface source panels are not evenly distributed over the surface domain as discussed in section 3 5 experience shows that large numerical errors are generated if ϕ u x and η x in equations 13 and 14 are calculated by finite difference formulae from boundary integral equation 16 ϕ u x can be expressed as 25 ϕ u x j f t x f i 1 n b σ i b x f j s i b ln x j f x i d s x j 1 n f σ j f x f j s j f ln x j f x j d s x k 1 n 0 σ k 0 x f j s k 0 ln x j f x k d s x the calculation of the partial derivative of the integral of l n r is undertaken in a similar manner to equation 24 here source strength σ i b σ j f and σ k 0 are of the same values as those for the unsteady problem presented in section 3 3 ϕ u x can be calculated by equation 25 once σ i b σ j f σ k 0 are obtained by omitting the high order terms on the rhs of equation 14 we have 26 ϕ u t g η 0 on s f therefore η x can be expressed as 27 η x ϕ u t g x ϕ u x g t by choosing an even time interval δ t in the numerical simulation we can calculate η x to a high degree of accuracy by finite difference formulae provided that ϕ u x is determined by equation 25 3 5 boundary panel distribution the fluid domain surface is composed of a body surface s b a free surface s f and a seabed surface s 0 the distributed panels coincide with their respective surface profiles and the source point on each panel is located at the same position as a control point therefore no desingularized distance is required in the present numerical scheme of study the free surface is divided into inner and outer domains in the inner domain 140 source panels are distributed in ever increasing distances between one another while 40 source panels are distributed in an exponentially increasing manner in the outer domain about two wavelength distance is covered by source panels in the inner domain and the outer domain ranges over a distance more than 100 wavelengths a detailed discussion of this source panel distribution approach is provided by feng et al 2015a starting from x 0 on the rhs of s f the horizontal distances between neighbouring free surface source points are expressed in the form 28 x j f x j 1 f l b α j ω 2 in the inner domain 29 x j f x j 1 f l b α j ω 2 1 05 j j 1 2 in the outer domain where l b denotes the length of the body surface panel covering the intersection point of the body and free surfaces the parameters α j define separation distances between source points and are determined according to the method discussed by feng et al 2014 the rankine source panels on the left hand side lhs and rhs of the body are mirrored in an arrangement around the z axis the outer domain provides a large covering of the free surface and therefore the incoming current and generated wave move toward the far field of this enlarged computational domain numerical simulations are ended before the wave and current reach the far field border and therefore no wave and current are reflected back to disturb the fluid domain as discussed by feng et al 2016 2017 this efficient numerical procedure allows satisfaction of the radiation condition without the need to introduce artificial damping into the mathematical model in the present study the sloping seabed z h x is described mathematically as 30 h x h d 2 x l 2 h x tan β l 2 x l 2 h d 2 x l 2 where h is the mean water depth and β denotes the angle of the sloping seabed and defined as 31 β arctan d l fig 2 illustrates the wave current body sloping seabed interaction under investigation here l denotes the length of the slope in the x direction and d the height of the slope in the z direction the seabed is divided into three regions h 1 h 2 x and h 3 the parameters h 1 and h 3 denote the constant water depths above the flat seabed on either side of the slope with variable water depth h 2 x the distribution of the source panels on the seabed is similar in principle to the approach adopted to describe the free surface that is we divide the region into inner and outer domains because the seabed is assumed of equivalent expanse to the free surface however because of the asymmetric nature of the sloping seabed a mirror image approach is no longer valid and the procedure needs adjustment a parameter γ 1 tan β is introduced to deal with this asymmetric characteristic starting from x 0 on the rhs of s 0 the horizontal distances between neighbouring seabed control source points x k 0 are expressed in the form 32 x k 0 x k 1 0 l b α k γ ω 2 in the inner domain 33 x k 0 x k 1 0 l b α k γ ω 2 1 05 k k 1 2 in the outer domain and on the lhs of s 0 34 x k 0 x k 1 0 γ l b α k ω 2 in the inner domain 35 x k 0 x k 1 0 γ l b α k ω 2 1 05 k k 1 2 in the outer domain the parameters α k define the separation distances between source points and their values are chosen in the same manner as those on the free surface the vertical positions of each control point x 0 are calculated by equation 30 once their horizontal positions are known it is noted that for a flat seabed the angle β 0 and therefore γ 1 the sloping seabed panel distribution method developed here is now similar to the one devised for a flat seabed and therefore can deal with both flat and sloping seabed profiles 3 6 hydrodynamic forces the determination of strengths σ i b σ j f and σ k 0 by means of the boundary integral equations for both steady and unsteady problems allows their respective velocity potentials ϕ x i b t on the body surface s b to be expressed in the form 36 ϕ x i b t i 1 n b σ i b s i b ln x i b x i d s x j 1 n f σ j f s j f ln x i b x j d s x k 1 n 0 σ k 0 s k 0 ln x i b x k d s x the dynamic pressure p p x i b t on the body surface is evaluated by the bernoulli equation written as 37 p x i b t ρ ϕ x i b t t 1 2 ϕ x i b t 2 bearing in mind that ϕ x i b t ϕ s x i b t ϕ u x i b t we express the first order dynamic pressure p p x i b t explicitly as 38 p x i b t ρ ϕ u x i b t t ϕ s x i b ϕ u x i b t ϕ u x i b t t ϕ s x i b x ϕ u x i b t x ϕ s x i b z ϕ u x i b t z with 39 ϕ s x i b x u x x u x x ϕ b x i b x and 40 ϕ s x i b z ϕ b x i b z the dynamic force f t applied to the body surface is calculated by integrating the dynamic pressure p x i b t over the body surface and is given by 41 f t s b p x i b t n b d s the adoption of fourier series allows the frequency domain added mass a i j ω i j 1 3 and damping coefficient b i j ω i j 1 3 to be written in the forms 42 a i j ω 2 z a ω 2 t 0 0 t 0 f i j t sin ω t d t 43 b i j ω 2 z a ω t 0 0 t 0 f i j t cos ω t d t where the period of the body motion is denoted by t 0 here i j refer to the ith and jth degrees of freedom of the body motion 4 numerical convergence test for steady problem the steady problem relates to the interaction of a fixed body in a steady current confined within the seabed environment and free surface as shown in fig 2 the presence of the sloping seabed causes changes to the current speed above it this study assumes that no current reflects from the sloping seabed as discussed in section 2 2 for simplicity it is assumed that current speeds u 1 and u 3 are constant on the lhs x l 2 and the rhs x l 2 of the slope whereas u 2 x is variable in this sloping region l 2 x l 2 by the principle of mass conservation it follows that 44 u 1 h d 2 u 2 x h x tan β u 3 h d 2 in the following numerical simulation the froude number f r is defined as f r u 1 g r to denote the current speed numerical simulations are performed for a semi circular cylinder with radius r to draft t ratio r t 1 and surface area a 1 2 π r 2 this cylinder is located in an uniform current u over a flat seabed at water depth h 2 r for a semi circular cylinder body located in an uniform current u in deep water analytical results are readily available by considering this problem as current flow passing a dipole as discussed by newman 1977 pp 153 154 if a flat seabed is introduced at constant depth this problem can be solved by mirror image technique that is another dipole is introduced having the same dipole strength placed below the seabed creating a symmetric two dipole system about the seabed floor as shown in fig 3 through this means analytical results are obtained by superposition of these two dipoles fig 4 shows comparisons of ϕ x a and ϕ z b between analytical and numerical results for a fixed semi circular cylinder the body shape is described by body panel number n b 240 n b 120 and n b 60 respectively above a flat seabed at depth h 2 r in a fluid flow f r 0 064 for the case n b 240 the differences between analytical and numerical results are small for both ϕ x and ϕ z this agreement is further improved by increasing the value of n b but with increasing computer effort n b 240 is applied for both steady and unsteady problems through the present study it is noticed that to validate the developed mathematical model for the steady problem and to compare numerical and analytical results in the flat seabed case it is assumed that the current speed u 1 u 2 u 3 neglecting small changes to the current speed due to the presence of the body to further demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model numerical simulations are performed for this semi circular cylinder in a combined environment of uniform current froude number f r 0 064 over a flat seabed and sloping seabed in this numerical simulation the current speed is variable due to the presence of both cylinder and sloping seabed fig 5 shows comparisons of ϕ x a and ϕ z b for the semi circular cylinder over a flat seabed sloping seabed with sloping angles tan β 1 20 1 10 and 1 5 respectively at depth h 2 r it can be seen that as the sloping angle β decreases the values of ϕ x and ϕ z for the sloping seabed converge to values associated with the flat seabed it is observed that the value of ϕ z displays two peaks angle 0 8 and 2 3 which are not symmetrical due to a larger current speed existing on the rhs angle 0 8 than the lhs angle 2 3 of the circular cylinder 5 numerical results and discussion section 4 demonstrated the convergence of the numerical simulations and the accuracy of the proposed boundary integral equation method for the steady problem this forms the basis of the solution of the unsteady problem the superposition of steady and unsteady problems models the interactions between the wave current seabed structure investigated in this study all the numerical simulations are performed in the time domain and the results are transformed into the frequency domain for the purpose of direct comparisons 5 1 forced oscillatory motion of body in the presence of current or seabed effect to provide a measure of validity of the developed mathematical model numerical simulations of a semi circular cylinder experiencing forced harmonic heave or sway motion of amplitude z a 0 1 r were compared with numerical predictions determined by other investigators for example fig 6 illustrates the numerical results of heave added mass coefficient a 33 a and heave damping coefficient b 33 b these were derived by zhao and faltinsen 1988 for h f r 0 064 and by bai 1977 for a flat seabed with h 2 r f r 0 0 fig 7 shows the numerical results of sway added mass coefficient a 11 a and sway damping coefficient b 11 b these were determined by zhao and faltinsen 1988 for h f r 0 064 and anderson and he 1985 for a flat seabed with h 2 r f r 0 0 the numerical agreement between the different mathematical models provides confidence in the developed numerical scheme of study 5 2 the influence of seabed in the wave current structure problem to investigate the combined influence of the seabed and current we assume a uniform current speed u or f r 0 064 unless otherwise stated the seabed is flat positioned at depths h h 3 r h 2 r and the cylinder undergoes heave or sway oscillatory motion it is observed from the predictions that seabed depth has a significant influence on the heave and sway hydrodynamic characteristics for example fig 8 shows a comparison of the calculated heave added mass coefficient a 33 ω a and heave damping coefficient b 33 ω b the values of a 33 ω reduce in the lower frequency range whereas they increase in the higher frequency range with decreasing depth of seabed for b 33 ω the values increase noticeably across the frequency range as h decreases in magnitude fig 9 illustrates a comparison of sway added mass coefficient a 11 ω a and sway damping coefficient b 11 ω b under the same conditions this evidence indicates that the position of the seabed significantly influences the hydrodynamic responses of the sway motion the sway added mass coefficient a 11 ω reduces in the lower frequency range ω 2 b 2 g 1 2 and is constant in the frequency range ω 2 b 2 g 1 2 as water depth h decreases the profile of b 11 ω becomes flatter as h reduces fig 10 shows a comparison of heave sway added mass coefficient a 31 ω a and associated damping coefficient b 31 ω between numerical results derived by wu and eatock taylor 1990 and the current method it is observed that the water depth h plays a significant role in determining the values of these coupling hydrodynamic coefficients with both increasing in value with reducing water depth h fig 11 illustrates a comparison of sway heave added mass coefficient a 13 a and associated damping coefficient b 13 b for a flat seabed at depths h h 3 r and h 2 r froude number f r 0 064 with decreasing water depth h the added mass coefficient a 13 ω reduces slightly in the frequency range ω 2 b 2 g 1 2 but increase noticeably when ω 2 b 2 g 1 2 the absolute value of the damping coefficient b 13 ω increases significantly across the whole frequency range especially in shallow water depths for zero current and flat seabed the coupling hydrodynamic coefficients are of zero value because of the symmetric nature of the fluid domain and boundary conditions however the presence of current alters this symmetry and the presence of a seabed further enhances the asymmetry nature of the fluid domain resulting in an increased influence of a decreasing water depth on these coupled hydrodynamic coefficients in general with no current present the coupled hydrodynamic coefficients are approximately an order of magnitude smaller than the corresponding diagonal coefficients feng et al 2017 but as shown in this study the predicted values of these coupled hydrodynamic coefficients are of the same order of magnitude as the diagonal coefficients the combination of shallow water depth and current plays an important role in determining the values of these coupled coefficients fig 12 illustrates a comparison of heave added mass coefficient a 33 a and heave damping coefficient b 33 b for a flat seabed at depth h 2 r in addition to a sloping seabed with slope angle tan β 1 6 1 5 and 1 4 and average water depth h 2 r in a fluid flow defined by froude number f r 0 064 fig 13 illustrates a comparison of sway added mass coefficient a 11 a and sway damping coefficient b 11 b it is observed that the slope of the seabed significantly increases the heave added mass coefficient a 33 in the frequency range 0 3 ω 2 b 2 g 0 9 but has limited effect in the higher frequency range ω 0 9 the slope imposes only a limited effect on the heave damping coefficient b 33 the sway added mass coefficient a 11 reduces noticeably in magnitude in the frequency range ω 2 b 2 g 1 3 and is relatively constant in frequency range ω 2 b 2 g 1 3 as for the sway damping coefficient b 11 the peak value moves to a lower frequency as slope inclination increases 5 3 current influence on an oscillatory body in the presence of a sloping seabed numerical simulation were further performed to investigate the effect of current on a body experiencing forced heave or sway oscillatory motion in the presence of a sloping seabed fig 14 shows a comparison of heave added mass coefficient a 33 a and damping coefficient b 33 b at mean water depth h 2 r sloping seabed angle tan β 1 4 with froude number f r 0 0 f r 0 032 and f r 0 064 respectively the current speed has a noticeable influence on the heave added mass coefficient a 33 for frequency range ω 2 b 2 g 1 0 and a limited effect for frequency range ω 2 b 2 g 1 0 the heave damping coefficient b 33 reduces slightly as current speed increases across the frequency range adopting these seabed and current conditions fig 15 shows a comparison of sway added mass coefficient a 11 a and damping coefficient b 11 b for only the sloping seabed angle tan β 1 4 the current speed has a modest effect on the sway added mass coefficient a 11 and damping coefficient b 11 5 4 investigation of wave elevation using far field asymptotic behaviour of the radiation potential relationship newman 1962 derived a relationship between wave damping b i i and the radiated wave amplitude η in deep water condition without current in the form 45 1 2 b i i ω 2 z a 2 ρ g 2 η 2 2 ω to provide further validation of the proposed mathematical model an investigation of wave elevation was undertaken this was calculated using equation 45 and by direct free surface updating feng et al 2016 showed that the calculated wave damping demonstrated excellent agreement with the experimental data of vugts 1968 this is taken as the basis to validate the calculated data figs 16 and 17 show comparisons of wave elevation η calculated by the proposed method equation 45 and numerical results of isaacson and cheung 1993 the latter provides wave elevation data for upstream lhs η u and downstream rhs η d of a circular cylinder experiencing forced oscillatory heave fig 16 and sway fig 17 motions in deep water froude number f r 0 0 and f r 0 064 the present model shows good agreement with the numerical data of isaacson and cheung 1993 for these conditions it is observed that the proposed model shows excellent agreement with the data derived by equation 45 for both heave fig 16 and sway fig 17 motions this agreement further validates the accuracy of the proposed mathematical model it is noticed that newman 1962 derived equation 45 based on the assumptions of deep water and zero current based on the principle of energy conservation the mathematical analysis described in appendix a demonstrates that equation 45 is also valid for finite water depth and a flat seabed fig 18 illustrates a comparison of wave elevation η between predictions derived using equation 45 and a free surface updating technique incorporated into the proposed method for a circular cylinder experiencing oscillatory heave or sway motion at water depth h 3 r and froude number f r 0 0 the excellent agreement between these two sets of data further validates the proposed numerical model and also supplies numerical evidence for the validity of equation 45 in these investigated situations the presence of the current causes different wave elevations on the upstream and downstream sides of the body as shown in appendix the wave damping b i i is related to η u and η d through the expression 46 b i i ω 2 z a 2 ρ g 2 2 ω η u 2 η d 2 for both deep and finite water depths fig 19 shows comparisons of calculated wave elevation η on the upstream and downstream sides of the circular cylinder experiencing oscillatory heave motion at water depth h h 4 r and h 3 r respectively froude number f r 0 064 it is observed that η increases on both the upstream and downstream sides with decreasing water depth h the maximum discrepancy between the lhs and rhs of equation 46 is approximately 5 for all the water depth conditions examined across the frequency range this discrepancy is accounted for by numerical approximation and therefore the accuracy of the proposed model is reasonably validated when the current influence is included in the analysis a comparison of figs 16 and 19 reveals that the presence of the seabed significantly increases the wave elevations η u and η d as well as η its presence increases the radiated wave energy and therefore increases the radiated wave amplitude the current influences the differences in wave elevation values between upstream side η u and downstream side η d but has no effect on the radiated wave energy the slope of the seabed causes larger differences in the predicted values of η u and η d compared with a flat seabed because of changes in water depth on either side of the cylinder the wave elevation η increases in the shallower water depth but decreases in the deeper water fig 12 b shows that seabed slope has only very limited influence on the predicted damping coefficient and therefore only a marginal effect on the radiated wave energy present numerical results show that these differences are of order 5 10 between the lhs and rhs of equation 46 and this can be accounted for by possible numerical error wave shoaling and wave reflection on the sloping part of the seabed bottom for a typical offshore structure of breadth 40 m in a current u 1 3 m s or froude number f r 0 064 corresponding to a moderate to maximum value in most real ocean environments the presented analysis and results can provide valuable insights to the offshore industry for offshore structures moving in a transit condition their forward speeds are usually larger than this value but high speeds generate flow separation and the potential flow model becomes invalid for this condition as discussed by zhao and faltinsen 1988 isaacson and cheung 1993 zhao and faltinsen 1988 pointed out that the potential model produces valid results when current speed is less than 2 m s in this study the froude number f r is defined using the velocity u 1 see fig 2 which is smaller than u 2 and u 3 in the seabed slope region and beyond according to the principle of mass conservation as f r increases the current influence increases and the validity of the proposed mathematical model decreases for this reason in order to guarantee validity of the potential flow model f r 0 064 is the maximum froude number investigated in the present study furthermore provided flow separation does not occur around the body caused by abrupt changes to the geometry of the body ie sharp corners etc there are no limitations theoretical or numerically on the application of the proposed linear potential model to evaluate the behaviour of a floating structure in a shallow water environment with arbitrary seabed profile 6 conclusions two dimensional linear wave current seabed structure interaction problems are investigated by combining two boundary integral equations the first defines the steady potential problem and is constructed by satisfying the neumann boundary conditions whereas the second deals with the unsteady potential problem and is formulated as a mixed neumann dirichlet boundary condition the steady potential describes a fixed body in a steady current in the presence of a seabed environment the free surface boundary conditions are modified to include the current effect and the resulting wave current seabed structure interaction problem is solved as an unsteady problem continuous rankine source panel distributions are adopted to discretize the free body and seabed surfaces and the rankine source integral is determined analytically instead of using a numerical approximation the establishment of a boundary integral equation allows evaluation of the partial derivative of the unsteady potential on the free surface and this reduces numerical errors the developed mathematical model and associated numerical scheme of study are validated through a wide range of numerical predictions associated with a circular cylinder which compare favourably with the findings from other studies these results emphasize the importance of water depth seabed slope and current speed on the hydrodynamic responses of a floating body experiencing forced heave or sway oscillatory motion each impacts in different ways on the hydrodynamic characteristics associated with the body and hence on its hydrodynamic responses at different frequencies of oscillation for example with the reduction of water depth h the heave added mass coefficient a 33 decreases in the lower frequency range and increases in the higher frequency range whereas the damping coefficient b 33 increases significantly across the frequency range the sway added mass coefficient a 11 reduces in the higher frequency range and the shape of the sway damping coefficient b 11 curve becomes flatter as frequency increases the absolute values of the cross coupling coefficients a 31 b 31 a 13 and b 13 increase significantly in the higher frequency range when water depth h reduces the values of these coupling coefficients are almost of the same order of magnitude as the diagonal coefficients due to the coupled interaction effects of both seabed and current the slope of the seabed reduces the heave added mass coefficient a 33 in the lower frequency range significantly but it has only a limited effect in the higher frequency range as well as across the frequency range of b 33 the sway added mass coefficient a 11 reduces significantly in the lower frequency range but remains constant at higher frequencies whereas the peak value of the sway damping coefficient b 11 shifts towards higher frequencies as slope angle β increases the current in combination with a sloping seabed impose a noticeable influence on the heave added mass coefficient a 33 in the lower frequency range but only a very limited effect on the heave damping coefficient b 33 sway added mass coefficient a 11 and sway damping coefficient b 11 both seabed and current provide a significant effect on the wave elevation the presence of a seabed increases the radiated wave amplitude and wave energy and the current magnifies the differences between upstream η u and downstream η d wave elevations but has little effect on the radiated wave energy the numerical results confirm the newman relationship ie equation 45 between wave damping and generated wave amplitude in the deep water condition in the absence of current furthermore numerical simulations and mathematical derivation show that the expanded relationship ie equation 46 is also valid for finite water depth with or without current included the relationship can therefore be applied to check the numerical accuracy of solutions for this kind of problem the problem of a floating structure experiencing both wave and current is equivalent to the body moving with forward speed in waves by formulating the problem in terms of a reference frame moving with the same speed as the current however in a sloping seabed environment these two problems are not equivalent as the relative position of the body within the fluid domain continuously changes when body moves with forward speed appendix a relation between wave damping b i i and amplitude of radiated wave the analysis presented in this appendix validate the relationship between wave damping b i i and the amplitude of the radiated wave in deep and finite water depths with current excluded and included for the body experiencing forced oscillatory motion z z a sin ω t the equation describing the body motion is expressed as a 1 m i i z t b i i z t c i i z t f i i t here m i i denotes the body mass composed of the body mass m i i and added mass a i i b i i denotes the wave damping and c i i represents hydrostatic coefficient the acceleration velocity and displacement of the body are expressed by terms z t z t and z t respectively f i i t is the external force imposed on the body to maintain forced oscillatory motion here e w a v e i n e i n e r t i a l e d a m p i n g and e s p r i n g are introduced to denote the total energy energy generated by inertial force m i i z t damping force b i i z t and spring force c i i z t respectively and therefore a 2 e w a v e i n e i n e r t i a l e d a m p i n g e s p r i n g for the energy generated per unit of time during one period of oscillation t 0 we have a 3 e i n e r t i a l 1 t 0 0 t 0 m i

2 t 0 0 t 0 cos 2 ω t d t z a 2 c i i ω t 0 0 t 0 sin ω t cos ω t d t 1 2 b i i ω 2 z a 2 for both deep and finite water depths the radiated wave η generated by the oscillatory body is described as a 7 η η a sin ω t ε here η a is the wave amplitude and ε denotes a phase difference in the deep water case the body is assumed symmetric about z axis and therefore the generated waves in the upstream and downstream directions are symmetric the wave energy e w a v e o u t transported outward by the radiated wave is a 8 e w a v e o u t 2 1 t 0 1 2 ρ g η a 2 c g t 0 ρ g 2 η a 2 2 ω with wave group velocity c g g 2 ω when steady state occurs in the fluid domain the total energy e w a v e i n input by the body oscillatory motion equals the energy transported outward by the generated wave from the viewpoint of energy conservation so a 9 e w a v e i n e w a v e o u t this gives immediately a 10 b i i ω 3 z a 2 ρ g 2 η a 2 equation a 10 is exactly the same as equation 45 derived based on far field asymptotic behaviour of the radiation potential relationship as discussed by newman 1962 for finite water depth over a flat seabed the body is assumed symmetric about the z axis and therefore the generated waves on the upstream and downstream are symmetric newman 1977 pp 260 264 states that the wave energy e w a v e o u t can be expressed in a similar form to equation a 8 providing that a 11 ϕ n 0 0 on seabed s 0 this requirement is exactly the same as the seabed boundary condition presented in equation 5 therefore similarly to the deep water case equation a 10 holds true for finite water depth over a flat seabed however for finite water depth over a sloping seabed the radiated waves on the rhs and lhs are not symmetric with the sloping seabed producing wave shoaling and wave reflection as discussed by newman 1977 pp 265 266 and feng et al 2017 these make equation a 8 invalid and therefore the relationship a 10 is invalid in this situation when the current effect is included the current is a source of energy in the fluid domain on the lhs but extracts it from the rhs these two types of energy are denoted as e c i n and e c o u t which comprise both potential energy and kinematic energy figure a 20 schematically illustrates the energy flow in the wave current seabed body interaction problem investigated in present study let us consider an enclosed flow domain ω 0 as shown in figure a 20 according to energy conservation we have a 12 e w a v e i n e c i n e w a v e o u t e c o u t using the terminology defined in equation 44 current energy e c i n and e c o u t are expressed as a 13 e c i n 1 t 0 u 1 t 0 ρ 1 2 h d 2 g 1 2 u 1 t 0 ρ u 1 2 a 14 e c o u t 1 t 0 u 3 t 0 ρ 1 2 h d 2 g 1 2 u 3 t 0 ρ u 3 2 for deep water and finite water depth over a flat

23021,ocean tides have been reported to be significantly damped by sea ice due to the fact that the bottom of sea ice is rough and able to dissipate tidal energy to examine this damping effect of sea ice on the astronomical tides in the bohai sea where sea ice is common in winter this study has developed a three dimensional ice ocean coupled model with and without sea ice to investigate potential changes in astronomical tides based on the finite volume community ocean model fvcom this newly developed model was first evaluated against field observations and remote sensing images including water elevations and sea ice cover and showed good agreement between the modelling results and the observed data in using the air forcing data 2009 2010 and the default sea ice drag coefficient of 0 0075 the model results show that in the presence of sea ice the major tidal constituent m2 is reduced by 1 cm at the top of the three bays from north to south liaodong bay bohai bay and laizhou bay in the bohai sea but the tidal phase is almost not affected a sensitivity run shows that the amplitude of m2 is decreased by 2 cm when increasing the drag coefficient from 0 005 to 0 01 moreover two extreme combinations of air temperatures and winds are simulated according to the standard deviation of wind speed and temperature over the past ten years and the damping effects of sea ice on tides are almost negligible as well based on the water mass analysis it is found that both the decreases of average volumetric flow rate for inflow and outflow due to ice through the three bays are relatively small compared to the average volumetric flow rate without ice the convergence of the cross sectional area increases the tidal amplitude of m2 which compensates the damping effect caused by sea ice keywords sea ice drag convergence fvcom tidal damping momentum balance 1 introduction the bohai sea is a semienclosed sea with three sides surrounded by land and one side open to the yellow sea fig 1 the bohai sea is located in the mid latitude monsoon climate zone in the northern hemisphere and is affected by strong cold waves which produce sea ice in the bohai sea in winter zhang et al 2016 2018 in general the sea ice in the bohai sea first appears in liaodong bay then advances south along the coastal water to cover part of bohai bay and subsequently the laizhou bay zhang et al 2015 in winter the ice in the bohai sea is mainly distributed in those three bays and the closer it is to the coasts the greater the probability of its occurrence zhang et al 2016 it is well known that sea ice insulates the ocean from the atmosphere and alters air sea heat and momentum exchanges however it is less known that sea ice is able to damp tides which is an important driving force especially affecting the tides of the three bays mentioned above and plays a critical role in sediment transport and pollutant dispersion wang et al 2013 xiong et al 2017 2018 it is also well known that the amplitude of the m2 tide in the bohai sea can be reduced by the bottom frictional stress guo and yanagi 1998 zhao et al 1994 however tidal damping due to sea ice in the bohai sea which is not well documented and understood is the focus of the present study a number of studies reported that sea ice is able to damp tidal ranges kagan and timofeev 2006 2007 kagan and sofina 2010 georgas 2012 parker 2014 sea ice is considered to be the main cause of seasonal variation in the harmonic constants of the arctic ocean tides kagan and sofina 2010 the results of seasonal variations of tidal harmonic constants were mostly derived from measured tidal data at several selected stations kagan and sofina 2010 luneva et al 2015 wunsch 2016 farhadzadeh 2017 according to the analysis of tidal elevations recorded from estuaries rivers and oceans the effect of ice on the tidal level varies for example the tidal amplitude can be reduced by ice from winter to summer several times in the estuaries of pyia while little impact was found in the canadian arctic except for in the southern beaufort sea georgas 2012 kagan and sofina 2010 on the other hand the influence of ice on the spatial variation of tidal level was mostly evaluated by numerical simulations such as the water body of the arctic ocean kagan and timofeev 2006 2007 according to tidal harmonic analysis of the arctic ocean in winter and summer seasonal variations of the tidal harmonic constants amplitude and phase in the middle and canadian parts of the arctic ocean can be ignored while the amplitude variation in the siberia continental shelf is 5 cm and the seasonal variation of the phase is 15 to several tens of degree kagan and sofina 2010 in general tidal seasonal changes caused by sea ice were mainly observed from measured data of marine observation gauge stations godin and barber 1980 godin 1986 however the available data are very limited and lacking especially the spatial variation of the harmonic constants of tides in the bohai sea caused by ice therefore the purpose of this study is to examine the impacts of sea ice on the tides in the bohai sea using a three dimensional ice ocean coupled model on the basis of the model validation the spatial changes of the tidal amplitude and phase in the three bays of the bohai sea with ice are discussed the main contents of this paper are as follows section 2 describes the numerical simulation method section 3 is the model validation including the validations of tides and sea ice section 4 presents the results of the amplitude and phase of the main tides with and without ice cover section 5 discusses the influences of different ice drag coefficients temperature and wind speed on tides section 6 further analyzes the mechanism of tidal level damping due to ice the conclusion is summarized in the last section 2 numerical model the model used in this paper is a three dimensional free surface ocean model based on an unstructured grid and finite volume algorithm which included the momentum equations continuity equation sst salinity and density equation it was developed and improved by chen et al 2003 2 1 the model mesh and parameters in fvcom model the horizontal computing domain is discretized in the horizontal direction using unstructured triangular meshes and the vertical sigma coordinate is used to transform the irregular bottom terrain chen et al 2003 therefore the model mesh of bohai sea established in this paper is not a fixed grid scale it varies with space as shown in fig 2 the total numbers of node and element of the horizontal grids in the bohai model are 12554 and 24398 respectively in terms of longitude and latitude the minimum grid size is 0 009 0 80 km while its maximum value is about 0 055 6 10 km the vertical coordinates are divided into 10 layers so that the surface layer has a larger resolution the finite volume algorithm can be used for local encryption of any concerned region being more convenient to fit complex boundaries and save calculation time its grid resolution depends on three factors the region of interest the geometry of the shoreline and the available depth data the three bays of the bohai sea are ice evolution areas in winter which are the areas of interest and the geometric shoreline is complex so more detailed mesh is needed to describe it according to the resolution of the measured water depth in each bay the final mesh resolution is different fig 2 fvcom uses a numerical discretization method similar to princeton ocean model pom mode which separates two dimensional external model from three dimensional internal model chen et al 2003 it uses a shorter time step in barotropic equation and a longer time step in baroclinic equation the time step of the external mode δ t e should follow courant friedrichs lewy cfl as shown below chen et al 2013 1 δ t e δ l g d where δ l is he shortest edge length of a triangular mesh element g is the acceleration of gravity and d is the largest water depth in the computational domain the time step of internal mode δ t i is usually recommended to be less than 10 times of δ t e according to chen et al 2013 as shown below 2 i s p l i t δ t i δ t e 10 where i s p l i t is the ratio of the time steps between the internal mode and external mode in the simulation of tidal wave and sea ice in the bohai sea according to eqs 1 and 2 and computational stability the time steps of external and internal modes are 2 s and 20 s respectively the two dimensional external model is solved by an improved fourth order runge kutta time stepping scheme which is an improved multistage time stepping method with second order accuracy dick 1992 the momentum equation of the three dimensional internal model is solved by a simple explicit and implicit difference scheme chen et al 2003 the convection term is solved by a second order accurate runge kutta time marching scheme and vertical diffusion is solved by using implicit scheme which greatly improves the computational efficiency by avoiding the problem that the time step of explicit solution is limited by spatial resolution chen et al 2003 the smagorinsky turbulence closure model is used for horizontal mixing and the mellor yamada level 2 5 order turbulence closure model is used for vertical mixing smagorinsky 1963 mellor and yamada 1982 galperin et al 1988 modified the stability function in the my turbulent closure model guyenne and părău 2017a b proposed an eddy viscosity model to examine the energy loss in direct numerical simulations of ocean wave propagation through fragmented sea ice in this paper the horizontal thermal diffusivity coefficient calculated by the smagorinsky formula is 0 2 at the same time the ratio of the horizontal eddy viscosity coefficient and the horizontal thermal diffusivity are 1 that is the horizontal eddy viscosity coefficient is also set to be 0 2 vertical eddy viscosity and thermal diffusivity are calculated by the mellor yamada level 2 5 order turbulence closure model and the vertical mixing coefficient is set to be 10 4 zhang and zhang 2013 the bottom friction is described by a minimum drag force coefficient of 0 001 zhao et al 1994 zhang and zhang 2013 2 2 the initial conditions the initial conditions of the numerical simulation in the bohai sea included surface elevation current sea temperature and salinity since the initial field of current is difficult to determine the simulations of model started from the hydrostatic state that is the initial values of surface elevation and current are 0 it can reach a steady state after approximately 4 5 tidal cycles it is more complex to determine the initial field of sea temperature and salinity according to the previous study the vertical sea temperature in the bohai sea has obvious seasonal variation characteristics in autumn when the sea surface temperature decreases the strength of the cooling thermocline gradually decreases and the stratification phenomenon disappears in september in winter with strong eddy mixing and convection mixing the temperature is vertically mixed and the stratification vanishes completely similar to the sea surface temperature distribution that the vertical mixing is uniform due to strong wind in winter the salinity of the bohai sea presents also the uniform distribution therefore the initial fields of temperature and salinity in the bohai sea in winter were determined by the sea surface temperature and salinity the initial sea temperature field was provided by the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom chassignet et al 2007 since the hycom data are absent in the shallow water area within 5 m this absence may lead to a large error of the initial sea temperature field in the shallow water area for this reason the start date of the model simulation is one month earlier than the initial ice day during which the meteorological forcing field is sufficient to make the sea temperature more reasonable in the shallow water area the determination of the initial field of salinity is also very challenging the salinity data from the national centers for environmental prediction ncep were available for the determination of the initial salinity field however they were missing at nearshore regions with depths less than 5 m in the bohai sea since this shallow water area is important for the freezing and melting point of sea ice which determines the start and end dates of the sea ice the initial salinity field was constructed and interpolated from the measured salinity data in shallow water and ncep 2 3 open boundary conditions adjacent to the yellow sea as shown in fig 2 there exists an open boundary on the east side of the computational domain the domain boundaries include the closed boundaries and the open boundaries the conditions applied at the closed boundaries are that the normal flow velocities are equal to zero there at the open boundaries the sea temperatures and tidal levels were specified since the discharge of estuaries is very small due to freezing in winter the model does not consider the open boundary of salinity the sea temperatures at the open boundaries were obtained by hycom the tidal elevations at the open boundaries were provided by chinatide which is a tidal forecast through 9 harmonic constants of q1 p1 o1 k1 n2 m2 s2 k2 and sa li and zheng 2007 the first eight tidal components were determined by the harmonic analysis of the numerical results of the china sea using the three dimensional pom on the other hand sa 8766 2315 h of period is an astronomical and meteorological tidal component whose amplitude is usually within 10 20 cm since its time period is too long it cannot be obtained by numerical simulations it can only be interpolated by the sa tidal harmonic constant of the long measured tidal stations along the coasts of china this constant can greatly improve the prediction accuracy of the tides in the bohai sea li and zheng 2007 2 4 input forcing data the forcing inputs for bohai sea ice model may include wind temperature relative humidity cloud cover short and long wave radiation sea surface pressure and so on the meteorological parameters from ncep hourly reanalyzed data were used to calculate the heat flux the input meteorological data directly affects the accuracy of the model calculation especially the temperature and wind which are the two main parameters affecting the numerical simulations of bohai sea ice lin et al 2006 zhang et al 2018 therefore the ncep hourly reanalyzed data of wind and air temperature were tested based on the measured data from the meteorological data sharing service network of national meteorological information center of china http www cma gov cn 2011qxfw 2011qsjgx fig 3 shows that the ncep hourly reanalyzed data agree well with the measured data and have high accuracy 2 5 the principle of tidal damping due to ice when sea ice is formed it floats above the water and reduces the dynamic effect of the wind on the tide therefore the ice is equivalent to a frictional stress which is called ice stress in a bohai model containing open water and ice the sea surface stress consists of two parts the sea surface wind stress and ice stress which can be formulated as follows 3 w u s u r f 2 σ x w i n d 1 a i c e σ x i c e o c e a n a i c e w v s u r f 2 σ y w i n d 1 a i c e σ y i c e o c e a n a i c e where wusurf2 and wvsurf2 are the surface stresses in the x and y directions in the external mode which are determined by using a weighted interpolation depending on the presence of ice guyenne and părău 2017a b a i c e is ice concentration between 0 and 1 and varies with space and time which is solved based on the sea ice transport equation thorndike et al 1975 σ x w i n d and σ y w i n d are the surface wind stresses on water in the x and y directions respectively while σ x i c e o c e a n and σ y i c e o c e a n are respectively the ice stresses in the x and y directions which can be written in the forms of connolley et al 2004 the expressions of surface wind stresses and ice stresses along x and y directions are given respectively as 4 σ x w i n d c d w i n d ρ a i r u w i n d 2 v w i n d 2 u w i n d cos φ v w i n d sin φ σ y w i n d c d w i n d ρ a i r u w i n d 2 v w i n d 2 u w i n d sin φ v w i n d cos φ

coefficient which is calculated by c d w i n d 0 8 0 065 u w i n d 2 v w i n d 2 10 3 according to wu 1982 ρ a i r is density of air u w i n d and v w i n d are the eastern and northern components of wind velocity φ is the angle between the wind stress vector and the wind direction c d i c e is the ice drag coefficient and its range is from 0 005 to 0 01 georgas 2012 according to georgas 2012 0 0075 is the recommended value and applied to the numerical simulation in this paper ρ w a t e r is density of water the variables u 1 and v 1 are the eastern and northern components of the surface currents respectively ω is the angle between ice current vector and water the variable duv is the relative velocity of the flow with the effect of ice which is 6 d u v u 1 u i c e 2 v 1 v i c e 2 where u i c e and v i c e are ice velocities in the x and y directions respectively which can be solved by the momentum equation of sea ice gao et al 2011 for the internal mode calculation the surface stresses in x and y directions wusurf and wvsurf can be determined as 7 w u s u r f σ x w i n d 1 a i c e σ x i c e o c e a n a i c e w v s u r f σ y w i n d 1 a i c e σ y i c e o c e a n a i c e in general the numerical procedure see fig 4 for calculating the tidal elevation with damping effect due to ice is summarized as follows first the internal mode surface currents u 1 and v 1 according to eqs 3 6 are used to calculate the surface stress wusurf2 and wvsurf2 of the external mode the free surface elevation ξ which is applied to calculate the external mode convection terms advua and advva can be determined with the inputs of the depth averaged velocity u a and v a second the values of wusurf2 wvsurf2 ξ advua and advva are used to update u a and v a of the external mode needed for the calculation at the next time step third the internal mode velocities u 1 and v 1 are estimated using the updated u a and v a and accordingly the surface stresses wusurf and wvsurf of the internal mode can be calculated finally the internal currents of the next time level u and v and the new free surface elevation are calculated according to the inputs of wusurf and wvsurf in the internal mode 3 model validation in this section the evolution of tides and sea ice in the winter of 2010 were simulated by modifying the model parameters suitable for the bohai sea with the consideration of the dynamic and the thermal process of sea ice the typical cpu time for numerical simulation of sea ice from late 2009 to early 2010 using 32 processors for parallel computing is about 96 h the results of the model simulations are verified by the measured data 3 1 validation of the tidal model the tidal waves appeared in the pacific ocean pass through the east china sea and the yellow sea and finally reach the bohai sea through the bohai strait since bohai is a shallow sea the simulation of tidal motion is a part of shallow water circulation problem the simulation time is from november 1 2009 to march 31 2010 the harmonic constants of 4 tides in m2 s2 k1 and o1 were analyzed by t tide pawlowicz et al 2002 the comparison of m2 and k1 with the united kingdom tide tables shows that the average errors of the amplitude and phase are 0 02 m and 4 5 respectively table 1 the comparison between the simulated tidal levels and the measured data in time series shows that the two agree well which is shown in fig 5 according to the criterion of fang 1986 for tidal types and the results of the numerical simulations the tidal types of the bohai sea based on the tidal number a is defined as 8 a h k 1 h o 1 h m 2 where h k 1 h o 1 and h m 2 are the amplitudes of the k1 o1 and m2 tides respectively if a 0 5 it is a semidiurnal tide if 0 5 a 2 0 it is classified as an irregular semidiurnal tide if 2 0 a 4 0 it is then an irregular diurnal tide while if 4 0 a it is a diurnal tide according to fig 6 a most areas of the bohai sea are mixed semidiurnal tides there is a small area of diurnal tide near the qinhuangdao offshore area surrounded by an irregular diurnal tide a similar situation occurred near the old yellow river estuary this is consistent with the conclusions made by huang and huang 2005 in addition the m2 tide has two elevation amphidromic points in the bohai sea as shown in fig 6 b one is located offshore of qinhuangdao and the other one is near the old yellow river estuary the numerical results are almost identical to the observed results huang and huang 2005 3 2 validation of sea ice in the winter of 2009 sea ice was first formed on december 5 since the start date of simulation is november 1 2009 sea ice was not formed at this time so the initial field of sea ice simulation does not need to consider the initial ice density ice thickness and the ice velocity field we selected the simulated sea ice on january 13 2010 for validation because the sea ice of the bohai bay the laizhou bay and the bohai sea reached its annual maximum on that day according to the results extracted from the modis the sea ice area is approximately 18 2 103 km2 for liaodong bay 6 7 103 km2 for bohai bay and 3 9 103 km2 for laizhou bay respectively zhang et al 2015 the simulated ice cover on january 13 2010 is very close to the sea ice retrieved from modis fig 7 the simulated sea ice area in liaodong bay is approximately 16 4 103 km2 which is slightly smaller than that of the modis the simulated sea ice area in bohai bay is 7 3 103 km2 which is 9 more than that of the modis the simulated sea ice area in laizhou bay is 3 6 103 km2 which is 8 less than that of the modis according to the modis image the starting date of sea ice was december 5 2009 and the end date of sea ice was march 15 2010 the total ice age was 101 days the initial and end dates of ice cover simulated by the fvcom model agree well with the modis for the model validation the simulated results of tides and sea ice cover agree well with the measured values it shows that the model achieves the desired accuracy and can be extended for the studies of parametric analyses 4 results analysis this section mainly presents the results of numerical analyses showing the tidal damping due to ice by comparing the harmonic constants of the main tidal components of the bohai sea with and without ice basically the amplitudes and phases of the m2 and k1 tides of bohai sea in january 2010 under the conditions with and without ice are compared in 2010 the period of sea ice existence in bohai bay laizhou bay and liaodong bay was concentrated in january therefore the time of tidal harmonic analysis is selected from january 1 2010 to january 31 2010 from the results of the spatial distribution of the amplitude difference of the m2 tides in the bohai sea between ice and ice free conditions fig 8 a only the nearshore areas of the three bays show amplitude attenuation this is due to the low salinity in the nearshore areas of the three bays which makes them easier to freeze in addition the amplitude of the m2 tide in the ice covered area is only 0 01 m less than that in the ice free area which is only equivalent to the error between the calculated value and the tidal surface value described in section 3 this may be due to thin ice and small ice range conditions according to the calculated results in january 2010 the average sea ice concentration in bohai bay and laizhou bay was about 0 50 and the average ice thickness was 5 cm the average ice concentration in liaodong bay was however 0 60 and the average ice thickness increased to 10 cm the maximum offshore distance of sea ice in bohai bay laizhou bay and liaodong bay was 36 km 26 km and 103 km respectively in addition the phase of the m2 tide the amplitude and the phase of the k1 tide are hardly affected by sea ice as shown in fig 8 b d in summary the results show that the influence of sea ice on tide can be ignored this conclusion is similar to that of georgas 2012 and kagan and sofina 2010 investigated in the canadian arctic to further examine the impact of ice between the three bays the 11 day volumetric flow rate of the three bays with and without ice from january 5 2010 to january 16 2010 are calculated the volumetric flow rate is defined as the product of flow velocity and the cross sectional area rowland and walker 1990 table 2 shows that with ice both the inflow and outflow rates at each of the three bays are relatively less than those without ice the reduction of average volumetric flow rate for inflow and outflow in liaodong bay was 8 65 103 m3 s and 13 42 103 m3 s respectively which has the most decrease among the three bays the second largest decrease in volumetric flow rate occurred in bohai bay where the reduction of average volumetric flow rate for inflow and outflow was 4 12 103 m3 s and 3 77 103 m3 s respectively laizhou bay has the smallest reduction of volumetric flow rate the reduction of inflow and outflow was 1 20 103 m3 s and 2 99 103 m3 s respectively compared to the average volumetric flow rate without ice the decreases of the inflows or outflows are relatively small and in general can be neglected similar conclusions can also be obtained by examining the results of volumetric flow rate plots with or without ice cover presented in fig 9 5 sensitivity analysis in this section the results showing the effects of sea ice on tides under the conditions of different ice drag coefficients different temperatures and different wind speeds are presented and discussed 5 1 influence of drag coefficient the purpose of this section is to determine the effect of ice drag coefficient on the tide in the bohai sea according to the study of georgas 2012 the effective range of the ice drag coefficient is from 0 005 to 0 01 therefore the harmonic constants of the m2 and k1 tidal components are calculated and compared with the ice drag coefficients of 0 005 and 0 01 respectively again the tidal harmonic analysis is performed for data in january 2010 as shown in fig 10 a when the ice drag coefficient increases from 0 005 to 0 01 the amplitude of the m2 tide decreases by 2 cm in liaodong bay and by 1 cm in bohai bay and shows almost no change in laizhou bay fig 10 b shows that the phase of the m2 tide is within 10 degrees of increase near the elevation amphidromic point in qinhuangdao from fig 10 c it is noticed the amplitude of the k1 tide decreases 1 cm in liaodong bay but it is not affected by the ice drag coefficient in bohai bay and laizhou bay the phase of the k1 tide is not affected by different drag coefficients see fig 10 d generally the effect of drag coefficient on the tidal harmonic constants is insignificant 5 2 influence of air temperature and wind since temperature and wind are the main factors for the evolution of bohai sea ice the effect of two extreme combinations of temperature and wind on sea ice and tidal harmonic constants are discussed in this section air temperature and wind are from the hourly reanalysis data of ncep in january and february from 2009 to 2018 first the standard deviation of the temperature in the period of 10 years fig 11 a and the standard deviation of wind speed for 10 years fig 11 b are calculated it can be seen that the range of standard deviation of temperature is from 2 78 c to 5 27 c and the standard deviations of temperature in the shallow water regions are higher than those in the deep water areas the standard deviations of temperature in laizhou bay and bohai bay are lower than those in liaodong bay the standard deviations of wind speed ranging from 1 77 m s to 3 60 m s are shown in fig 11 b where the standard deviations of wind speed in shallow water are lower than those in deep water the standard deviations of wind speed in laizhou bay and bohai bay are slightly lower than those in liaodong bay this section discusses the results under two conditions of extreme combinations namely test 1 and test 2 test 1 is a combination of temperature plus standard deviation and wind speed minus standard deviation that is high temperature and low wind speed test 2 is a combination of temperature minus standard deviation and wind speed plus standard deviation i e low temperature and high wind speed the spatial distribution of sea ice on january 13 2010 as shown in fig 12 a was observed to be greatly reduced under the combination of high temperature and low wind speed in test 1 compared with fig 7 there was low percentage of sea ice in both liaodong bay and bohai bay at the northern coastal regions whereas the sea ice in the laizhou bay is completely disappeared under the combination of low temperature and high wind speed in test 2 the three bays of the bohai sea were all covered by sea ice as shown in fig 12 b to compare the influence of test 1 and test 2 on the harmonic constants of the tides the amplitudes of the m2 tide of the central axis of bohai bay laizhou bay and liaodong bay are selected to do the contrast analysis the tidal data in january 2010 are again used for harmonic analysis the maximum amplitude differences of the m2 tide between test 2 and test 1 in liaodong bay bohai bay and laizhou bay are 5 cm 5 cm and 6 cm respectively which are shown in fig 13 6 mechanism of tidal damping to further elucidate the mechanism of tidal damping a one dimensional momentum conservation equation is proposed as follows 9 a u t a u u x a g η x τ b ρ p m τ s ρ p i in eq 9 a is the cross sectional area u is the velocity parallel to the central axis of the three bays η is the free surface elevation τ b is the bottom shear stress τ s is the surface shear stress that is caused by ice p m is the bottom wetted perimeter and p i is the surface width as shown in eq 9 the momentum equation contains five terms which are the local acceleration the convective acceleration the pressure and the bottom and surface shear stress from left to right respectively to compute the standard deviation of each term in the momentum equation several sections at an interval of 10 km are selected that are perpendicular to the central axis of bohai bay liaodong bay and laizhou bay see fig 14 the grid spacing along each section is 2 km in the calculation of the convection and the pressure terms the distance between two adjacent sections is further refined to 2 km in order to reflect their spatial gradients to illustrate the contributions of the five terms in the momentum equation more clearly the standard deviations of the acceleration term term 1 the convection term term 2 the bottom shear stress term term 4 and the surface shear stress term term 5 are divided by the standard deviation of pressure term term 3 to obtain the proportions of each term in the momentum equation on this basis the ratio distributions of each term along the central axis of the three bays are obtained from the section near the top of the bay to the mouth of the bay as seen from fig 15 the ratio of term 3 pressure term as one is the largest and the sum of the other four terms is basically equal to 1 term 4 bottom shear stress accounts for the largest proportion of all of the other 3 terms in section 1 which is 10 km from the top of the bay with bohai bay accounting for 71 of the standard deviation of term 3 liaodong bay accounting for 37 and laizhou bay for 33 the proportion of the bottom shear stress contribution decreases with the increase of the water depth at the mouth of the three bays term 4 accounts for 25 of the standard deviation of term 3 in bohai bay while it accounts for 30 in liaodong bay and 22 in laizhou bay the spatial variations of term 1 acceleration term along the central axis of the three bays are basically the opposite of term 4 the proportion of term 1 in the momentum equation increases with an increase in water depth at sections near the top of the three bays section 1 term 1 accounts for 23 of the standard deviation in term 3 in bohai bay while it accounts for 41 in liaodong bay and 39 in laizhou bay at the mouth of the three bays with the increase in the water depth the sectional area and the flow velocity term 1 accounts for 59 of the standard deviation of term 3 in bohai bay while it accounts for 89 in liaodong bay and 68 in laizhou bay term 5 surface shear stress basically makes no change along the central axis of the three bays and its proportion of the standard deviation to term 3 is also very small from the top of the three bays to the mouth the ratio of the standard deviation of term 5 to term 3 in bohai bay changes from 11 to 10 while in liaodong bay it remains 9 and in laizhou bay it varies from 15 to 9 term 2 convection has the smallest standard deviation ratio when compared to other terms in the momentum equation from the top of the bay to the mouth of the bay the proportion of the standard deviation to term 3 in bohai bay decreases from 7 to 1 in liaodong bay from 8 to 4 and in laizhou bay from 6 to 1 it can also be seen from fig 16 that the amplitude of term 1 and term 3 varies the most in time and the direction is basically opposite in addition the variation period of bottom shear stress is basically the same as that of the tidal period and its amplitude changed in time are less than term 1 and term 3 compared with term 2 its direction is consistent at flood tide and opposite to ebb tide compared with term 4 term 5 is not only affected by the velocity of flow but also by the wind in summary although the ice stress term in the momentum equation can reduce the tidal level the convection term in the momentum equation offsets a part of the damping effects of ice on the tide due to the convergence of the sectional area from the mouth to the top of the three bays 7 conclusions in this paper tidal damping due to sea ice is studied based on the three dimensional ice ocean coupling model fvcom according to the numerical results the simulated tidal level and sea ice in the bohai sea agreed well with the field data collected in the winter season from 2009 to 2010 it is found in this study that the amplitude of the m2 tide is reduced by 1 cm at the top of the three bays in the bohai sea which have high percentage cover of sea ice the phase of the m2 tide and the amplitude and the phase of the k1 tide are almost not affected by sea ice by comparing the average volumetric flow rate at the three bays with and without ice it is found that both the average volumetric flow rate for inflow and outflow are almost not be affected by ice coverage based on the sensitivity analysis results the amplitude of the m2 tide is reduced by 2 cm in liaodong bay and by 1 cm in bohai bay but almost no change in laizhou bay when the ice drag coefficient is increased from 0 005 to 0 01 the phase of the m2 tide increases within 10 near the elevation amphidromic point in qinhuangdao however the amplitude and phase of the k1 tide are not affected by varying ice drag coefficients in addition under the combined condition of air temperature plus its standard deviation and wind speed minus its standard deviation the spatial distribution of sea ice decreases significantly and only a small amount of sea ice appears along the northern coast of liaodong bay and bohai bay in contrast all three bays in the bohai sea are covered by sea ice under the condition of air temperature minus its standard deviation and wind speed plus its standard deviation the m2 tidal amplitude is also accordingly decreases by 5 cm in bohai bay and liaodong bay while it decreases by 6 cm in laizhou bay based on the mechanism analysis of tidal damping the ice stress term of the momentum equation can reduce the tidal level especially under extreme conditions i e all three bays of the bohai sea are covered by sea ice however the convergence of the cross sectional area from the mouth to the top of the bay leads to an increase in the tidal level resulting from the convection term in the momentum equation although this value is very small the convection term can still offset some of the decrease in tidal level caused by the ice stress this may have explained why the tidal levels in the three bays of the bohai sea do not show considerable decrease even when the ice cover is very big in addition the existence of sea ice reduces the dynamic effect of wind and may affect the flow induced transport in the bohai sea in the future the effects of sea ice on material transport will be further studied acknowledgments this research was supported by the national natural science foundation of china under grant 51509177 state scholarship fund of china under grant 201808120025 major

23021,ocean tides have been reported to be significantly damped by sea ice due to the fact that the bottom of sea ice is rough and able to dissipate tidal energy to examine this damping effect of sea ice on the astronomical tides in the bohai sea where sea ice is common in winter this study has developed a three dimensional ice ocean coupled model with and without sea ice to investigate potential changes in astronomical tides based on the finite volume community ocean model fvcom this newly developed model was first evaluated against field observations and remote sensing images including water elevations and sea ice cover and showed good agreement between the modelling results and the observed data in using the air forcing data 2009 2010 and the default sea ice drag coefficient of 0 0075 the model results show that in the presence of sea ice the major tidal constituent m2 is reduced by 1 cm at the top of the three bays from north to south liaodong bay bohai bay and laizhou bay in the bohai sea but the tidal phase is almost not affected a sensitivity run shows that the amplitude of m2 is decreased by 2 cm when increasing the drag coefficient from 0 005 to 0 01 moreover two extreme combinations of air temperatures and winds are simulated according to the standard deviation of wind speed and temperature over the past ten years and the damping effects of sea ice on tides are almost negligible as well based on the water mass analysis it is found that both the decreases of average volumetric flow rate for inflow and outflow due to ice through the three bays are relatively small compared to the average volumetric flow rate without ice the convergence of the cross sectional area increases the tidal amplitude of m2 which compensates the damping effect caused by sea ice keywords sea ice drag convergence fvcom tidal damping momentum balance 1 introduction the bohai sea is a semienclosed sea with three sides surrounded by land and one side open to the yellow sea fig 1 the bohai sea is located in the mid latitude monsoon climate zone in the northern hemisphere and is affected by strong cold waves which produce sea ice in the bohai sea in winter zhang et al 2016 2018 in general the sea ice in the bohai sea first appears in liaodong bay then advances south along the coastal water to cover part of bohai bay and subsequently the laizhou bay zhang et al 2015 in winter the ice in the bohai sea is mainly distributed in those three bays and the closer it is to the coasts the greater the probability of its occurrence zhang et al 2016 it is well known that sea ice insulates the ocean from the atmosphere and alters air sea heat and momentum exchanges however it is less known that sea ice is able to damp tides which is an important driving force especially affecting the tides of the three bays mentioned above and plays a critical role in sediment transport and pollutant dispersion wang et al 2013 xiong et al 2017 2018 it is also well known that the amplitude of the m2 tide in the bohai sea can be reduced by the bottom frictional stress guo and yanagi 1998 zhao et al 1994 however tidal damping due to sea ice in the bohai sea which is not well documented and understood is the focus of the present study a number of studies reported that sea ice is able to damp tidal ranges kagan and timofeev 2006 2007 kagan and sofina 2010 georgas 2012 parker 2014 sea ice is considered to be the main cause of seasonal variation in the harmonic constants of the arctic ocean tides kagan and sofina 2010 the results of seasonal variations of tidal harmonic constants were mostly derived from measured tidal data at several selected stations kagan and sofina 2010 luneva et al 2015 wunsch 2016 farhadzadeh 2017 according to the analysis of tidal elevations recorded from estuaries rivers and oceans the effect of ice on the tidal level varies for example the tidal amplitude can be reduced by ice from winter to summer several times in the estuaries of pyia while little impact was found in the canadian arctic except for in the southern beaufort sea georgas 2012 kagan and sofina 2010 on the other hand the influence of ice on the spatial variation of tidal level was mostly evaluated by numerical simulations such as the water body of the arctic ocean kagan and timofeev 2006 2007 according to tidal harmonic analysis of the arctic ocean in winter and summer seasonal variations of the tidal harmonic constants amplitude and phase in the middle and canadian parts of the arctic ocean can be ignored while the amplitude variation in the siberia continental shelf is 5 cm and the seasonal variation of the phase is 15 to several tens of degree kagan and sofina 2010 in general tidal seasonal changes caused by sea ice were mainly observed from measured data of marine observation gauge stations godin and barber 1980 godin 1986 however the available data are very limited and lacking especially the spatial variation of the harmonic constants of tides in the bohai sea caused by ice therefore the purpose of this study is to examine the impacts of sea ice on the tides in the bohai sea using a three dimensional ice ocean coupled model on the basis of the model validation the spatial changes of the tidal amplitude and phase in the three bays of the bohai sea with ice are discussed the main contents of this paper are as follows section 2 describes the numerical simulation method section 3 is the model validation including the validations of tides and sea ice section 4 presents the results of the amplitude and phase of the main tides with and without ice cover section 5 discusses the influences of different ice drag coefficients temperature and wind speed on tides section 6 further analyzes the mechanism of tidal level damping due to ice the conclusion is summarized in the last section 2 numerical model the model used in this paper is a three dimensional free surface ocean model based on an unstructured grid and finite volume algorithm which included the momentum equations continuity equation sst salinity and density equation it was developed and improved by chen et al 2003 2 1 the model mesh and parameters in fvcom model the horizontal computing domain is discretized in the horizontal direction using unstructured triangular meshes and the vertical sigma coordinate is used to transform the irregular bottom terrain chen et al 2003 therefore the model mesh of bohai sea established in this paper is not a fixed grid scale it varies with space as shown in fig 2 the total numbers of node and element of the horizontal grids in the bohai model are 12554 and 24398 respectively in terms of longitude and latitude the minimum grid size is 0 009 0 80 km while its maximum value is about 0 055 6 10 km the vertical coordinates are divided into 10 layers so that the surface layer has a larger resolution the finite volume algorithm can be used for local encryption of any concerned region being more convenient to fit complex boundaries and save calculation time its grid resolution depends on three factors the region of interest the geometry of the shoreline and the available depth data the three bays of the bohai sea are ice evolution areas in winter which are the areas of interest and the geometric shoreline is complex so more detailed mesh is needed to describe it according to the resolution of the measured water depth in each bay the final mesh resolution is different fig 2 fvcom uses a numerical discretization method similar to princeton ocean model pom mode which separates two dimensional external model from three dimensional internal model chen et al 2003 it uses a shorter time step in barotropic equation and a longer time step in baroclinic equation the time step of the external mode δ t e should follow courant friedrichs lewy cfl as shown below chen et al 2013 1 δ t e δ l g d where δ l is he shortest edge length of a triangular mesh element g is the acceleration of gravity and d is the largest water depth in the computational domain the time step of internal mode δ t i is usually recommended to be less than 10 times of δ t e according to chen et al 2013 as shown below 2 i s p l i t δ t i δ t e 10 where i s p l i t is the ratio of the time steps between the internal mode and external mode in the simulation of tidal wave and sea ice in the bohai sea according to eqs 1 and 2 and computational stability the time steps of external and internal modes are 2 s and 20 s respectively the two dimensional external model is solved by an improved fourth order runge kutta time stepping scheme which is an improved multistage time stepping method with second order accuracy dick 1992 the momentum equation of the three dimensional internal model is solved by a simple explicit and implicit difference scheme chen et al 2003 the convection term is solved by a second order accurate runge kutta time marching scheme and vertical diffusion is solved by using implicit scheme which greatly improves the computational efficiency by avoiding the problem that the time step of explicit solution is limited by spatial resolution chen et al 2003 the smagorinsky turbulence closure model is used for horizontal mixing and the mellor yamada level 2 5 order turbulence closure model is used for vertical mixing smagorinsky 1963 mellor and yamada 1982 galperin et al 1988 modified the stability function in the my turbulent closure model guyenne and părău 2017a b proposed an eddy viscosity model to examine the energy loss in direct numerical simulations of ocean wave propagation through fragmented sea ice in this paper the horizontal thermal diffusivity coefficient calculated by the smagorinsky formula is 0 2 at the same time the ratio of the horizontal eddy viscosity coefficient and the horizontal thermal diffusivity are 1 that is the horizontal eddy viscosity coefficient is also set to be 0 2 vertical eddy viscosity and thermal diffusivity are calculated by the mellor yamada level 2 5 order turbulence closure model and the vertical mixing coefficient is set to be 10 4 zhang and zhang 2013 the bottom friction is described by a minimum drag force coefficient of 0 001 zhao et al 1994 zhang and zhang 2013 2 2 the initial conditions the initial conditions of the numerical simulation in the bohai sea included surface elevation current sea temperature and salinity since the initial field of current is difficult to determine the simulations of model started from the hydrostatic state that is the initial values of surface elevation and current are 0 it can reach a steady state after approximately 4 5 tidal cycles it is more complex to determine the initial field of sea temperature and salinity according to the previous study the vertical sea temperature in the bohai sea has obvious seasonal variation characteristics in autumn when the sea surface temperature decreases the strength of the cooling thermocline gradually decreases and the stratification phenomenon disappears in september in winter with strong eddy mixing and convection mixing the temperature is vertically mixed and the stratification vanishes completely similar to the sea surface temperature distribution that the vertical mixing is uniform due to strong wind in winter the salinity of the bohai sea presents also the uniform distribution therefore the initial fields of temperature and salinity in the bohai sea in winter were determined by the sea surface temperature and salinity the initial sea temperature field was provided by the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom chassignet et al 2007 since the hycom data are absent in the shallow water area within 5 m this absence may lead to a large error of the initial sea temperature field in the shallow water area for this reason the start date of the model simulation is one month earlier than the initial ice day during which the meteorological forcing field is sufficient to make the sea temperature more reasonable in the shallow water area the determination of the initial field of salinity is also very challenging the salinity data from the national centers for environmental prediction ncep were available for the determination of the initial salinity field however they were missing at nearshore regions with depths less than 5 m in the bohai sea since this shallow water area is important for the freezing and melting point of sea ice which determines the start and end dates of the sea ice the initial salinity field was constructed and interpolated from the measured salinity data in shallow water and ncep 2 3 open boundary conditions adjacent to the yellow sea as shown in fig 2 there exists an open boundary on the east side of the computational domain the domain boundaries include the closed boundaries and the open boundaries the conditions applied at the closed boundaries are that the normal flow velocities are equal to zero there at the open boundaries the sea temperatures and tidal levels were specified since the discharge of estuaries is very small due to freezing in winter the model does not consider the open boundary of salinity the sea temperatures at the open boundaries were obtained by hycom the tidal elevations at the open boundaries were provided by chinatide which is a tidal forecast through 9 harmonic constants of q1 p1 o1 k1 n2 m2 s2 k2 and sa li and zheng 2007 the first eight tidal components were determined by the harmonic analysis of the numerical results of the china sea using the three dimensional pom on the other hand sa 8766 2315 h of period is an astronomical and meteorological tidal component whose amplitude is usually within 10 20 cm since its time period is too long it cannot be obtained by numerical simulations it can only be interpolated by the sa tidal harmonic constant of the long measured tidal stations along the coasts of china this constant can greatly improve the prediction accuracy of the tides in the bohai sea li and zheng 2007 2 4 input forcing data the forcing inputs for bohai sea ice model may include wind temperature relative humidity cloud cover short and long wave radiation sea surface pressure and so on the meteorological parameters from ncep hourly reanalyzed data were used to calculate the heat flux the input meteorological data directly affects the accuracy of the model calculation especially the temperature and wind which are the two main parameters affecting the numerical simulations of bohai sea ice lin et al 2006 zhang et al 2018 therefore the ncep hourly reanalyzed data of wind and air temperature were tested based on the measured data from the meteorological data sharing service network of national meteorological information center of china http www cma gov cn 2011qxfw 2011qsjgx fig 3 shows that the ncep hourly reanalyzed data agree well with the measured data and have high accuracy 2 5 the principle of tidal damping due to ice when sea ice is formed it floats above the water and reduces the dynamic effect of the wind on the tide therefore the ice is equivalent to a frictional stress which is called ice stress in a bohai model containing open water and ice the sea surface stress consists of two parts the sea surface wind stress and ice stress which can be formulated as follows 3 w u s u r f 2 σ x w i n d 1 a i c e σ x i c e o c e a n a i c e w v s u r f 2 σ y w i n d 1 a i c e σ y i c e o c e a n a i c e where wusurf2 and wvsurf2 are the surface stresses in the x and y directions in the external mode which are determined by using a weighted interpolation depending on the presence of ice guyenne and părău 2017a b a i c e is ice concentration between 0 and 1 and varies with space and time which is solved based on the sea ice transport equation thorndike et al 1975 σ x w i n d and σ y w i n d are the surface wind stresses on water in the x and y directions respectively while σ x i c e o c e a n and σ y i c e o c e a n are respectively the ice stresses in the x and y directions which can be written in the forms of connolley et al 2004 the expressions of surface wind stresses and ice stresses along x and y directions are given respectively as 4 σ x w i n d c d w i n d ρ a i r u w i n d 2 v w i n d 2 u w i n d cos φ v w i n d sin φ σ y w i n d c d w i n d ρ a i r u w i n d 2 v w i n d 2 u w i n d sin φ v w i n d cos φ 5 σ x i c e o c e a n c d i c e ρ w a t e r d u v u 1 u i c e cos ω v 1 v i c e sin ω σ y i c e o c e a n c d i c e ρ w a t e r d u v v 1 v i c e cos ω u 1 u i c e sin ω where c d w i n d is wind drag coefficient which is calculated by c d w i n d 0 8 0 065 u w i n d 2 v w i n d 2 10 3 according to wu 1982 ρ a i r is density of air u w i n d and v w i n d are the eastern and northern components of wind velocity φ is the angle between the wind stress vector and the wind direction c d i c e is the ice drag coefficient and its range is from 0 005 to 0 01 georgas 2012 according to georgas 2012 0 0075 is the recommended value and applied to the numerical simulation in this paper ρ w a t e r is density of water the variables u 1 and v 1 are the eastern and northern components of the surface currents respectively ω is the angle between ice current vector and water the variable duv is the relative velocity of the flow with the effect of ice which is 6 d u v u 1 u i c e 2 v 1 v i c e 2 where u i c e and v i c e are ice velocities in the x and y directions respectively which can be solved by the momentum equation of sea ice gao et al 2011 for the internal mode calculation the surface stresses in x and y directions wusurf and wvsurf can be determined as 7 w u s u r f σ x w i n d 1 a i c e σ x i c e o c e a n a i c e w v s u r f σ y w i n d 1 a i c e σ y i c e o c e a n a i c e in general the numerical procedure see fig 4 for calculating the tidal elevation with damping effect due to ice is summarized as follows first the internal mode surface currents u 1 and v 1 according to eqs 3 6 are used to calculate the surface stress wusurf2 and wvsurf2 of the external mode the free surface elevation ξ which is applied to calculate the external mode convection terms advua and advva can be determined with the inputs of the depth averaged velocity u a and v a second the values of wusurf2 wvsurf2 ξ advua and advva are used to update u a and v a of the external mode needed for the calculation at the next time step third the internal mode velocities u 1 and v 1 are estimated using the updated u a and v a and accordingly the surface stresses wusurf and wvsurf of the internal mode can be calculated finally the internal currents of the next time level u and v and the new free surface elevation are calculated according to the inputs of wusurf and wvsurf in the internal mode 3 model validation in this section the evolution of tides and sea ice in the winter of 2010 were simulated by modifying the model parameters suitable for the bohai sea with the consideration of the dynamic and the thermal process of sea ice the typical cpu time for numerical simulation of sea ice from late 2009 to early 2010 using 32 processors for parallel computing is about 96 h the results of the model simulations are verified by the measured data 3 1 validation of the tidal model the tidal waves appeared in the pacific ocean pass through the east china sea and the yellow sea and finally reach the bohai sea through the bohai strait since bohai is a shallow sea the simulation of tidal motion is a part of shallow water circulation problem the simulation time is from november 1 2009 to march 31 2010 the harmonic constants of 4 tides in m2 s2 k1 and o1 were analyzed by t tide pawlowicz et al 2002 the comparison of m2 and k1 with the united kingdom tide tables shows that the average errors of the amplitude and phase are 0 02 m and 4 5 respectively table 1 the comparison between the simulated tidal levels and the measured data in time series shows that the two agree well which is shown in fig 5 according to the criterion of fang 1986 for tidal types and the results of the numerical simulations the tidal types of the bohai sea based on the tidal number a is defined as 8 a h k 1 h o 1 h m 2 where h k 1 h o 1 and h m 2 are the amplitudes of the k1 o1 and m2 tides respectively if a 0 5 it is a semidiurnal tide if 0 5 a 2 0 it is classified as an irregular semidiurnal tide if 2 0 a 4 0 it is then an irregular diurnal tide while if 4 0 a it is a diurnal tide according to fig 6 a most areas of the bohai sea are mixed semidiurnal tides there is a small area of diurnal tide near the qinhuangdao offshore area surrounded by an irregular diurnal tide a similar situation occurred near the old yellow river estuary this is consistent with the conclusions made by huang and huang 2005 in addition the m2 tide has two elevation amphidromic points in the bohai sea as shown in fig 6 b one is located offshore of qinhuangdao and the other one is near the old yellow river estuary the numerical results are almost identical to the observed results huang and huang 2005 3 2 validation of sea ice in the winter of 2009 sea ice was first formed on december 5 since the start date of simulation is november 1 2009 sea ice was not formed at this time so the initial field of sea ice simulation does not need to consider the initial ice density ice thickness and the ice velocity field we selected the simulated sea ice on january 13 2010 for validation because the sea ice of the bohai bay the laizhou bay and the bohai sea reached its annual maximum on that day according to the results extracted from the modis the sea ice area is approximately 18 2 103 km2 for liaodong bay 6 7 103 km2 for bohai bay and 3 9 103 km2 for laizhou bay respectively zhang et al 2015 the simulated ice cover on january 13 2010 is very close to the sea ice retrieved from modis fig 7 the simulated sea ice area in liaodong bay is approximately 16 4 103 km2 which is slightly smaller than that of the modis the simulated sea ice area in bohai bay is 7 3 103 km2 which is 9 more than that of the modis the simulated sea ice area in laizhou bay is 3 6 103 km2 which is 8 less than that of the modis according to the modis image the starting date of sea ice was december 5 2009 and the end date of sea ice was march 15 2010 the total ice age was 101 days the initial and end dates of ice cover simulated by the fvcom model agree well with the modis for the model validation the simulated results of tides and sea ice cover agree well with the measured values it shows that the model achieves the desired accuracy and can be extended for the studies of parametric analyses 4 results analysis this section mainly presents the results of numerical analyses showing the tidal damping due to ice by comparing the harmonic constants of the main tidal components of the bohai sea with and without ice basically the amplitudes and phases of the m2 and k1 tides of bohai sea in january 2010 under the conditions with and without ice are compared in 2010 the period of sea ice existence in bohai bay laizhou bay and liaodong bay was concentrated in january therefore the time of tidal harmonic analysis is selected from january 1 2010 to january 31 2010 from the results of the spatial distribution of the amplitude difference of the m2 tides in the bohai sea between ice and ice free conditions fig 8 a only the nearshore areas of the three bays show amplitude attenuation this is due to the low salinity in the nearshore areas of the three bays which makes them easier to freeze in addition the amplitude of the m2 tide in the ice covered area is only 0 01 m less than that in the ice free area which is only equivalent to the error between the calculated value and the tidal surface value described in section 3 this may be due to thin ice and small ice range conditions according to the calculated results in january 2010 the average sea ice concentration in bohai bay and laizhou bay was about 0 50 and the average ice thickness was 5 cm the average ice concentration in liaodong bay was however 0 60 and the average ice thickness increased to 10 cm the maximum offshore distance of sea ice in bohai bay laizhou bay and liaodong bay was 36 km 26 km and 103 km respectively in addition the phase of the m2 tide the amplitude and the phase of the k1 tide are hardly affected by sea ice as shown in fig 8 b d in summary the results show that the influence of sea ice on tide can be ignored this conclusion is similar to that of georgas 2012 and kagan and sofina 2010 investigated in the canadian arctic to further examine the impact of ice between the three bays the 11 day volumetric flow rate of the three bays with and without ice from january 5 2010 to january 16 2010 are calculated the volumetric flow rate is defined as the product of flow velocity and the cross sectional area rowland and walker 1990 table 2 shows that with ice both the inflow and outflow rates at each of the three bays are relatively less than those without ice the reduction of average volumetric flow rate for inflow and outflow in liaodong bay was 8 65 103 m3 s and 13 42 103 m3 s respectively which has the most decrease among the three bays the second largest decrease in volumetric flow rate occurred in bohai bay where the reduction of average volumetric flow rate for inflow and outflow was 4 12 103 m3 s and 3 77 103 m3 s respectively laizhou bay has the smallest reduction of volumetric flow rate the reduction of inflow and outflow was 1 20 103 m3 s and 2 99 103 m3 s respectively compared to the average volumetric flow rate without ice the decreases of the inflows or outflows are relatively small and in general can be neglected similar conclusions can also be obtained by examining the results of volumetric flow rate plots with or without ice cover presented in fig 9 5 sensitivity analysis in this section the results showing the effects of sea ice on tides under the conditions of different ice drag coefficients different temperatures and different wind speeds are presented and discussed 5 1 influence of drag coefficient the purpose of this section is to determine the effect of ice drag coefficient on the tide in the bohai sea according to the study of georgas 2012 the effective range of the ice drag coefficient is from 0 005 to 0 01 therefore the harmonic constants of the m2 and k1 tidal components are calculated and compared with the ice drag coefficients of 0 005 and 0 01 respectively again the tidal harmonic analysis is performed for data in january 2010 as shown in fig 10 a when the ice drag coefficient increases from 0 005 to 0 01 the amplitude of the m2 tide decreases by 2 cm in liaodong bay and by 1 cm in bohai bay and shows almost no change in laizhou bay fig 10 b shows that the phase of the m2 tide is within 10 degrees of increase near the elevation amphidromic point in qinhuangdao from fig 10 c it is noticed the amplitude of the k1 tide decreases 1 cm in liaodong bay but it is not affected by the ice drag coefficient in bohai bay and laizhou bay the phase of the k1 tide is not affected by different drag coefficients see fig 10 d generally the effect of drag coefficient on the tidal harmonic constants is insignificant 5 2 influence of air temperature and wind since temperature and wind are the main factors for the evolution of bohai sea ice the effect of two extreme combinations of temperature and wind on sea ice and tidal harmonic constants are discussed in this section air temperature and wind are from the hourly reanalysis data of ncep in january and february from 2009 to 2018 first the standard deviation of the temperature in the period of 10 years fig 11 a and the standard deviation of wind speed for 10 years fig 11 b are calculated it can be seen that the range of standard deviation of temperature is from 2 78 c to 5 27 c and the standard deviations of temperature in the shallow water regions are higher than those in the deep water areas the standard deviations of temperature in laizhou bay and bohai bay are lower than those in liaodong bay the standard deviations of wind speed ranging from 1 77 m s to 3 60 m s are shown in fig 11 b where the standard deviations of wind speed in shallow water are lower than those in deep water the standard deviations of wind speed in laizhou bay and bohai bay are slightly lower than those in liaodong bay this section discusses the results under two conditions of extreme combinations namely test 1 and test 2 test 1 is a combination of temperature plus standard deviation and wind speed minus standard deviation that is high temperature and low wind speed test 2 is a combination of temperature minus standard deviation and wind speed plus standard deviation i e low temperature and high wind speed the spatial distribution of sea ice on january 13 2010 as shown in fig 12 a was observed to be greatly reduced under the combination of high temperature and low wind speed in test 1 compared with fig 7 there was low percentage of sea ice in both liaodong bay and bohai bay at the northern coastal regions whereas the sea ice in the laizhou bay is completely disappeared under the combination of low temperature and high wind speed in test 2 the three bays of the bohai sea were all covered by sea ice as shown in fig 12 b to compare the influence of test 1 and test 2 on the harmonic constants of the tides the amplitudes of the m2 tide of the central axis of bohai bay laizhou bay and liaodong bay are selected to do the contrast analysis the tidal data in january 2010 are again used for harmonic analysis the maximum amplitude differences of the m2 tide between test 2 and test 1 in liaodong bay bohai bay and laizhou bay are 5 cm 5 cm and 6 cm respectively which are shown in fig 13 6 mechanism of tidal damping to further elucidate the mechanism of tidal damping a one dimensional momentum conservation equation is proposed as follows 9 a u t a u u x a g η x τ b ρ p m τ s ρ p i in eq 9 a is the cross sectional area u is the velocity parallel to the central axis of the three bays η is the free surface elevation τ b is the bottom shear stress τ s is the surface shear stress that is caused by ice p m is the bottom wetted perimeter and p i is the surface width as shown in eq 9 the momentum equation contains five terms which are the local acceleration the convective acceleration the pressure and the bottom and surface shear stress from left to right respectively to compute the standard deviation of each term in the momentum equation several sections at an interval of 10 km are selected that are perpendicular to the central axis of bohai bay liaodong bay and laizhou bay see fig 14 the grid spacing along each section is 2 km in the calculation of the convection and the pressure terms the distance between two adjacent sections is further refined to 2 km in order to reflect their spatial gradients to illustrate the contributions of the five terms in the momentum equation more clearly the standard deviations of the acceleration term term 1 the convection term term 2 the bottom shear stress term term 4 and the surface shear stress term term 5 are divided by the standard deviation of pressure term term 3 to obtain the proportions of each term in the momentum equation on this basis the ratio distributions of each term along the central axis of the three bays are obtained from the section near the top of the bay to the mouth of the bay as seen from fig 15 the ratio of term 3 pressure term as one is the largest and the sum of the other four terms is basically equal to 1 term 4 bottom shear stress accounts for the largest proportion of all of the other 3 terms in section 1 which is 10 km from the top of the bay with bohai bay accounting for 71 of the standard deviation of term 3 liaodong bay accounting for 37 and laizhou bay for 33 the proportion of the bottom shear stress contribution decreases with the increase of the water depth at the mouth of the three bays term 4 accounts for 25 of the standard deviation of term 3 in bohai bay while it accounts for 30 in liaodong bay and 22 in laizhou bay the spatial variations of term 1 acceleration term along the central axis of the three bays are basically the opposite of term 4 the proportion of term 1 in the momentum equation increases with an increase in water depth at sections near the top of the three bays section 1 term 1 accounts for 23 of the standard deviation in term 3 in bohai bay while it accounts for 41 in liaodong bay and 39 in laizhou bay at the mouth of the three bays with the increase in the water depth the sectional area and the flow velocity term 1 accounts for 59 of the standard deviation of term 3 in bohai bay while it accounts for 89 in liaodong bay and 68 in laizhou bay term 5 surface shear stress basically makes no change along the central axis of the three bays and its proportion of the standard deviation to term 3 is also very small from the top of the three bays to the mouth the ratio of the standard deviation of term 5 to term 3 in bohai bay changes from 11 to 10 while in liaodong bay it remains 9 and in laizhou bay it varies from 15 to 9 term 2 convection has the smallest standard deviation ratio when compared to other terms in the momentum equation from the top of the bay to the mouth of the bay the proportion of the standard deviation to term 3 in bohai bay decreases from 7 to 1 in liaodong bay from 8 to 4 and in laizhou bay from 6 to 1 it can also be seen from fig 16 that the amplitude of term 1 and term 3 varies the most in time and the direction is basically opposite in addition the variation period of bottom shear stress is basically the same as that of the tidal period and its amplitude changed in time are less than term 1 and term 3 compared with term 2 its direction is consistent at flood tide and opposite to ebb tide compared with term 4 term 5 is not only affected by the velocity of flow but also by the wind in summary although the ice stress term in the momentum equation can reduce the tidal level the convection term in the momentum equation offsets a part of the damping effects of ice on the tide due to the convergence of the sectional area from the mouth to the top of the three bays 7 conclusions in this paper tidal damping due to sea ice is studied based on the three dimensional ice ocean coupling model fvcom according to the numerical results the simulated tidal level and sea ice in the bohai sea agreed well with the field data collected in the winter season from 2009 to 2010 it is found in this study that the amplitude of the m2 tide is reduced by 1 cm at the top of the three bays in the bohai sea which have high percentage cover of sea ice the phase of the m2 tide and the amplitude and the phase of the k1 tide are almost not affected by sea ice by comparing the average volumetric flow rate at the three bays with and without ice it is found that both the average volumetric flow rate for inflow and outflow are almost not be affected by ice coverage based on the sensitivity analysis results the amplitude of the m2 tide is reduced by 2 cm in liaodong bay and by 1 cm in bohai bay but almost no change in laizhou bay when the ice drag coefficient is increased from 0 005 to 0 01 the phase of the m2 tide increases within 10 near the elevation amphidromic point in qinhuangdao however the amplitude and phase of the k1 tide are not affected by varying ice drag coefficients in addition under the combined condition of air temperature plus its standard deviation and wind speed minus its standard deviation the spatial distribution of sea ice decreases significantly and only a small amount of sea ice appears along the northern coast of liaodong bay and bohai bay in contrast all three bays in the bohai sea are covered by sea ice under the condition of air temperature minus its standard deviation and wind speed plus its standard deviation the m2 tidal amplitude is also accordingly decreases by 5 cm in bohai bay and liaodong bay while it decreases by 6 cm in laizhou bay based on the mechanism analysis of tidal damping the ice stress term of the momentum equation can reduce the tidal level especially under extreme conditions i e all three bays of the bohai sea are covered by sea ice however the convergence of the cross sectional area from the mouth to the top of the bay leads to an increase in the tidal level resulting from the convection term in the momentum equation although this value is very small the convection term can still offset some of the decrease in tidal level caused by the ice stress this may have explained why the tidal levels in the three bays of the bohai sea do not show considerable decrease even when the ice cover is very big in addition the existence of sea ice reduces the dynamic effect of wind and may affect the flow induced transport in the bohai sea in the future the effects of sea ice on material transport will be

23022,understanding the hydrodynamic performance of floating energy converters is a complex challenge hence physical modelling is necessary to evaluate the performance of innovative designs and validate them the present paper shows the experimental work performed to validate a new floating semisubmersible structure which combines wave energy converters 3 oscillating water columns owc and wind harvesting 5 mw wind turbine to characterize the global response of the platform as well as the owcs performance an innovative wave tank testing campaign was carried out at the cantabria coastal and ocean basin ccob the multi use platform was characterized under the incidence of regular wave tests with and without wind operational sea states and survival sea states combining waves currents and wind during the tests wind was reproduced with a portable wind generator and the wind turbine was simulated as a drag disk the owc air turbines were experimentally conceptualized by different diameter openings on the upper part of each owc this paper describes the experimental testing campaign carried out at the ccob and presents the most significant experimental results obtained such as natural periods movements loads on the mooring system or accelerations which are representative of the performance of the multi use platform presented keywords floating multi use platform wind energy wave energy physcical modelling hydrodinamic response 1 introduction based on the global objective of reducing co2 emissions the european commission has boosted the development of new renewable energy concepts during the last years within this framework and also motivated by the firm decision of supporting blue growth activities the development of marine renewable energies mre has gained special importance within the different mre resources floating offshore wind and wave energy are two of the most promising ones however the floating offshore wind and wave energy sectors are currently at very different stages of maturity as regards wind driven energy even if there are some experimental floating wind turbines under development jonkman and matha 2011 and a series of pilot wind farms are set to demonstrate the technical and commercial viability of the technology only 50 mw of floating wind power have been installed globally up to date carbon trust 2018 the experimental prototypes are trying to unlock vast areas with high rates of wind resource at deep and ultra deep conditions in the case of wave energy converters wec the wide variety of concepts under development is a clear indicator of the immaturity of the sector falcão 2010 however there are signs of technology convergence around the owc working principle despite the important differences between fowts floating offshore wind turbines and wecs the main barrier for the offshore development of both systems are the high costs mainly related to operation and maintenance o m and installation expenses the suitable combination of different renewable energy conversion systems in the same platform offers significant opportunities to reduce the cost of energy and can notably contribute to the sustainable exploitation of the marine natural resources pérez collazo et al 2015 furthermore linking the development of the immature sector of wave energy to offshore wind provides a unique opportunity to speed up its process towards commercialization taking into account the aforementioned considerations looking for synergies between different ocean uses has become hot topic in this context the european commission has supported the development of new multi use platforms mups to increase clean energy production and reduce the offshore renewable energy cost by sharing common costs and risks mups are offshore structures both floating or fixed which integrate different uses in the same platform for instance different energy converters wind current turbines or wave energy converters or even aquaculture cages may be combined in a single platform mups are thus an alternative to ocean space distribution administration planning sharing allowing important advantages such as the minimization of environmental impacts and the reduction of installation and o m costs recently several eu funded research projects such as marina platform marina platform n d h2ocean h2ocean project n d tropos tropos project n d or mermaid project mermaid project n d have focused on the development of mup concepts conceived to be installed at different european locations the search for the most suitable combination of energy conversion systems has led to intensive investigation researchers worldwide have presented several concepts and have faced different challenges for instance wan et al 2016a 2016b 2015 presented a hybrid concept composed of a spar floating wind turbine and a torus shape heaving buoy wec they stated that maintaining the structural integrity of the platform under extreme sea states was challenging especially for the wecs hence several experimental campaigns were performed to test different survivability modes for the platform wan et al 2015 michailides et al 2016 also studied a hybrid floating concept composed of a 5 mw wind turbine and three rotating flap type wecs the novelty of the concept presented in this paper is that it combines wind energy generation with the owc wave energy generation technology in a robust semisubmersible platform according to several authors pérez collazo et al 2015 one of the major problems of semisubmersible platforms for marine renewable uses are the non easily avoidable movements of the system therefore the owc devices considered in the present work contribute to the attenuation of these movements by improving the stability of the platform in addition one of the main advantages of the owc in comparison with other wave energy conversion systems is its robustness since all the moving elements turbine and relief valves are emerged o sullivan and murphy 2013 already outlined the development of a large v shaped concrete floating platform incorporating several owc devices and a wind turbine they performed reduced scale tank testing to extrapolate power production and feed a project lifetime cost estimation model in contrast the motivation of the present work is to implement an experimental study of the hydrodynamics of the platform since the hydrodynamic optimization of a design is a key aspect for the future energy production maximization and o m cost reduction furthermore it is important to highlight that the results of this experimental campaign will be used for the validation of numerical modelling tools which will significantly contribute to cost efficient optimization of this type of concepts in the context of the mermaid project funded by the european commission within the 7th framework programme four mups have been conceptually designed for the atlantic ocean the baltic sea the north sea and the mediterranean sea respectively christensen et al 2015 in this paper the hydrodynamic response of the mup designed for the atlantic site is analyzed which was composed of three owc devices and a wind turbine the atlantic site considered is an offshore area located in north of spain just in front of the santander shore line the met ocean conditions of the atlantic site are widely described in zanuttigh et al 2013 the bathymetry of the site varies between 50 and 250 m of water depth the mup proposed for the atlantic site fig 1 is a floating concrete semisubmersible structure based on patent pct es2013 000 165 guanche et al n d that combines wind and wave energy converters the platform is an equilateral triangle composed by four columns three external ones conforming the triangle and a central one bounded by submerged beams which reinforce the whole structure fig 1 the mup incorporates oscillating water columns owc around surrounding the external columns while the central column supports a nrel 5 mw wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 the mooring system is based on four conventional catenary lines the aim of this paper is to understand the hydrodynamic response of a semisubmersible mup that combines wind nrel 5 mw and wave energy converters x 3 oscillating water columns on the one hand the working principle of the owc is simple owc devices consist on half submerged chambers keeping a trapped air pocket above a column of water and with an air turbine installed on the chamber ceiling the wave incidence provokes the oscillation of the free surface inside the chamber pushing the air through the turbine in and out and generating electricity in the case of floating owc devices energy is harvested based on the relative displacement between the floating structure and the water mass inside on the other hand wind s kinetic energy is converted into electrical energy by means of a nrel 5 mw wind turbine further details about the nrel 5 mw wind turbine are available in jonkman et al 2009 based on the complexity of the physical processes associated to the platform s response under different environmental conditions it is necessary to carry out a detailed wave current and wind tank testing program in order to 1 understand the performance of the mup for several owc chambers openings under operational and survival conditions movements accelerations and mooring system loads will be evaluated 2 provide quantitative estimations of the owcs production furthermore several owc chambers openings were simulated in order to find the chamber opening and therefore the recommend pto damping that maximizes the wave energy production 3 estimate the effect of the wind speed in the wave energy production 4 provide a detailed information for the calibration of numerical models the present paper has been divided into four sections 1 description of the experimental set up basin characteristics measurement instruments physical model description laboratory wind turbine and owc chambers 2 description of the experimental tests decay tests wave wind and current test 3 results and discussion and 4 conclusions 2 description of the prototype the proposed multi use platform has been designed based on an in house patent guanche et al n d the final mup is a triangular semisubmersible platform formed by 4 columns and designed to be installed at deep water locations the mup is equipped with a 5 mw wind turbine supported in the central column and three owcs placed around the external columns see fig 10 where the owc is the grey part of the columns the four columns are bounded by submerged beams and a triangular heave plate finally to reduce the mup weight the external columns owcs the top deck and the central tower were designed as steel elements while the rest of the mup s elements were designed in concrete the combination of these materials increases the stability of the platform and optimizes the manufacturing costs the main characteristics of the platform are shown in fig 2 and table 1 the mup also incorporates an active ballast water system to avoid high tilt angles due to wind action each external column has an individual pump system which allows filling emptying the central area of the column blue zone in fig 2 in order to modify the mass distribution the column s ballast modification is based on the incident wind velocity and direction liquid ballast has not been employed in the tests but the corresponding free surface effect has been taken into account based on the inertia of the free surfaces and the platform buoyancy the equivalent elevation of the centre of gravity has been calculated the consequence is a reduction in the metacentric height during the tests this effect has been simulated by means of a modification of the platform centre of gravity see fig 7 the mooring system has been designed for a location with a water depth of 105 m full met ocean conditions are available in zanuttigh et al 2013 this mooring system is based on four steel catenary lines and has a dry weight of 367 5 kg m and length of 570 m the column receiving the most important wave and wind loads is moored to the seabed by two lines separated 90 the mooring system layout is shown in fig 8 3 experimental set up 3 1 basin characteristics the wave current and wind tests were performed at the cantabria coastal and ocean basin ccob fig 3 managed by ihcantabria spain table 2 describes the main characteristics and generation capabilities of the facility which suitably fits with the experimental campaign defined 3 2 physical model characteristics taking into account the platform prototype s dimensions and the characteristics of the basin the selected scale to perform the wave wind current tests was 1 35 normally the scaling of the hydraulics models is carried out applying the froude scaling laws of similitude where the inertial and gravity forces in waves gravity is the primary restoring force are constant in full and laboratory scale the froude scaling laws of similitude have been applied successfully in the offshore industry to evaluate the interaction between waves and structures dnvgl rp205 dnv gl 2017 in order to be consistent with wave loads the wind loads will also be scaled following the froude scaling laws of similitude other methods to scale physical models such as reynolds criterion inertial forces and viscous forces are constant in both scales should be taken into account in those cases where the viscous forces are predominant therefore according to dnvgl rp205 dnv gl 2017 the scaling of offshore experimental testing is carried out following the froude s scaling laws of similitude table 3 shows the main froude laws of similitude journée and massie 2001 applied during the physical testing the physical model was completely built in steel see fig 4 table 4 summarizes the comparison between the targeted mass definition and that obtained during the quality control tests of the mockup regarding the wec system the owc pto was conceptualized by various holes openings see fig 4 the opening of the chambers was placed at the top of the owc four different top opening configurations of the owc were tested in order to simulate different conditions of air circulation through it see table 5 1 the three chambers completely open the 5 orifices completely open 2 the three chambers partially open 1 orifice completely open opening diameter 0 033 m further referred to as po1 3 the three chambers partially open 1 orifice partially open opening diameter 0 02 m further referred to as po2 and 4 the three chambers completely closed the 5 orifices closed the wind turbine was simulated as a drag disk the drag disk see fig 5 and table 6 allows the simulation of the wind thrust force as a result of the air flow provided by the gevi see fig 5 this technique has been successfully used in the past by other authors roddier et al 2010 in the development of windfloat technology the wind generator gevi was calibrated in order to reproduce the wind loads of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine journée and massie 2001 the wind calibration was carried out generating air flows through gevi and measuring the wind loads with a tri axial load cell located just below nacelle the gevi capabilities only allow us the generation of steady wind conditions therefore only the wind velocities selected were calibrated the fig 6 shows the thrust forces calibrated 6 11 5 16 50 m s it should be highlighted that when using the drag disk technique negative damping dynamics wind turbine control changes or turbulent wind speeds cannot be represented in the particular case of negative damping dynamics it has to be noticed that above the rated speed turbine thrust force curve usually shows a negative derivative because of that the negative damping cannot be represented based on a drag disk drag forces derivative is always positive however the impact of this limitation is limited because most of the floating offshore wind turbines already include improved control systems to mitigate negative damping induced resonance issues because of that the drag disk is an efficient and robust method to validate the performance of the mup under constant wind speeds the laboratory mooring system was built using conventional steel chains that reproduce the lineal weight of the full mooring system the weight of the laboratory mooring system was 0 301 kg m target weight 0 306 kg m the back lines length was 11 11 m see fig 8 meanwhile the front lines length was 17 03 m a plant view of the basin the physical model semisubmersible platform and lines of the mooring system and the measurement instruments employed is shown in fig 8 3 3 basin instrumentation fig 8 shows the location of the wave gauges used during the experimental tests prior to executing the wave tank tests with the physical model in place each selected sea state was calibrated without it two arrays of wave gauges akamina technologies n d and current velocity gauges were used during the calibration stage the incident and reflected waves were calculated applying mansard and funke 1980 methodology the first array was placed in the position theoretically occupied by the mup while the second one was located behind it the second array was maintained in the same position during the whole testing phase in order to monitor the simulated waves during the physical model tests the free surface measured with the second array was compared with the results measured during the wave calibration in order to verify the hydrodynamic performance of the mup the movements 6 dof were measured in the centre of the wind turbine and also in the geometric centre of the intersection between the floating platform and the mean water level x 0 y 0 0 514 m above the heave plate the motion capture system used was qualisys qualisys n d figs 8 and 9 and fig 10 present the sign convention used during the tests program nacelle accelerations xyz were also measured in order to verify that the inertial forces due to the platform movements do not generate failures in the rna rotor and nacelle components the loads on the mooring system were measured using a set of axial load cells located at the fairlead position the forces over the drag disk were measured using a tri axial load cell to measure force and moments in 6 dof model k6d40 from me system installed under the nacelle the potential energy of the owcs was obtained based on the potential hydro mechanical energy available in order to estimate the power production of the owc devices due to the reduced scale of the experiments 1 35 and based on previous works the air in the owc chambers was assumed incompressible during tank testing falcão and justino 1999 iturrioz et al 2014 however the spring like effect of air compressibility should not be neglected in full scale devices where the chamber height attains several meters sarmento and falcão 1985 equations 1 3 show the equations used to obtain the instantaneous power production the total energy generated and the mean power production

total time simulated based on equations 1 3 the evaluation of the owcs power performance required recording pressures and the free surface velocity inside the owc chambers thus pressure sensors and wave gauges were installed inside the chambers the free surface velocity was obtained as the time derivation of the free surface time series η t the pressure sensors were located at the top cover of the chambers whereas the wave gauges were installed inside the chambers and around the whole perimeter fig 10 see central render the free surface sensor is the green line the chamber wave gauges were capacitive sensors akamina technologies n d used to calculate the average water level inside each owc iturrioz et al 2014 4 description of the experimental tests the tank testing program was divided into characterization tests to evaluate the hydrodynamic performance of the mup decay test tilt test and static offset test wave wind current tests to evaluate the behavior of the mup under operational and survival conditions and to calculate the wave energy production different wave conditions were selected to check the platform s dynamic response 1 regular wave 2 operational sea states and 3 survival tests given the high directional variability of wind waves and currents incidence at site the most unfavourable condition of coaligned wind waves and currents was selected to test experimentally hence the wave wind and current direction was always of 0 see figs 8 and 10 during the tests performed in this section all the parameters are provided in full scale 4 1 characterization tests decay tests were performed to determine the natural periods and the non dimensional damping journée and massie 2001 these tests were performed with 6 dof and without 3 dof heave roll pitch the mooring system decay tests were also conducted with the owc chambers open and closed in order to calculate the amount of water trapped in the owcs during the tests depends on the water trapped in the owc the hydrodynamic response of the mup could change modifying the natural periods and damping coefficients of heave roll and pitch 4 2 wave wind tests after the characterization tests a set of regular waves with and without wind were performed the regular wave tests were conducted for different owc openings 1 open 2 closed 3 po1 and 4 po2 see table 7 the range of regular wave periods was from 8 to 25 s wave height was constant 3 m and wind speed was 11 m s table 7 summarizes the regular wave tests matrix operational tests irregular sea states were also performed with different owc openings 1 po1 2 po2 and 3 open as with the regular wave tests the operational tests were also performed with and without wind three wind speeds were tested 6 m s 11 5 m s and 16 m s three significant wave heights were tested 1 88 m 3 m and 5 m peak periods were between 7 and 25 s furthermore a set of operational sea states were also simulated under currents 0 9 m s but they are not included in table 8 because these tests are not discussed in the present paper a total of 25 operational tests were carried out including the different openings of the oscillating water columns table 8 shows the operational test matrix survival sea states were performed with the owc top open which permits neglecting the pneumatic part of the problem since the air pressure in the chamber remains atmospheric iturrioz et al 2014 the survival sea states were carried out combining waves wind and currents table 9 shows the sea states selected to check the mup s response under survival conditions finally maintaining the mup fixed to a metallic framework a set of regular wave tests was also programmed in order to study the hydrodynamic response of the owc uncoupled from the platform motions the results obtained from this set of tests allowed the numerical calibration of the oscillating water column damping coefficients armesto et al 2016 5 results and discussion with the aim of facilitating the interpretation and understanding of the experimental results all data and figures in this section are presented at prototype scale 1 1 5 1 hydrodynamic characterization tests for simplification purposes only results of the decay tests are shown and summarized in this section table 10 decay tests with without mooring system and two chamber opening conditions completely open and closed table 10 reflects an important influence of the owc s top opening when the chambers are open maximum opening natural periods are far from natural wave frequencies all reaching values higher than 19 s it has to be highlighted that natural periods below this threshold are likely to be excited by wave action however when chambers are closed heave roll and pitch natural periods show reduced values of down to 15 s which leads to a natural period that might be easily exited by waves action these variations in the natural period are due to the modification of two terms the added water mass in the owcs and the second moment of waterplane area when the upper openings of the owc chambers are closed the water enclosed inside the owc chambers follows the mup s movements therefore the water columns become part of the structure which increase the platform inertia and generates an increment in the natural periods however there is an additional effect due to the increment of the water plane area which causes an increase in the hydrostatic stiffness considering these two effects it has been identified the increment in the metacentric height as the overriding factor which results in a reduction of the natural periods of the platform on the other hand when the upper opening of the chamber is fully open the water plane area is lower and therefore the platform s natural periods are increased variations in the natural period occur for the dofs of heave roll and pitch table 10 while the natural periods of surge sway and yaw remain constant at all degrees of chamber openings surge sway and yaw natural periods are directly related to the mooring system stiffness therefore chamber opening does not influence and hence the natural periods are not modified comparing free decay results with those of moored decay table 10 we can assure that when the mup is moored the damping coefficients are higher and the natural periods are lower than under free floating conditions 5 2 static condition of the mup under wind and current action in order to evaluate the influence of the wind and currents over the initial platform positions and mooring system loads the table 11 presents the mup s mean static position as well as the mean mooring system loads when the mup is subjected to different steady wind velocities u w 0 6 11 5 and 16 m s and permanent currents cu 0 9 m s based on the thrust curve of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine shown in fig 6 the maximum offsets and mooring loads are shown for a wind velocity of 11 5 m s see table 11 under this loading condition the tension on the front lines increased by a 27 compared to the initial condition wind and current speed 0 m s regarding the horizontal displacement surge of the mup it moved 3 8 m away from the static position without wind furthermore the mup s active ballast system allows correcting the tilt angles due to the wind effect as expected the pitch angle induced by the wind force was negligible table 10 with regard to the current effect over the platform response we can check that a current of 0 9 m s generates a platform response quite similar as the effect generated by a 6 m s wind velocity producing an increasing of 10 in the front lines pre load and a horizontal offset of 1 6 m 5 3 waves wind and currents tests 5 3 1 regular wave tests without wind or currents fig 11 fig 13 and fig 14 present the movement surge heave and pitch loads and wave energy production obtained from regular wave tests without wind or currents see table 7 fig 11 presents the rigid body motion empirical response amplitude operators raos of the platform during these tests curves plotted correspond to different upper openings of the owcs tested open po1 po2 and closed the rao functions fig 11 indicate that the natural periods obtained under regular wave conditions are in line with the results measured in the moored decay tests table 10 for open or partially open conditions from the results given in fig 11 we can conclude that the mup shows only slight variations between totally or partially open owc chambers open po1 po2 its hydrodynamic response being low in these cases partially or totally open chambers with the most common natural wave periods lower than 20 s the motion amplifications raos is always below 1 m m in heave or 1 deg m in pitch and roll these thresholds in the response amplitude operators rao are considered a good indicator of the seakeeping of the platform as regards results for completely closed owc chambers the hydrodynamic response of the platform was totally different heave and pitch compared with the rest of configurations decay tests provide the natural periods with low amplitude oscillations 0 5 m in full scale in contrast regular wave excitation induces much larger oscillations taking into account the non linear effects heave plates complex geometry mass water inside the added mass can be modified in comparison with the results of decay tests modifying the natural period of the platform in this case it is clear in fig 11 that the maximum response has changed from the range of 14 16 s to 16 18 s for closed chambers therefore one of the most interesting findings of the present analysis is the limited influence of the pto on natural periods the openings here analysed cover a wide range of damping rates see openings in table 5 so the normal operation of an owc has limited influence over platform dynamics however emergency shut downs or chambers changing from open to closed may lead to significant changes in the performance of the floating body as can be seen in fig 11 where heave and pitch show substantial variations moreover comparing the rao results obtained with those obtained from the oc4 initiative where a reference semisubmersible platform was tested numerically and experimentally robertson et al 2014 it can be concluded that pitch heave and surge values show similar amplitudes for example for 10 s wave period regarding the loads on the mooring system see fig 13 the x axis represents the wave period while the y axis represents the mean peak trough value of the series the tensions measured at the four fairleads shown similar values for any opening situation therefore the dynamics of the owc has a limited influence over the mooring system also in fig 13 the dotted line without symbol represents the static loading conditions table 11 taking into account that the surge response at free surface level was almost the same for all configurations see fig 11 it could be concluded that the behavior of the mooring system is directly related to the horizontal displacement once again the mean peak loads observed in the most loaded lines are similar to the loads observed on the oc4 semisubmersible platform for equivalent regular waves robertson et al 2014 also based on the regular wave tests the mean drift forces were measured once the initial transient dynamics were extinguished in fig 12 the drift forces have been represented by the square of the wave amplitude to get the surge qtf fig 12 shows a peak around 18 s heave natural period as expected moreover an even larger second peak can be identified around 8 s this peak is closely related with the natural period of the chamber which is around 7 s despite some differences can be found between opened and closed chambers they are limited for all periods analyzed therefore even if the owc may introduces some differences in the platform performance they are limited the mean wave energy production is presented in fig 14 giving representative results of the behavior of the owc system power production has been evaluated based on the method described in section 3 the subplots in fig 14 represent the wave energy production per wave period and owc opening the x axis represents the wave period seconds while the y axis is the mean wave power production equation 3 the subplot on the left shows the production of owc 1 center subplot corresponds to owc 2 and right subplot corresponds to owc 3 see fig 10 the maximum wave energy production was generated under the opening po2 opening ø 0 02 m situation fig 14 so the damping introduced by a 0 02 opening was closer to the optimum damping than that obtained with a po3 opening furthermore the maximum wave energy was produced for relatively low periods close to the natural heave period of the owcs 7 s for periods higher than 16 s the wave energy production was invariable for any opening configuration this was due to the wave period being far away from the owcs natural heave period and the fact that the free surface inside the chamber followed wave free surface variations from the mean production of the chambers represented in fig 14 it was obvious that chambers openings were not optimized in future works using ad hoc numerical models armesto et al 2016 the chambers openings will be optimized in order to maximize wave energy production 5 3 2 regular wave tests with wind fig 15 represents the rao of movements of the platform and fig 16 the loads on the mooring system mean of the peak and trough values of regular wave tests under wind action uw 11 5 m s regarding the owc s upper opening these tests were carried out with open and closed chambers the static offset due to the wind effect can be checked in table 11 comparing fig 15 where the offset was not considered and fig 11 raos regular wave without wind the shape of both figures is very similar however the pitch amplification and consequently also the surge at the nacelle is lower for the wind tests as it has been observed in hall and goupee 2018 who tested the reference deepcwind semisubmersible platform in fact for the period of 14 s the pitch reaches 1 6 with wind and 2 3 without wind regarding surge it reaches 2 m with and without wind this phenomenon is due to the wind force which introduces aerodynamic damping in the system limiting the motions due to wave action but adding an extra surge excursion table 11 fig 16 shows the mean peak and trough values of the loads on the mooring system fairleads the dotted line is the mean offset load for a wind speed of 11 5 m s table 7 as expected in the front lines the loads amplitude value from peak to trough is higher in fig 16 regular wave tests with wind than in fig 13 regular wave tests without wind for tests with wind the platform presents a mean offset in the surge direction see table 11 i e when the platform is displaced from the initial position without environmental loads small motions incite higher mooring system loads in the front lines this phenomenon can be checked comparing fig 13 regular wave without wind and fig 16 regular wave with wind where in the specific case of period 22 s and line 1 front the oscillations of first order due to wave action are around 245250 n for regular wave tests fig 13 and around 490500 n for regular wave and wind tests fig 16 for the back lines this phenomenon is the opposite the oscillation of line 3 being of 25 tons without wind and 15 tons with wind comparing the magnitude of the drift forces fig 12 with the wind s static load magnitude fig 16 dotted line and table 11 it can be observed that the wind loads are one order of magnitude larger than the drift forces it can be concluded that the influence of the wind turbines over the platforms dynamics is higher in comparison with the owc influence wind turbine introduces important changes in the platform motions as well as in the mooring dynamics 5 3 3 operational sea states as stated before the operational sea states were performed with different owc openings open po1 and po2 due to the high number of operational sea states only the most representative results will be presented in this section in order to evaluate the operation sea states results properly the experimental tests table 8 were divided into two different groups group 1 operational tests with wind owc top opening po2 tests 49 to 57 group 2 operational tests without wind owc top opening open po1 and po2 tests 58 to 70 for operational tests with wind group 1 tests 49 to test 57 different wind velocities uw 6 11 5 and 16 m s and sea states hs 1 88 tp 9 15 hs 3 tp 10 39 hs 5 tp 11 92 were tested to evaluate the operability of the wind turbine 3 sea states with 3 different wind velocities total of 9 tests fig 17 shows the maximum and minimum value of the nacelle s accelerations left and platform s pitch angles right reached in each test which are the parameters used to define the wind turbine operation the parameter hm0 2 tp is represented at the x axis of fig 17 which is representative of the incident wave energy in each test the tests have been grouped according to wind velocity maximum nacelle accelerations were always lower than 1 8 m s2 while maximum pitch was also lower than 3 5 both values for the highest operational sea state hs 5 tp 11 92 fig 17 it has to be noticed that usually the maximum nacelle accelerations and tilts are governed by turbine requirements however it is assumed that during operational conditions for indicative purposes the maximum acceleration accepted is of 0 3g and the maximum tilt of about 10 this confirms that for the most representative sea states of the selected location the operation range of the wind turbine will be wide what means that the wind turbine will be working continuously except for occasional extreme events furthermore fig 17 shows that for the same sea state hs and tp and different wind velocities 6 11 5 16 m s the accelerations and pitch tilts measured during the wave tank tests were almost equal as a result of the active ballast system for the most severe operational sea state test 57 hs 5 m tp 11 92 s and uw 11 5 m s and owcs top opening po2 the maximum load on the mooring system was of 230 tons line 1 fig 18 presents the power spectrum and the load time series the load time series has been decomposed into high and low frequencies fig 18 with a cut frequency of 0 045 hz for line 1 and test 57 table 12 presents the static load taking into account the steady wind pretension see table 11 and the most representative statistics of loads associated to the total time series total loads high frequency dynamic loads and low frequency dynamic loads it should be highlighted that in table 11 second order wave forces introduce an extra mooring load offset of 7 9 tons moreover the maximum dynamic load is directly related with first order effects high frequency while second order wave forces are responsible for the major part of the standard deviation of the mooring line forces with regard to the mup s movements the maximum nacelle movements registered during this test were 9 45 m in surge 2 5 m in heave and 3 49 in pitch furthermore in order to evaluate the influence of wind speed in owc production wave energy production was represented as a function of wind speed and sea state fig 19 peak period of the sea state represented in the x axis however it should be highlighted that unlike in fig 14 these values were obtained for different wave heights which may affect the results due to non linear effects in the chambers the sea states represented in fig 19 were hs 1 88 tp 9 15 hs 3 tp 10 39 and hs 5 tp 11 92 and po2 the results show that wave energy production was not modified when wind velocity varied fig 19 x axis peak period of each sea state evaluated s y axis mean production kw therefore it can be concluded that wind velocity has no influence on owc production this phenomenon could be due to the fact that owc power production depends on the relative heave motions between the water trapped in the chamber and the structure comparing the rao with wind fig 15 and without wind fig 11 it becomes evident that heave relative motions are almost equal and therefore owc production for a selected sea state is equal under any wind condition for the operational tests without wind group 2 owc production was obtained for the different opening conditions open po1 and po2 and represented in fig 20 as expected the maximum wave energy production was also reached for opening po2 as well as with regular wave tests further investigations should be made in order to optimize power production 5 4 survival sea states the survival sea states tested were composed of a combination of wave wind and currents action on the mup as a summary of the results obtained for the survival sea states table 13 and table 14 show the maximum movements registered at the nacelle the maximum loads at the fairleads and the maximum accelerations at the nacelle turbine manufacturers usually set tilt and nacelle acceleration limits also for survival conditions some indicative limits based on previous experiences are given next 1 maximum non operating tilt 15 and 2 maximum non operating nacelle acceleration 0 6g based on them it can be concluded that the movements the platform shows under survival conditions are within the limits commonly accepted by the industry what is more it shows a very limited maximum pitch and maximum nacelle acceleration 6 conclusions this paper is focused on the physical model testing and analysis of a new multi use platform developed within the framework or the fp7 project mermaid armesto et al 2016 the coupled wave wind current basin tests allowed us to understand the hydrodynamic platform response under different environmental conditions operational and survival conditions in addition different owc chambers opening were evaluated in order to 1 evaluate the influence of the pto over the platform response 2 find the chamber opening that maximizes the wave energy production taking into account the previous considerations a complete set of results was obtained leading to the following conclusions the natural periods vary from 18 88 s to 15 17 s heave 23 7 s 15 65 s roll and 23 65 s 15 44 s pitch depending on the openness of the chambers fully open owc chamber increase the natural period while fully close chamber reduces the natural period therefore important changes on platform performance are induced by chamber hydrodynamics in the case of the surge sway and yaw dof the natural periods remain constant for any condition of chamber opening from the rao analyses it can be concluded that the platform gives a low response with a fully or partially open chamber moreover when the chambers are open or partially open one of the most interesting findings is the limited influence of the pto over the platform s dynamic response indicating that the normal operation of the owcs has limited influence in the platform s dynamics from the rao analysis it can also be concluded that the po2 chamber opening configuration maximizes power production lower opening diameter tested however further investigations are needed to optimize power production for wave periods higher than 16 s wave energy production is the same for any chamber opening condition from the irregular wave tests it is highly remarkable the importance of second order effects in the platform and mooring system response for instance in the fig 18 it can be checked that in the mooring system spectrum the energy associated to the low frequencies is higher than the energy associated to the high frequencies wave frequency range it has also been evidenced that different wind velocities do not affect over the chambers dynamics the existence of a dynamic pitch control limits the influence of the wind turbine over the wave power production in operating conditions the influence of the owc is limited however the influence of the wind turbine is very relevant it introduces higher motions and mooring system loads with regard to the survival sea states the maximum nacelle acceleration was lower than 2 1 m s2 the maximum pitch was 9 51 and the maximum load on the mooring system was higher than 1400 tons the loads observed suggest that the mooring system needs to be re shaped in order to find a more cost effective solution analyzing the owc power production the optimization of the orifice and chamber is still needed in order to increase the wave energy production acknowledgements this work was part of the

23022,understanding the hydrodynamic performance of floating energy converters is a complex challenge hence physical modelling is necessary to evaluate the performance of innovative designs and validate them the present paper shows the experimental work performed to validate a new floating semisubmersible structure which combines wave energy converters 3 oscillating water columns owc and wind harvesting 5 mw wind turbine to characterize the global response of the platform as well as the owcs performance an innovative wave tank testing campaign was carried out at the cantabria coastal and ocean basin ccob the multi use platform was characterized under the incidence of regular wave tests with and without wind operational sea states and survival sea states combining waves currents and wind during the tests wind was reproduced with a portable wind generator and the wind turbine was simulated as a drag disk the owc air turbines were experimentally conceptualized by different diameter openings on the upper part of each owc this paper describes the experimental testing campaign carried out at the ccob and presents the most significant experimental results obtained such as natural periods movements loads on the mooring system or accelerations which are representative of the performance of the multi use platform presented keywords floating multi use platform wind energy wave energy physcical modelling hydrodinamic response 1 introduction based on the global objective of reducing co2 emissions the european commission has boosted the development of new renewable energy concepts during the last years within this framework and also motivated by the firm decision of supporting blue growth activities the development of marine renewable energies mre has gained special importance within the different mre resources floating offshore wind and wave energy are two of the most promising ones however the floating offshore wind and wave energy sectors are currently at very different stages of maturity as regards wind driven energy even if there are some experimental floating wind turbines under development jonkman and matha 2011 and a series of pilot wind farms are set to demonstrate the technical and commercial viability of the technology only 50 mw of floating wind power have been installed globally up to date carbon trust 2018 the experimental prototypes are trying to unlock vast areas with high rates of wind resource at deep and ultra deep conditions in the case of wave energy converters wec the wide variety of concepts under development is a clear indicator of the immaturity of the sector falcão 2010 however there are signs of technology convergence around the owc working principle despite the important differences between fowts floating offshore wind turbines and wecs the main barrier for the offshore development of both systems are the high costs mainly related to operation and maintenance o m and installation expenses the suitable combination of different renewable energy conversion systems in the same platform offers significant opportunities to reduce the cost of energy and can notably contribute to the sustainable exploitation of the marine natural resources pérez collazo et al 2015 furthermore linking the development of the immature sector of wave energy to offshore wind provides a unique opportunity to speed up its process towards commercialization taking into account the aforementioned considerations looking for synergies between different ocean uses has become hot topic in this context the european commission has supported the development of new multi use platforms mups to increase clean energy production and reduce the offshore renewable energy cost by sharing common costs and risks mups are offshore structures both floating or fixed which integrate different uses in the same platform for instance different energy converters wind current turbines or wave energy converters or even aquaculture cages may be combined in a single platform mups are thus an alternative to ocean space distribution administration planning sharing allowing important advantages such as the minimization of environmental impacts and the reduction of installation and o m costs recently several eu funded research projects such as marina platform marina platform n d h2ocean h2ocean project n d tropos tropos project n d or mermaid project mermaid project n d have focused on the development of mup concepts conceived to be installed at different european locations the search for the most suitable combination of energy conversion systems has led to intensive investigation researchers worldwide have presented several concepts and have faced different challenges for instance wan et al 2016a 2016b 2015 presented a hybrid concept composed of a spar floating wind turbine and a torus shape heaving buoy wec they stated that maintaining the structural integrity of the platform under extreme sea states was challenging especially for the wecs hence several experimental campaigns were performed to test different survivability modes for the platform wan et al 2015 michailides et al 2016 also studied a hybrid floating concept composed of a 5 mw wind turbine and three rotating flap type wecs the novelty of the concept presented in this paper is that it combines wind energy generation with the owc wave energy generation technology in a robust semisubmersible platform according to several authors pérez collazo et al 2015 one of the major problems of semisubmersible platforms for marine renewable uses are the non easily avoidable movements of the system therefore the owc devices considered in the present work contribute to the attenuation of these movements by improving the stability of the platform in addition one of the main advantages of the owc in comparison with other wave energy conversion systems is its robustness since all the moving elements turbine and relief valves are emerged o sullivan and murphy 2013 already outlined the development of a large v shaped concrete floating platform incorporating several owc devices and a wind turbine they performed reduced scale tank testing to extrapolate power production and feed a project lifetime cost estimation model in contrast the motivation of the present work is to implement an experimental study of the hydrodynamics of the platform since the hydrodynamic optimization of a design is a key aspect for the future energy production maximization and o m cost reduction furthermore it is important to highlight that the results of this experimental campaign will be used for the validation of numerical modelling tools which will significantly contribute to cost efficient optimization of this type of concepts in the context of the mermaid project funded by the european commission within the 7th framework programme four mups have been conceptually designed for the atlantic ocean the baltic sea the north sea and the mediterranean sea respectively christensen et al 2015 in this paper the hydrodynamic response of the mup designed for the atlantic site is analyzed which was composed of three owc devices and a wind turbine the atlantic site considered is an offshore area located in north of spain just in front of the santander shore line the met ocean conditions of the atlantic site are widely described in zanuttigh et al 2013 the bathymetry of the site varies between 50 and 250 m of water depth the mup proposed for the atlantic site fig 1 is a floating concrete semisubmersible structure based on patent pct es2013 000 165 guanche et al n d that combines wind and wave energy converters the platform is an equilateral triangle composed by four columns three external ones conforming the triangle and a central one bounded by submerged beams which reinforce the whole structure fig 1 the mup incorporates oscillating water columns owc around surrounding the external columns while the central column supports a nrel 5 mw wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 the mooring system is based on four conventional catenary lines the aim of this paper is to understand the hydrodynamic response of a semisubmersible mup that combines wind nrel 5 mw and wave energy converters x 3 oscillating water columns on the one hand the working principle of the owc is simple owc devices consist on half submerged chambers keeping a trapped air pocket above a column of water and with an air turbine installed on the chamber ceiling the wave incidence provokes the oscillation of the free surface inside the chamber pushing the air through the turbine in and out and generating electricity in the case of floating owc devices energy is harvested based on the relative displacement between the floating structure and the water mass inside on the other hand wind s kinetic energy is converted into electrical energy by means of a nrel 5 mw wind turbine further details about the nrel 5 mw wind turbine are available in jonkman et al 2009 based on the complexity of the physical processes associated to the platform s response under different environmental conditions it is necessary to carry out a detailed wave current and wind tank testing program in order to 1 understand the performance of the mup for several owc chambers openings under operational and survival conditions movements accelerations and mooring system loads will be evaluated 2 provide quantitative estimations of the owcs production furthermore several owc chambers openings were simulated in order to find the chamber opening and therefore the recommend pto damping that maximizes the wave energy production 3 estimate the effect of the wind speed in the wave energy production 4 provide a detailed information for the calibration of numerical models the present paper has been divided into four sections 1 description of the experimental set up basin characteristics measurement instruments physical model description laboratory wind turbine and owc chambers 2 description of the experimental tests decay tests wave wind and current test 3 results and discussion and 4 conclusions 2 description of the prototype the proposed multi use platform has been designed based on an in house patent guanche et al n d the final mup is a triangular semisubmersible platform formed by 4 columns and designed to be installed at deep water locations the mup is equipped with a 5 mw wind turbine supported in the central column and three owcs placed around the external columns see fig 10 where the owc is the grey part of the columns the four columns are bounded by submerged beams and a triangular heave plate finally to reduce the mup weight the external columns owcs the top deck and the central tower were designed as steel elements while the rest of the mup s elements were designed in concrete the combination of these materials increases the stability of the platform and optimizes the manufacturing costs the main characteristics of the platform are shown in fig 2 and table 1 the mup also incorporates an active ballast water system to avoid high tilt angles due to wind action each external column has an individual pump system which allows filling emptying the central area of the column blue zone in fig 2 in order to modify the mass distribution the column s ballast modification is based on the incident wind velocity and direction liquid ballast has not been employed in the tests but the corresponding free surface effect has been taken into account based on the inertia of the free surfaces and the platform buoyancy the equivalent elevation of the centre of gravity has been calculated the consequence is a reduction in the metacentric height during the tests this effect has been simulated by means of a modification of the platform centre of gravity see fig 7 the mooring system has been designed for a location with a water depth of 105 m full met ocean conditions are available in zanuttigh et al 2013 this mooring system is based on four steel catenary lines and has a dry weight of 367 5 kg m and length of 570 m the column receiving the most important wave and wind loads is moored to the seabed by two lines separated 90 the mooring system layout is shown in fig 8 3 experimental set up 3 1 basin characteristics the wave current and wind tests were performed at the cantabria coastal and ocean basin ccob fig 3 managed by ihcantabria spain table 2 describes the main characteristics and generation capabilities of the facility which suitably fits with the experimental campaign defined 3 2 physical model characteristics taking into account the platform prototype s dimensions and the characteristics of the basin the selected scale to perform the wave wind current tests was 1 35 normally the scaling of the hydraulics models is carried out applying the froude scaling laws of similitude where the inertial and gravity forces in waves gravity is the primary restoring force are constant in full and laboratory scale the froude scaling laws of similitude have been applied successfully in the offshore industry to evaluate the interaction between waves and structures dnvgl rp205 dnv gl 2017 in order to be consistent with wave loads the wind loads will also be scaled following the froude scaling laws of similitude other methods to scale physical models such as reynolds criterion inertial forces and viscous forces are constant in both scales should be taken into account in those cases where the viscous forces are predominant therefore according to dnvgl rp205 dnv gl 2017 the scaling of offshore experimental testing is carried out following the froude s scaling laws of similitude table 3 shows the main froude laws of similitude journée and massie 2001 applied during the physical testing the physical model was completely built in steel see fig 4 table 4 summarizes the comparison between the targeted mass definition and that obtained during the quality control tests of the mockup regarding the wec system the owc pto was conceptualized by various holes openings see fig 4 the opening of the chambers was placed at the top of the owc four different top opening configurations of the owc were tested in order to simulate different conditions of air circulation through it see table 5 1 the three chambers completely open the 5 orifices completely open 2 the three chambers partially open 1 orifice completely open opening diameter 0 033 m further referred to as po1 3 the three chambers partially open 1 orifice partially open opening diameter 0 02 m further referred to as po2 and 4 the three chambers completely closed the 5 orifices closed the wind turbine was simulated as a drag disk the drag disk see fig 5 and table 6 allows the simulation of the wind thrust force as a result of the air flow provided by the gevi see fig 5 this technique has been successfully used in the past by other authors roddier et al 2010 in the development of windfloat technology the wind generator gevi was calibrated in order to reproduce the wind loads of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine journée and massie 2001 the wind calibration was carried out generating air flows through gevi and measuring the wind loads with a tri axial load cell located just below nacelle the gevi capabilities only allow us the generation of steady wind conditions therefore only the wind velocities selected were calibrated the fig 6 shows the thrust forces calibrated 6 11 5 16 50 m s it should be highlighted that when using the drag disk technique negative damping dynamics wind turbine control changes or turbulent wind speeds cannot be represented in the particular case of negative damping dynamics it has to be noticed that above the rated speed turbine thrust force curve usually shows a negative derivative because of that the negative damping cannot be represented based on a drag disk drag forces derivative is always positive however the impact of this limitation is limited because most of the floating offshore wind turbines already include improved control systems to mitigate negative damping induced resonance issues because of that the drag disk is an efficient and robust method to validate the performance of the mup under constant wind speeds the laboratory mooring system was built using conventional steel chains that reproduce the lineal weight of the full mooring system the weight of the laboratory mooring system was 0 301 kg m target weight 0 306 kg m the back lines length was 11 11 m see fig 8 meanwhile the front lines length was 17 03 m a plant view of the basin the physical model semisubmersible platform and lines of the mooring system and the measurement instruments employed is shown in fig 8 3 3 basin instrumentation fig 8 shows the location of the wave gauges used during the experimental tests prior to executing the wave tank tests with the physical model in place each selected sea state was calibrated without it two arrays of wave gauges akamina technologies n d and current velocity gauges were used during the calibration stage the incident and reflected waves were calculated applying mansard and funke 1980 methodology the first array was placed in the position theoretically occupied by the mup while the second one was located behind it the second array was maintained in the same position during the whole testing phase in order to monitor the simulated waves during the physical model tests the free surface measured with the second array was compared with the results measured during the wave calibration in order to verify the hydrodynamic performance of the mup the movements 6 dof were measured in the centre of the wind turbine and also in the geometric centre of the intersection between the floating platform and the mean water level x 0 y 0 0 514 m above the heave plate the motion capture system used was qualisys qualisys n d figs 8 and 9 and fig 10 present the sign convention used during the tests program nacelle accelerations xyz were also measured in order to verify that the inertial forces due to the platform movements do not generate failures in the rna rotor and nacelle components the loads on the mooring system were measured using a set of axial load cells located at the fairlead position the forces over the drag disk were measured using a tri axial load cell to measure force and moments in 6 dof model k6d40 from me system installed under the nacelle the potential energy of the owcs was obtained based on the potential hydro mechanical energy available in order to estimate the power production of the owc devices due to the reduced scale of the experiments 1 35 and based on previous works the air in the owc chambers was assumed incompressible during tank testing falcão and justino 1999 iturrioz et al 2014 however the spring like effect of air compressibility should not be neglected in full scale devices where the chamber height attains several meters sarmento and falcão 1985 equations 1 3 show the equations used to obtain the instantaneous power production the total energy generated and the mean power production during a specific sea state respectively instantaneous production iturrioz 2014 1 p o w e r t z t δ p t s where z t internal chamber free surface velocity δ p increased pressure s chamber area total

total time simulated based on equations 1 3 the evaluation of the owcs power performance required recording pressures and the free surface velocity inside the owc chambers thus pressure sensors and wave gauges were installed inside the chambers the free surface velocity was obtained as the time derivation of the free surface time series η t the pressure sensors were located at the top cover of the chambers whereas the wave gauges were installed inside the chambers and around the whole perimeter fig 10 see central render the free surface sensor is the green line the chamber wave gauges were capacitive sensors akamina technologies n d used to calculate the average water level inside each owc iturrioz et al 2014 4 description of the experimental tests the tank testing program was divided into characterization tests to evaluate the hydrodynamic performance of the mup decay test tilt test and static offset test wave wind current tests to evaluate the behavior of the mup under operational and survival conditions and to calculate the wave energy production different wave conditions were selected to check the platform s dynamic response 1 regular wave 2 operational sea states and 3 survival tests given the high directional variability of wind waves and currents incidence at site the most unfavourable condition of coaligned wind waves and currents was selected to test experimentally hence the wave wind and current direction was always of 0 see figs 8 and 10 during the tests performed in this section all the parameters are provided in full scale 4 1 characterization tests decay tests were performed to determine the natural periods and the non dimensional damping journée and massie 2001 these tests were performed with 6 dof and without 3 dof heave roll pitch the mooring system decay tests were also conducted with the owc chambers open and closed in order to calculate the amount of water trapped in the owcs during the tests depends on the water trapped in the owc the hydrodynamic response of the mup could change modifying the natural periods and damping coefficients of heave roll and pitch 4 2 wave wind tests after the characterization tests a set of regular waves with and without wind were performed the regular wave tests were conducted for different owc openings 1 open 2 closed 3 po1 and 4 po2 see table 7 the range of regular wave periods was from 8 to 25 s wave height was constant 3 m and wind speed was 11 m s table 7 summarizes the regular wave tests matrix operational tests irregular sea states were also performed with different owc openings 1 po1 2 po2 and 3 open as with the regular wave tests the operational tests were also performed with and without wind three wind speeds were tested 6 m s 11 5 m s and 16 m s three significant wave heights were tested 1 88 m 3 m and 5 m peak periods were between 7 and 25 s furthermore a set of operational sea states were also simulated under currents 0 9 m s but they are not included in table 8 because these tests are not discussed in the present paper a total of 25 operational tests were carried out including the different openings of the oscillating water columns table 8 shows the operational test matrix survival sea states were performed with the owc top open which permits neglecting the pneumatic part of the problem since the air pressure in the chamber remains atmospheric iturrioz et al 2014 the survival sea states were carried out combining waves wind and currents table 9 shows the sea states selected to check the mup s response under survival conditions finally maintaining the mup fixed to a metallic framework a set of regular wave tests was also programmed in order to study the hydrodynamic response of the owc uncoupled from the platform motions the results obtained from this set of tests allowed the numerical calibration of the oscillating water column damping coefficients armesto et al 2016 5 results and discussion with the aim of facilitating the interpretation and understanding of the experimental results all data and figures in this section are presented at prototype scale 1 1 5 1 hydrodynamic characterization tests for simplification purposes only results of the decay tests are shown and summarized in this section table 10 decay tests with without mooring system and two chamber opening conditions completely open and closed table 10 reflects an important influence of the owc s top opening when the chambers are open maximum opening natural periods are far from natural wave frequencies all reaching values higher than 19 s it has to be highlighted that natural periods below this threshold are likely to be excited by wave action however when chambers are closed heave roll and pitch natural periods show reduced values of down to 15 s which leads to a natural period that might be easily exited by waves action these variations in the natural period are due to the modification of two terms the added water mass in the owcs and the second moment of waterplane area when the upper openings of the owc chambers are closed the water enclosed inside the owc chambers follows the mup s movements therefore the water columns become part of the structure which increase the platform inertia and generates an increment in the natural periods however there is an additional effect due to the increment of the water plane area which causes an increase in the hydrostatic stiffness considering these two effects it has been identified the increment in the metacentric height as the overriding factor which results in a reduction of the natural periods of the platform on the other hand when the upper opening of the chamber is fully open the water plane area is lower and therefore the platform s natural periods are increased variations in the natural period occur for the dofs of heave roll and pitch table 10 while the natural periods of surge sway and yaw remain constant at all degrees of chamber openings surge sway and yaw natural periods are directly related to the mooring system stiffness therefore chamber opening does not influence and hence the natural periods are not modified comparing free decay results with those of moored decay table 10 we can assure that when the mup is moored the damping coefficients are higher and the natural periods are lower than under free floating conditions 5 2 static condition of the mup under wind and current action in order to evaluate the influence of the wind and currents over the initial platform positions and mooring system loads the table 11 presents the mup s mean static position as well as the mean mooring system loads when the mup is subjected to different steady wind velocities u w 0 6 11 5 and 16 m s and permanent currents cu 0 9 m s based on the thrust curve of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine shown in fig 6 the maximum offsets and mooring loads are shown for a wind velocity of 11 5 m s see table 11 under this loading condition the tension on the front lines increased by a 27 compared to the initial condition wind and current speed 0 m s regarding the horizontal displacement surge of the mup it moved 3 8 m away from the static position without wind furthermore the mup s active ballast system allows correcting the tilt angles due to the wind effect as expected the pitch angle induced by the wind force was negligible table 10 with regard to the current effect over the platform response we can check that a current of 0 9 m s generates a platform response quite similar as the effect generated by a 6 m s wind velocity producing an increasing of 10 in the front lines pre load and a horizontal offset of 1 6 m 5 3 waves wind and currents tests 5 3 1 regular wave tests without wind or currents fig 11 fig 13 and fig 14 present the movement surge heave and pitch loads and wave energy production obtained from regular wave tests without wind or currents see table 7 fig 11 presents the rigid body motion empirical response amplitude operators raos of the platform during these tests curves plotted correspond to different upper openings of the owcs tested open po1 po2 and closed the rao functions fig 11 indicate that the natural periods obtained under regular wave conditions are in line with the results measured in the moored decay tests table 10 for open or partially open conditions from the results given in fig 11 we can conclude that the mup shows only slight variations between totally or partially open owc chambers open po1 po2 its hydrodynamic response being low in these cases partially or totally open chambers with the most common natural wave periods lower than 20 s the motion amplifications raos is always below 1 m m in heave or 1 deg m in pitch and roll these thresholds in the response amplitude operators rao are considered a good indicator of the seakeeping of the platform as regards results for completely closed owc chambers the hydrodynamic response of the platform was totally different heave and pitch compared with the rest of configurations decay tests provide the natural periods with low amplitude oscillations 0 5 m in full scale in contrast regular wave excitation induces much larger oscillations taking into account the non linear effects heave plates complex geometry mass water inside the added mass can be modified in comparison with the results of decay tests modifying the natural period of the platform in this case it is clear in fig 11 that the maximum response has changed from the range of 14 16 s to 16 18 s for closed chambers therefore one of the most interesting findings of the present analysis is the limited influence of the pto on natural periods the openings here analysed cover a wide range of damping rates see openings in table 5 so the normal operation of an owc has limited influence over platform dynamics however emergency shut downs or chambers changing from open to closed may lead to significant changes in the performance of the floating body as can be seen in fig 11 where heave and pitch show substantial variations moreover comparing the rao results obtained with those obtained from the oc4 initiative where a reference semisubmersible platform was tested numerically and experimentally robertson et al 2014 it can be concluded that pitch heave and surge values show similar amplitudes for example for 10 s wave period regarding the loads on the mooring system see fig 13 the x axis represents the wave period while the y axis represents the mean peak trough value of the series the tensions measured at the four fairleads shown similar values for any opening situation therefore the dynamics of the owc has a limited influence over the mooring system also in fig 13 the dotted line without symbol represents the static loading conditions table 11 taking into account that the surge response at free surface level was almost the same for all configurations see fig 11 it could be concluded that the behavior of the mooring system is directly related to the horizontal displacement once again the mean peak loads observed in the most loaded lines are similar to the loads observed on the oc4 semisubmersible platform for equivalent regular waves robertson et al 2014 also based on the regular wave tests the mean drift forces were measured once the initial transient dynamics were extinguished in fig 12 the drift forces have been represented by the square of the wave amplitude to get the surge qtf fig 12 shows a peak around 18 s heave natural period as expected moreover an even larger second peak can be identified around 8 s this peak is closely related with the natural period of the chamber which is around 7 s despite some differences can be found between opened and closed chambers they are limited for all periods analyzed therefore even if the owc may introduces some differences in the platform performance they are limited the mean wave energy production is presented in fig 14 giving representative results of the behavior of the owc system power production has been evaluated based on the method described in section 3 the subplots in fig 14 represent the wave energy production per wave period and owc opening the x axis represents the wave period seconds while the y axis is the mean wave power production equation 3 the subplot on the left shows the production of owc 1 center subplot corresponds to owc 2 and right subplot corresponds to owc 3 see fig 10 the maximum wave energy production was generated under the opening po2 opening ø 0 02 m situation fig 14 so the damping introduced by a 0 02 opening was closer to the optimum damping than that obtained with a po3 opening furthermore the maximum wave energy was produced for relatively low periods close to the natural heave period of the owcs 7 s for periods higher than 16 s the wave energy production was invariable for any opening configuration this was due to the wave period being far away from the owcs natural heave period and the fact that the free surface inside the chamber followed wave free surface variations from the mean production of the chambers represented in fig 14 it was obvious that chambers openings were not optimized in future works using ad hoc numerical models armesto et al 2016 the chambers openings will be optimized in order to maximize wave energy production 5 3 2 regular wave tests with wind fig 15 represents the rao of movements of the platform and fig 16 the loads on the mooring system mean of the peak and trough values of regular wave tests under wind action uw 11 5 m s regarding the owc s upper opening these tests were carried out with open and closed chambers the static offset due to the wind effect can be checked in table 11 comparing fig 15 where the offset was not considered and fig 11 raos regular wave without wind the shape of both figures is very similar however the pitch amplification and consequently also the surge at the nacelle is lower for the wind tests as it has been observed in hall and goupee 2018 who tested the reference deepcwind semisubmersible platform in fact for the period of 14 s the pitch reaches 1 6 with wind and 2 3 without wind regarding surge it reaches 2 m with and without wind this phenomenon is due to the wind force which introduces aerodynamic damping in the system limiting the motions due to wave action but adding an extra surge excursion table 11 fig 16 shows the mean peak and trough values of the loads on the mooring system fairleads the dotted line is the mean offset load for a wind speed of 11 5 m s table 7 as expected in the front lines the loads amplitude value from peak to trough is higher in fig 16 regular wave tests with wind than in fig 13 regular wave tests without wind for tests with wind the platform presents a mean offset in the surge direction see table 11 i e when the platform is displaced from the initial position without environmental loads small motions incite higher mooring system loads in the front lines this phenomenon can be checked comparing fig 13 regular wave without wind and fig 16 regular wave with wind where in the specific case of period 22 s and line 1 front the oscillations of first order due to wave action are around 245250 n for regular wave tests fig 13 and around 490500 n for regular wave and wind tests fig 16 for the back lines this phenomenon is the opposite the oscillation of line 3 being of 25 tons without wind and 15 tons with wind comparing the magnitude of the drift forces fig 12 with the wind s static load magnitude fig 16 dotted line and table 11 it can be observed that the wind loads are one order of magnitude larger than the drift forces it can be concluded that the influence of the wind turbines over the platforms dynamics is higher in comparison with the owc influence wind turbine introduces important changes in the platform motions as well as in the mooring dynamics 5 3 3 operational sea states as stated before the operational sea states were performed with different owc openings open po1 and po2 due to the high number of operational sea states only the most representative results will be presented in this section in order to evaluate the operation sea states results properly the experimental tests table 8 were divided into two different groups group 1 operational tests with wind owc top opening po2 tests 49 to 57 group 2 operational tests without wind owc top opening open po1 and po2 tests 58 to 70 for operational tests with wind group 1 tests 49 to test 57 different wind velocities uw 6 11 5 and 16 m s and sea states hs 1 88 tp 9 15 hs 3 tp 10 39 hs 5 tp 11 92 were tested to evaluate the operability of the wind turbine 3 sea states with 3 different wind velocities total of 9 tests fig 17 shows the maximum and minimum value of the nacelle s accelerations left and platform s pitch angles right reached in each test which are the parameters used to define the wind turbine operation the parameter hm0 2 tp is represented at the x axis of fig 17 which is representative of the incident wave energy in each test the tests have been grouped according to wind velocity maximum nacelle accelerations were always lower than 1 8 m s2 while maximum pitch was also lower than 3 5 both values for the highest operational sea state hs 5 tp 11 92 fig 17 it has to be noticed that usually the maximum nacelle accelerations and tilts are governed by turbine requirements however it is assumed that during operational conditions for indicative purposes the maximum acceleration accepted is of 0 3g and the maximum tilt of about 10 this confirms that for the most representative sea states of the selected location the operation range of the wind turbine will be wide what means that the wind turbine will be working continuously except for occasional extreme events furthermore fig 17 shows that for the same sea state hs and tp and different wind velocities 6 11 5 16 m s the accelerations and pitch tilts measured during the wave tank tests were almost equal as a result of the active ballast system for the most severe operational sea state test 57 hs 5 m tp 11 92 s and uw 11 5 m s and owcs top opening po2 the maximum load on the mooring system was of 230 tons line 1 fig 18 presents the power spectrum and the load time series the load time series has been decomposed into high and low frequencies fig 18 with a cut frequency of 0 045 hz for line 1 and test 57 table 12 presents the static load taking into account the steady wind pretension see table 11 and the most representative statistics of loads associated to the total time series total loads high frequency dynamic loads and low frequency dynamic loads it should be highlighted that in table 11 second order wave forces introduce an extra mooring load offset of 7 9 tons moreover the maximum dynamic load is directly related with first order effects high frequency while second order wave forces are responsible for the major part of the standard deviation of the mooring line forces with regard to the mup s movements the maximum nacelle movements registered during this test were 9 45 m in surge 2 5 m in heave and 3 49 in pitch furthermore in order to evaluate the influence of wind speed in owc production wave energy production was represented as a function of wind speed and sea state fig 19 peak period of the sea state represented in the x axis however it should be highlighted that unlike in fig 14 these values were obtained for different wave heights which may affect the results due to non linear effects in the chambers the sea states represented in fig 19 were hs 1 88 tp 9 15 hs 3 tp 10 39 and hs 5 tp 11 92 and po2 the results show that wave energy production was not modified when wind velocity varied fig 19 x axis peak period of each sea state evaluated s y axis mean production kw therefore it can be concluded that wind velocity has no influence on owc production this phenomenon could be due to the fact that owc power production depends on the relative heave motions between the water trapped in the chamber and the structure comparing the rao with wind fig 15 and without wind fig 11 it becomes evident that heave relative motions are almost equal and therefore owc production for a selected sea state is equal under any wind condition for the operational tests without wind group 2 owc production was obtained for the different opening conditions open po1 and po2 and represented in fig 20 as expected the maximum wave energy production was also reached for opening po2 as well as with regular wave tests further investigations should be made in order to optimize power production 5 4 survival sea states the survival sea states tested were composed of a combination of wave wind and currents action on the mup as a summary of the results obtained for the survival sea states table 13 and table 14 show the maximum movements registered at the nacelle the maximum loads at the fairleads and the maximum accelerations at the nacelle turbine manufacturers usually set tilt and nacelle acceleration limits also for survival conditions some indicative limits based on previous experiences are given next 1 maximum non operating tilt 15 and 2 maximum non operating nacelle acceleration 0 6g based on them it can be concluded that the movements the platform shows under survival conditions are within the limits commonly accepted by the industry what is more it shows a very limited maximum pitch and maximum nacelle acceleration 6 conclusions this paper is focused on the physical model testing and analysis of a new multi use platform developed within the framework or the fp7 project mermaid armesto et al 2016 the coupled wave wind current basin tests allowed us to understand the hydrodynamic platform response under different environmental conditions operational and survival conditions in addition different owc chambers opening were evaluated in order to 1 evaluate the influence of the pto over the platform response 2 find the chamber opening that maximizes the wave energy production taking into account the previous considerations a complete set of results was obtained leading to the following conclusions the natural periods vary from 18 88 s to 15 17 s heave 23 7 s 15 65 s roll and 23 65 s 15 44 s pitch depending on the openness of the chambers fully open owc chamber increase the natural period while fully close chamber reduces the natural period therefore important changes on platform performance are induced by chamber hydrodynamics in the case of the surge sway and yaw dof the natural periods remain constant for any condition of chamber opening from the rao analyses it can be concluded that the platform gives a low response with a fully or partially open chamber moreover when the chambers are open or partially open one of the most interesting findings is the limited influence of the pto over the platform s dynamic response indicating that the normal operation of the owcs has limited influence in the platform s dynamics from the rao analysis it can also be concluded that the po2 chamber opening configuration maximizes power production lower opening diameter tested however further investigations are needed to optimize power production for wave periods higher than 16 s wave energy production is the same for any chamber opening condition from the irregular wave tests it is highly remarkable the importance of second order effects in the platform and mooring system response for instance in the fig 18 it can be checked that in the mooring system spectrum the energy associated to the low frequencies is higher than the energy associated to the high frequencies wave frequency range it has also been evidenced that different wind velocities do not affect over the chambers dynamics the existence of a dynamic pitch control limits the influence of the wind turbine over the wave power production in operating conditions the influence of the owc is limited however the influence of the wind turbine is very relevant it introduces higher motions and mooring system loads with regard to the survival sea states the maximum nacelle acceleration was lower than 2 1 m s2 the maximum pitch was 9 51 and the maximum load on the mooring system was higher than 1400 tons the loads observed suggest that the mooring system needs to be re shaped in order to find a more cost effective solution analyzing the owc power production the optimization of the orifice and chamber is still needed in order to increase the wave energy production acknowledgements this work was part of the

23023,ship to ship transfer operations primarily used to transfer crude oil petroleum and other chemical products between ocean going ships i e lightering operations are commonly conducted worldwide because a deep draft of a large ship limits its access to ports in areas where the water depth is too great for anchoring cargo is transferred to another rigidly moored ship running slowly this operation is called underway transfer during this process the maneuvering service ship ss approaches and berths from the port side to the starboard side of the large ship to be lightered stbl after mooring the ss stops its engine and behaves as a towed ship meanwhile the stbl maintains its steerage on a steady course responsible for all maneuvers to reduce the possibility of accidents the maneuverability of this unique combined two ship unit should be further investigated in this study a very large crude carrier vlcc and an aframax tanker are used as the stbl and ss two scenarios are considered for the two ship unit the full load stbl with the ballasted ss and the half load stbl with the full load ss these are assumed to be different stages of the cargo transfer process free running model tests and captive model tests are conducted and a mathematical model for maneuvering simulation of such a front back and left right asymmetric two ship unit is presented additionally full scale simulations are performed based on the results of experiments and simulations the change in maneuverability according to the progress of the cargo transfer is assessed the combined two ship unit needs a large advance and transfer when turning to port especially in the case of the half load stbl with the full load ss the difference of left and right turning abilities is significant in terms of the directional stability the combined unit condition during underway transfer would be preferable to running alone keywords maneuverability underway transfer two ship unit free running model test towing tank model test maneuvering simulation 1 introduction ship to ship sts transfer operations primarily used to transfer crude oil petroleum and other chemical products between ocean going ships i e lightering operations are commonly conducted worldwide this operation is required because a deep draft of a large ship limits its access to ports owing to water depth additionally it is more economical to move products in a large ship over the bulk of the distance and to transfer it to smaller ships near the destination than moving the same amount of them over the entire distance in a number of smaller ships marine board committee and national research council 1998 p 14 this report refers to another report by zharen 1994 which presents a key example i e when shipping oil from the arabian gulf directly to a port in the gulf of mexico in service sized vessels it would cost 70 more than moving the same amount of oil by means of sts operations the number of sts operations is currently increasing and the size of ships is increasing to take advantage of economies of scale nikolaos and dimitrios 2013 pointed out that the trading factors involved with offshore storage in tankers caused by the contango situation is a reason for the significant development contango is a situation where the futures price of a commodity is higher than the anticipated spot price at maturity of the futures contract meanwhile the risk of collision or other accidents are always a concern whereas an sts operation procedure is mostly established indeed in a brief report the club s loss prevention department of steamship mutual 2010 several collisions were reported to have occurred off the south eastern coast of the united kingdom over a short period of time when the number of sts operations in the area increased considerably in 2009 the sts transfer guide published by ics ocimf 2005 describes not only a procedure for sts operations involving one ship positioned at anchor but also a procedure for berthing alongside with two ships under power whereas the former case is common the latter case has been adopted in the open ocean where the water depth is too great for anchoring and tug assistance cannot be expected because it is far from the port during this operation the maneuvering service ship ss should approach and berth from the port side to the starboard side of the constant heading ship to be lightered stbl after berthing the cargo transfer between two ships rigidly moored to each other is conducted while running slowly this operation is called underway transfer the ss keeps its rudder amidship and stops its engines acting like a towed ship the stbl towing the ss aside by mooring lines is responsible for all maneuvers including collision avoidance this is considered a combined two ship unit with fore aft and left right asymmetry whereas the ship is supposed to move sufficiently small and slowly unusual situations may impose a large amount of stress on the operator to reduce the possibility of potential accidents caused by human maneuvering it is necessary to understand the maneuverability of this kind of two ship unit hydrodynamic interaction between ships has been studied for meeting and overtaking situations or lightering and replenishment operations newton 1960 first presented experimental results of interaction effects between two ships close aboard during overtaking in deep water dand 1977 discussed the physical causes of hydrodynamic interaction and also presented experimental results of interaction loads while passing on parallel courses dand 1981 in these days the research group at ghent university presented captive experimental studies on sts interaction e g vantorre et al 2002 and lataire et al 2011 theoretically tuck and newman 1974 examined the hydrodynamic interaction between two ships moving in deep water whereas yeung 1978 studied the same interaction in shallow water by applying the slender body theory and matched asymptotic expansion yasukawa 2003 and xiang and faltinsen 2010 calculated non lifting hydrodynamics interaction loads using a 3 dimensional boundary element method xiang et al 2011 continuously simulated all processes of underway lightering maneuvers as realistically as possible by following the guide book ics ocimf 2005 there are currently also many studies based on computational fluid dynamics e g mousaviraad et al 2011 and zou and larsson 2013 notably two ships move independently in all studies listed above whereas a two ship unit engaged in underway transfer does not appear from the viewpoint of operation safety during underway transfer this study aims to discuss the maneuverability of the combined two ship unit captive model tests are conducted and a mathematical model of the maneuvering simulation for a front back and left right asymmetric ship are established this model is validated with a comparison of the results of the simulations and free running model tests additionally based on a full scale simulation the change in maneuverability per the progress of cargo transfer is discussed 2 subject ship 2 1 combination of ships a combination of a very large crude carrier vlcc and aframax tanker is standard for ships engaged in sts transfers in this study kvlcc2 a second variant of a korean vlcc and some experimental data opened in simman workshop 2008 is used as the stbl meanwhile the aframax tanker model designed with reference to the same type of the ship of lataire et al 2009 is used as the ss for the experiments of this study 1 110 scale model ships are used whereas a propeller is attached to the stbl model to produce propulsion a rudder is installed in both models and the rudder in the ss model is permanently fixed neutral during the experiments thus the hydrodynamic loads measured in the captive model tests include the contributions of this rudder 2 2 loading conditions during lightering in which cargoes are transferred from the stbl to the ss i e from the vlcc to the aframax tanker in this study the loading conditions for each ship change according to the progress of the operation it is explained as follows defining the abbreviation of each loading condition the full load stbl running alone f stbl is approached by the ss in ballast condition and the berthing and mooring of the two ships are completed prior to off loading this situation is called f stbl b ss representing the combination of the loading conditions of the stbl and the ss where f means full load and b means ballast after a few offloading operations the stbl should have enough shallow draft to enter a port inside to simulate this a combination of the ship to have been lightered and the full load ss is considered this loading condition of the stbl is tentatively called half load and its abbreviation is defined as h therefore this two ship unit is expressed as hstbl bss eventually after unberthing the half load stbl hstbl heads to port to complete offloading operation this study focuses on these four states i e fstbl fstbl bss hstbl fss and hstbl and discuss the change of the maneuverability among them the ships principal particulars in each loading condition are listed in table 1 the mean draft of the ss is 8 3 m ballast and 15 m full load respectively they are the same conditions as cited in lataire et al 2009 the full load draft of the stbl is 20 8 m determined on the basis of data given by simman workshop 2008 and the half load draft is assumed to be 15 12 m which is the similar order of magnitude to the draft of the full load ss the principal particulars of the submerged part of the rudder and propeller of the stbl model are also listed in table 2 where k 0 1 2 are the coefficients of the propeller thrust open water characteristic k t ref eq 9 3 mathematical model of a combined two ship unit 3 1 coordinate system the coordinate system is shown in fig 1 o x 0 y 0 z 0 is the right hand

a two ship unit the origin m is defined at the midship and on the center line of the left side stbl x y are the coordinate values defined as distance from this origin in the longitudinal and lateral directions of the stbl u m and v m are the surge and sway velocities at the midship and u m and β m are the ship s speed and hull drift angle respectively they are calculated as follows 1 u m u m 2 v

mmg standard method yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 motion equations of a two ship unit i e a front back and left right asymmetric ship are originally presented in this study this is a 3 degree of freedom model considering surge sway and yaw motions assuming the metacentric height of tankers sufficiently large the roll coupling effect on maneuvering is negligible when the position of the center of gravity cog of the two ship unit on the horizontal plane is defined as x g y g whose values are specified in table 1 the motion equations of surge sway and yaw based on m x y z are expressed as follows 2 m u m v m r y g r x g r 2 x s m v m u m r x g r y g r 2 y s i m r m x g v m u m r m y g u m v m r n s where differential functions of time are distinguished with a dot above variables m is the ship mass and i m is the moment of inertia of the ship around the origin the external surge force sway force and yaw moment are expressed as x s y s and n s respectively the terms of added masses are separated from the external loads and moved into the left hand side x y and n m are newly defined for the external loads without added masses and eq 2 is rewritten as follows note n m implicitly includes the munk moment 3 m m 11 u m m m 22 v m r m x g m 23 r 2 m 12 v m m 21 u m r m y g m 13 r x m m 22 v m m m 11 u m r m x g m 23 r m 21 u m m 12 v m r m y g m 13 r 2 y i m m 33 r m x g m 32 v m

is also considered because the two ship unit is asymmetric longitudinally and transversely in the case of a normal ship terms surrounded by and m i j i are unnecessary x y and n m are defined by summing load components as follows 4 x x h x r x p y y h y r n m n h n r each subscript h r and p of eq 4 signifies the loads acting on the hull rudder and propeller respectively hereinafter non dimensional variables are distinguished with l p p of the stbl is consistently used as the representative length i e l p p 0 for the non dimensionalization of the length scale 3 3 hydrodynamic loads acting on hull the naked hull loads are defined as follows 5 x h 1 2 ρ l p p 0 d 0 u m 2 x h y h 1 2 ρ l p p 0 d 0 u m 2 y h n h 1 2 ρ l p p 0 2 d 0 u m 2 n h where ρ is the water density here the full load mean draft of the stbl is consistently adopted as d 0 to easily compare the magnitude of the non dimensional loads among different conditions x h y h and n h are expressed by the 3rd order polynomial equations with respect to β m and r r l p p 0 u m 6 x h x 0 x β β m x r r x β β β m 2 x β r β m r x r r r 2 x β β β β m 3 x β β r β m 2 r x β r r β m r 2 y h y 0 y β β m y r r y β β β m 2 y

resistance coefficient and y 0 and n 0 are the steady components of the non dimensional hydrodynamic loads caused by the asymmetric ship the hydrodynamic derivatives e g x β β y β and n r represent the magnitude of the loads caused by the maneuvering motions because the maneuvering motion is assumed to be sufficiently small during underway transfer a circular motion test is conducted within r 0 2 thus the derivative with respect to r 3 which is considered a too high order term is omitted from the above equations 3 4 propeller thrust the propeller thrust x p is defined as the thrust with some deduction 7 x p 1 t p t where 8 t ρ n p 2 d p 4 k t j p where t p is a thrust deduction factor n p is the number of propeller revolutions k t is the propeller thrust open water characteristic calculated as follows 9 k t k 0 k 1 j p k 2 j p 2 j p is the propeller advanced ratio defined as follows 10 j p u m 1 w p n p d p the wake coefficient at the propeller position w p changes according to the maneuvering motion expressed as follows 11 1 w p 1 w p 0 c 1 β p c 2 β p β p 2 where 12 β p β m x p r w p 0 is the wake coefficient when sailing straight and this value is adjusted in the following simulation depending on the scale of the simulated ship i e w p 0 m o d e l or w p 0 s h i p β p is the geometrical inflow angle to the propeller in maneuvering motions c i i 1 2 are experimental constants representing the wake characteristic c i takes the values of c i in starboard maneuver β p 0 and c i in port maneuver β p 0 respectively eq 11 is applicable while β p is smaller than a threshold β p β p m a x and 1 w p 1 w p β p β p max is applied to other ranges of β p x p is the geometrical longitudinal coordinate of the propeller based on m x y z and its non dimensional value x p x p l p p 0 is set at 0 48 3 5 hydrodynamic loads by steering the surge force sway force and yaw moment induced by steering are defined as follows 13 x r 1 t r f n sin δ y r 1 a h f n cos δ n r x r a h x h f n cos δ where t r a h and x h are hull and rudder interaction parameters x r is the geometrical longitudinal coordinate of the rudder based on m x y z and its non dimensional value x r x r l p p 0 is set at 0 5 the rudder normal force f n can be calculated as follows 14 f n 1 2 ρ a r u r 2 f α sin α r f α is the lift gradient coefficient calculated by fujii s formula fujii and tuda 1961 15 f α 6 13 λ 2 25 λ where λ is the aspect ratio of the rudder u r is the resultant inflow velocity to the rudder and α r is the effective inflow angle to the rudder they are calculated as follows 16 u r u r 2 v r 2 17 α r δ δ 0 p r o p e l l e r v r u r where δ 0 p r o p e l l e r is the check helm angle caused by the average lateral flow induced by propeller rotation at the rudder position the longitudinal accelerated inflow velocity component to the rudder u r is estimated by the following equation 18 u r ε u m 1 w p η 1 κ 1 8 k t π j p 2 1 2 1 η where η is the ratio of propeller diameter to rudder height d p h r ε is the ratio of wake fraction at the propeller and rudder positions and κ denotes an experimental constant the lateral inflow velocity component to the rudder v r is expressed using the flow straightening coefficient γ r 19 v r u m γ r β r where 20 β r β m l r r γ r takes the values of γ r in the starboard maneuver β r 0 and γ r in port maneuver β r 0 respectively where β r is the effective inflow angle to the rudder in maneuvering motions and is expressed with the effective longitudinal coordinate of the rudder position l r this is a non dimensional value defined by l r l p p 0 3 6 estimation of added mass coefficients added mass tensor m i j i j 1 2 3 is theoretically calculated by using the surface singularity distribution method based on newman s textbook newman 1977 with the assumption of the rigid free surface because of the sufficiently small speed it is defined as follows 21 m i j ρ s h ϕ j ϕ i n d s this equation is the surface integral over the wetted hull surface s h where ϕ i ϕ j represents the velocity potential caused by body motion with unit velocity in the ith jth mode they satisfy both rigid free surface and hull surface conditions n denotes the derivative in the direction of the unit normal directed out of the fluid the added masses are non dimensionalized by 0 5 ρ l p p 0 l d 0 the power index l takes 2 for m 11 m 22 m 12 and m 21 4 for m 33 and 3 for others to check the convergence of the solution according to the number of panels arranged on the hull surface we first validate the non dimensional added masses for the full load stbl fig 2 shows the results of m 11 m 22 and m 33 estimated by arranging 720 and 1320 panels we can see they are sufficiently converged for reference when comparing the added masses estimated by the so called motora s empirical charts motora 1959 1960a 1960b shown in the same figure the validation of these values seems to be acceptable thus 1320 panels are adopted for the hull surface of one ship i e fstbl and hstbl and its double panels 2640 panels are used for the combined two ship unit fstbl bss and hstbl fss table 3 lists the calculated result of added masses under each loading condition because added masses of combined two ship units are evaluated while arranging both ships aside they include the influence of the interaction between the stbl and ss from this table we can see that the timman newman symmetry relation for the added mass timman and newman 1962 which states that the cross coupling coefficients between various motions have symmetry properties i e m i j m j i is acceptably satisfied fig 3 shows the result of m 11 m 22 and m 33 the value of m 22 has a little difference between fstbl and fstbl bss and between hstbl fss and hstbl meanwhile comparing fstbl bss and hstbl fss m 22 clearly becomes smaller with a decrease of the draft of the stbl i e from the full load draft to the half load draft this is caused by the decrease of lateral projected area the same tendency mentioned above applies to m 33 regarding m 11 the two ship units are subject to the large m 11 because of the large frontal projected area 4 captive model test 4 1 outline of the captive model test as described in 2 2 the loading conditions changes as f stbl f stbl b ss h stbl f ss and h stbl during underway transfer therefore our concerns apply to the change of maneuverability among these four states and they are investigated by captive model tests the outline of the experiments is explained below for f stbl b ss h stbl f ss and h stbl resistance test self propulsion test rudder force test oblique towing test and circular motion test with a combination of a yaw rate and hull drift angle are conducted the speed through the water should be minimal during the operation in our experiment tests are conducted at a sufficiently slow speed i e froude number f n 0 055 where the length of the stbl model is used for its definition propeller revolutions are set at the model self propulsion point mspp indicating the self propelled loading condition of this model ship the load cell is located at midship of the stbl model the dynamometers are installed to measure the propeller thrust and rudder normal forces for f stbl sano and yasukawa 2008 presented its experimental coefficients used for a maneuvering mathematical model and most are available for this study however because our target speed f n 0 055 is much slower than in their study i e f n 0 142 only resistance and self propulsion tests are conducted 4 2 setup of the combined two ship unit when the ss is arranged on the starboard side of the stbl a suitable gap corresponding to the fender size should be given between the two ships we estimate the diameter of the fender as 3 3 m for our target combination of ships per the sts transfer guide ics ocimf 2005 because the aim of this study is to investigate a very slow low frequency and steady maneuvering motion of ships during underway transfer the two ships are rigidly connected while keeping the gap equivalent to 3 3 m at a full scale the way of this simplified experimental setup would be accepted when acknowledging that the fenders which prevent tankers from approaching too closely and the mooring lines which prevent them from separating away can suppress the large relative movement of these two ships thus in the case of a two ship unit we measure the hydrodynamic loads acting on this combined hull including the interaction between them in close proximity each hydrodynamic derivative identified by these data includes the same interaction too fig 4 shows the setup of the captive model test in the towing tank 4 3 resistance and self propulsion tests because the wave making resistance can be neglected owing to the sufficiently slow speed the total resistance is considered to the sum of the frictional and viscous pressure resistances introducing form factor k which is defined as the constant of proportionality of the frictional resistance and represents the magnitude of the viscous pressure resistance the total resistance coefficient c t is expressed as follows ittc 1999 22 c t 1 k c f here c t corresponds to x 0 1 2 ρ s u m 2 or x 0 l p p 0 d 0 s where s is the wetted surface area the friction resistance coefficient c f is estimated by the following schoenherr s flat plate frictional resistance formula conn et al 1953 23 c f 0 463 l o g 10 r e 2 6 where r e is the reynolds number the fig 5 shows the comparison of k for different conditions the form factor increases by 19 42 and 5 for f stbl b ss h stbl f ss and h stbl respectively more than the form factor of f stbl this indicates that a significant increase in viscous pressure resistance occurs especially in the stage of h stbl f ss the fig 5 also shows the result of 1 t p and 1 w p 0 s h i p in which w p 0 s h i p is the full scale wake coefficient converted by the 1978 ittc formula ittc 1999 the reduction of 1 w p 0 s h i p indicates that the wake at the propeller position of the stbl increases when it is under the half load condition i e h stbl f ss and h stbl 4 4 rudder force test fig 6 presents the non dimensional rudder normal force f n 1 2 ρ l p p 0 d 0 u m 2 versus the rudder angle at different propeller loadings obtained by this experiment each broken line is the result estimated by eq 14 using the determined experimental constants and non dimensionalized they agree well with the experimental plots the interaction parameters between the rudder and the hull t r a h and x h x h l p p 0 are determined fig 7 shows their values and the value of a h x h x r representing the increased ratio of the yaw moment is also presented in particular the effect of the loading condition of the stbl on a h seems significant the large value of a h for fstbl and fstbl bss where the stbl is under the full load condition indicates that the large interaction lateral force acts on the hull by steering resulting in a large interaction yaw moment meanwhile because the interaction parameters of between fstbl and fstbl bss or between hstbl fss and hstbl are similar there seems to be no significant influence on these parameters by towing the ss aside 4 5 oblique towing test and circular motion test 4 5 1 hydrodynamic loads during maneuvering figs 8 10 show the hydrodynamic surge force sway force and yaw moment around the stbl midship acting on the maneuvering bare hull obtained by subtracting the load components of the propeller and rudder from the measured results of the oblique towing and circular motion tests the terms including the added mass components are distinguished by the symbol with respect to fstbl bss and hstbl fss maneuvering loads are not symmetrical for example the sway force that acts on the hull of fstbl bss when moving at r β m 0 20 is larger than when moving in the opposite direction i e 0 20 in another example the direction of yaw moment on the hull of hstbl fss is not symmetric between 0 2 16 and 0 2 16 we see the linearity and the gradient of these loads with respect to the maneuvering motions depends substantially on the loading conditions a least squares method is applied to the experimental plots and all hydrodynamic derivatives used in eq 6 are identified they are listed in tables 4 6 the hydrodynamic derivatives of fstbl were quoted from sano and yasukawa 2008 as mentioned in section 4 1 the first and third order derivatives of the surge force and the second order derivatives of the sway force and yaw moment with respect to β m and r represent the magnitude of the load asymmetry between the port and starboard maneuvering motions therefore only the two ship units fstbl bss and hstbl fss whose combined hull is asymmetrical have a value for their terms additionally fstbl bss and hstbl fss have constant terms y 0 and n 0 the polynomial trend lines based on the regression formula are drawn in figs 8 10 they agree well with the experimental plots 4 5 2 linear derivatives of the sway force and yaw moment the linear derivatives of the sway force and yaw moment with respect to the hull drift angle and yaw rate are shown in fig 11 because the stbl carries a lot of cargo and has a deep draft at the beginning of its underway transfer a large aspect ratio d m l p p of fstbl and fstbl bss contributes to the large lift force and resultant yaw moment indeed y β and n r m 23 representing the magnitude of the damping sway force and yaw moment are large in these conditions next when comparing fstbl bss with fstbl or hstbl fss with hstbl we see that the two ship units take the larger value of y β considering that a lift force is a main component of the sway force acting on a naked hull in small oblique towing we may consider that the asymmetric hull of the combined two ship unit could contribute to the larger lift force than the symmetric hull of the stbl alone because it behaves as an airfoil with a camber which is known to generate a larger lift force than a symmetric airfoil this result in a larger value of y β here we define the point of application of the sway force in small oblique towing as follows because y β β m can be considered the non dimensional sway force induced by small oblique towing and n β β m is the resultant yaw moment around the midship of the stbl the ratio between the liner derivatives n β y β represents the non dimensional value of its longitudinal coordinate of the sway force from the midship this value changes from 0 45 to 0 27 in the stage from fstbl to fstbl bss indicating the point of application of the sway force is moved from the bow toward the midship of the stbl by mooring the ss aside by contrast it shifts forward again after unmooring n β y β changes from 0 19 to 0 31 in the stage from hstbl fss to hstbl in terms of y r m 11 it seems to decrease as the operation progresses 4 5 3 directional stability of the naked hull dynamic stability requires that the homogeneous solutions of a pair of coupled linear differential equations for the sway and yaw velocities exponentially decay to zero over time newman 1977 the following index c l is used as a criterion for determining whether these solutions or motions decay or not 24 c l n r g m 23 y r g m 11 m n β g y β g where 25 y β g y β y r g y r x g y β n β g n β x g y β y g x β n r g n r x g n β x g y r x g 2 y β y g x r x g y g x β the linear derivatives defined at the midship of the stbl can be converted to the derivatives defined at the cog of the stbl for fstbl and hstbl or defined at the cog of the two ship unit for fstbl bss and hstbl fss from eq 25 the index for the directional stability is defined using these converted derivatives here the first term of eq 24 signifies the longitudinal coordinate of the point of application of the sway force during yaw motion defined from the cog and non dimensionalized by l p p 0 a positive value indicates a forward direction the second term is the equivalent term for sway if c l takes a positive value this ship is directionally stable fig 12 shows index c l and each point of application of the sway force in pure sway and pure yaw 1st and 2nd terms of eq 24 comparing fstbl with hstbl the negative value of c l of fstbl grows larger than that of hstbl indicating the directional stability of the full load condition has worsened because the block coefficient of the full load stbl is 0 81 and that of the half load stbl is 0 783 as listed in table 1 it can be intuitively understood that the directional stability of the blunter ship i e fstbl is worse with respect to the two ship unit we see that the directional stability of fstbl bss is better than fstbl further improvement occurs in the case of hstbl fss fig 12 indicates that this is mainly caused by the drastic change of the point of application of the sway force during sway motion i e n β g y β g whereas the equivalent term for yaw does not change significantly this fact reduces the negative value of c l when the loading condition changes from fstbl to fstbl bss and the sign of c l eventually turns positive in the case of hstbl fss in conclusion running as a two ship unit during underway transfer seems to be generally advantageous to directional stability although the extent of the improvement depends on the combination of the loading conditions of these two ships it would contribute to operational safety by enhancing the ability to maintain course stably 4 5 4 estimation of the flow straightening coefficient the actual inflow angle on the rudder while maneuvering becomes smaller than the geometrical inflow angle because of the presence of the hull and propeller slip stream this straightening phenomenon is expressed by γ r and l r in eqs 19 and 20 and they are identified for fstbl bss hstbl fss and hstbl the constants for fstbl are quoted from sano and yasukawa 2008 because l r is known to take a value close to 1 0 yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 it is assumed 1 0 here only γ r is identified in this study using the oblique towing and circular motion tests specifically by inputting the u r calculated by eq 18 and the observed rudder normal force f n into eq 14 v r is estimated using a back calculation technique fig 13 shows the estimated v r v r u m versus β r which is calculated by eq 20 for a variety of combinations of β m and r and in which the linear fitting lines are also drawn note from eq 19 the gradient γ r which takes a different value according to the sign of β r corresponds to γ r and γ r fig 14 shows the result of the straightening coefficient the value of γ r is consistently smaller than γ r which is known due to the influence of the propeller rotation the influence of the stbl s draft seems significant the straightening phenomenon increases i e the value decreases when the stbl is under the half load condition a comparison of γ r between fstbl and fstbl bss or hstbl fss and hstbl shows that the straightening phenomenon of the stbl increases by towing the ss aside during underway transfer 5 free running model test and simulation sts operations normally take many hours while several offloadings are completed thus it is possible that the ships may not be able to maintain a straight course for the entire operation for example xiang et al 2011 who numerically discussed the interaction loads between two ships assumed that the underway lightering operation takes place between areas of restricted maritime operations following a part of circular path predefined by the maritime authorities in this study the maneuverability of the two ship unit engaged in underway transfer is investigated with free running model tests and maneuvering simulations the values of coefficients used in the mathematical model but not given from table 1 to table 6 can be found in table a 1 in appendix a 5 1 outline of free running model test free running model tests in calm water are conducted in the marine dynamics basin length 60 m breadth 25 m depth 3 2 m at the national research institute of fisheries engineering japan four loading conditions fstbl fstbl bss hstbl fss and hstbl are tested because ship maneuvers should be sufficiently small during operation a straight course keeping test and a 10 turning test are conducted the ship speed is set the same as that in the captive model test f n 0 055 fig 15 shows a photo of the free running model test the prism reflectors set at the stbl model are tracked to measure ship position and the heading angle and yaw rate are also measured by the gyration the ship surge and sway speeds and the hull drift angle are calculated based on these data the test procedure is as follows after launching an autopilot control proportional derivative control is used to control the heading angle for course keeping the stbl steers after reaching the designed ship speed and it starts turning 5 2 helm angle and equilibrium hull drift angle fig 16 shows the check helm angle required to maintain a straight course δ 0 the label exp indicates the average of the time series of the rudder angle and hull drift angle measured while running straight note that δ 0 for fstbl and hstbl is equal to δ 0 p r o p e l l e r in eq 17 which is taken to cancel the lateral rudder force caused by the propeller rotational effect meanwhile larger angles would be required for two ship units during underway transfer i e fstbl bss and hstbl fss because they additionally need to counter steady hydrodynamic loads caused by the asymmetric combined hull whereas the value of the check helm angle does not seem critically large the reduction of rudder deflection margin would be a concern in terms of the hull drift angle in the equilibrium condition β 0 which is also shown in the same figure we see that only a small hull drift angle seems sufficient for the course keeping cal the solution of the equilibrium conditions based on the linearized non modular type mathematical model is also plotted for the combined unit conditions fstbl bss and hstbl fss this estimation method is explained in appendix b the results of cal follows the results of exp 5 3 turning test with 10 rudder angle 5 3 1 turning trajectory fig 17 shows the turning trajectory with a 10 rudder angle non dimensionalized by division using l p p 0 each run is suspended when the ship heading angle reaches 90 because the tank width is insufficient to complete the turning trajectory owing to small steering the non dimensional values of the longitudinal distance from the start point to the end point i e advance ad and the lateral i e transfer tr are shown in figs 18 and 19 cal is also shown in these figures indicating the results of the turning simulation presented later for the starboard turning δ 10 the trajectories are similar regardless of the loading conditions we see the values of advance and transfer do not change much during underway transfer in contrast the difference in trajectories advance and transfer for different conditions is significant when turning to port δ 10 and the turning performance of the two ship unit deteriorates for example the advance of hstbl fss reaches about seven ship lengths about 1 43 times longer than the advance of hstbl because a large steering would be undesirable to avoid excessive towing loads the degraded port turning ability under two ship unit conditions is worth considering for safe maneuvering 5 3 2 time series of ship motions the surge velocity u g lateral velocity v g and hull drift angle β g all defined at the cog are calculated as follows 26 u g u m y g r v g v m x g r β g tan 1 v g u g fig 20 and fig 21 show the time series of u g β g and yaw rate r for turning starboard and port respectively as expected from the turning trajectory in fig 17 hstbl having the smallest displacement shows a quick response to both starboard and port steering meanwhile the yaw rate for fstbl bss and hstbl fss appears to be different according to the turning direction the yawing motion of the two ship unit slowly develops after steering to port and the yaw rate converges to a smaller value than when turning to starboard the time series of the surge velocity and hull drift angle is also asymmetrical for the different turning maneuvers 5 3 3 comparison with turning simulation to validate the established mathematical model of maneuvering motions of ships engaged in underway transfer a maneuvering simulation in calm water is conducted and compared to the experimental results the initial speed is set to f n 0 055 and the number or revolutions of the stbl s propeller is adjusted at mspp 7 89 9 32 9 26 and 7 11 rps for each fstbl fstbl bss hstbl fss and hstbl condition in terms of w p 0 the model scale wake coefficient w p 0 m o d e l is adopted in this model scale turning simulation as specified in table a 1 in appendix a the water temperature is considered as 20 degree celsius fig 22 shows the turning trajectory calculated for 300 s and the corresponding time series results of each motion up to 100 s are shown in figs 23 and 24 the mark x in this figure indicates the ship position at the 90 heading change the simulated trajectories are similar to the experimental ones of fig 17 the advance and transfer are shown as cal in figs 18 and 19 they agree well with the results of experiment the turning performance of the two ship unit for fstbl bss and hstbl fss which deteriorates when turning to port can be explained well by this simulation whereas the estimation accuracy is not perfect e g the steady yaw rate of fstbl bss during turning to port the simulated time series of ship motions can explain the results of the experiment as a whole for example the simulation can explain the steady yaw rate of hstbl and fstbl which reaches 1 5 s and that of hstbl fss which reaches about 1 s it can also capture the behavior of yaw rate convergence when turning to starboard 6 full scale simulation the mathematical model validated in section 5 was applied to a full scale simulation the total resistance coefficient for the full scale ship c t s was extrapolated from the 1978 ittc performance prediction method ittc 1999 27 c t s 1 k c f s where c f s the full scale frictional resistance coefficient was calculated by schoenherr s formula conn et al 1953 and the form factor k was maintained as the same value as the experiment s note wave making resistance was neglected because of the slow speed the wake coefficient of the scale model w p 0 m o d e l was also converted to full scale w p 0 s h i p based on the 1978 ittc formula ittc 1999 and it is used as w p 0 for the full scale simulation the ship speed of each condition was determined by the following procedure the dead slow speed of the full load stbl fstbl was assumed to be 5 kn 2 57 m s and the number of propeller revolutions was identified as 0 439 rps based on propeller performance this number of propeller revolutions was applied to the other navigation modes fstbl bss hstbl fss and hstbl and the self propelled speeds resulted in 4 35 kn 2 24 m s for fstbl bss 4 33 kn for 2 23 m s for hstbl fss and 5 36 kn 2 76 m s for hstbl the steering speed was set to 2 32 s 6 1 turning simulation by 10 steering fig 25 presents the trajectory for 2 h after steering and the non dimensional advance and transfer are shown in fig 26 we see that the advance and transfer of the two ship unit when turning to port significantly increase the advance of fstbl bss and hstbl fss are 1 26 times and 1 53 times as large as fstbl respectively and the transfer of fstbl bss is 1 37 times and that of hstbl fss is 1 89 times larger than fstbl thus the asymmetry of the turning ability between port and starboard maneuvers of the two ship unit is notable in particular in the stage of hstbl fss its advance and transfer during port maneuvers increased by 44 and 59 compared to those during starboard maneuvering fig 27 shows the distance traveled when the heading had changed by 10 from the original imo standard imo 1993 requires the initial turning ability of this traveled distance to not exceed 2 5 ship lengths whereas this standard does not cover a two ship unit moving at very slow speeds it exceeds 2 5 l p p 0 in cases of port maneuvers of fstbl bss and hstbl fss for safe operations it might be better to keep in mind the serious deterioration of the turning ability to port during underway transfer 6 2 spiral characteristics the spiral characteristics representing the relation of r β g and u g u 0 with respect to δ are shown in fig 28 where u g is defined as u g 2 v g 2 and u 0 is the initial speed i e 5 kn or 2 57 m s only fstbl has a small spiral loop width because the presence of the rudder behind the working propeller takes on the role of an effective skeg the directional instability of fstbl bss and hstbl caused by the naked hull as discussed in section 4 5 3 is improved and the spiral loop does not appear we see that a significant asymmetry of the spiral characteristics occurs for fstbl bss and hstbl fss the rudder angle at r 0 corresponds to the check helm angle which is required to cancel the yaw moment for going straight in this full scale simulation the check helm angle of hstbl fss was estimated at 4 16 these spiral characteristics clearly indicate that the turning ability to port varies among different conditions more than for starboard this is a consistent argument all through the text 7 conclusions the maneuverability of a combined two ship unit engaged in underway transfer was studied the operation was separated into four stages 1 a full load stbl running alone before the operation starts fstbl 2 a full load stbl towing a ballasted ss aside fstbl bss corresponding to the first stage after berthing and mooring of the two ships 3 a half load stbl towing a full load ss aside hstbl fss assumed to be the final stage after a few offloading operations and 4 a half load stbl running alone with enough shallow draft to enter a port after unberthing hstbl in this study we assumed that the draft of the stbl changed from 20 8 m full load to 15 12 m half load whereas the draft of the ss changed from 8 3 m ballast i e the mean draft at midship to 15 m full load captive model tests were conducted considering these four loading conditions and their mathematical model for maneuvering simulations was presented free running model tests were also conducted with the application of 10 rudder angle because the two ships were rigidly connected throughout the experiments a snap load which is an impulse in acceleration deceleration due to the quick transfer from a slack state to a taut state of the mooring lines was not considered however we assumed this setup was acceptable because a maneuvering behavior while underway transfer occurred very slowly thus a high frequency snap load would not have a severe impact on such a low frequency maneuvering behavior of the combined two ship unit the main conclusions are summarized as follows the effect of the presence of the ss aside on the added masses or propeller rudder force characteristics of the stbl does not seem to be significant however the loading draft of the stbl would have a large impact for example m 22 m 33 1 w p 0 and a h reduce as the draft of the stbl becomes shallow or as the offloading operation progresses the linearity and gradient of the surge force sway force and yaw moment acting on the hull with respect to maneuvering motions substantially depend on loading conditions the asymmetry of these loads between the starboard port maneuvers is significant during underway transfer the directional stability of the full load stbl is improved by towing the ballasted ss aside more improvement is expected nearer the final stage of underway transfer where the half load stbl towing the full load ss aside whereas the extent of improvement depends on the combination of the loading conditions of the two ships we can expect such a combined unit condition would contribute to the operation s safety by enhancing the ability to maintain course the modular type mathematical model for the maneuvering motion of a two ship unit i e the front back and left right asymmetric ship was developed it was validated by comparing the results of simulations and free running model tests the difference of the turning ability between port and starboard maneuvers is significant for two ship units particularly near the end of transfer operation i e hstbl fss condition the turning ability to port deteriorates and the large advance and transfer are needed moreover because of the large check helm angle for course keeping the steering margin reduces during underway transfer this might be unfavorable in case of an emergency acknowledgement the authors are grateful to dr akihiko matsuda and dr daisuke terada for supporting the free running model tests in the marine dynamics basin of

propulsion factors experimental constants representing wake characteristic in maneuvering and other coefficients related to the inflow to the rudder and the rudder hull interaction the value of δ 0 p r o p e l l e r for fstbl and hstbl was based on the results of the free running model tests meanwhile its value for fstbl bss and hstbl fss was an estimated value by the course keeping simulation so

propeller rotational flow a ship can maintain a course with a check helm angle and hull drift angle meanwhile in the case of a combined two ship unit those angles might be large not only because of the propeller rotational flow but also because of the hull body asymmetry here the method for estimating these angles is explained by solving the equilibrium condition based on the following assumptions the equation of the surge motion is neglected because its change is negligible the order of magnitude of the sway motion is o ε where ε represents a small value it implies that the hull drift angle in the equilibrium condition β 0 is also o ε the order of magnitude of the check helm angle δ 0 is o 1 the equations for the non dimensional sway force y and yaw moment n m are expressed simply with third order polynomial equations considering β m r and δ b 1 y y 0 y β β m y r r y δ δ y β δ β m δ y β β δ β m 2 δ n m n 0 n β β m n r r n δ δ n β δ β m δ n β β δ β m 2 δ they are not modular type expressions like eq 4 and they are based on the same concept as abkowitz type mathematical models abkowitz 1964 which consider coupling terms of motion and steering parameters thus each derivative includes the interaction of the hull propeller and rudder those equations are linearized and substituting them into the non dimensionalized eq 3 the equilibrium condition can be expressed as follows b 2 y 0 y β β 0 y δ δ 0 y β δ β 0 δ 0 0 n 0 m 21 n β β 0 n δ δ 0 n β δ β 0 δ 0 0 to identify the derivatives of the coupling term y β δ and n β δ an oblique towing test with steering is required in this study this test was conducted only for the unit conditions fstbl bss and hstbl fss based on results of not only the rudder force test oblique towing test without steering and circular motion test presented in the main text but also the oblique towing test with steering additionally conducted the hydrodynamic derivatives used in eq b 2 were identified and listed in table b1 these values are slightly different from those due to the naked hull shown in tables 4 6 because of the inclusion of the influence of the propeller and rudder for example y 0 decreases and n 0 increases compared to values listed in tables 5 and 6 because the lateral flow in the port direction which occurs at the rudder position due to the propeller rotation causes a lateral force in the port direction y 0 results in taking a larger negative value the resultant yaw moment in a clock wise direction is also given to the hull causing n 0 increases δ 0 and β 0 under the two ship unit conditions fstbl bss and hstbl fss were obtained by solving eq b 2 the results are shown in table b1 and fig 16 table b 1 list of hydrodynamic derivatives of the sway force and yaw moment acting on

because a deep draft of a large ship limits its access to ports in areas where the water depth is too great for anchoring cargo is transferred to another rigidly moored ship running slowly this operation is called underway transfer during this process the maneuvering service ship ss approaches and berths from the port side to the starboard side of the large ship to be lightered stbl after mooring the ss stops its engine and behaves as a towed ship meanwhile the stbl maintains its steerage on a steady course responsible for all maneuvers to reduce the possibility of accidents the maneuverability of this unique combined two ship unit should be further investigated in this study a very large crude carrier vlcc and an aframax tanker are used as the stbl and ss two scenarios are considered for the two ship unit the full load stbl with the ballasted ss and the half load stbl with the full load ss these are assumed to be different stages of the cargo transfer process free running model tests and captive model tests are conducted and a mathematical model for maneuvering simulation of such a front back and left right asymmetric two ship unit is presented additionally full scale simulations are performed based on the results of experiments and simulations the change in maneuverability according to the progress of the cargo transfer is assessed the combined two ship unit needs a large advance and transfer when turning to port especially in the case of the half load stbl with the full load ss the difference of left and right turning abilities is significant in terms of the directional stability the combined unit condition during underway transfer would be preferable to running alone keywords maneuverability underway transfer two ship unit free running model test towing tank model test maneuvering simulation 1 introduction ship to ship sts transfer operations primarily used to transfer crude oil petroleum and other chemical products between ocean going ships i e lightering operations are commonly conducted worldwide this operation is required because a deep draft of a large ship limits its access to ports owing to water depth additionally it is more economical to move products in a large ship over the bulk of the distance and to transfer it to smaller ships near the destination than moving the same amount of them over the entire distance in a number of smaller ships marine board committee and national research council 1998 p 14 this report refers to another report by zharen 1994 which presents a key example i e when shipping oil from the arabian gulf directly to a port in the gulf of mexico in service sized vessels it would cost 70 more than moving the same amount of oil by means of sts operations the number of sts operations is currently increasing and the size of ships is increasing to take advantage of economies of scale nikolaos and dimitrios 2013 pointed out that the trading factors involved with offshore storage in tankers caused by the contango situation is a reason for the significant development contango is a situation where the futures price of a commodity is higher than the anticipated spot price at maturity of the futures contract meanwhile the risk of collision or other accidents are always a concern whereas an sts operation procedure is mostly established indeed in a brief report the club s loss prevention department of steamship mutual 2010 several collisions were reported to have occurred off the south eastern coast of the united kingdom over a short period of time when the number of sts operations in the area increased considerably in 2009 the sts transfer guide published by ics ocimf 2005 describes not only a procedure for sts operations involving one ship positioned at anchor but also a procedure for berthing alongside with two ships under power whereas the former case is common the latter case has been adopted in the open ocean where the water depth is too great for anchoring and tug assistance cannot be expected because it is far from the port during this operation the maneuvering service ship ss should approach and berth from the port side to the starboard side of the constant heading ship to be lightered stbl after berthing the cargo transfer between two ships rigidly moored to each other is conducted while running slowly this operation is called underway transfer the ss keeps its rudder amidship and stops its engines acting like a towed ship the stbl towing the ss aside by mooring lines is responsible for all maneuvers including collision avoidance this is considered a combined two ship unit with fore aft and left right asymmetry whereas the ship is supposed to move sufficiently small and slowly unusual situations may impose a large amount of stress on the operator to reduce the possibility of potential accidents caused by human maneuvering it is necessary to understand the maneuverability of this kind of two ship unit hydrodynamic interaction between ships has been studied for meeting and overtaking situations or lightering and replenishment operations newton 1960 first presented experimental results of interaction effects between two ships close aboard during overtaking in deep water dand 1977 discussed the physical causes of hydrodynamic interaction and also presented experimental results of interaction loads while passing on parallel courses dand 1981 in these days the research group at ghent university presented captive experimental studies on sts interaction e g vantorre et al 2002 and lataire et al 2011 theoretically tuck and newman 1974 examined the hydrodynamic interaction between two ships moving in deep water whereas yeung 1978 studied the same interaction in shallow water by applying the slender body theory and matched asymptotic expansion yasukawa 2003 and xiang and faltinsen 2010 calculated non lifting hydrodynamics interaction loads using a 3 dimensional boundary element method xiang et al 2011 continuously simulated all processes of underway lightering maneuvers as realistically as possible by following the guide book ics ocimf 2005 there are currently also many studies based on computational fluid dynamics e g mousaviraad et al 2011 and zou and larsson 2013 notably two ships move independently in all studies listed above whereas a two ship unit engaged in underway transfer does not appear from the viewpoint of operation safety during underway transfer this study aims to discuss the maneuverability of the combined two ship unit captive model tests are conducted and a mathematical model of the maneuvering simulation for a front back and left right asymmetric ship are established this model is validated with a comparison of the results of the simulations and free running model tests additionally based on a full scale simulation the change in maneuverability per the progress of cargo transfer is discussed 2 subject ship 2 1 combination of ships a combination of a very large crude carrier vlcc and aframax tanker is standard for ships engaged in sts transfers in this study kvlcc2 a second variant of a korean vlcc and some experimental data opened in simman workshop 2008 is used as the stbl meanwhile the aframax tanker model designed with reference to the same type of the ship of lataire et al 2009 is used as the ss for the experiments of this study 1 110 scale model ships are used whereas a propeller is attached to the stbl model to produce propulsion a rudder is installed in both models and the rudder in the ss model is permanently fixed neutral during the experiments thus the hydrodynamic loads measured in the captive model tests include the contributions of this rudder 2 2 loading conditions during lightering in which cargoes are transferred from the stbl to the ss i e from the vlcc to the aframax tanker in this study the loading conditions for each ship change according to the progress of the operation it is explained as follows defining the abbreviation of each loading condition the full load stbl running alone f stbl is approached by the ss in ballast condition and the berthing and mooring of the two ships are completed prior to off loading this situation is called f stbl b ss representing the combination of the loading conditions of the stbl and the ss where f means full load and b means ballast after a few offloading operations the stbl should have enough shallow draft to enter a port inside to simulate this a combination of the ship to have been lightered and the full load ss is considered this loading condition of the stbl is tentatively called half load and its abbreviation is defined as h therefore this two ship unit is expressed as hstbl bss eventually after unberthing the half load stbl hstbl heads to port to complete offloading operation this study focuses on these four states i e fstbl fstbl bss hstbl fss and hstbl and discuss the change of the maneuverability among them the ships principal particulars in each loading condition are listed in table 1 the mean draft of the ss is 8 3 m ballast and 15 m full load respectively they are the same conditions as cited in lataire et al 2009 the full load draft of the stbl is 20 8 m determined on the basis of data given by simman workshop 2008 and the half load draft is assumed to be 15 12 m which is the similar order of magnitude to the draft of the full load ss the principal particulars of the submerged part of the rudder and propeller of the stbl model are also listed in table 2 where k 0 1 2 are the coefficients of the propeller thrust open water characteristic k t ref eq 9 3 mathematical model of a combined two ship unit 3 1 coordinate system the coordinate system is shown in fig 1 o x 0 y 0 z 0 is the right hand space fixed coordinate system with the x 0 y 0 plane referring to the water surface ψ is the ship heading angle from the x 0 axis m x y z is the right hand ship fixed coordinate system in the case of a two ship unit the origin m is defined at the midship and on the center line of the left side stbl x y are the coordinate values defined as distance from this origin in the longitudinal and lateral directions of the stbl u m and v m are the surge and sway velocities at the midship and u m and β m are the ship s speed and hull drift angle respectively they are calculated as follows 1 u m u m 2 v m 2 β m tan 1 v m u m r is the yaw rate and δ is the rudder angle 3 2 motion equations whereas the framework of the mathematical model for maneuvering a ship is based on the maneuvering modeling group mmg standard method yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 motion equations of a two ship unit i e a front back and left right asymmetric ship are originally presented in this study this is a 3 degree of freedom model considering surge sway and yaw motions assuming the metacentric height of tankers sufficiently large the roll coupling effect on maneuvering is negligible when the position of the center of gravity cog of the two ship unit on the horizontal plane is defined as x g y g whose values are specified in table 1 the motion equations of surge sway and yaw based on m x y z are expressed as follows 2 m u m v m r y g r x g r 2 x s m v m u m r x g r y g r 2 y s i m r m x g v m u m r m y g u m v m r n s where differential functions of time are distinguished with a dot above variables m is the ship mass and i m is the moment of inertia of the ship around the origin the external surge force sway force and yaw moment are expressed as x s y s and n s respectively the terms of added masses are separated from the external loads and moved into the left hand side x y and n m are newly defined for the external loads without added masses and eq 2 is rewritten as follows note n m implicitly includes the munk moment 3 m m 11 u m m m 22 v m r m x g m 23 r 2 m 12 v m m 21 u m r m y g m 13 r x m m 22 v m m m 11 u m r m x g m 23 r m 21 u m m 12 v m r m y g m 13 r 2 y i m m 33 r m x g m 32 v m

is also considered because the two ship unit is asymmetric longitudinally and transversely in the case of a normal ship terms surrounded by and m i j i are unnecessary x y and n m are defined by summing load components as follows 4 x x h x r x p y y h y r n m n h n r each subscript h r and p of eq 4 signifies the loads acting on the hull rudder and propeller respectively hereinafter non dimensional variables are distinguished with l p p of the stbl is consistently used as the representative length i e l p p 0 for the non dimensionalization of the length scale 3 3 hydrodynamic loads acting on hull the naked hull loads are defined as follows 5 x h 1 2 ρ l p p 0 d 0 u m 2 x h y h 1 2 ρ l p p 0 d 0 u m 2 y h n h 1 2 ρ l p p 0 2 d 0 u m 2 n h where ρ is the water density here the full load mean draft of the stbl is consistently adopted as d 0 to easily compare the magnitude of the non dimensional loads among different conditions x h y h and n h are expressed by the 3rd order polynomial equations with respect to β m and r r l p p 0 u m 6 x h x 0 x β β m x r r x β β β m 2 x β r β m r x r r r 2 x β β β β m 3 x β β r β m 2 r x β r r β m r 2 y h y 0 y β β m y r r y β β β m 2 y

resistance coefficient and y 0 and n 0 are the steady components of the non dimensional hydrodynamic loads caused by the asymmetric ship the hydrodynamic derivatives e g x β β y β and n r represent the magnitude of the loads caused by the maneuvering motions because the maneuvering motion is assumed to be sufficiently small during underway transfer a circular motion test is conducted within r 0 2 thus the derivative with respect to r 3 which is considered a too high order term is omitted from the above equations 3 4 propeller thrust the propeller thrust x p is defined as the thrust with some deduction 7 x p 1 t p t where 8 t ρ n p 2 d p 4 k t j p where t p is a thrust deduction factor n p is the number of propeller revolutions k t is the propeller thrust open water characteristic calculated as follows 9 k t k 0 k 1 j p k 2 j p 2 j p is the propeller advanced ratio defined as follows 10 j p u m 1 w p n p d p the wake coefficient at the propeller position w p changes according to the maneuvering motion expressed as follows 11 1 w p 1 w p 0 c 1 β p c 2 β p β p 2 where 12 β p β m x p r w p 0 is the wake coefficient when sailing straight and this value is adjusted in the following simulation depending on the scale of the simulated ship i e w p 0 m o d e l or w p 0 s h i p β p is the geometrical inflow angle to the propeller in maneuvering motions c i i 1 2 are experimental constants representing the wake characteristic c i takes the values of c i in starboard maneuver β p 0 and c i in port maneuver β p 0 respectively eq 11 is applicable while β p is smaller than a threshold β p β p m a x and 1 w p 1 w p β p β p max is applied to other ranges of β p x p is the geometrical longitudinal coordinate of the propeller based on m x y z and its non dimensional value x p x p l p p 0 is set at 0 48 3 5 hydrodynamic loads by steering the surge force sway force and yaw moment induced by steering are defined as follows 13 x r 1 t r f n sin δ y r 1 a h f n cos δ n r x r a h x h f n cos δ where t r a h and x h are hull and rudder interaction parameters x r is the geometrical longitudinal coordinate of the rudder based on m x y z and its non dimensional value x r x r l p p 0 is set at 0 5 the rudder normal force f n can be calculated as follows 14 f n 1 2 ρ a r u r 2 f α sin α r f α is the lift gradient coefficient calculated by fujii s formula fujii and tuda 1961 15 f α 6 13 λ 2 25 λ where λ is the aspect ratio of the rudder u r is the resultant inflow velocity to the rudder and α r is the effective inflow angle to the rudder they are calculated as follows 16 u r u r 2 v r 2 17 α r δ δ 0 p r o p e l l e r v r u r where δ 0 p r o p e l l e r is the check helm angle caused by the average lateral flow induced by propeller rotation at the rudder position the longitudinal accelerated inflow velocity component to the rudder u r is estimated by the following equation 18 u r ε u m 1 w p η 1 κ 1 8 k t π j p 2 1 2 1 η where η is the ratio of propeller diameter to rudder height d p h r ε is the ratio of wake fraction at the propeller and rudder positions and κ denotes an experimental constant the lateral inflow velocity component to the rudder v r is expressed using the flow straightening coefficient γ r 19 v r u m γ r β r where 20 β r β m l r r γ r takes the values of γ r in the starboard maneuver β r 0 and γ r in port maneuver β r 0 respectively where β r is the effective inflow angle to the rudder in maneuvering motions and is expressed with the effective longitudinal coordinate of the rudder position l r this is a non dimensional value defined by l r l p p 0 3 6 estimation of added mass coefficients added mass tensor m i j i j 1 2 3 is theoretically calculated by using the surface singularity distribution method based on newman s textbook newman 1977 with the assumption of the rigid free surface because of the sufficiently small speed it is defined as follows 21 m i j ρ s h ϕ j ϕ i n d s this equation is the surface integral over the wetted hull surface s h where ϕ i ϕ j represents the velocity potential caused by body motion with unit velocity in the ith jth mode they satisfy both rigid free surface and hull surface conditions n denotes the derivative in the direction of the unit normal directed out of the fluid the added masses are non dimensionalized by 0 5 ρ l p p 0 l d 0 the power index l takes 2 for m 11 m 22 m 12 and m 21 4 for m 33 and 3 for others to check the convergence of the solution according to the number of panels arranged on the hull surface we first validate the non dimensional added masses for the full load stbl fig 2 shows the results of m 11 m 22 and m 33 estimated by arranging 720 and 1320 panels we can see they are sufficiently converged for reference when comparing the added masses estimated by the so called motora s empirical charts motora 1959 1960a 1960b shown in the same figure the validation of these values seems to be acceptable thus 1320 panels are adopted for the hull surface of one ship i e fstbl and hstbl and its double panels 2640 panels are used for the combined two ship unit fstbl bss and hstbl fss table 3 lists the calculated result of added masses under each loading condition because added masses of combined two ship units are evaluated while arranging both ships aside they include the influence of the interaction between the stbl and ss from this table we can see that the timman newman symmetry relation for the added mass timman and newman 1962 which states that the cross coupling coefficients between various motions have symmetry properties i e m i j m j i is acceptably satisfied fig 3 shows the result of m 11 m 22 and m 33 the value of m 22 has a little difference between fstbl and fstbl bss and between hstbl fss and hstbl meanwhile comparing fstbl bss and hstbl fss m 22 clearly becomes smaller with a decrease of the draft of the stbl i e from the full load draft to the half load draft this is caused by the decrease of lateral projected area the same tendency mentioned above applies to m 33 regarding m 11 the two ship units are subject to the large m 11 because of the large frontal projected area 4 captive model test 4 1 outline of the captive model test as described in 2 2 the loading conditions changes as f stbl f stbl b ss h stbl f ss and h stbl during underway transfer therefore our concerns apply to the change of maneuverability among these four states and they are investigated by captive model tests the outline of the experiments is explained below for f stbl b ss h stbl f ss and h stbl resistance test self propulsion test rudder force test oblique towing test and circular motion test with a combination of a yaw rate and hull drift angle are conducted the speed through the water should be minimal during the operation in our experiment tests are conducted at a sufficiently slow speed i e froude number f n 0 055 where the length of the stbl model is used for its definition propeller revolutions are set at the model self propulsion point mspp indicating the self propelled loading condition of this model ship the load cell is located at midship of the stbl model the dynamometers are installed to measure the propeller thrust and rudder normal forces for f stbl sano and yasukawa 2008 presented its experimental coefficients used for a maneuvering mathematical model and most are available for this study however because our target speed f n 0 055 is much slower than in their study i e f n 0 142 only resistance and self propulsion tests are conducted 4 2 setup of the combined two ship unit when the ss is arranged on the starboard side of the stbl a suitable gap corresponding to the fender size should be given between the two ships we estimate the diameter of the fender as 3 3 m for our target combination of ships per the sts transfer guide ics ocimf 2005 because the aim of this study is to investigate a very slow low frequency and steady maneuvering motion of ships during underway transfer the two ships are rigidly connected while keeping the gap equivalent to 3 3 m at a full scale the way of this simplified experimental setup would be accepted when acknowledging that the fenders which prevent tankers from approaching too closely and the mooring lines which prevent them from separating away can suppress the large relative movement of these two ships thus in the case of a two ship unit we measure the hydrodynamic loads acting on this combined hull including the interaction between them in close proximity each hydrodynamic derivative identified by these data includes the same interaction too fig 4 shows the setup of the captive model test in the towing tank 4 3 resistance and self propulsion tests because the wave making resistance can be neglected owing to the sufficiently slow speed the total resistance is considered to the sum of the frictional and viscous pressure resistances introducing form factor k which is defined as the constant of proportionality of the frictional resistance and represents the magnitude of the viscous pressure resistance the total resistance coefficient c t is expressed as follows ittc 1999 22 c t 1 k c f here c t corresponds to x 0 1 2 ρ s u m 2 or x 0 l p p 0 d 0 s where s is the wetted surface area the friction resistance coefficient c f is estimated by the following schoenherr s flat plate frictional resistance formula conn et al 1953 23 c f 0 463 l o g 10 r e 2 6 where r e is the reynolds number the fig 5 shows the comparison of k for different conditions the form factor increases by 19 42 and 5 for f stbl b ss h stbl f ss and h stbl respectively more than the form factor of f stbl this indicates that a significant increase in viscous pressure resistance occurs especially in the stage of h stbl f ss the fig 5 also shows the result of 1 t p and 1 w p 0 s h i p in which w p 0 s h i p is the full scale wake coefficient converted by the 1978 ittc formula ittc 1999 the reduction of 1 w p 0 s h i p indicates that the wake at the propeller position of the stbl increases when it is under the half load condition i e h stbl f ss and h stbl 4 4 rudder force test fig 6 presents the non dimensional rudder normal force f n 1 2 ρ l p p 0 d 0 u m 2 versus the rudder angle at different propeller loadings obtained by this experiment each broken line is the result estimated by eq 14 using the determined experimental constants and non dimensionalized they agree well with the experimental plots the interaction parameters between the rudder and the hull t r a h and x h x h l p p 0 are determined fig 7 shows their values and the value of a h x h x r representing the increased ratio of the yaw moment is also presented in particular the effect of the loading condition of the stbl on a h seems significant the large value of a h for fstbl and fstbl bss where the stbl is under the full load condition indicates that the large interaction lateral force acts on the hull by steering resulting in a large interaction yaw moment meanwhile because the interaction parameters of between fstbl and fstbl bss or between hstbl fss and hstbl are similar there seems to be no significant influence on these parameters by towing the ss aside 4 5 oblique towing test and circular motion test 4 5 1 hydrodynamic loads during maneuvering figs 8 10 show the hydrodynamic surge force sway force and yaw moment around the stbl midship acting on the maneuvering bare hull obtained by subtracting the load components of the propeller and rudder from the measured results of the oblique towing and circular motion tests the terms including the added mass components are distinguished by the symbol with respect to fstbl bss and hstbl fss maneuvering loads are not symmetrical for example the sway force that acts on the hull of fstbl bss when moving at r β m 0 20 is larger than when moving in the opposite direction i e 0 20 in another example the direction of yaw moment on the hull of hstbl fss is not symmetric between 0 2 16 and 0 2 16 we see the linearity and the gradient of these loads with respect to the maneuvering motions depends substantially on the loading conditions a least squares method is applied to the experimental plots and all hydrodynamic derivatives used in eq 6 are identified they are listed in tables 4 6 the hydrodynamic derivatives of fstbl were quoted from sano and yasukawa 2008 as mentioned in section 4 1 the first and third order derivatives of the surge force and the second order derivatives of the sway force and yaw moment with respect to β m and r represent the magnitude of the load asymmetry between the port and starboard maneuvering motions therefore only the two ship units fstbl bss and hstbl fss whose combined hull is asymmetrical have a value for their terms additionally fstbl bss and hstbl fss have constant terms y 0 and n 0 the polynomial trend lines based on the regression formula are drawn in figs 8 10 they agree well with the experimental plots 4 5 2 linear derivatives of the sway force and yaw moment the linear derivatives of the sway force and yaw moment with respect to the hull drift angle and yaw rate are shown in fig 11 because the stbl carries a lot of cargo and has a deep draft at the beginning of its underway transfer a large aspect ratio d m l p p of fstbl and fstbl bss contributes to the large lift force and resultant yaw moment indeed y β and n r m 23 representing the magnitude of the damping sway force and yaw moment are large in these conditions next when comparing fstbl bss with fstbl or hstbl fss with hstbl we see that the two ship units take the larger value of y β considering that a lift force is a main component of the sway force acting on a naked hull in small oblique towing we may consider that the asymmetric hull of the combined two ship unit could contribute to the larger lift force than the symmetric hull of the stbl alone because it behaves as an airfoil with a camber which is known to generate a larger lift force than a symmetric airfoil this result in a larger value of y β here we define the point of application of the sway force in small oblique towing as follows because y β β m can be considered the non dimensional sway force induced by small oblique towing and n β β m is the resultant yaw moment around the midship of the stbl the ratio between the liner derivatives n β y β represents the non dimensional value of its longitudinal coordinate of the sway force from the midship this value changes from 0 45 to 0 27 in the stage from fstbl to fstbl bss indicating the point of application of the sway force is moved from the bow toward the midship of the stbl by mooring the ss aside by contrast it shifts forward again after unmooring n β y β changes from 0 19 to 0 31 in the stage from hstbl fss to hstbl in terms of y r m 11 it seems to decrease as the operation progresses 4 5 3 directional stability of the naked hull dynamic stability requires that the homogeneous solutions of a pair of coupled linear differential equations for the sway and yaw velocities exponentially decay to zero over time newman 1977 the following index c l is used as a criterion for determining whether these solutions or motions decay or not 24 c l n r g m 23 y r g m 11 m n β g y β g where 25 y β g y β y r g y r x g y β n β g n β x g y β y g x β n r g n r x g n β x g y r x g 2 y β y g x r x g y g x β the linear derivatives defined at the midship of the stbl can be converted to the derivatives defined at the cog of the stbl for fstbl and hstbl or defined at the cog of the two ship unit for fstbl bss and hstbl fss from eq 25 the index for the directional stability is defined using these converted derivatives here the first term of eq 24 signifies the longitudinal coordinate of the point of application of the sway force during yaw motion defined from the cog and non dimensionalized by l p p 0 a positive value indicates a forward direction the second term is the equivalent term for sway if c l takes a positive value this ship is directionally stable fig 12 shows index c l and each point of application of the sway force in pure sway and pure yaw 1st and 2nd terms of eq 24 comparing fstbl with hstbl the negative value of c l of fstbl grows larger than that of hstbl indicating the directional stability of the full load condition has worsened because the block coefficient of the full load stbl is 0 81 and that of the half load stbl is 0 783 as listed in table 1 it can be intuitively understood that the directional stability of the blunter ship i e fstbl is worse with respect to the two ship unit we see that the directional stability of fstbl bss is better than fstbl further improvement occurs in the case of hstbl fss fig 12 indicates that this is mainly caused by the drastic change of the point of application of the sway force during sway motion i e n β g y β g whereas the equivalent term for yaw does not change significantly this fact reduces the negative value of c l when the loading condition changes from fstbl to fstbl bss and the sign of c l eventually turns positive in the case of hstbl fss in conclusion running as a two ship unit during underway transfer seems to be generally advantageous to directional stability although the extent of the improvement depends on the combination of the loading conditions of these two ships it would contribute to operational safety by enhancing the ability to maintain course stably 4 5 4 estimation of the flow straightening coefficient the actual inflow angle on the rudder while maneuvering becomes smaller than the geometrical inflow angle because of the presence of the hull and propeller slip stream this straightening phenomenon is expressed by γ r and l r in eqs 19 and 20 and they are identified for fstbl bss hstbl fss and hstbl the constants for fstbl are quoted from sano and yasukawa 2008 because l r is known to take a value close to 1 0 yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 it is assumed 1 0 here only γ r is identified in this study using the oblique towing and circular motion tests specifically by inputting the u r calculated by eq 18 and the observed rudder normal force f n into eq 14 v r is estimated using a back calculation technique fig 13 shows the estimated v r v r u m versus β r which is calculated by eq 20 for a variety of combinations of β m and r and in which the linear fitting lines are also drawn note from eq 19 the gradient γ r which takes a different value according to the sign of β r corresponds to γ r and γ r fig 14 shows the result of the straightening coefficient the value of γ r is consistently smaller than γ r which is known due to the influence of the propeller rotation the influence of the stbl s draft seems significant the straightening phenomenon increases i e the value decreases when the stbl is under the half load condition a comparison of γ r between fstbl and fstbl bss or hstbl fss and hstbl shows that the straightening phenomenon of the stbl increases by towing the ss aside during underway transfer 5 free running model test and simulation sts operations normally take many hours while several offloadings are completed thus it is possible that the ships may not be able to maintain a straight course for the entire operation for example xiang et al 2011 who numerically discussed the interaction loads between two ships assumed that the underway lightering operation takes place between areas of restricted maritime operations following a part of circular path predefined by the maritime authorities in this study the maneuverability of the two ship unit engaged in underway transfer is investigated with free running model tests and maneuvering simulations the values of coefficients used in the mathematical model but not given from table 1 to table 6 can be found in table a 1 in appendix a 5 1 outline of free running model test free running model tests in calm water are conducted in the marine dynamics basin length 60 m breadth 25 m depth 3 2 m at the national research institute of fisheries engineering japan four loading conditions fstbl fstbl bss hstbl fss and hstbl are tested because ship maneuvers should be sufficiently small during operation a straight course keeping test and a 10 turning test are conducted the ship speed is set the same as that in the captive model test f n 0 055 fig 15 shows a photo of the free running model test the prism reflectors set at the stbl model are tracked to measure ship position and the heading angle and yaw rate are also measured by the gyration the ship surge and sway speeds and the hull drift angle are calculated based on these data the test procedure is as follows after launching an autopilot control proportional derivative control is used to control the heading angle for course keeping the stbl steers after reaching the designed ship speed and it starts turning 5 2 helm angle and equilibrium hull drift angle fig 16 shows the check helm angle required to maintain a straight course δ 0 the label exp indicates the average of the time series of the rudder angle and hull drift angle measured while running straight note that δ 0 for fstbl and hstbl is equal to δ 0 p r o p e l l e r in eq 17 which is taken to cancel the lateral rudder force caused by the propeller rotational effect meanwhile larger angles would be required for two ship units during underway transfer i e fstbl bss and hstbl fss because they additionally need to counter steady hydrodynamic loads caused by the asymmetric combined hull whereas the value of the check helm angle does not seem critically large the reduction of rudder deflection margin would be a concern in terms of the hull drift angle in the equilibrium condition β 0 which is also shown in the same figure we see that only a small hull drift angle seems sufficient for the course keeping cal the solution of the equilibrium conditions based on the linearized non modular type mathematical model is also plotted for the combined unit conditions fstbl bss and hstbl fss this estimation method is explained in appendix b the results of cal follows the results of exp 5 3 turning test with 10 rudder angle 5 3 1 turning trajectory fig 17 shows the turning trajectory with a 10 rudder angle non dimensionalized by division using l p p 0 each run is suspended when the ship heading angle reaches 90 because the tank width is insufficient to complete the turning trajectory owing to small steering the non dimensional values of the longitudinal distance from the start point to the end point i e advance ad and the lateral i e transfer tr are shown in figs 18 and 19 cal is also shown in these figures indicating the results of the turning simulation presented later for the starboard turning δ 10 the trajectories are similar regardless of the loading conditions we see the values of advance and transfer do not change much during underway transfer in contrast the difference in trajectories advance and transfer for different conditions is significant when turning to port δ 10 and the turning performance of the two ship unit deteriorates for example the advance of hstbl fss reaches about seven ship lengths about 1 43 times longer than the advance of hstbl because a large steering would be undesirable to avoid excessive towing loads the degraded port turning ability under two ship unit conditions is worth considering for safe maneuvering 5 3 2 time series of ship motions the surge velocity u g lateral velocity v g and hull drift angle β g all defined at the cog are calculated as follows 26 u g u m y g r v g v m x g r β g tan 1 v g u g fig 20 and fig 21 show the time series of u g β g and yaw rate r for turning starboard and port respectively as expected from the turning trajectory in fig 17 hstbl having the smallest displacement shows a quick response to both starboard and port steering meanwhile the yaw rate for fstbl bss and hstbl fss appears to be different according to the turning direction the yawing motion of the two ship unit slowly develops after steering to port and the yaw rate converges to a smaller value than when turning to starboard the time series of the surge velocity and hull drift angle is also asymmetrical for the different turning maneuvers 5 3 3 comparison with turning simulation to validate the established mathematical model of maneuvering motions of ships engaged in underway transfer a maneuvering simulation in calm water is conducted and compared to the experimental results the initial speed is set to f n 0 055 and the number or revolutions of the stbl s propeller is adjusted at mspp 7 89 9 32 9 26 and 7 11 rps for each fstbl fstbl bss hstbl fss and hstbl condition in terms of w p 0 the model scale wake coefficient w p 0 m o d e l is adopted in this model scale turning simulation as specified in table a 1 in appendix a the water temperature is considered as 20 degree celsius fig 22 shows the turning trajectory calculated for 300 s and the corresponding time series results of each motion up to 100 s are shown in figs 23 and 24 the mark x in this figure indicates the ship position at the 90 heading change the simulated trajectories are similar to the experimental ones of fig 17 the advance and transfer are shown as cal in figs 18 and 19 they agree well with the results of experiment the turning performance of the two ship unit for fstbl bss and hstbl fss which deteriorates when turning to port can be explained well by this simulation whereas the estimation accuracy is not perfect e g the steady yaw rate of fstbl bss during turning to port the simulated time series of ship motions can explain the results of the experiment as a whole for example the simulation can explain the steady yaw rate of hstbl and fstbl which reaches 1 5 s and that of hstbl fss which reaches about 1 s it can also capture the behavior of yaw rate convergence when turning to starboard 6 full scale simulation the mathematical model validated in section 5 was applied to a full scale simulation the total resistance coefficient for the full scale ship c t s was extrapolated from the 1978 ittc performance prediction method ittc 1999 27 c t s 1 k c f s where c f s the full scale frictional resistance coefficient was calculated by schoenherr s formula conn et al 1953 and the form factor k was maintained as the same value as the experiment s note wave making resistance was neglected because of the slow speed the wake coefficient of the scale model w p 0 m o d e l was also converted to full scale w p 0 s h i p based on the 1978 ittc formula ittc 1999 and it is used as w p 0 for the full scale simulation the ship speed of each condition was determined by the following procedure the dead slow speed of the full load stbl fstbl was assumed to be 5 kn 2 57 m s and the number of propeller revolutions was identified as 0 439 rps based on propeller performance this number of propeller revolutions was applied to the other navigation modes fstbl bss hstbl fss and hstbl and the self propelled speeds resulted in 4 35 kn 2 24 m s for fstbl bss 4 33 kn for 2 23 m s for hstbl fss and 5 36 kn 2 76 m s for hstbl the steering speed was set to 2 32 s 6 1 turning simulation by 10 steering fig 25 presents the trajectory for 2 h after steering and the non dimensional advance and transfer are shown in fig 26 we see that the advance and transfer of the two ship unit when turning to port significantly increase the advance of fstbl bss and hstbl fss are 1 26 times and 1 53 times as large as fstbl respectively and the transfer of fstbl bss is 1 37 times and that of hstbl fss is 1 89 times larger than fstbl thus the asymmetry of the turning ability between port and starboard maneuvers of the two ship unit is notable in particular in the stage of hstbl fss its advance and transfer during port maneuvers increased by 44 and 59 compared to those during starboard maneuvering fig 27 shows the distance traveled when the heading had changed by 10 from the original imo standard imo 1993 requires the initial turning ability of this traveled distance to not exceed 2 5 ship lengths whereas this standard does not cover a two ship unit moving at very slow speeds it exceeds 2 5 l p p 0 in cases of port maneuvers of fstbl bss and hstbl fss for safe operations it might be better to keep in mind the serious deterioration of the turning ability to port during underway transfer 6 2 spiral characteristics the spiral characteristics representing the relation of r β g and u g u 0 with respect to δ are shown in fig 28 where u g is defined as u g 2 v g 2 and u 0 is the initial speed i e 5 kn or 2 57 m s only fstbl has a small spiral loop width because the presence of the rudder behind the working propeller takes on the role of an effective skeg the directional instability of fstbl bss and hstbl caused by the naked hull as discussed in section 4 5 3 is improved and the spiral loop does not appear we see that a significant asymmetry of the spiral characteristics occurs for fstbl bss and hstbl fss the rudder angle at r 0 corresponds to the check helm angle which is required to cancel the yaw moment for going straight in this full scale simulation the check helm angle of hstbl fss was estimated at 4 16 these spiral characteristics clearly indicate that the turning ability to port varies among different conditions more than for starboard this is a consistent argument all through the text 7 conclusions the maneuverability of a combined two ship unit engaged in underway transfer was studied the operation was separated into four stages 1 a full load stbl running alone before the operation starts fstbl 2 a full load stbl towing a ballasted ss aside fstbl bss corresponding to the first stage after berthing and mooring of the two ships 3 a half load stbl towing a full load ss aside hstbl fss assumed to be the final stage after a few offloading operations and 4 a half load stbl running alone with enough shallow draft to enter a port after unberthing hstbl in this study we assumed that the draft of the stbl changed from 20 8 m full load to 15 12 m half load whereas the draft of the ss changed from 8 3 m ballast i e the mean draft at midship to 15 m full load captive model tests were conducted considering these four loading conditions and their mathematical model for maneuvering simulations was presented free running model tests were also conducted with the application of 10 rudder angle because the two ships were rigidly connected throughout the experiments a snap load which is an impulse in acceleration deceleration due to the quick transfer from a slack state to a taut state of the mooring lines was not considered however we assumed this setup was acceptable because a maneuvering behavior while underway transfer occurred very slowly thus a high frequency snap load would not have a severe impact on such a low frequency maneuvering behavior of the combined two ship unit the main conclusions are summarized as follows the effect of the presence of the ss aside on the added masses or propeller rudder force characteristics of the stbl does not seem to be significant however the loading draft of the stbl would have a large impact for example m 22 m 33 1 w p 0 and a h reduce as the draft of the stbl becomes shallow or as the offloading operation progresses the linearity and gradient of the surge force sway force and yaw moment acting on the hull with respect to maneuvering motions substantially depend on loading conditions the asymmetry of these loads between the starboard port maneuvers is significant during underway transfer the directional stability of the full load stbl is improved by towing the ballasted ss aside more improvement is expected nearer the final stage of underway transfer where the half load stbl towing the full load ss aside whereas the extent of improvement depends on the combination of the loading conditions of the two ships we can expect such a combined unit condition would contribute to the operation s safety by enhancing the ability to maintain course the modular type mathematical model for the maneuvering motion of a two ship unit i e the front back and left right asymmetric ship was developed it was validated by comparing the results of simulations and free running model tests the difference of the turning ability between port and starboard maneuvers is significant for two ship units particularly near the end of transfer operation i e hstbl fss condition the turning ability to port deteriorates and the large advance and transfer are needed moreover because of the large check helm angle for course keeping the steering margin reduces during underway transfer this might be unfavorable in case of an emergency acknowledgement the authors are grateful to dr akihiko matsuda and dr daisuke terada for supporting the free running model tests in the marine dynamics basin of

propeller rotational flow a ship can maintain a course with a check helm angle and hull drift angle meanwhile in the case of a combined two ship unit those angles might be large not only because of the propeller rotational flow but also because of the hull body asymmetry here the method for estimating these angles is explained by solving the equilibrium condition based on the following assumptions the equation of the surge motion is neglected because its change is negligible the order of magnitude of the sway motion is o ε where ε represents a small value it implies that the hull drift angle in the equilibrium condition β 0 is also o ε the order of magnitude of the check helm angle δ 0 is o 1 the equations for the non dimensional sway force y and yaw moment n m are expressed simply with third order polynomial equations considering β m r and δ b 1 y y 0 y β β m y r r y δ δ y β δ β m δ y β β δ β m 2 δ n m n 0 n β β m n r r n δ δ n β δ β m δ n β β δ β m 2 δ they are not modular type expressions like eq 4 and they are based on the same concept as abkowitz type mathematical models abkowitz 1964 which consider coupling terms of motion and steering parameters thus each derivative includes the interaction of the hull propeller and rudder those equations are linearized and substituting them into the non dimensionalized eq 3 the equilibrium condition can be expressed as follows b 2 y 0 y β β 0 y δ δ 0 y β δ β 0 δ 0 0 n 0 m 21 n β β 0 n δ δ 0 n β δ β 0 δ 0 0 to identify the derivatives of the coupling term y β δ and n β δ an oblique towing test with steering is required in this study this test was conducted only for the unit conditions fstbl bss and hstbl fss based on results of not only the rudder force test oblique towing test without steering and circular motion test presented in the main text but also the oblique towing test with steering additionally conducted the hydrodynamic derivatives used in eq b 2 were identified and listed in table b1 these values are slightly different from those due to the naked hull shown in tables 4 6 because of the inclusion of the influence of the propeller and rudder for example y 0 decreases and n 0 increases compared to values listed in tables 5 and 6 because the lateral flow in the port direction which occurs at the rudder position due to the propeller rotation causes a lateral force in the port direction y 0 results in taking a larger negative value the resultant yaw moment in a clock wise direction is also given to the hull causing n 0 increases δ 0 and β 0 under the two ship unit

23024,the openfoam package incorporated with actuator line method alm is employed to calculate the aerodynamic characteristics of large wind turbines in an offshore wind farm in order to mitigate the wake effect of upstream wind turbines and conduct the overall optimization of output power for the offshore wind farm wake deviation simulations of nine yaw angles and fifteen tilt angles are carried out taking total output power of the offshore wind farm as the reference point and combining fluid field profiles of cross sections in all simulations we investigate the flow mechanism of wake s influence on the downstream turbines with different control strategies the results show that although the output power of the upstream wind turbine may decreases mildly changing the wake direction with different control methods can significantly increase the total output power of the whole wind farm due to the substantial enhancement of the downstream wind turbine both control strategies of wake deviation can globally optimize the offshore wind farm and each has an optimal angle while the yaw control strategy has better results and with regard to the tilt control strategy the plus tilt angle is comparatively better than the minus angle keywords wind turbine wake deviation yaw tilt total output power offshore wind farm 1 introduction for centuries increasing demand for energy has chiefly depended on fossil fuels which leads to unintended global consequences especially in air pollution and climate change elginoz and bas 2017 accordingly various technologies of renewable energy have been developed to replace fossil fuels among them wind power appears to be a prominent and promising alternative up to now wind energy technology has been exploited on a wide commercial scale establishing itself as a mature approach of renewable energy generation karimi et al 2017 with the decrease of available onshore wind farm resources strong consistent and weak turbulent offshore winds have become a hot research topic among scientific staff around the word in recent years kang et al 2017 furthermore compared with onshore wind farms offshore wind farms have some notable advantages such as higher energy production less wind shear and lower environmental impact noise visual pollution and so on hou et al 2017 consequently the fact that offshore wind power will be the main field of future utilization of wind energy has been widely acknowledged in both academic and the industrial circles chen et al 2018 yang et al 2018 in fact the offshore wind power capacity has been rising rapidly year by year as illustrated by the annual cumulative capacity 2011 2017 of the offshore wind turbine in fig 1 gwec 2018 customarily tens or even hundreds of wind turbines would be arranged in one offshore wind farm for the purpose of maximal use of wind energy as well as reduction of construction costs shakoor et al 2016 puneet et al 2017 however this pattern of the offshore wind farm as well as the onshore wind farm has an inherent phenomenon that the velocity of the wake from the upstream wind turbine will experience a deficit and its turbulence turns intense as shown in fig 2 nrel 2016 tian et al 2018 in turn the wind turbine in the downstream wind farm located within and suffered from such wakes reduce its inflow quality as a result the output power of downstream wind turbine turns to be less overall wind energy and offshore water area resources are actually wasted therefore it is of vital importance to study the offshore wind farm especially the valid wake control strategies and then to apply the optimal strategy to achieve the aim of increasing total output power of the offshore wind farm at present there are two main methods can that are used to conduct the wake control the first is to alter the axial induction factor of wind turbine rotor by changing the pitch angle to alleviate the wake velocity deficit the second way is to adopt the wake redirection control strategy to make the wake after upstream wind farm deviate from rotor center of the downstream wind turbine in this way part of or the entire downstream wind turbine rotor could avoid interacting with the wake thus eventually improving energy capturing of the overall offshore wind farm in general the second method mainly consists of yaw and tilt control strategy as for the first method fleming et al 2015 used individual pitch control ipc to change the rotor power efficiency of the upstream wind turbine with an aim to weaken the wake velocity defect and the results showed that total output power of the whole wind farm increased slightly but the blade root moment increased exponentially gebraad et al 2015 used the sowfa a high fidelity computational simulation software for wind farm to carry out a numerical calculation of adjusting the pitch and torque but the results were not satisfactory for the global optimization of wind farm output power nevertheless the study of miao et al 2017 indicated that the total output power of two tandem wind turbines in a wind farm shown a gratifying discrepancy between different yaw directions of the upstream wind turbine as illustrated in fig 3 for the aforementioned reasons we propose employing the control strategy of wake deviation to redirect the wake of upstream wind turbine in an offshore wind farm subsequently a mainstream wind turbine type and an appropriate research approach need to be determined to conduct wake deviation realistically in an offshore wind farm we based our study on a 5 mw horizontal axis wind turbine designed by the national renewable energy laboratory nrel see the schematic of the turbine in fig 4 although the nrel 5 mw wind turbine doesn t reach the largest scale level among existing wind turbines at least it is unrealistic to conduct aerodynamic experiments in a wind tunnel moreover due to the requirement of precision time restriction and computational cost there are few aerodynamically numerical studies on the whole wind turbine for the 5 mw and higher at present as fat as numerical studies are concerned there are mainly three conventional approaches each having its own merits and demerits as seen in table 1 bangga et al 2018 combined the pure blade element momentum bem with a stall delay model for a wind turbine operating under pitch fault circumstance and the accuracy of the result was assessed by comparing the results of computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations data however bangga et al 2018 couldn t calculate the flow field and wind turbine wake although their approach could predict the aerodynamic characteristics of a single wind turbine quickly meghlaoui et al 2017 took into account both the tangential and longitudinal vorticity of the vortex system formed behind the rotor based on vortex wake method vwm they found that the development of the near wake of a horizontal axis wind turbine under different inflow speeds showed a good agreement between the calculation and experience however the rotor diameter they used is only 0 54 m in contrast the rotor diameter of the 5 mw wind turbine is 126 m and the flow field spans five size scales from macroscopic to microcosmic vwm performs with a low precision when it is used to predict the small vortex in a large scale domain miao et al 2017 used commercial cfd software star ccm to simulate the wind farm arranged with two intandem wind turbines their results showed that when the upstream wind turbine applied a positive yaw angle the wind farm s total power increased however according to miao s work in order to capture the boundary layer flows around three long wind turbine blades massive complex mesh need to be imposed this would cost too much time and it is computationally too expensive to conduct numerical simulation we find that the alm approach proposed by sorensen and shen 2002 can redress the above problems it is a fully three dimensional and unsteady aerodynamic model for studying the flow field around the wind turbine however it has received little attention and application in the study of total output power of a large offshore wind farm in our study based on the alm involved in the openfoam package we simulated 24 operation conditions of wake redirection including 9 yaw angles and 15 tilt angles then we analyzed the impact of wake control strategies on aerodynamic characteristics of wind turbines and in turn on the total output power of offshore wind farm the characteristics of wind turbine wakes at different control strategies are studied in detail by researching the variables of the flow field meanwhile the influence of wake on the downstream turbine is also discussed the finding of this work will provide significant instructions for operating offshore wind farms 2 methodology of alm in terms of time and computational cost compared with the conventional cfd method alm has a great advantage alm can produce preferable results at equivalent precision as the traditional cfd method does but with less computing resources and time therefore alm is especially suitable for the simulation of three dimensional flow fields for offshore wind farms the basis of the alm is the incompressible navier stokes ns equations 1 d v d t 1 ρ p ν 2 v f 2 v 0 where t and ρ are the time and density respectively and v is the velocity vector p represents the stresses tensor ν is the kinematic viscosity and the source term f denotes the body force which represents the load on the flow field imposed by rotating blades based on the newton s third law the body force can be attained using the force applied on blades by flow field since there are no solid walls of blades in the alm the force acted on blades needs to be calculated via an extra model which can achieve the equivalent effect of real blades with solid walls in this paper we adopt the bem as the extra model combined with tabulated two dimensional airfoil characteristics alm accesses the information of flow fields at each cfd time step and meanwhile calculates the aerodynamic characteristics of blades by the following equations 3 f τ 1 2 ρ w 2 c c τ τ 4 f n 1 2 ρ w 2 c c n n 5 f s f τ f n where w relative velocity of the local airfoil c local chord of the airfoil c τ coefficient of the tangential force τ tangential unit vector c n coefficient of the normal force n normal unit vector f τ f n and f s tangential normal and resultant forces of the unit length blade automatically the body force of fluid flow given by blades can be represented as the following 6 f f f s in the end body force is distributed radially along lines representing the blades via numerically smearing as shown in fig 5 the body force needs to be distributed within a certain scope around the lines blades in order to avoid singular behavior otherwise the cfd simulation may not converge if the area of body force distribution is smaller whereas if bigger vortexes on tip and root of blades would be weakened excessively wimshurst and willden 2016 to ensure the body force smear smoothly a three dimensional gaussian manner like equation 7 is adopted 7 f r 1 ε 3 π 3 2 e r ε 2 where r represents the distance between the body force center on blade and the distributed point in fluid domain and ε is the smearing factor that controls the gradient of body force distributing troldborg 2008 points out that the distribution of body force has a significant influence on the results of the simulations and in three dimensional distribution of gauss for alm the equation ε 2 δ s should be met if the effect of alm wants to be extremely close to the real wind turbine situation while δ s is the distance of points on the actuator line compared with what would be needed for simulating the actual geometry of the blades the advantage of representing the blades by airfoil data as it is done in the actuator line model is that much fewer grid points are needed to capture the influence of the blades therefore the alm provides a detailed study of the dynamics of different wake structures using a reasonably number of grid nodes furthermore the model benefits from being applicable with simple structured grids and consequently issues connected to grid generation do not occur on the other hand a drawback of the method is its reliance on tabulated airfoil characteristics however as the main purpose of the present paper is to study fundamental wake effects it is of minor importance to capture the dynamic stall or other flow regimes on the blades exactly the alm technic described above is implemented in the openfoam package which is an open source cfd software developed with object oriented c it has the benefit of being free and therefore essentially provides unlimited licenses this means its source codes are available which helps users know exactly how codes function and allows modification and expansion that are necessary for new code development and research on this fundamental level and it should be pointed that the version of openfoam 3 0 1 is employed in this paper we construct a new solver newturbinepisofoam based on the built in solver pisofoam in openfoam 3 0 1 it is based on the pressure implicit split operator piso method that is more efficient and accurate compared to the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple method the new solver newturbinepisofoam is intended for the numerical simulation of horizontal axis wind turbine based on the alm compared with the pisofoam newturbinepisofoam constructs a c class turbines which can function a series of operations such as defining the array of the body force solving the body force distributing the body force and so on accordingly a wind turbine can be added expediently in offshore wind farm just through setting the locations of coordinate values of the wind turbine the piece of code below this paragraph is a part of source codes of the alm solver implementation and properly speaking it is the moment predictor step equation from the include file ueq h in newturbinepisofoam finally the equation is evaluated using built in class fvvectormatrix that discretizes and distributes the operators specified within first order curled brackets image 1 3 computational implementation 3 1 wind turbine the computational object employed in the present work is a 5 mw rating wind turbine designed by the nrel affiliated to the u s department of energy nerl 5 mw wind turbine generally refers to the publicly available information of the multibrid m5000 and repower 5m prototype wind turbines as detailed information on those two machines is not available nerl 5 mw wind turbine also refers to the publicly available properties from the conceptual models used in the windpact recoff and dowec projects nrel 2009 the main specifications of nerl 5 mw wind turbine are illustrated in table 2 3 2 offshore wind farm configuration in order to avoid tunnel blockage effect in computational simulation we created a larger numerical offshore wind farm with a flow domain of 20d in length 6d in width and 6d in height d represents the wind turbine rotor diameter two tandem wind turbines substituted by wt1 and wt2 respectively were located in the offshore wind farm and the two wind turbines was set at a distance of 7d with regard to the reasons for the choice of 7d first of all turbine performance at separation distances from 3d to 7d was examined and it was observed that the performance of downstream wind turbine decreased notably when the distance was less than 6d miao et al 2016 in addition the inter turbine distance in a wind farm needs to be estimated carefully to balance the power output efficiency and construction costs for example due to some constraints such as the cost of electrical connections or the availability of land surface an oversized separation is inappropriate son et al 2014 besides there is 3d from wt1 to the inlet of the wind farm and wt2 has been placed sufficiently far away from the outlet 10d to eliminate the effect on the flow of wake the flow domain and wind turbines are illustrated in fig 6 3 3 control strategies of wake deviation we implemented control strategies by executing changes of yaw and tilt angles for the upstream wt1 and in this way the wake of wt1 would deviate from the rotor center of the downstream wt2 for the purpose of better comparison we investigated 24 operation conditions associated with control strategies that consisted of 9 yaw angles and 15 tilt angles while the range of yaw angles were from 230 to 310 with the step length of 10 and tile angles were from 35 to 35 with the step length of 5 fig 7 is the sketch of the control strategies of wake deviation and the y direction is along the offshore wind farm s width that is perpendicular to the plane determined by x and z axis moreover in order to avoid the accident of blade tower collision it should be noted that the tilt angles between 0 and 35 are intended for the type of downwind wind turbine 3 4 mesh generation in consideration of the application of alm and fast there was no need to model solid wind turbine rotors or to resolve the boundary layer behavior around the blade which would need huge cell numbers and computational resources nedjari et al 2017 therefore the flow domain was meshed into structure elements with hexahedral cuboid grids through the built in mesh solver blockmesh in the openfoam it began with a coarse resolution of mesh in the flow domain then in order to confirm that the mesh was sufficient to capture the wake structure like blade tip vortices which was considered to be the most important flow characteristics and required the finer grids we locally refined the mesh in accordance to areas covered by wake corresponding to the rotation motion of the rotors in reality we chose the cylinder shaped zone associated with the refined region besides we added two transition zones between coarse mesh and the refined mesh to avoid fluctuations of the numerical simulation therefore the final mesh was composed of three sub domains coarse mesh transition zones two layers and refined mesh the most refined resolution of the mesh for the wake was 3 94 m which was enough for the simulation of large scale wind turbines in the offshore wind farm according to the previous investigation fleming et al 2014 the meshes on the section plane that is orthotropic with the x direction and the meshes which cover the entire computational domain are shown in fig 8 a and b respectively 3 5 boundary conditions the boundary conditions of the offshore wind farm are shown in fig 9 the inlet condition was a uniform freestream velocity boundary whose direction was parallel to the x direction and magnitude was equal to the nominal rated velocity of nrel 5 mw 11 4 m s the outlet employed a pressure outlet the magnitude of which was as large as a standard atmospheric pressure two lateral sides were set to periodic boundary conditions which meant when a flow variable appears on the unit cell of one side it would simultaneously re appear on the opposite side with the same value the reason why the lateral sides used the periodic boundary was mainly that in practice there were flow domains at both sides of the offshore wind farm and they were the same besides the upper and the lower faces consisted of two slip boundaries and if we would like to apply the numerical method presented in this paper to onshore wind farms we should change the boundary conditions according to the land based characteristics 4 results and discussions 4 1 output power of wind turbines in this paper the computational simulation was unsteady we employed the parallel block technic with thirty cores to compute all cases with regard to the convergence criteria the residuals for the pressure and velocity were set to 1 10 5 and 1 10 6 respectively which were sufficient to produce converged solutions within every numerical interval and guarantee the reliability of the simulation for every computational time step the alm calculated and output the power of wind turbines when the wind blows from the inlet of computational domain to the outlet which took approximate 220s we continued to calculate until the total time reached the 300s we use the average of the last 80s s data as the final power of wind turbines fig 10 presents the output power of wind turbines under the circumstances of wake deviation control strategies for better distinction we use different colours to represent the output power of wind turbines respectively from the output results of yaw control in fig 10a it can be easily seen that there are evident discrepancies between wt1 and wt2 the output power of wt1 changes obviously when the yaw angles varies from 230 to 310 with the step length of 10 while at the 230 of yaw angle the output power of wt1 is 2 8663 mw which only makes up 57 5 of the output power when it is at the zero yaw angle with further enlargement of the yaw angle the output power of wt1 is increasing gradually at the yaw angle of 270 the power output arrives at the peak value of 4 9849 mw in the yaw angles from 270 to 310 the output power of wt1 declines continuously falling to 2 8671 mw at the high angle of 310 which is about the same value at the yaw angle of 230 the trend of power output of wt2 is in sharp contrast to that of wt1 when the yaw angles are at 230 and 310 the power output of wt1 are at the maximum values 4 5765 mw and 4 5939 mw respectively whereas the minimum of power output of wt2 occurs at the yaw angle of 270 with a value of only 0 8570 mw moreover the distribution law in fig 10a indicates that our work using alm and openfoam to optimize the offshore wind farm is correct and valid in the output results of tilt control in fig 10b we find that the power output of wt1 increases at first and then decreases as the tilt angles varies from 35 to 35 with the step length of 5 the power output reaches the maximum of 5 0205 mw at the tilt angle of 0 while the tilt angles are 35 and 35 respectively the power of wt1 are 3 4016 mw and 3 4002 mw accordingly in contrast compared with wt1 wt2 has an opposite variation tendency of power output when the tilt angle is 0 wt2 falls to its minimum power value only 0 7900 mw while the angles are 35 and 35 the output power of wt2 are 4 1728 mw and 4 3038 mw respectively moreover we also find that the power output at plus tilt angles is higher than that at the corresponding minus tilt angles in order to clearly reveal distinctly the changes of output power of wind turbines with both of the two control strategies of wake deviation we define the power output ratio as the power output of wt1 without the yaw or tilt divided by the power output with control strategies table 3 and table 4 indicate the power output ratios of wind turbines obtained from the yaw and tilt control strategies 4 2 total output power of the offshore wind farm fig 11 illustrates the total output power of the offshore wind farm in the condition of the control strategies of yaw and tilt from fig 11 we find that the total output power of the two control strategies both have two maximum values and one minimum values which fit well to fig 10 it should be noted that the effects of two control strategies on total output power of the offshore wind farm are not absolutely the same instead the yaw control strategy generates a bit more total output power than the tilt control strategy does the maximum and the minimum total output power of the offshore wind farm under the yaw control strategy are 7 9071 mw and 5 8419 mw respectively while the maximum and the minimum total output power under the tilt control strategy are 7 8146 mw and 5 8105 mw in addition the total output power of plus tilt angles is about one hundred thousand watts more than that of the corresponding minus tilt angles from fig 11 we can also see that the maximums of total output power all appear to be at the 30 of the deviation angle that is because at this deviation angle the output power of wt1 and wt2 are all considerable we define the deviation angle as the absolute difference value between the yaw angle and the tilt angle with the angle of no control strategy based on the three order polynomial as the base function we fit the relations of total output power of the offshore wind farm with the angles of control strategies of yaw and tilt using the least square method finally we can attain equations 8 and 9 8 p 1 3 0724 θ 3 0 0008 θ 2 0 427 θ 63 9563 9 p 2 1 0914 φ 3 0 0015 φ 2 0 0034 φ 6 2509 where p 1 represents total output power of the offshore wind farm under yaw control strategy θ is the yaw angle from 230 to 310 p 2 represents total output power of the offshore wind farm under tilt control strategy φ is the tilt angle from 35 to 35 besides mainly because of the restriction of computing resources and time it is impossible to compute all angles so we only simulate the integer angle values anyway it should be noted that the general tendency of equations 8 and 9 is accurate table 5 shows the differences between total output power of positive and negative tilt angles in the tilt control strategy as mentioned above we know that the total output power of positive tilt angles is in general more than that of the corresponding negative tilt angles so the difference values here are all positive and with the absolute value of the deviation angle increasing the difference values are getting bigger 4 3 velocity nephogram fig 12 is the velocity nephogram of horizontal cross section namely the top view at the height of hub for nine operating conditions of the yaw control strategy from these nephograms we could access intuitively the influence of wake from upstream wind turbine on the downstream and the mechanism of the yaw control strategy to weaken the effect of wake as illustrated in fig 12 the yaw control strategy can remarkably change the orientation of the wake fromwt1 if the yaw angle is greater the deviation of the wake is more obvious when the yaw angle is 260 or 280 the wake of wt1 begins to deviate from the rotor center of wt2 therefore the influence of wake from the upstream wind turbine is weakened and the average velocity of the inflow of wt2 increases in this condition the output power of wt2 is about two times of the output power without the wake control strategy the enlargement of the output power of wt2 is apparent which is in good agreement with fig 10a with further increase of the yaw angle the effect of wt1 on wt2 becomes weaker consequently the proportion of inflow of wt2 that is not influenced by wt1 rises and the average velocity of inflow of wt2 increases especially when the yaw angle of wt1 is 310 or 230 wake of wt1 almost deviates from the rotor of wt2 and the influence of wt1 on wt2 is so weak that the output power of wt2 approximately approaches to its rated power however when the yaw angle of wt1 is too big its operating condition is seriously away from the designed optimal condition in consequence the output power of wt1 may decline drastically causing the total output power of the offshore wind farm too less than that at the 300 or 230 of the yaw angle therefore when the yaw angle is too big or too small the total output power of the offshore wind farm cannot reach the maximum while the yaw angle is 300 or 240 wt1 and wt2 are both at an ideal operating condition and the total output power of the offshore wind farm arrives at the largest the above substance fits well to the results of fig 11 fig 13 is the velocity nephogram of vertical cross section namely see from one side to another of the offshore wind farm through two rotor centers in fifteen operating conditions of the tilt control strategy which perspicuously displays the deviation of the wake in fig 13 we can find that the greater the absolute value of the tilt angle the more obvious the wake deviation is as a result the effect of the upstream wind turbine on wt2 becomes feebler hence the quality of inflow of wt2 turns higher and the output power remarkably improves this fits well to figs 10b and 11 besides in fig 10b the total output power of plus tilt angles is about one hundred thousand watts more than that of the corresponding minus tilt angles this is realistic and can be interpreted according to fig 13 that is to say when the tilt angle is plus the wake of wt1 deviates downwards and enhanced by gravity it will further increase the output power of wt2 while the tilt angle is minus the wake of wt1 deviates upwards and the deviation is weakened by gravity so the output power of wt2 turns less 5 conclusions in this paper we have modified the standard solver pisofoam in the open source software openfoam and developed a new solver newturbinepisofoam on this basis we conducted computational simulations for the nrel 5wm wind turbines in an offshore wind farm two control strategies of wake deviation were adopted to simulate 24 operating conditions the results demonstrate an instructional significance for the offshore wind farm in operating wind turbines by numerical analysis the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the power of wind turbines flow fields and wake deviation have been simulated with relatively far less computing resources and time it indicates the present modified solver has good accuracy and extensive applicability 2 the influence of wake from the upstream wind turbine on the downstream wind turbine cannot be negligible by controlling the deviation of the wake from the upstream wind turbine we could effectively weaken the impact of the wake on the performance of the downstream wind turbine 3 compared with the tilt control strategy the yaw control strategy could attain more total output power of the offshore wind farm with regard to the tilt control strategy plus tilt angles are better than the minus 4 there is an optimal angle generally being the 30 of the deviation angle for both the yaw and tilt control strategy with regard to the total output power of the offshore wind farm under these circumstances the output power of the upstream and the downstream wind turbines are all considerable 5 the present work has the potential to be extended to a simulation of an offshore wind farm with hundreds of wind turbines above all it can be directly applied to the real offshore wind farms and is likely to produce some considerable

23024,the openfoam package incorporated with actuator line method alm is employed to calculate the aerodynamic characteristics of large wind turbines in an offshore wind farm in order to mitigate the wake effect of upstream wind turbines and conduct the overall optimization of output power for the offshore wind farm wake deviation simulations of nine yaw angles and fifteen tilt angles are carried out taking total output power of the offshore wind farm as the reference point and combining fluid field profiles of cross sections in all simulations we investigate the flow mechanism of wake s influence on the downstream turbines with different control strategies the results show that although the output power of the upstream wind turbine may decreases mildly changing the wake direction with different control methods can significantly increase the total output power of the whole wind farm due to the substantial enhancement of the downstream wind turbine both control strategies of wake deviation can globally optimize the offshore wind farm and each has an optimal angle while the yaw control strategy has better results and with regard to the tilt control strategy the plus tilt angle is comparatively better than the minus angle keywords wind turbine wake deviation yaw tilt total output power offshore wind farm 1 introduction for centuries increasing demand for energy has chiefly depended on fossil fuels which leads to unintended global consequences especially in air pollution and climate change elginoz and bas 2017 accordingly various technologies of renewable energy have been developed to replace fossil fuels among them wind power appears to be a prominent and promising alternative up to now wind energy technology has been exploited on a wide commercial scale establishing itself as a mature approach of renewable energy generation karimi et al 2017 with the decrease of available onshore wind farm resources strong consistent and weak turbulent offshore winds have become a hot research topic among scientific staff around the word in recent years kang et al 2017 furthermore compared with onshore wind farms offshore wind farms have some notable advantages such as higher energy production less wind shear and lower environmental impact noise visual pollution and so on hou et al 2017 consequently the fact that offshore wind power will be the main field of future utilization of wind energy has been widely acknowledged in both academic and the industrial circles chen et al 2018 yang et al 2018 in fact the offshore wind power capacity has been rising rapidly year by year as illustrated by the annual cumulative capacity 2011 2017 of the offshore wind turbine in fig 1 gwec 2018 customarily tens or even hundreds of wind turbines would be arranged in one offshore wind farm for the purpose of maximal use of wind energy as well as reduction of construction costs shakoor et al 2016 puneet et al 2017 however this pattern of the offshore wind farm as well as the onshore wind farm has an inherent phenomenon that the velocity of the wake from the upstream wind turbine will experience a deficit and its turbulence turns intense as shown in fig 2 nrel 2016 tian et al 2018 in turn the wind turbine in the downstream wind farm located within and suffered from such wakes reduce its inflow quality as a result the output power of downstream wind turbine turns to be less overall wind energy and offshore water area resources are actually wasted therefore it is of vital importance to study the offshore wind farm especially the valid wake control strategies and then to apply the optimal strategy to achieve the aim of increasing total output power of the offshore wind farm at present there are two main methods can that are used to conduct the wake control the first is to alter the axial induction factor of wind turbine rotor by changing the pitch angle to alleviate the wake velocity deficit the second way is to adopt the wake redirection control strategy to make the wake after upstream wind farm deviate from rotor center of the downstream wind turbine in this way part of or the entire downstream wind turbine rotor could avoid interacting with the wake thus eventually improving energy capturing of the overall offshore wind farm in general the second method mainly consists of yaw and tilt control strategy as for the first method fleming et al 2015 used individual pitch control ipc to change the rotor power efficiency of the upstream wind turbine with an aim to weaken the wake velocity defect and the results showed that total output power of the whole wind farm increased slightly but the blade root moment increased exponentially gebraad et al 2015 used the sowfa a high fidelity computational simulation software for wind farm to carry out a numerical calculation of adjusting the pitch and torque but the results were not satisfactory for the global optimization of wind farm output power nevertheless the study of miao et al 2017 indicated that the total output power of two tandem wind turbines in a wind farm shown a gratifying discrepancy between different yaw directions of the upstream wind turbine as illustrated in fig 3 for the aforementioned reasons we propose employing the control strategy of wake deviation to redirect the wake of upstream wind turbine in an offshore wind farm subsequently a mainstream wind turbine type and an appropriate research approach need to be determined to conduct wake deviation realistically in an offshore wind farm we based our study on a 5 mw horizontal axis wind turbine designed by the national renewable energy laboratory nrel see the schematic of the turbine in fig 4 although the nrel 5 mw wind turbine doesn t reach the largest scale level among existing wind turbines at least it is unrealistic to conduct aerodynamic experiments in a wind tunnel moreover due to the requirement of precision time restriction and computational cost there are few aerodynamically numerical studies on the whole wind turbine for the 5 mw and higher at present as fat as numerical studies are concerned there are mainly three conventional approaches each having its own merits and demerits as seen in table 1 bangga et al 2018 combined the pure blade element momentum bem with a stall delay model for a wind turbine operating under pitch fault circumstance and the accuracy of the result was assessed by comparing the results of computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations data however bangga et al 2018 couldn t calculate the flow field and wind turbine wake although their approach could predict the aerodynamic characteristics of a single wind turbine quickly meghlaoui et al 2017 took into account both the tangential and longitudinal vorticity of the vortex system formed behind the rotor based on vortex wake method vwm they found that the development of the near wake of a horizontal axis wind turbine under different inflow speeds showed a good agreement between the calculation and experience however the rotor diameter they used is only 0 54 m in contrast the rotor diameter of the 5 mw wind turbine is 126 m and the flow field spans five size scales from macroscopic to microcosmic vwm performs with a low precision when it is used to predict the small vortex in a large scale domain miao et al 2017 used commercial cfd software star ccm to simulate the wind farm arranged with two intandem wind turbines their results showed that when the upstream wind turbine applied a positive yaw angle the wind farm s total power increased however according to miao s work in order to capture the boundary layer flows around three long wind turbine blades massive complex mesh need to be imposed this would cost too much time and it is computationally too expensive to conduct numerical simulation we find that the alm approach proposed by sorensen and shen 2002 can redress the above problems it is a fully three dimensional and unsteady aerodynamic model for studying the flow field around the wind turbine however it has received little attention and application in the study of total output power of a large offshore wind farm in our study based on the alm involved in the openfoam package we simulated 24 operation conditions of wake redirection including 9 yaw angles and 15 tilt angles then we analyzed the impact of wake control strategies on aerodynamic characteristics of wind turbines and in turn on the total output power of offshore wind farm the characteristics of wind turbine wakes at different control strategies are studied in detail by researching the variables of the flow field meanwhile the influence of wake on the downstream turbine is also discussed the finding of this work will provide significant instructions for operating offshore wind farms 2 methodology of alm in terms of time and computational cost compared with the conventional cfd method alm has a great advantage alm can produce preferable results at equivalent precision as the traditional cfd method does but with less computing resources and time therefore alm is especially suitable for the simulation of three dimensional flow fields for offshore wind farms the basis of the alm is the incompressible navier stokes ns equations 1 d v d t 1 ρ p ν 2 v f 2 v 0 where t and ρ are the time and density respectively and v is the velocity vector p represents the stresses tensor ν is the kinematic viscosity and the source term f denotes the body force which represents the load on the flow field imposed by rotating blades based on the newton s third law the body force can be attained using the force applied on blades by flow field since there are no solid walls of blades in the alm the force acted on blades needs to be calculated via an extra model which can achieve the equivalent effect of real blades with solid walls in this paper we adopt the bem as the extra model combined with tabulated two dimensional airfoil characteristics alm accesses the information of flow fields at each cfd time step and meanwhile calculates the aerodynamic characteristics of blades by the following equations 3 f τ 1 2 ρ w 2 c c τ τ 4 f n 1 2 ρ w 2 c c n n 5 f s f τ f n where w relative velocity of the local airfoil c local chord of the airfoil c τ coefficient of the tangential force τ tangential unit vector c n coefficient of the normal force n normal unit vector f τ f n and f s tangential normal and resultant forces of the unit length blade automatically the body force of fluid flow given by blades can be represented as the following 6 f f f s in the end body force is distributed radially along lines representing the blades via numerically smearing as shown in fig 5 the body force needs to be distributed within a certain scope around the lines blades in order to avoid singular behavior otherwise the cfd simulation may not converge if the area of body force distribution is smaller whereas if bigger vortexes on tip and root of blades would be weakened excessively wimshurst and willden 2016 to ensure the body force smear smoothly a three dimensional gaussian manner like equation 7 is adopted 7 f r 1 ε 3 π 3 2 e r ε 2 where r represents the distance between the body force center on blade and the distributed point in fluid domain and ε is the smearing factor that controls the gradient of body force distributing troldborg 2008 points out that the distribution of body force has a significant influence on the results of the simulations and in three dimensional distribution of gauss for alm the equation ε 2 δ s should be met if the effect of alm wants to be extremely close to the real wind turbine situation while δ s is the distance of points on the actuator line compared with what would be needed for simulating the actual geometry of the blades the advantage of representing the blades by airfoil data as it is done in the actuator line model is that much fewer grid points are needed to capture the influence of the blades therefore the alm provides a detailed study of the dynamics of different wake structures using a reasonably number of grid nodes furthermore the model benefits from being applicable with simple structured grids and consequently issues connected to grid generation do not occur on the other hand a drawback of the method is its reliance on tabulated airfoil characteristics however as the main purpose of the present paper is to study fundamental wake effects it is of minor importance to capture the dynamic stall or other flow regimes on the blades exactly the alm technic described above is implemented in the openfoam package which is an open source cfd software developed with object oriented c it has the benefit of being free and therefore essentially provides unlimited licenses this means its source codes are available which helps users know exactly how codes function and allows modification and expansion that are necessary for new code development and research on this fundamental level and it should be pointed that the version of openfoam 3 0 1 is employed in this paper we construct a new solver newturbinepisofoam based on the built in solver pisofoam in openfoam 3 0 1 it is based on the pressure implicit split operator piso method that is more efficient and accurate compared to the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple method the new solver newturbinepisofoam is intended for the numerical simulation of horizontal axis wind turbine based on the alm compared with the pisofoam newturbinepisofoam constructs a c class turbines which can function a series of operations such as defining the array of the body force solving the body force distributing the body force and so on accordingly a wind turbine can be added expediently in offshore wind farm just through setting the locations of coordinate values of the wind turbine the piece of code below this paragraph is a part of source codes of the alm solver implementation and properly speaking it is the moment predictor step equation from the include file ueq h in newturbinepisofoam finally the equation is evaluated using built in class fvvectormatrix that discretizes and distributes the operators specified within first order curled brackets image 1 3 computational implementation 3 1 wind turbine the computational object employed in the present work is a 5 mw rating wind turbine designed by the nrel affiliated to the u s department of energy nerl 5 mw wind turbine generally refers to the publicly available information of the multibrid m5000 and repower 5m prototype wind turbines as detailed information on those two machines is not available nerl 5 mw wind turbine also refers to the publicly available properties from the conceptual models used in the windpact recoff and dowec projects nrel 2009 the main specifications of nerl 5 mw wind turbine are illustrated in table 2 3 2 offshore wind farm configuration in order to avoid tunnel blockage effect in computational simulation we created a larger numerical offshore wind farm with a flow domain of 20d in length 6d in width and 6d in height d represents the wind turbine rotor diameter two tandem wind turbines substituted by wt1 and wt2 respectively were located in the offshore wind farm and the two wind turbines was set at a distance of 7d with regard to the reasons for the choice of 7d first of all turbine performance at separation distances from 3d to 7d was examined and it was observed that the performance of downstream wind turbine decreased notably when the distance was less than 6d miao et al 2016 in addition the inter turbine distance in a wind farm needs to be estimated carefully to balance the power output efficiency and construction costs for example due to some constraints such as the cost of electrical connections or the availability of land surface an oversized separation is inappropriate son et al 2014 besides there is 3d from wt1 to the inlet of the wind farm and wt2 has been placed sufficiently far away from the outlet 10d to eliminate the effect on the flow of wake the flow domain and wind turbines are illustrated in fig 6 3 3 control strategies of wake deviation we implemented control strategies by executing changes of yaw and tilt angles for the upstream wt1 and in this way the wake of wt1 would deviate from the rotor center of the downstream wt2 for the purpose of better comparison we investigated 24 operation conditions associated with control strategies that consisted of 9 yaw angles and 15 tilt angles while the range of yaw angles were from 230 to 310 with the step length of 10 and tile angles were from 35 to 35 with the step length of 5 fig 7 is the sketch of the control strategies of wake deviation and the y direction is along the offshore wind farm s width that is perpendicular to the plane determined by x and z axis moreover in order to avoid the accident of blade tower collision it should be noted that the tilt angles between 0 and 35 are intended for the type of downwind wind turbine 3 4 mesh generation in consideration of the application of alm and fast there was no need to model solid wind turbine rotors or to resolve the boundary layer behavior around the blade which would need huge cell numbers and computational resources nedjari et al 2017 therefore the flow domain was meshed into structure elements with hexahedral cuboid grids through the built in mesh solver blockmesh in the openfoam it began with a coarse resolution of mesh in the flow domain then in order to confirm that the mesh was sufficient to capture the wake structure like blade tip vortices which was considered to be the most important flow characteristics and required the finer grids we locally refined the mesh in accordance to areas covered by wake corresponding to the rotation motion of the rotors in reality we chose the cylinder shaped zone associated with the refined region besides we added two

previous investigation fleming et al 2014 the meshes on the section plane that is orthotropic with the x direction and the meshes which cover the entire computational domain are shown in fig 8 a and b respectively 3 5 boundary conditions the boundary conditions of the offshore wind farm are shown in fig 9 the inlet condition was a uniform freestream velocity boundary whose direction was parallel to the x direction and magnitude was equal to the nominal rated velocity of nrel 5 mw 11 4 m s the outlet employed a pressure outlet the magnitude of which was as large as a standard atmospheric pressure two lateral sides were set to periodic boundary conditions which meant when a flow variable appears on the unit cell of one side it would simultaneously re appear on the opposite side with the same value the reason why the lateral sides used the periodic boundary was mainly that in practice there were flow domains at both sides of the offshore wind farm and they were the same besides the upper and the lower faces consisted of two slip boundaries and if we would like to apply the numerical method presented in this paper to onshore wind farms we should change the boundary conditions according to the land based characteristics 4 results and discussions 4 1 output power of wind turbines in this paper the computational simulation was unsteady we employed the parallel block technic with thirty cores to compute all cases with regard to the convergence criteria the residuals for the pressure and velocity were set to 1 10 5 and 1 10 6 respectively which were sufficient to produce converged solutions within every numerical interval and guarantee the reliability of the simulation for every computational time step the alm calculated and output the power of wind turbines when the wind blows from the inlet of computational domain to the outlet which took approximate 220s we continued to calculate until the total time reached the 300s we use the average of the last 80s s data as the final

output power of wind turbines respectively from the output results of yaw control in fig 10a it can be easily seen that there are evident discrepancies between wt1 and wt2 the output power of wt1 changes obviously when the yaw angles varies from 230 to 310 with the step length of 10 while at the 230 of yaw angle the output power of wt1 is 2 8663 mw which only makes up 57 5 of the output power when it is at the zero yaw angle with further enlargement of the yaw angle the output power of wt1 is increasing gradually at the yaw angle of 270 the power output arrives at the peak value of 4 9849

power output of wt2 is in sharp contrast to that of wt1 when the yaw angles are at 230 and 310 the power output of wt1 are at the maximum values 4 5765 mw and 4 5939 mw respectively whereas the minimum of power output of wt2 occurs at the yaw angle of 270 with a value of only 0 8570 mw moreover the distribution law in fig 10a indicates that our work using alm and openfoam to optimize the offshore wind farm is correct and valid in the output results of tilt control in fig 10b we find that the power output of wt1 increases at first and then decreases as the tilt angles varies from 35 to 35 with the step length of 5 the power output reaches the maximum of 5 0205 mw at the tilt angle of 0 while the tilt angles are 35 and 35 respectively the power of wt1 are 3 4016 mw and 3 4002 mw accordingly in contrast compared with wt1 wt2 has an opposite variation tendency of power output when the tilt angle is 0 wt2 falls to its minimum power value only 0 7900 mw while the angles are 35 and 35 the output power of wt2 are 4 1728 mw and 4 3038 mw respectively moreover we also find that the power output at plus tilt angles is higher than that at the corresponding minus tilt angles in order to clearly reveal distinctly the changes of output power of wind turbines with both of the two control strategies of wake deviation we define the power output ratio as the power output of wt1 without the yaw or tilt divided by the power output with control strategies table 3 and table 4 indicate the power output ratios of wind turbines obtained from the yaw and tilt control strategies 4 2 total output power of the offshore wind farm fig 11 illustrates the total output power of the offshore wind farm in the condition of the control strategies of yaw and tilt from fig 11 we find that the total output power of the two control strategies both have two maximum values and one minimum values which fit well to fig 10 it should be noted that the effects of two control strategies on total output power of the offshore wind farm are not absolutely the same instead the yaw control strategy generates a bit more total output power than the tilt control strategy does the maximum and the minimum total output power of the offshore wind farm under the yaw control strategy are 7 9071 mw and 5 8419 mw respectively while the maximum and the minimum total output power under the tilt control strategy are 7 8146 mw and 5 8105 mw in addition the total output power of plus tilt angles is about one hundred thousand watts more than that of the corresponding minus tilt angles from fig 11 we can also see that the maximums of total output power all appear to be at the 30 of the deviation angle that is because at this deviation angle the output power of wt1 and wt2 are all considerable we define the deviation angle as the absolute difference value between the yaw angle and the tilt angle with the angle of no control strategy based on the three order polynomial as the base function we fit the relations of total output power of the offshore wind farm with the angles of control strategies of yaw and tilt using the least square method finally we can attain equations 8 and 9 8 p 1 3

to 310 p 2 represents total output power of the offshore wind farm under tilt control strategy φ is the tilt angle from 35 to 35 besides mainly because of the restriction of computing resources and time it is impossible to compute all angles so we only simulate the integer angle values anyway it should be noted that the general tendency of equations 8 and 9 is accurate table 5 shows the differences between total output power of positive and negative tilt angles in the tilt control strategy as mentioned above we know that the total output power of positive tilt angles is in general more than that of the corresponding negative tilt angles so the difference values here are all positive and with the absolute value of the deviation angle increasing the difference values are getting bigger 4 3 velocity nephogram fig 12 is the velocity nephogram of horizontal cross section namely the top view at the height of hub for nine operating conditions of the yaw control strategy from these nephograms we could access intuitively the influence of wake from upstream wind turbine on the downstream and the mechanism of the yaw control strategy to weaken the effect of wake as illustrated in fig 12 the yaw control strategy can remarkably change the orientation of the wake fromwt1 if the yaw angle is greater the deviation of the wake is more obvious when the yaw angle is 260 or 280 the wake of wt1 begins to deviate from the rotor center of wt2 therefore the influence of wake from the upstream wind turbine is weakened and the average velocity of the inflow of wt2 increases in this condition the output power of wt2 is about two times of the output power without the wake control strategy the enlargement of the output power of wt2 is apparent which is in good agreement with fig 10a with further increase of the yaw angle the effect of wt1 on wt2 becomes weaker consequently the proportion of inflow of wt2 that is not influenced by wt1 rises and the average velocity of inflow of wt2 increases especially when the yaw angle of wt1 is 310 or 230 wake of wt1 almost deviates from the rotor of wt2 and the influence of wt1 on wt2 is so weak that the output power of wt2 approximately approaches to its rated power however when the yaw angle of wt1 is too big its operating condition is seriously away from the designed optimal condition in consequence the output power of wt1 may decline drastically causing the total output power of the offshore wind farm too less than that at the 300 or 230 of the yaw angle therefore when the yaw angle is too big or too small the total output power of the offshore wind farm cannot reach the maximum while the yaw angle is 300 or 240 wt1 and wt2 are both at an ideal operating condition and the total output power of the offshore wind farm arrives at the largest the above substance fits well to the results of fig 11 fig 13 is the velocity nephogram of vertical cross section namely see from one side to another of the offshore wind farm through two rotor centers in fifteen operating conditions of the tilt control strategy which perspicuously displays the deviation of the wake in fig 13 we can find that the greater the absolute value of the tilt angle the more obvious the wake deviation is as a result the effect of the upstream wind turbine on wt2 becomes feebler hence the quality of inflow of wt2 turns higher and the output power remarkably improves this fits well to figs 10b and 11 besides in fig 10b the total output power of plus tilt angles is about one hundred thousand watts more than that of the corresponding minus tilt angles this is realistic and can be interpreted according to fig 13 that is to say when the tilt angle is plus the wake of wt1 deviates downwards and enhanced by gravity it will further increase the output power of wt2 while the tilt angle is minus the wake of wt1 deviates upwards and the deviation is weakened by gravity so the output power of wt2 turns less 5 conclusions in this paper we have modified the standard solver pisofoam in the open source software openfoam and developed a new solver newturbinepisofoam on this basis we conducted computational simulations for the nrel 5wm wind turbines in an offshore wind farm two control strategies of wake deviation were adopted to simulate 24 operating conditions the results demonstrate an instructional significance for the offshore wind farm in operating wind turbines by numerical analysis the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the power of wind turbines flow fields and wake deviation have been simulated with relatively far less computing resources and time it indicates the present modified solver has good accuracy and extensive applicability 2 the influence of wake from the upstream wind turbine on the downstream wind turbine cannot be negligible by controlling the deviation of the wake from the upstream wind turbine we could effectively weaken the impact of the wake on the performance of the downstream wind turbine 3 compared with the tilt control strategy the yaw control strategy could attain more total output power of the offshore wind farm with regard to the tilt control strategy plus tilt angles are better than the minus 4 there is an optimal angle generally being the 30 of the deviation angle for both the yaw and tilt control strategy with regard to the total output power of the offshore wind farm under these circumstances the output power of the upstream and the downstream wind turbines are all considerable 5 the present work has the potential to be extended to a simulation of an offshore wind farm with hundreds of wind turbines above all it can be directly applied to the real offshore wind farms and is likely to produce some considerable
