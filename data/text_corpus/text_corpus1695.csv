8475,study region pannonian basin central and eastern europe study focus this study carried out by the geological surveys of hungary slovenia austria and slovakia combines a joint characterization of a transboundary thermal groundwater system based on harmonised geological and hydrogeological data with hydrodynamic modelling delivering recommendations for authorities and policy makers on how they could improve the long term management of thermal groundwater a porous intergranular multi layered upper pannonian aquifer system was the focus of this investigation this deep sedimentary basin up to 8000 m deep has favourable conditions for geothermal exploitation with centuries old thermal water usage and plans for increased utilization in all countries new hydrological insights for the region cross border areas with significant transboundary flow rates were identified which have decreased due to thermal water production with flow direction reversal across the hungarian slovakian border thermal water production causes significant transboundary effects with depression cones that can penetrate several tens of kilometres into the neighbouring countries simulated drawdowns at the state borders are in the range of 2 10 m thermal water should therefore be exploited using doublets nine benchmark indicators monitoring status best available technology thermal efficiency utilisation

western part of the pannonian basin was a result of the determination of hydrogeologists and earth scientists to jointly investigate all natural resources not only those which are visible on the surface but also those which are hidden from our eyes this cooperation dates back to the end of the 1980s császár 2000 and became stronger from the middle of the first decade of the 21st century brezsnyánszky et al 2008 malík et al 2012 although several bilateral commissions exist in the region their work focuses mainly on surface water issues and very little has been done in connection with groundwater following the economic and political changes in central europe in the late 80s and after a downturn in the use of water and energy private companies started to flourish a boom in thermal spa and greenhouse developments started at the same time it became clear that an increase in groundwater abstraction would follow rman et al 2015 according to their renewable energy action plans nreaps most of the central european countries but especially of hungary slovenia austria and slovakia planned a 3 3 5 fold increase in their geothermal heat production from 2010 to 2020 com 2015 293 in order to implement these ambitious goals it was essential to properly survey the aquifers and hydrothermal reservoirs and get familiar with their physical and chemical characteristics the quantitative and qualitative assessment of aquifers independent of national borders is also important in the framework of groundwater body status assessment within the river basin management plans required by the 2000 60 ec water framework directive wfd the first joint transboundary aquifer management plan in the pannonian basin dealing with the hungarian slovenian porous intergranular thermal aquifer thermal joint aquifer management t jam nádor et al 2012 was formulated within a hungarian slovenian interreg iiia project in order to support the sustainable management and further developments based on the use of transboundary thermal aquifers in the western part of the pannonian basin the geological surveys of hungary slovenia austria and slovakia jointly delineated fig 1 and characterised potential geothermal aquifers rotár szalkai et al 2017 their exploitation rman et al 2015 carried out 3d hydrodynamic modelling tóth et al 2016 and defined nine benchmarking indicators prestor et al 2015 they also prepared a white paper for a harmonised management strategy for the sustainable utilisation of thermal water and geothermal energy taking into account the goals of wfd and nreap the work was carried out within the framework of the transboundary geothermal energy resources of slovenia austria hungary and slovakia transenergy project within the central european programme nádor et al 2013a the delineated upper pannonian transboundary thermal aquifer uptta is one out of the 199 aquifers incorporated into the comparative assessment of transboundary aquifers within the continuation of the transboundary waters assessment programme twap this work was not part of the internationally shared aquifer resources management isarm initiative a unesco and iah led multi agency programme aimed at improving the understanding of scientific socio economic legal institutional and environmental issues related to the management of transboundary aquifers but follows its main concepts this paper presents the results of the joint work related to the upper pannonian multi layered thermal aquifer 1 1 policies related to the use of aquifers in the involved countries and their consequences beside national legislation the exploitation of aquifers in the european union has to be carried out in the context of two main policies the water policy and the energy policy although they both deal with issues related to aquifers they have competing interests the european framework of the water policy is in line with the wfd and targets the groundwater within the aquifer focusing on the protection of the resource the energy policy 2009 28 ec on renewable energy directive focuses on the maximum utilisation of resources by using the heat energy stored in the subsurface space in line with the target numbers of the national renewable energy action plans nreap while the water policy s objective was to achieve and maintain the good qualitative and quantitative status of ground water by 2015 or under some required conditions in the second or third management cycle in 2021 or 2027 respectively the energy policy aims to increase to the proportion of the renewable energy source namely geothermal energy within the energy portfolio not only the objectives but also the measures and the time frames of achieving these objectives are different table 1 a review of legislation in the four countries lapanje and prestor 2011 shows the following geothermal resources are owned by the state except in austria where they belong to the land owner geothermal resource management is divided between ministries of environment and water dealing with abstraction of thermal groundwater and ministries of energy industry economics national development controlling the geothermal energy utilization without groundwater production or dealing just with the heat extraction of thermal water e g geothermal doublets the most permissive regulatory framework is in austria where even the energy content of the thermal water is not acknowledged in the legislation while the most integrated legislation exists in slovakia controlled by the geological act abstraction of thermal water is based on a water license in all four countries however there is currently an initiative april 2017 for the modification of the hungarian water management law 57 1995 which if accepted would allow groundwater abstraction without any licencing and even any reporting of the abstraction up to a depth of 80 m below surface in the case of household supplies in hungary a geothermal concession is needed for deep geothermal energy usage more than 2500 m below surface these areas are closed for geothermal energy exploitation and such an exploitation request cannot be directly submitted to the authority but the investor can initiate a request at the hungarian office for mining and geology in order for a concession to be prepared if the ministry accepts that the area can be used for exploitation than the investors can apply for a concession based on an open tendering re injection of the abstracted thermal water for energy use is compulsory in slovakia slovenia and austria however this is mostly defined in individual water permits while compulsory for slovenia it is not actually achieved in practise at existing energy use sites e g greenhouses the hungarian legislation was changed from requested re injection to a non compulsory approach in 2013 since then used thermal water can be re injected also defined on a case by case basis which means there is no re injection in most cases in slovenia the use of doublets is obligatory if granted a licence by the mining act but since 2015 the re injection provides lower concession fees also for new licences granted according to the water act temperature and chemical thresholds for emitting used thermal water into surface water or aquifers are strictly regulated in all four countries monitoring of inspected wells is carried out in all four countries however the extent the measured parameters and their frequency and the organisations responsible for the monitoring and reporting are very different in accordance with the wfd in hungary there are also wells operating specially for thermal groundwater body monitoring 1 2 financial supporting schemes a review of available financial support nádor et al 2013b revealed that there are a number of options to obtain subsidies funds and loans from the world bank the european investment bank and various international banks these can be used mainly for funding the drilling of exploration production wells or activities such as establishing and running district heating facilities in some cases the danube transnational programme and state budgets are also available tax incentives are currently not available for producers of green electricity from geothermal sources except for slovakia geothermal energy in theory would benefit from this exemption if there were any geothermal power plants the hungarian and slovakian nreap s foresee geothermal based electricity in production by 2020 slovenia does not so feed in tariffs may become relevant the current austrian feed in tariff for geothermally produced electricity is too low to promote any further investment geothermal energy as currently produced is mostly suitable for direct heat utilization such as district heating indirect support schemes for renewable energy related operative programmes in hungary slovakia and slovenia have been financed by the structural and cohesion funds these eu funds have provided an average of 50 up to 85 financing of geothermal projects with a total support in the range of 100 million the beneficiaries were typically sme s larger companies non profit organizations private companies and municipalities risk insurance as one of the most important supporting instrument for geothermal energy is not available in any of the four countries 2 geographical and geological description of the upper pannonian transboundary thermal aquifer the upper pannonian transboundary thermal aquifer uptta extends from ne slovenia to sw slovakia over an area of approximately 20 300 km2 the entire area is located in the danube river drainage basin within the pannonian basin lowlands of the mura zala styrian vienna and danube basins rarely extend to elevations of 300 m a s l and the landscape is rural with only a few middle sized cities population mostly between 60 000 and 130 000 present the humid temperate climate results in a decrease in precipitation from about 1500 mm in the south west to 500 mm in the north west with some local variations related to topography the basement of the pannonian basin consists of paleozoic and mesozoic crystalline rocks and carbonates paleogene siliciclastic and andesitic rocks and neogene and quaternary sediments were deposited on it displayed in the neogene sequence the processes connected with the infilling of the huge inland lake pannon resulted in the formation of the uptta the lake was formed approximately 12 million years ago and deepened until 9 8 million years ago sub basins were filled rapidly by huge siliciclastic deltaic systems of the alpine and the carpathian rivers magyar et al 1999 the bottom of the uptta is mostly formed by the turbiditic silt and argillaceous marl that were deposited on basin slopes simultaneously the delta front environment evolved into a prograding shelf resulting in deposition of thick sand bodies the uptta was delineated based on lithostratigraphy and is formed by the upper pannonian delta front sand and poorly lithified sandstone which generally extends to depths between 500 and 2000 m fig 1 the sand prone units are mostly composed internally of individual delta lobes of few tens of meters in thickness and separated by pelitic layers nádor et al 2012 the uptta is overlain by fine grained pontian and quaternary delta and alluvial plain sediments representing the latest stages of the sub basin filling 3 hydrogeological description of the upper pannonian transboundary thermal aquifer the upper pannonian multi layered delta front sediments reach a total thickness of more than 2000 m averaging about 800 m the effective aquifer thickness which comprises the sandy sequence is estimated to be about 300 m if intercalated fine grained sediments are excluded as aquitards the uptta sands are heterogeneous and anisotropic the horizontal hydraulic conductivity varies between approximately 4 0e 06 and 5 0e 05 m s while the vertical hydraulic conductivity varies between approximately 6 0e 10 and 7 0e 08 m s the effective porosity is estimated to up to 30 the regional groundwater flow system has evolved in these sands and locally especially along faults density and heat driven flows may interfere with gravitational flows however no convection cells are yet discovered in this porous geothermal aquifer a clear distinction between this regional flow system and the shallower intermediate flow system in the upper pannonian delta plain and deeper quaternary sediments can be made also based on hydrogeochemistry the stratification of groundwater shows that moderately mineralized up to 2000 mg l tds water of na hco3 type is stored in the uptta this infiltrated during the pleistocene szőcs et al 2013 rman 2016 probably during the last interglacial period meteoric water which recharges the aquifer infiltrates through outcrops at the sub basin margins and percolates through overlying layers however it can be shown that the recharge is very slow and limited based on hydrogeological investigations which fail to show any significant annual difference in terms of volume and frequency of recharge tóth et al 2016 with groundwater residence time of several ten thousand years the regional natural groundwater flow in the natural state occurs in two main directions figs 2 4 and 5 in the south of the uptta the infiltrated water percolates along the strata approximately from west to east so from slovenia and austria towards the discharge area of the hévíz and balaton lakes in hungary in its northern part the prevalent flow direction occurs from the north east to south west from slovakia to hungary with discharge along the danube river since the pannonian basin is located above a positive geothermal anomaly with an average heat flow of 100 mw m2 hurter and haenel 2002 lenkey et al 2002 elevated groundwater temperatures up to 100 c are recorded in the deepest part of the uptta the average heat flow in the part of the pannonian basin under investigation is 75 80 mw m2 goetzl et al 2012 temperatures below 80 c prevail in most of the aquifer and thermal water only rarely exceeds 60 c at the wellhead fig 3 as many as 225 geothermal wells were identified in the area fig 1 having screen intervals up to about 2400 m below surface mostly they tap only the uptta fig 1 but 13 of wells terminate in the aquifer below due to a need for higher water temperatures or more mineralized water the hydraulic conditions result in an observation that 13 of wells almost exclusively in slovakia are still producing without submersible pumps fig 3 while at least 70 of the total needs pumps of the 225 wells about 64 were constantly in production fig 3 an additional 10 occasionally produced while no information was available for the remaining wells only three re injection wells were identified in the region fig 3 one in each country except austria however only the one used for a district heating system in lendava in slovenia was active at the time of this investigation 4 3d hydrodynamic modelling to help understanding the flow systems in order to better characterise and quantify the cross border flows in the studied aquifer system and to evaluate the potential effects of current and future groundwater abstractions a 3d hydrodynamic model was set up using the usgs modflow v 2011 code the model has an aerial extent of 283 km x 314 km and extends to a depth of 8 km having a 1 km 1 km cell size it took account of the heterogeneity and anisotropy of the seven hydrostratigraphic units which were introduced into the numerical model as 11 layers these units are quaternary unconfined aquifers deeper quaternary confined freshwater aquifers upper pannonian confined freshwater and thermal aquifers lower miocene to lower pannonian aquitards weathered and or karstified basement containing thermal aquifers and low permeability unweathered basement rocks the uptta was represented as layer no 6 the upper pannonian confined geothermal aquifers three steady state model scenarios were prepared starting from the natural state in the 1960s with no groundwater production see fig 4 to application of the average annual production rate based on the production from 2007 to 2009 to a five times increased production rate for a forecast model fig 5 no freshwater production was included in the model both production scenarios were further subdivided into five sub scenarios to evaluate the effects of production by each country and combined the natural state model was not calibrated as it was developed by deducting the thermal water abstraction rates from the calibrated steady state production model with applied average 2007 2009 production rates previous research and hydrodynamic modelling provided cross border information on the extent of use of the upper pannonian thermal aquifer between hungary and slovenia nádor et al 2012 but this was a very new regional wide approach the results of modelling were used to evaluate the present and potential future aquifer depletion as one of the most important factors in long term sustainable use of thermal water and geothermal systems rybach 2003 rman et al 2016 a detailed description of the setup of the hydrodynamic model and the results of the modelling is presented by tóth et al 2016 4 1 results of scenario modelling 4 1 1 model scenario 1 natural 1960s steady state situation in the pre production state the regional thermal water flow direction was from west to east in the southern part of the uptta fig 4 from sw to ne in the southern part of the danube basin and from ne to sw in its northern part the hydraulic heads ranged from approximately 220 110 m a s l major discharges occurred west of lake balaton and near győr hu and south east of lake neusiedl at tóth et al 2016 4 1 2 model scenario 2 average annual production rate based on abstraction in the period 2007 2009 the average production is the following 4628 m3day 1 for 21wells in south west hungary 5854 m3day 1 for 19 wells in north west hungary 5336 m3day 1 for 17 wells in slovenia 0 m3day 1 for austria having no geothermal wells and 7726 m3day 1 for 27 wells in slovakia thermal water production simulated extensive drawdowns around major production sites with values exceeding 20 m at production wells the total regional drawdown is modelled to be between 2 and 10 m respectively fig 5 across the cross border region of the uptta the drawdown cone exceeding 0 5 m extends as far as about 60 km in the neighbouring countries the simulated cross border drawdowns are different at different locations fig 5 the slovenian production causes a drawdown of approximately 6 m at the si hu border the production in sw hungary causes a drawdown of approximately 2 m at the si hu and at hu borders the production in ne hungary causes a drawdown of 2 5 m at the sk hu border and about 2 m at the at hu border while the slovakian production causes a drawdown less than 1 5 m at the at sk border and 3 m at the sk hu one the most affected areas are the mura zala and the danube basins with total simulated drawdown of about 10 m and 6 m respectively if freshwater production was taken into account the drawdown is expected to be at least a few meters more it should be mentioned that thermal water production increased in the last years compared to this 2007 2009 period 4 1 3 model scenario 3 forward modelling based on 5 fold increase in production compared to 2007 2009 a five fold increase in total production would cause the drawdowns to increase to over 40 m at the si hu border 20 m at the southern at hu border 15 m along the at hu border to the north and 30 m at the hu sk border it would also open new flow paths between hungary and slovakia and lead to a severely increased flow from austria to hungary the whole uptta is covered by the quaternary unconfined freshwater aquifers e g zone 1 in fig 5 additionally fresh and thermal water aquifers were distinguished in each country in order to interpret the changes in the water budget due to the regional thermal water production simulation shows that thermal aquifers received 86 910 m3 day recharge in the pre exploitation state table 2 production has induced recharge from shallow confined aquifers to the thermal aquifers by 13 060 m3 day and decreased thermal water discharge to unconfined ones by 170 m3 day while between thermal aquifers there is a recharge of 24 980 m3 day table 3 cross border flows have been changed due to thermal water production in several ways generally leading to a reduction in the flows table 2 the natural thermal water budget was positive for austria regarding hungary but production has decreased the surplus to only 60 m3 day a five fold increase in production could reverse the flow direction tóth et al 2016 existing production has resulted in establishment of a new flow connection discharge from the slovakian thermal water into the austrian confined freshwater aquifer has occurred at 6 m3 day and can increase with higher production rates e g five fold increase in rates the thermal water budget between slovenia and hungary was strongly positive in the direction of hungary 3930 m3 day in the natural state thermal water production has reduced both the freshwater flow rate to hungary by 8 and the thermal water flow rate by 24 to about 2980 m3 day increased production would actually change the flow direction towards slovenia for fresh and thermal waters the natural thermal water budget from slovakia to hungary was about 6000 m3 day in the pre production period thermal water production has caused a reversal of transboundary flow which based on the average abstractions between 2007 and 2009 leads to a surplus of 2140 m3 day for slovakia this volume would increase if production increases 5 benchmarking a tool for thermal aquifer assessment and management in order to ensure a long term sustainable management of transboundary or even national geothermal aquifers an easy to apply and objective method is required which can uniformly be applied in the neighbouring countries in addition to this the method has to be capable of quantifying and evaluating the relevant parameters related to transboundary or even national aquifer exploitation by multiple users a comprehensive draft guidelines for multidisciplinary assessment of transboundary aquifers was published by the international groundwater resource assessment centre igrac in 2015 igrac and unesco ihp 2015 with the aim of providing a methodology for assessment of aquifers and guidelines for its implementation transboundary aquifers are in general cold water aquifers and these guidelines aim specifically to tackle these aquifers however in some cases thermal groundwater resources are also shared by different countries which parallel to its geological hydrogeological assessment and a regular monitoring also requires the assessment of certain specific parameters for sustainable thermal water resource development and management in order to achieve a rapid semi quantitative evaluation of thermal groundwater resources whether transboundary or not a pre existing scheme developed by lachavanne and juge 2009 for managing the region around lake geneva in switzerland was reworked and modified as a key action in the transenergy project nine indicators based on data evaluation information availability and relevance were defined prestor et al 2015 the indicators are assigned numerical values based on a calculation method eq 1 9 using detailed information such as status monitoring and operation taken from different wells this leads to a grouping within five categories bad weak medium good and very good which allows a fast comparison of different aquifers in different regions to be made how these indicators are calculated and what information is used is shown below the nine benchmarking indicators are the following 1 monitoring setup 2 best available technology 3 thermal efficiency 4 utilisation efficiency 5 re injection rate 6 quality of discharged thermal water 7 over abstraction 8 status of water balance 9 public awareness the monitoring setup indicator is linked to the choice of parameters to be recorded at a site this can be simple eg only water level varying up to complex where numerous parameters are recorded both at the production and monitoring wells importantly this indicator also shows whether the monitoring at a given level local regional is carried out in a unified integrated way and also indicates the degree of groundwater abstraction monitoring regional evaluation of the resources of thermal aquifers depends on an optimally functioning monitoring system and provides a basis for issuing new water abstraction permits the monitoring setup criteria and related points are shown in table 4 the indicator

for this and all other equations are explained at the beginning of the paper the best available technology bat indicator shows whether appropriate technical parameters exist at well installations whether cascade use is applied how efficiently the water usage is implemented and it also describes the overall status of documentation if good bat is being implemented this will lead to a reduced operational cost safer operation and usage efficiency at the same time any environmental pollution will be reduced the bat use criteria and related points are shown in table 5 the indicator

efficiency is determined from the ratio between the used and the available annual heat energy the mean annual air temperature is used as a reference lowering the temperature of the waste thermal water through the use of e g cascade systems will increase the thermal efficiency this also leads to a reduction in the total amount of abstracted thermal groundwater and reduces the threat of thermal and chemical pollution of surface waters coming from discharge of waste thermal waters the indicator calculation formula eq 3 1 3 3 and corresponding classification scoring are 3 1 t e i 1 n η i q i i 1 n

simply taken from the installed pump capacity a more realistic approximation is calculated on the basis of the maximum yield and conditions as stated in the water permits the transenergy project evaluated this approach in detail this indicator cannot be calculated for naturally discharged thermal waters e g from springs which enter the ecosystems the indicator calculation formula eq 4 and

rate as it can be used as a test for sustainable thermal water exploitation re injection is permitted only for non treated and uncontaminated thermal water i e used only for its heat energy it is calculated based on the ratio of the volume of re injected and abstracted thermal water used for geothermal energy production this indicator shows whether re injection is taking place or not it does not monitor where re injection is taking place i e in the same aquifer from where the thermal water is abstracted unfortunately if re injection takes place it is often applied to shallower aquifers this is in direct contradiction with the guidelines of the water framework directive since shallow re injection can lead to the introduction of higher organic matter and or trace element content into these aquifers a new parameter to be included in the indicator calculation will be a check if the re injection depth is the same as the abstraction depth the indicator calculation formula eq 5 and

discharged thermal waste water shows if an operating well does or does not pose a chemical or thermal threat to surface waters or other parts of the environment it also shows how many wells comply with the local or international legislative standards for thermal wastewater emissions the indicator calculation formula eq 6 1 and eq 6 2 and corresponding classification scoring are 6 1 i q u a l w

status of the aquifer potential impacts include piezometric level water temperature groundwater availability water quality change the groundwater dependent ecosystem and subsidence and so these are included in the calculation and evaluated the over abstraction criteria and related points are shown in table 6 the indicator calculation formula eq 7 and corresponding classification scoring are 7 i

of information on the water quantity status of an aquifer reliable good quality regional hydrogeological data is needed in order to make an estimate on the natural recharge of a thermal aquifer if there is an ongoing national monitoring programme and data interpretation can be combined with data from users active monitoring then more accurate estimates can be calculated it is proposed that every 3 6 years the annual data for water balance assessment and regional hydrogeological evaluation should be assessed and evaluated since only after this period will any trends become evident goldbrunner et al 2007 the status of water balance assessment criteria and related points are shown in table 7 only one criteria can be allocated to one well the indicator calculation formula eq 8 and

public to make an informed decision relevant parameters in the calculation include open access on information about monitoring bat the quantity status of aquifers the quality of discharged thermal

major changes in the piezometric levels and water budgets in the transboundary zones of the upper pannonian aquifer as discussed in section 4 were identified between slovenia and hungary and between hungary and slovakia the benchmark indicators presented above for these two regions are summarised in fig 6 based on data covering the period 2009 slovakia and 2011 slovenia hungary 5 1 hungarian slovakian border region danube basin the benchmarking comparison carried out in this study clearly shows that the general management of the geothermal aquifers under investigation has to be improved significantly in both countries the results of this comparison together with the main issues which should be improved first nádor et al 2013a are currently the monitoring indicator for the active thermal water wells is only medium monitoring of geothermal aquifers relies on reported abstraction yield and temperature on an annual basis with monthly reported values in both countries all water users have a legal obligation under the slovakian water act to report these values annually relative to limits stated in the water act groundwater users also have to report yearly their abstractions in hungary to the water authorities only active wells are used for benchmarking in the monitoring evaluation there is no independent monitoring of the geothermal aquifer e g through monitoring wells constructed exclusively for this purpose in any of the countries the exploitation of thermal water is not always done using the best available technologies sometimes wellheads are poorly maintained and there may be gas or water leaks in the system pumps with frequency converters are occasionally installed cascade usage of thermal water is not applied in hungary there is a clear lack of use of efficient thermal systems such as cascade configurations for this reason there is only a medium thermal effectivity it is likely that this is a result of a lack of investment by the organisation exploiting the thermal water and shows also that there is limited or no support from the government or banks in this environmentally acceptable technology thermal efficiency needs improving in both countries there are no re injection wells operating in the studied region of the upper pannonian transboundary thermal aquifer there has been only one test to evaluate the re injection rate in the intergranular environment in a well in horna poton slovakia which shows very complicated conditions for re injection into such a geological environment nowadays this well is used as an abstraction well the only re injection is applied to the karst fissure environment mesozoic formation at the podhájska site several studies have been carried out in slovakia to evaluate the regional conditions for thermal water flow and related water regime as part of wider studies into recharge of geothermal water unfortunately there are no periodic updates from monitored data in the geothermal aquifer water balance calculations on the hungarian side of the study region cannot be considered representative nevertheless the amount of abstraction has been defined for most of the wells and is stated in the abstraction permit there is a deterioration in the quantity status of this geothermal aquifer which is reflected in the over abstraction indicators however more work is needed to better define the parameters of this indicator since no information on the quality of discharged thermal waste water was collected during this study so it was not possible to evaluate this parameter concerning public awareness information about the reported yield thermal water usage chemical composition and temperature of thermal water is partly available on some websites but is archived mainly in institutions responsible for data storage the general public does not have access to data on monitoring bat quantity status of the aquifers quality of discharged thermal waste water or energy efficiency of thermal water exploitation in specific cases these have not been even monitored 5 2 slovenian hungarian border region mura zala basin fig 5 shows that utilisation efficiency energy efficiency and best available technology are mostly good or very good in the mura zala basin while monitoring and over abstraction practice could be improved the lack of designated monitoring wells in the slovenian side resulted in a bad indicator value but the situation has much improved after 2015 reliable over abstraction calculations on the hungarian side could not be carried out due to lack of representative data re injection is bad in hungary with no operating re injection wells there is one re injection well but out of usage while the one re injection well in slovenia still only results in a weak indicator value it has been concluded that re injection will play a crucial part in the long term sustainable use of thermal waters not just in the mura zala basin but in the whole upper pannonian transboundary thermal aquifer there is a lot of progress to be made concerning the knowledge on the degree and reliability of information on the quantity status of the aquifer the situation in slovenia has much improved after 2015 as holders of the newly granted concession permits are obliged to set up a continuous monitoring system of groundwater levels temperatures and discharge rates and annually check the chemical composition of waters so in the next few years we expect to have a reliable evaluation of the aquifers state in both countries public awareness indicator results should be increased and stakeholders better informed about the current use and the need to improve it 6 transboundary agreements in hungary groundwater governance has been organised through the ministry of interior since 2014 the groundwater management is coordinated by the general directorate of water management under the supervision of ministry of interior this also includes the drafting of the river basin management plan under the supervision of the ministry of national development the geological and geophysical institute of hungary which from july 2017 has been merged into the mining and geological survey of hungary supports the national level groundwater status assessment and strategic planning it is also tasked with groundwater monitoring together with the regional water directorates and environmental authorities and assists the groundwater delineation on both national and bilateral levels and provides scientific support for transboundary groundwater management there are 11 aggregated transboundary groundwater bodies in the danube river basin and seven affect hungary at international level under the danube river protection convention signed on june 29 1994 in sofia bulgaria the activity of the groundwater task group within the international commission for protection of danube river icpdr is therefore relevant and important for hungary the work of the icpdr is supported by seven bilateral water commissions each of them based on bilateral agreement on government level of which 4 are active in groundwater governance the geological survey of slovenia provides professional support for the implementation of the national river basin management plan where it concerns groundwater with the plan being coordinated by the ministry of the environment and the spatial planning the ministry also manages bilateral water commissions and their activities the survey provides professional support to the ministry regarding groundwater and in the last years the mura zala transboundary thermal groundwater body has often been discusses in the permanent slovenian hungarian commission on water management 7 conclusions and perspectives although long term groundwater management has been practiced in the pannonian basin and transboundary bilateral agreements existed before isarm due to the hydrogeological conditions eg regional transboundary groundwater flow over large distances and existing and planned abstraction plans further steps for transboundary aquifer management are needed these should be in line with isarm unga res 63 124 unga 2008 the principles given by the un water convention unwc 2014 the eu water framework directive and the danube river basin management plans of icpdr in addition to supporting environmental goals it also has to follow the aims of sustainable utilization of renewable energy resources the resolution on transboundary aquifers prepared by the united nations general assembly should be considered for adoption by the four countries sharing the uptta the delineated uptta is a good example of how aquifers are shared and used by multiple countries lessons learnt from the surveys carried out and the results of the indicator system can be summarised as follows the system of licensing for thermal water abstraction and exploitation of geothermal resources is not efficiently regulated in general i e it is complicated both under and at the same time over regulated rather slow and expensive thus it does not help to develop national geothermal sectors we propose that the indicators defined previously prestor et al 2015 have to be measured and evaluated both when water permits are issued or concessions on thermal water use are granted and when they are renewed future refinement and or modification of some indicators especially focusing on the assessment of sustainable use of energy and thus thermal water exploitation can also be expected legislation and groundwater aquifer vary greatly across the region in order to overcome cross boarder differences a harmonised approach must be developed by the relevant institutes and authorities using common thinking and unified objectives the results of the benchmarking action highlight that there is a long tradition of using thermal water for balneological purposes in addition it can be seen that in the whole western part of the pannonian basin there is a very good utilization efficiency in this sector other indicators such as the re injection rate and public awareness have very low scores indicating that a major effort is needed to improve the management of the geothermal resources in all four countries this study looked only to see if re injection had been applied or not in a proper governance setting it will be necessary to differentiate between re injection into the aquifer from which water is being abstracted and re injection into other aquifers or at different depths of the same aquifer with the exception of austria the monitoring indicator for the active thermal water wells is mostly medium or bad effective monitoring of the geothermal aquifer should be prioritised in all countries which requires implementation of viable monitoring policies which should be taken care of by the relevant ministries and authorities dealing with resource management and environment protection data on the quality of emitted thermal waste water was not collected during this study and therefore it was not possible to accurately assess this parameter the indicator values for the best available technology vary between bad and good it has become apparent that the good values may be due to a lack of reliable information so far the thermal aquifers are not being over abstracted but the good results can potentially act as an early warning indicator giving the first signals of deterioration in status shown by decrease of piezometric levels or change in groundwater quality the thermal efficiency indicator generally shows a bad or very bad status so we recommend that the exploitation of annual heat energy of operating wells should be increased rather than focusing on the exploitation of new wells the thermal efficiency indicator does not correctly reflect the efficiency of the well in the case of low less than about 35 c wellhead temperatures the status of water balance assessment is also bad or very bad in hungary slovenia and slovakia so there is much to be achieved in defining critical level points and critical limits of abstraction in all four countries especially in those cases where the wells are located close to the national borders the successful cooperation established among the geological surveys of the four countries of uptta with a harmonised evaluation of transboundary hydrogeothermal resources

the danube region and involves 15 partners from hungary slovenia croatia serbia bosnia and herzegovina and romania they work together to promote sustainable utilization of the existing but still

8475,study region pannonian basin central and eastern europe study focus this study carried out by the geological surveys of hungary slovenia austria and slovakia combines a joint characterization of a transboundary thermal groundwater system based on harmonised geological and hydrogeological data with hydrodynamic modelling delivering recommendations for authorities and policy makers on how they could improve the long term management of thermal groundwater a porous intergranular multi layered upper pannonian aquifer system was the focus of this investigation this deep sedimentary basin up to 8000 m deep has favourable conditions for geothermal exploitation with centuries old thermal water usage and plans for increased utilization in all countries new hydrological insights for the region cross border areas with significant transboundary flow rates were identified which have decreased due to thermal water production with flow direction reversal across the hungarian slovakian border thermal water production causes significant transboundary effects with depression cones that can penetrate several tens of kilometres into the neighbouring countries simulated drawdowns at the state borders are in the range of 2 10 m thermal water should therefore be exploited using doublets nine benchmark indicators monitoring status best available technology thermal efficiency utilisation

western part of the pannonian basin was a result of the determination of hydrogeologists and earth scientists to jointly investigate all natural resources not only those which are visible on the surface but also those which are hidden from our eyes this cooperation dates back to the end of the 1980s császár 2000 and became stronger from the middle of the first decade of the 21st century brezsnyánszky et al 2008 malík et al 2012 although several bilateral commissions exist in the region their work focuses mainly on surface water issues and very little has been done in connection with groundwater following the economic and political changes in central europe in the late 80s and after a downturn in the use of water and energy private companies started to flourish a boom in thermal spa and greenhouse developments started at the same time it became clear that an increase in groundwater abstraction would follow rman et al 2015 according to their renewable energy action plans nreaps most of the central european countries but especially of hungary slovenia austria and slovakia planned a 3 3 5 fold increase in their geothermal heat production from 2010 to 2020 com 2015 293 in order to implement these ambitious goals it was essential to properly survey the aquifers and hydrothermal reservoirs and get familiar with their physical and chemical characteristics the quantitative and qualitative assessment of aquifers independent of national borders is also important in the framework of groundwater body status assessment within the river basin management plans required by the 2000 60 ec water framework directive wfd the first joint transboundary aquifer management plan in the pannonian basin dealing with the hungarian slovenian porous intergranular thermal aquifer thermal joint aquifer management t jam nádor et al 2012 was formulated within a hungarian slovenian interreg iiia project in order to support the sustainable management and further developments based on the use of transboundary thermal aquifers in the western part of the pannonian basin the geological surveys of hungary slovenia austria and slovakia jointly delineated fig 1 and characterised potential geothermal aquifers rotár szalkai et al 2017 their exploitation rman et al 2015 carried out 3d hydrodynamic modelling tóth et al 2016 and defined nine benchmarking indicators prestor et al 2015 they also prepared a white paper for a harmonised management strategy for the sustainable utilisation of thermal water and geothermal energy taking into account the goals of wfd and nreap the work was carried out within the framework of the transboundary geothermal energy resources of slovenia austria hungary and slovakia transenergy project within the central european programme nádor et al 2013a the delineated upper pannonian transboundary thermal aquifer uptta is one out of the 199 aquifers incorporated into the comparative assessment of transboundary aquifers within the continuation of the transboundary waters assessment programme twap this work was not part of the internationally shared aquifer resources management isarm initiative a unesco and iah led multi agency programme aimed at improving the understanding of scientific socio economic legal institutional and environmental issues related to the management of transboundary aquifers but follows its main concepts this paper presents the results of the joint work related to the upper pannonian multi layered thermal aquifer 1 1 policies related to the use of aquifers in the involved countries and their consequences beside national legislation the exploitation of aquifers in the european union has to be carried out in the context of two main policies the water policy and the energy policy although they both deal with issues related to aquifers they have competing interests the european framework of the water policy is in line with the wfd and targets the groundwater within the aquifer focusing on the protection of the resource the energy policy 2009 28 ec on renewable energy directive focuses on the maximum utilisation of resources by using the heat energy stored in the subsurface space in line with the target numbers of the national renewable energy action plans nreap while the water policy s objective was to achieve and maintain the good qualitative and quantitative status of ground water by 2015 or under some required conditions in the second or third management cycle in 2021 or 2027 respectively the energy policy aims to increase to the proportion of the renewable energy source namely geothermal energy within the energy portfolio not only the objectives but also the measures and the time frames of achieving these objectives are different table 1 a review of legislation in the four countries lapanje and prestor 2011 shows the following geothermal resources are owned by the state except in austria where they belong to the land owner geothermal resource management is divided between ministries of environment and water dealing with abstraction of thermal groundwater and ministries of energy industry economics national development controlling the geothermal energy utilization without groundwater production or dealing just with the heat extraction of thermal water e g geothermal doublets the most permissive regulatory framework is in austria where even the energy content of the thermal water is not acknowledged in the legislation while the most integrated legislation exists in slovakia controlled by the geological act abstraction of thermal water is based on a water license in all four countries however there is currently an initiative april 2017 for the modification of the hungarian water management law 57 1995 which if accepted would allow groundwater abstraction without any licencing and even any reporting of the abstraction up to a depth of 80 m below surface in the case of household supplies in hungary a geothermal concession is needed for deep geothermal energy usage more than 2500 m below surface these areas are closed for geothermal energy exploitation and such an exploitation request cannot be directly submitted to the authority but the investor can initiate a request at the hungarian office for mining and geology in order for a concession to be prepared if the ministry accepts that the area can be used for exploitation than the investors can apply for a concession based on an open tendering re injection of the abstracted thermal water for energy use is compulsory in slovakia slovenia and austria however this is mostly defined in individual water permits while compulsory for slovenia it is not actually achieved in practise at existing energy use sites e g greenhouses the hungarian legislation was changed from requested re injection to a non compulsory approach in 2013 since then used thermal water can be re injected also defined on a case by case basis which means there is no re injection in most cases in slovenia the use of doublets is obligatory if granted a licence by the mining act but since 2015 the re injection provides lower concession fees also for new licences granted according to the water act temperature and chemical thresholds for emitting used thermal water into surface water or aquifers are strictly regulated in all four countries monitoring of inspected wells is carried out in all four countries however the extent the measured parameters and their frequency and the organisations responsible for the monitoring and reporting are very different in accordance with the wfd in hungary there are also wells operating specially for thermal groundwater body monitoring 1 2 financial supporting schemes a review of available financial support nádor et al 2013b revealed that there are a number of options to obtain subsidies funds and loans from the world bank the european investment bank and various international banks these can be used mainly for funding the drilling of exploration production wells or activities such as establishing and running district heating facilities in some cases the danube transnational programme and state budgets are also available tax incentives are currently not available for producers of green electricity from geothermal sources except for slovakia geothermal energy in theory would benefit from this exemption if there were any geothermal power plants the hungarian and slovakian nreap s foresee geothermal based electricity in production by 2020 slovenia does not so feed in tariffs may become relevant the current austrian feed in tariff for geothermally produced electricity is too low to promote any further investment geothermal energy as currently produced is mostly suitable for direct heat utilization such as district heating indirect support schemes for renewable energy related operative programmes in hungary slovakia and slovenia have been financed by the structural and cohesion funds these eu funds have provided an average of 50 up to 85 financing of geothermal projects with a total support in the range of 100 million the beneficiaries were typically sme s larger companies non profit organizations private companies and municipalities risk insurance as one of the most important supporting instrument for geothermal energy is not available in any of the four countries 2 geographical and geological description of the upper pannonian transboundary thermal aquifer the upper pannonian transboundary thermal aquifer uptta extends from ne slovenia to sw slovakia over an area of approximately 20 300 km2 the entire area is located in the danube river drainage basin within the pannonian basin lowlands of the mura zala styrian vienna and danube basins rarely extend to elevations of 300 m a s l and the landscape is rural with only a few middle sized cities population mostly between 60 000 and 130 000 present the humid temperate climate results in a decrease in precipitation from about 1500 mm in the south west to 500 mm in the north west with some local variations related to topography the basement of the pannonian basin consists of paleozoic and mesozoic crystalline rocks and carbonates paleogene siliciclastic and andesitic rocks and neogene and quaternary sediments were deposited on it displayed in the neogene sequence the processes connected with the infilling of the huge inland lake pannon resulted in the formation of the uptta the lake was formed approximately 12 million years ago and deepened until 9 8 million years ago sub basins were filled rapidly by huge siliciclastic deltaic systems of the alpine and the carpathian rivers magyar et al 1999 the bottom of the uptta is mostly formed by the turbiditic silt and argillaceous marl that were deposited on basin slopes simultaneously the delta front environment evolved into a prograding shelf resulting in deposition of thick sand bodies the uptta was delineated based on lithostratigraphy and is formed by the upper pannonian delta front sand and poorly lithified sandstone which generally extends to depths between 500 and 2000 m fig 1 the sand prone units are mostly composed internally of individual delta lobes of few tens of meters in thickness and separated by pelitic layers nádor et al 2012 the uptta is overlain by fine grained pontian and quaternary delta and alluvial plain sediments representing the latest stages of the sub basin filling 3 hydrogeological description of the upper pannonian transboundary thermal aquifer the upper pannonian multi layered delta front sediments reach a total thickness of more than 2000 m averaging about 800 m the effective aquifer thickness which comprises the sandy sequence is estimated to be about 300 m if intercalated fine grained sediments are excluded as aquitards the uptta sands are heterogeneous and anisotropic the horizontal hydraulic conductivity varies between approximately 4 0e 06 and 5 0e 05 m s while the vertical hydraulic conductivity varies between approximately 6 0e 10 and 7 0e 08 m s the effective porosity is estimated to up to 30 the regional groundwater flow system has evolved in these sands and locally especially along faults density and heat driven flows may interfere with gravitational flows however no convection cells are yet discovered in this porous geothermal aquifer a clear distinction between this regional flow system and the shallower intermediate flow system in the upper pannonian delta plain and deeper quaternary sediments can be made also based on hydrogeochemistry the stratification of groundwater shows that moderately mineralized up to 2000 mg l tds water of na hco3 type is stored in the uptta this infiltrated during the pleistocene szőcs et al 2013 rman 2016 probably during the last interglacial period meteoric water which recharges the aquifer infiltrates through outcrops at the sub basin margins and percolates through overlying layers however it can be shown that the recharge is very slow and limited based on hydrogeological investigations which fail to show any significant annual difference in terms of volume and frequency of recharge tóth et al 2016 with groundwater residence time of several ten thousand years the regional natural groundwater flow in the natural state occurs in two main directions figs 2 4 and 5 in the south of the uptta the infiltrated water percolates along the strata approximately from west to east so from slovenia and austria towards the discharge area of the hévíz and balaton lakes in hungary in its northern part the prevalent flow direction occurs from the north east to south west from slovakia to hungary with discharge along the danube river since the pannonian basin is located above a positive geothermal anomaly with an average heat flow of 100 mw m2 hurter and haenel 2002 lenkey et al 2002 elevated groundwater temperatures up to 100 c are recorded in the deepest part of the uptta the average heat flow in the part of the pannonian basin under investigation is 75 80 mw m2 goetzl et al 2012 temperatures below 80 c prevail in most of the aquifer and thermal water only rarely exceeds 60 c at the wellhead fig 3 as many as 225 geothermal wells were identified in the area fig 1 having screen intervals up to about 2400 m below surface mostly they tap only the uptta fig 1 but 13 of wells terminate in the aquifer below due to a need for higher water temperatures or more mineralized water the hydraulic conditions result in an observation that 13 of wells almost exclusively in slovakia are still producing without submersible pumps fig 3 while at least 70 of the total needs pumps of the 225 wells about 64 were constantly in production fig 3 an additional 10 occasionally produced while no information was available for the remaining wells only three re injection wells were identified in the region fig 3 one in each country except austria however only the one used for a district heating system in lendava in slovenia was active at the time of this investigation 4 3d hydrodynamic modelling to help understanding the flow systems in order to better characterise and quantify the cross border flows in the studied aquifer system and to evaluate the potential effects of current and future groundwater abstractions a 3d hydrodynamic model was set up using the usgs modflow v 2011 code the model has an aerial extent of 283 km x 314 km and extends to a depth of 8 km having a 1 km 1 km cell size it took account of the heterogeneity and anisotropy of the seven hydrostratigraphic units which were introduced into the numerical model as 11 layers these units are quaternary unconfined aquifers deeper quaternary confined freshwater aquifers upper pannonian confined freshwater and thermal aquifers lower miocene to lower pannonian aquitards weathered and or karstified basement containing thermal aquifers and low permeability unweathered basement rocks the uptta was represented as layer no 6 the upper pannonian confined geothermal aquifers three steady state model scenarios were prepared starting from the natural state in the 1960s with no groundwater production see fig 4 to application of the average annual production rate based on the production from 2007 to 2009 to a five times increased production rate for a forecast model fig 5 no freshwater production was included in the model both production scenarios were further subdivided into five sub scenarios to evaluate the effects of production by each country and combined the natural state model was not calibrated as it was developed by deducting the thermal water abstraction rates from the calibrated steady state production model with applied average 2007 2009 production rates previous research and hydrodynamic modelling provided cross border information on the extent of use of the upper pannonian thermal aquifer between hungary and slovenia nádor et al 2012 but this was a very new regional wide approach the results of modelling were used to evaluate the present and potential future aquifer depletion as one of the most important factors in long term sustainable use of thermal water and geothermal systems rybach 2003 rman et al 2016 a detailed description of the setup of the hydrodynamic model and the results of the modelling is presented by tóth et al 2016 4 1 results of scenario modelling 4 1 1 model scenario 1 natural 1960s steady state situation in the pre production state the regional thermal water flow direction was from west to east in the southern part of the uptta fig 4 from sw to ne in the southern part of the danube basin and from ne to sw in its northern part the hydraulic heads ranged from approximately 220 110 m a s l major discharges occurred west of lake balaton and near győr hu and south east of lake neusiedl at tóth et al 2016 4 1 2 model scenario 2 average annual production rate based on abstraction in the period 2007 2009 the average production is the following 4628 m3day 1 for 21wells in south west hungary 5854 m3day 1 for 19 wells in north west hungary 5336 m3day 1 for 17 wells in slovenia 0 m3day 1 for austria having no geothermal wells and 7726 m3day 1 for 27 wells in slovakia thermal water production simulated extensive drawdowns around major production sites with values exceeding 20 m at production wells the total regional drawdown is modelled to be between 2 and 10 m respectively fig 5 across the cross border region of the uptta the drawdown cone exceeding 0 5 m extends as far as about 60 km in the neighbouring countries the simulated cross border drawdowns are different at different locations fig 5 the slovenian production causes a drawdown of approximately 6 m at the si hu border the production in sw hungary causes a drawdown of approximately 2 m at the si hu and at hu borders the production in ne hungary causes a drawdown of 2 5 m at the sk hu border and about 2 m at the at hu border while the slovakian production causes a drawdown less than 1 5 m at the at sk border and 3 m at the sk hu one the most affected areas are the mura zala and the danube basins with total simulated drawdown of about 10 m and 6 m respectively if freshwater production was taken into account the drawdown is expected to be at least a few meters more it should be mentioned that thermal water production increased in the last years compared to this 2007 2009 period 4 1 3 model scenario 3 forward modelling based on 5 fold increase in production compared to 2007 2009 a five fold increase in total production would cause the drawdowns to increase to over 40 m at the si hu border 20 m at the southern at hu border 15 m along the at hu border to the north and 30 m at the hu sk border it would also open new flow paths between hungary and slovakia and lead to a severely increased flow from austria to hungary the whole uptta is covered by the quaternary unconfined freshwater aquifers e g zone 1 in fig 5 additionally fresh and thermal water aquifers were distinguished in each country in order to interpret the changes in the water budget due to the regional thermal water production simulation shows that thermal aquifers received 86 910 m3 day recharge in the pre exploitation state table 2 production has induced recharge from shallow confined aquifers to the thermal aquifers by 13 060 m3 day and decreased thermal water discharge to unconfined ones by 170 m3 day while between thermal aquifers there is a recharge of 24 980 m3 day table 3 cross border flows have been changed due to thermal water production in several ways generally leading to a reduction in the flows table 2 the natural thermal water budget was positive for austria regarding hungary but production has decreased the surplus to only 60 m3 day a five fold increase in production could reverse the flow direction tóth et al 2016 existing production has resulted in establishment of a new flow connection discharge from the slovakian thermal water into the austrian confined freshwater aquifer has occurred at 6 m3 day and can increase with higher production rates e g five fold increase in rates the thermal water budget between slovenia and hungary was strongly positive in the direction of hungary 3930 m3 day in the natural state thermal water production has reduced both the freshwater flow rate to hungary by 8 and the thermal water flow rate by 24 to about 2980 m3 day increased production would actually change the flow direction towards slovenia for fresh and thermal waters the natural thermal water budget from slovakia to hungary was about 6000 m3 day in the pre production period thermal water production has caused a reversal of transboundary flow which based on the average abstractions between 2007 and 2009 leads to a surplus of 2140 m3 day for slovakia this volume would increase if production increases 5 benchmarking a tool for thermal aquifer assessment and management in order to ensure a long term sustainable management of transboundary or even national geothermal aquifers an easy to apply and objective method is required which can uniformly be applied in the neighbouring countries in addition to this the method has to be capable of quantifying and evaluating the relevant parameters related to transboundary or even national aquifer exploitation by multiple users a comprehensive draft guidelines for multidisciplinary assessment of transboundary aquifers was published by the international groundwater resource assessment centre igrac in 2015 igrac and unesco ihp 2015 with the aim of providing a methodology for assessment of aquifers and guidelines for its implementation transboundary aquifers are in general cold water aquifers and these guidelines aim specifically to tackle these aquifers however in some cases thermal groundwater resources are also shared by different countries which parallel to its geological hydrogeological assessment and a regular monitoring also requires the assessment of certain specific parameters for sustainable thermal water resource development and management in order to achieve a rapid semi quantitative evaluation of thermal groundwater resources whether transboundary or not a pre existing scheme developed by lachavanne and juge 2009 for managing the region around lake geneva in switzerland was reworked and modified as a key action in the transenergy project nine indicators based on data evaluation information availability and relevance were defined prestor et al 2015 the indicators are assigned numerical values based on a calculation method eq 1 9 using detailed information such as status monitoring and operation taken from different wells this leads to a grouping within five categories bad weak medium good and very good which allows a fast comparison of different aquifers in different regions to be made how these indicators are calculated and what information is used is shown below the nine benchmarking indicators are the following 1 monitoring setup 2 best available technology 3 thermal efficiency 4 utilisation efficiency 5 re injection rate 6 quality of discharged thermal water 7 over abstraction 8 status of water balance 9 public awareness the monitoring setup indicator is linked to the choice of parameters to be recorded at a site this can be simple eg only water level varying up to complex where numerous parameters are recorded both at the production and monitoring wells importantly this indicator also shows whether the monitoring at a given level local regional is carried out in a unified integrated way and also indicates the degree of groundwater abstraction monitoring regional evaluation of the resources of thermal aquifers depends on an optimally functioning monitoring system and provides a basis for issuing new water abstraction permits the monitoring setup criteria and related points are shown in table 4 the indicator calculation formula eq 1 and corresponding classification scoring are 1 i m o n i 1 n p i n t o t very good i m o n 8 good 6 i m o n 8 medium 4 i m o n 6 weak 2 i m o n 4 b a d i m o n 2 abbreviations for this and all other equations are explained at the beginning of the paper the best available technology bat indicator shows whether appropriate technical parameters exist at well installations whether cascade use is applied how efficiently the water usage is implemented and it also describes the overall status of documentation if good bat is being implemented this will lead to a reduced operational cost safer operation and usage efficiency at the same time any environmental pollution will be reduced the bat use criteria and related points are shown in table 5 the indicator

efficiency is determined from the ratio between the used and the available annual heat energy the mean annual air temperature is used as a reference lowering the temperature of the waste thermal water through the use of e g cascade systems will increase the thermal efficiency this also leads to a reduction in the total amount of abstracted thermal groundwater and reduces the threat of thermal and

calculated based on the ratio of the volume of re injected and abstracted thermal water used for geothermal energy production this indicator shows whether re injection is taking place or not it does not monitor where re injection is taking place i e in the same aquifer from where the thermal water is abstracted unfortunately if re injection takes place it is often applied to shallower aquifers this is in direct contradiction with the guidelines of the water framework directive since shallow re injection can lead to the introduction of higher organic matter and or trace element content into these aquifers a new parameter to be included in the indicator calculation will be a check if the re injection depth is the same as the abstraction depth the indicator calculation formula eq 5 and

there is an ongoing national monitoring programme and data interpretation can be combined with data from users active monitoring then more accurate estimates can be calculated it is proposed that every 3 6 years the annual data for water balance assessment and regional hydrogeological evaluation should be assessed and evaluated since only after this period will any trends become evident

major changes in the piezometric levels and water budgets in the transboundary zones of the upper pannonian aquifer as discussed in section 4 were identified between slovenia and hungary and between hungary and slovakia the benchmark indicators presented above for these two regions are summarised in fig 6 based on data covering the period 2009 slovakia and 2011 slovenia hungary 5 1 hungarian slovakian border region danube basin the benchmarking comparison carried out in this study clearly shows that the general management of the geothermal aquifers under investigation has to be improved significantly in both countries the results of this comparison together with the main issues which should be improved first nádor et al 2013a are currently the monitoring indicator for the active thermal water wells is only medium monitoring of geothermal aquifers relies on reported abstraction yield and temperature on an annual basis with monthly reported values in both countries all water users have a legal obligation under the slovakian water act to report these values annually relative to limits stated in the water act groundwater users also have to report yearly their abstractions in hungary to the water authorities only active wells are used for benchmarking in the monitoring evaluation there is no independent monitoring of the geothermal aquifer e g through monitoring wells constructed exclusively for this purpose in any of the countries the exploitation of thermal water is not always done using the best available technologies sometimes wellheads are poorly maintained and there may be gas or water leaks in the system pumps with frequency converters are occasionally installed cascade usage of thermal water is not applied in hungary there is a clear lack of use of efficient thermal systems such as cascade configurations for this reason there is only a medium thermal effectivity it is likely that this is a result of a lack of investment by the organisation exploiting the thermal water and shows also that there is limited or no support from the government or banks in this environmentally acceptable technology thermal efficiency needs improving in both countries there are no re injection wells operating in the studied region of the upper pannonian transboundary thermal aquifer there has been only one test to evaluate the re injection rate in the intergranular environment in a well in horna poton slovakia which shows very complicated conditions for re injection into such a geological environment nowadays this well is used as an abstraction well the only re injection is applied to the karst fissure environment mesozoic formation at the podhájska site several studies have been carried out in slovakia to evaluate the regional conditions for thermal water flow and related water regime as part of wider studies into recharge of geothermal water unfortunately there are no periodic updates from monitored data in the geothermal aquifer water balance calculations on the hungarian side of the study region cannot be considered representative nevertheless the amount of abstraction has been defined for most of the wells and is stated in the abstraction permit there is a deterioration in the quantity status of this geothermal aquifer which is reflected in the over abstraction indicators however more work is needed to better define the parameters of this indicator since no information on the quality of discharged thermal waste water was collected during this study so it was not possible to evaluate this parameter concerning public awareness information about the reported yield thermal water usage chemical composition and temperature of thermal water is partly available on some websites but is archived mainly in institutions responsible for data storage the general public does not have access to data on monitoring bat quantity status of the aquifers quality of discharged thermal waste water or energy efficiency of thermal water exploitation in specific cases these have not been even monitored 5 2 slovenian hungarian border region mura zala basin fig 5 shows that utilisation efficiency energy efficiency and best available technology are mostly good or very good in the mura zala basin while monitoring and over abstraction practice could be improved the lack of designated monitoring wells in the slovenian side resulted in a bad indicator value but the situation has much improved after 2015 reliable over abstraction calculations on the hungarian side could not be carried out due to lack of representative data re injection is bad in hungary with no operating re injection wells there is one re injection well but out of usage while the one re injection well in slovenia still only results in a weak indicator value it has been concluded that re injection will play a crucial part in the long term sustainable use of thermal waters not just in the mura zala basin but in the whole upper pannonian transboundary thermal aquifer there is a lot of progress to be made concerning the knowledge on the degree and reliability of information on the quantity status of the aquifer the situation in slovenia has much improved after 2015 as holders of the newly granted concession permits are obliged to set up a continuous monitoring system of groundwater levels temperatures and discharge rates and annually check the chemical composition of waters so in the next few years we expect to have a reliable evaluation of the aquifers state in both countries public awareness indicator results should be increased and stakeholders better informed about the current use and the need to improve it 6 transboundary agreements in hungary groundwater governance has been organised through the ministry of interior since 2014 the groundwater management is coordinated by the general directorate of water management under the supervision of ministry of interior this also includes the drafting of the river basin management plan under the supervision of the ministry of national development the geological and geophysical institute of hungary which from july 2017 has been merged into the mining and geological survey of hungary supports the national level groundwater status assessment and strategic planning it is also tasked with groundwater monitoring together with the regional water directorates and environmental authorities and assists the groundwater delineation on both national and bilateral levels and provides scientific support for transboundary groundwater management there are 11 aggregated transboundary groundwater bodies in the danube river basin and seven affect hungary at international level under the danube river protection convention signed on june 29 1994 in sofia bulgaria the activity of the groundwater task group within the international commission for protection of danube river icpdr is therefore relevant and important for hungary the work of the icpdr is supported by seven bilateral water commissions each of them based on bilateral agreement on government level of which 4 are active in groundwater governance the geological survey of slovenia provides professional support for the implementation of the national river basin management plan where it concerns groundwater with the plan being coordinated by the ministry of the environment and the spatial planning the ministry also manages bilateral water commissions and their activities the survey provides professional support to the ministry regarding groundwater and in the last years the mura zala transboundary thermal groundwater body has often been discusses in the permanent slovenian hungarian commission on water management 7 conclusions and perspectives although long term groundwater management has been practiced in the pannonian basin and transboundary bilateral agreements existed before isarm due to the hydrogeological conditions eg regional transboundary groundwater flow over large distances and existing and planned abstraction plans further steps for transboundary aquifer management are needed these should be in line with isarm unga res 63 124 unga 2008 the principles given by the un water convention unwc 2014 the eu water framework directive and the danube river basin management plans of icpdr in addition to supporting environmental goals it also has to follow the aims of sustainable utilization of renewable energy resources the resolution on transboundary aquifers prepared by the united nations general assembly should be considered for adoption by the four countries sharing the uptta the delineated uptta is a good example of how aquifers are shared and used by multiple countries lessons learnt from the surveys carried out and the results of the indicator system can be summarised as follows the system of licensing for thermal water abstraction and exploitation of geothermal resources is not efficiently regulated in general i e it is complicated both under and at the same time over regulated rather slow and expensive thus it does not help to develop national geothermal sectors we propose that the indicators defined previously prestor et al 2015 have to be measured and evaluated both when water permits are issued or concessions on thermal water use are granted and when they are renewed future refinement and or modification of some indicators especially focusing on the assessment of sustainable use of energy and thus thermal water exploitation can also be expected legislation and groundwater aquifer vary greatly across the region in order to overcome cross boarder differences a harmonised approach must be developed by the relevant institutes and authorities using common thinking and unified objectives the results of the benchmarking action highlight that there is a long tradition of using thermal water for balneological purposes in addition it can be seen that in the whole western part of the pannonian basin there is a very good utilization efficiency in this sector other indicators such as the re injection rate and public awareness have very low scores indicating that a major effort is needed to improve the management of the geothermal resources in all four countries this study looked only to see if re injection had been applied or not in a proper governance setting it will be necessary to differentiate between re injection into the aquifer from which water is being abstracted and re injection into other aquifers or at different depths of the same aquifer with the exception of austria the monitoring indicator for the active thermal water wells is mostly medium or bad effective monitoring of the geothermal aquifer should be prioritised in all countries which requires implementation of viable monitoring policies which should be taken care of by the relevant ministries and authorities dealing with resource management and environment protection data on the quality of emitted thermal waste water was not collected during this study and therefore it was not possible to accurately assess this parameter the indicator values for the best available technology vary between bad and good it has become apparent that the good values may be due to a lack of reliable information so far the thermal aquifers are not being over abstracted but the good results can potentially act as an early warning indicator giving the first signals of deterioration in status shown by decrease of piezometric levels or change in groundwater quality the thermal efficiency indicator generally shows a bad or very bad status so we recommend that the exploitation of annual heat energy of operating wells should be increased rather than focusing on the exploitation of new wells the thermal efficiency indicator does not correctly reflect the efficiency of the well in the case of low less than about 35 c wellhead temperatures the status of water balance assessment is also bad or very bad in hungary slovenia and slovakia so there is much to be achieved in defining critical level points and critical limits of abstraction in all four countries especially in those cases where the wells are located close to the national borders the successful cooperation established among the geological surveys of the four countries of uptta with a harmonised evaluation of transboundary hydrogeothermal resources

the danube region and involves 15 partners from hungary slovenia croatia serbia bosnia and herzegovina and romania they work together to promote sustainable utilization of the existing but still

8476,study region city of niamey niger west africa study focus this paper aims to explore the possibility of implementing a probabilistic framework for flood risk estimation for the city of niamey niger a probabilistic set of flood maps were generated by forcing a hec ras model with a stochastically generated ensemble of flood peaks representing the river regime at niamey loss curves were derived from expert judgment and various adaptation options to flood risk were examined by considering two main variables a buildings material b dike height ranged from 180 5 m to 184 m at a 0 5 m interval within a scenario based framework floods with return periods of 2 to 1000 yr were considered in estimating total loss and benefits and costs of different adaptation options were compared new hydrological insights for the region it was found that increasing the height of the dikes would lead to smaller economic losses while rebuilding with better materials would increase the average annual economic losses but might decrease the risk of human casualties individual and combined impact of decision variables on flood risk were estimated for the city of niamey quantitative tools were developed to help decision makers and regulators choose the best preventive measures to mitigate flood risk keywords flood risk probabilistic risk estimation hec ras adaptation options niger river niamey 1 introduction flood could affect our environment and in most of vulnerable areas of the world may cause damages including loss of human life damage to property and crop interruption to transportation and utility services and other damages arisen from economic activity disruption the number of people who could be affected by flood is reported to be more than all the other natural hazards together asian disaster reduction center 2011 one reason could be the increasing trend of flooding over the last 30 years freer et al 2013 moreover floods which last for several days endanger affected people to exposure to water borne and vector borne diseases which could lead to death at some regions along the river bed sediment deposits could significantly reduce the flood passage capacity of the river hence increase the amount of the area in the vicinity of the river which could be inundated in case of flooding two main categories of flood damages are identified as tangible and intangible damages tangible flood damages could be estimated and expressed in monetary value and are further classified as direct caused by direct contact of floodwater and indirect types both direct and indirect damages are subdivided into primary and secondary damages dutta et al 2003 intangible damages direct or indirect cannot be directly assessed or measured in monetary values mainly due to their subjectivity examples of such damages are casualties and health effects indirect damages are those caused by disruption to physical and economic linkages such as interruption of traffic flow and loss of personal income and business profit to assess these type of damages a multidisciplinary approach integrating engineering social science and economic knowledge should be applied since considering only engineering factors is not sufficient therefore in this study only direct tangible losses are being considered risk is defined as the magnitude of a hazard in terms of its frequency and intensity accordingly flood risk analysis which includes flood hazard mapping hydraulic structure design urban drainage system planning and reservoir management is a method to quantify flood frequency and its damage overall as the environmental agency s strategy for flood risk management environment agency 2003 states flood risk estimation is to estimate the probability that the safety standard would be exceeded flood risk assessments consists of the following main components a flood hazard b exposure and c vulnerability flood hazard i e depth velocity discharge and flood frequency is defined by the probability and magnitude of flooding flood hazard assessment estimates the probabilities of different magnitudes of damaging flood conditions such as the depth and duration of inundation and flow velocity different parameters including meteorological hydrological hydraulic and topographic properties of the watershed channels and floodplains at upstream and downstream of the location of interest affect the magnitudes for the various probabilities when flood hazards cause damages to assets the value of the assets as well as the relationship between the flood hazard and damage to the assets are examined by exposure i e the population and assets located in flood prone areas and vulnerability i e the susceptibility of the exposed elements to the hazard analysis the results of such analysis may be represented with inundation depth damage functions for the structures which predict the damage corresponding to specific water depth increases in loss levels during the recent centuries made the stakeholders and decision makers to work harder in order to find the scientific approaches to prevent the occurrence of such extreme events and in the areas that the occurrence could not be prevented to diminish the loss levels as much as possible the need for flood risk evaluation and assessment is more recognized in flood prone and vulnerable regions since the loss level in affected areas is directly proportional to the level of vulnerability and exposure of the area growing vulnerability to floods could be related to various economic social cultural political and environmental drivers in the case of the current study area other causal factors of vulnerability could play an important role in diminishing resilience and capacity to cope with and adapt to the extreme events some of these factors are lack of any type of early warning system using low strength constructional material in the residential areas that are mainly located near the niger river and lack of enough disaster recovery and rehabilitation time due to yearly flooding in the region through proposing some adaptation options the main goal of this research is to develop a probabilistic framework in order to evaluate impact of the proposed adaptation options to flood risk in niamey the area of interest it also aims to help decision makers to contribute to improvements in the ability of niamey community to better respond in the scenario of any disastrous flooding event 1 1 deterministic and probabilistic risk assessment risk assessments are being performed using two main approaches deterministic and probabilistic approaches flood risk analysis based on the traditional t year event deterministic approach is used to assess disaster impacts of a given hazard scenario and does not account for the full range of possible floods therefore provides an incomplete representation of the risk in deterministic approach which considers the impact of a single risk scenario it is not easy to relate the damages of a single flood to the cost of infrastructure for instance in a probabilistic framework all possible scenarios their likelihood and associate impacts are being considered probabilistic methods are used to obtain more refined estimates of hazard frequencies and damages however probabilistic methods are characterized by inherent uncertainties because they incorporate the concept of randomness partly related to the natural randomness of hazards and partly because of our incomplete understanding and measurement of the hazards exposure and vulnerability under consideration oecd 2012 probabilistic risk assessment pra has one primary advantage over its deterministic counterpart it provides the distribution of estimated exposure and risk which makes it more realistic compared to too conservative deterministic method the probabilistic approach has been subject to increasing popularity amongst researchers in recent years as it accommodates for the specification of uncertainty apel et al 2006 2008 purvis et al 2008 di baldassarre et al 2009b 2010 neal et al 2013 dyck and willems 2013 ganguli and reddy 2013 dale et al 2014 jalayer et al 2014 shortridge et al 2017 tang et al 2018 in addition to describing uncertainty in the model inputs probabilistic modelling also provides information on the uncertainty in the model output despite the better results of risk assessment using probabilistic approach complex and specific mathematical calculations in this approach make it more challenging to use deterministic modelling in contrast whilst ignoring uncertainty has the pragmatic advantage of simplicity in analysis and results historical losses can explain the past however they do not necessarily provide a good guide to the future since most disasters that could happen have not happened yet unisdr 2013 pra resolves this problem posed by the limits of historical data through simulating future disasters which are likely to occur based on scientific evidence unisdr 2015 therefore probabilistic flood risk assessment is the subject of various recent projects and has been considered by many others as an example dyck and willems 2013 developed a probabilistic flood risk assessment methodology to estimate the recurrence rate of flood losses to geographically distributed properties in the large areas where limited information is available they presented the results of the application of their methodology to river flood loss from residential buildings in belgium while considering all the major sources of uncertainty that introduce variation on the flood losses the methodology simplifies the necessary calculations considerably and estimates the model parameters either directly from general topographic information and historical observations or on the basis of simulated model results in another study apel et al 2006 developed complex spatially distributed models representing the relevant meteorological hydrological hydraulic geo technical and socio economic processes a simple probabilistic model consists of modules each representing one process of the flood disaster chain complemented these complex deterministic models in order to assess flood risk the simple stochastic approach allows a large number of simulation runs in a monte carlo framework thus providing the basis for a probabilistic risk assessment apel et al 2006 applied the proposed model to quantify flood risk including an estimation of flood damage for an example area at the river rhine they also investigated the effect of upstream levee breaches on the flood risk at the lower reaches based on the satisfactory results they suggested the proposed model concept to be used for the integrated assessment of flood risks in flood prone areas as well as cost benefit assessment and risk based design of flood protection measures and as a decision support tool for flood management one challenge in the application of probabilistic framework is the availability of data and knowledge to generate the joint probability distributions it is therefore legitimate to ask if it is applicable in practical cases especially in developing countries this study explores the possibility of implementing pra with very limited data in a region that has not been studied in much detail to the best knowledge of the authors 1 2 floodplain mapping flood plain management has been received a significant attention within the past decades thanks to the ever developing tools that enable proper analysis of river systems nowadays a hydraulic analysis is often required by federal state provincial and local regulations prior to any development or construction in a floodplain in order to predict the effects of such activities on the floodplain researchers have developed various computer models to aid engineers in accurate floodplain modelling and management the choice of the model depends on the application purpose level of accuracy required and computational efficiency demands computer programs which are being used to simulate the general hydraulic procedures vary from simple uniform flow assumptions to multidimensional models in order to compute a water surface profile essentially all steady gradually varied flow hydraulics programs use the direct step and standard step methods all of the models are using the four main equations comprising the typical hydraulic analysis the continuity energy momentum and manning equations flood analysis have been done using various approaches such as analysis based on in situ observation hagen and lu 2011 using remote sensing data chormanski et al 2011 haq et al 2012 and numerical models for cases which in situ flood observation and remote sensing data are not available di baldassarre et al 2009a ruiz bellet et al 2015 schober et al 2015 numerical modeling which could be done by one dimensional 1d or two dimensional 2d models enables flood simulating under different scenarios some typical hydrodynamic models which have been used for modelling flood inundation include tuflow classic 1d faster sobek suite mike11 mike hydro river mascaret infoworks rs telemac sipson and hec ras amongst them hydrologic engineering center river analysis system hec ras model is one of the most widely used programs for floodplain modelling which has been continuously improved since its initial release version 1 0 in 1995 1 3 exposure quantification and analysis exposure represents the economic and social values that are likely to be affected by floods it includes people livelihoods environmental services and resources infrastructure or economic social and cultural assets in places that could be adversely affected several methods have been used to analyze and quantify the exposure which is considered the main driver of observed increase in flood damages hallegatte et al 2013 ipcc 2012 de moel et al 2011 exposure can be quantified by the number or the value of elements at risk röthlisberger et al 2017 considered two types of exposure indicators the density of exposed assets exposed number of assets per km2 and the share of exposed assets share of exposed assets compared to the total number of assets in a specific region in their study they applied different aggregation and normalization methods on object specific information about the building stock and flood hazards map with the case study of switzerland they investigated the impact of the aggregation scheme on resultant differences to help decision makers in risk management according to their findings more information is provided by spatial cluster analysis for the prioritization of flood protection measures than simple maps of spatially aggregated data represented in quantiles paprotny et al 2018 presented the historical analysis of natural hazards in europe hanze database which contains maps of exposures in 37 countries at various resolutions and a database of past disasters the exposure information consists of high resolution gridded data with information on land use population production and wealth geographic information system gis is commonly used to intersect land use data with inundation data to extract the exposed objects in floodplain using flood hazard data land use information asset data and hazard maps can be analyzed in a gis system to quantify the assets at risk fig 1 accordingly asset values which depend on the type of the elements at risk tangible and intangible have to be estimated however not many studies on risk assessment have explained explicit approaches for the estimation of assets one reason could be that many risk analyses do not use any quantitative indicators or that absolute damage functions are used for damage modelling moreover when land use data are used to identify the affected sectors monetary values are not given size of the study area the available input data and the required level of accuracy of the risk assessment are the important factors affecting the detail of asset estimation several researchers have demonstrated the capability of geo information techniques adeaga 2009 mayomi et al 2013 nkeki et al 2013 fuchs et al 2017 fuchs et al 2017 presented a spatially explicit object based temporal assessment of elements at risk to mountain hazards in austria and switzerland in their study they used two different data sets to assess flood hazard exposure information on flood hazards and data on residential buildings inventory they first combined available hazard maps with nation wide flood modeling results to obtain spatial information on flood hazards and later the hazard information was overlaid with building inventory data in a geographic information system in a research by daffi et al 2014 flood inundation maps were overlaid on the settlement map of the study area in order to obtain the exposure map and view those that will be affected by flood likewise the land uses that would be inundated by the flood were achieved by overlaying the flood inundation maps on the landsat land use classified maps abah 2013 also used arcview gis package to digitize a topographic map and through gis overlay and manipulative functions he mapped flood risk zones in makurdi town nigeria mayomi et al 2013 used gis and global positional systems gps measurements in their study to identify the settlements that are within the floodplain by integrating the mapped settlements and the terrain model of the area adelekan 2009 and oyinloye et al 2013 used both quantitative and qualitative methods by using gis coupled with analyzed data acquired from questionnaires and interviews to better understand the susceptibility level of the people and properties in the study area whereas in small scale studies such as the case in the study by rogelis et al 2014 exposure analysis could be done without applying the advanced technologies in their study data from the census the municipal cadaster and field visits were used to classify the buildings located in the area of study according to construction type estimate the value for each exposed element and identify the population exposed risk assessment in their study addressed 4 8 km reach of the caldera river located in the municipality of boquete in panama in the current study and in order to quantify the flood exposure here residential buildings the output of the hec ras model describing flood prone areas hazard maps was imported to google earth software potential floodplain polygons which identify the buildings in the flood prone areas were then digitized in google earth fig 2 for this purpose visual interpretation was applied to the google earth images in order to identify the number of properties buildings at risk of flooding it should be mentioned that in the current study one main land use class of residential was considered subsequently the digitized buildings polygons were exported to arcmap to calculate the total area of potentially affected regions buildings are considered exposed if the polygons are partially or completely within the flood prone area according to the flood hazard maps after all processing steps our dataset includes 2600 potentially flooded buildings with a total area of 170 193 30 m2 2 study area regional features niger river the third longest river in

most recent floods in the region which caused by heavy rains between 13 and 14 june 2017 caused severe damage in several parts of the country with niamey and tillabéri the most severely affected according to the reports 14 people have died 456 households have been affected and 395 homes have collapsed because of the floods and heavy rain ocha june 2017 floodlist in africa news 2017 since 2010 significant damages including damages to property and loss of life among people in the vicinity of the river have been reported in niamey the region of interest in this study descroix et al 2012 sighomnou et al 2011 2013 acted and oxfam report 2012 however to the best knowledge of the authors no detailed studies on the amount of losses in the study area neither any research on evaluation of any adaptation options for the region have been reported so far niamey the largest city of niger is also the most populated one with a population estimate of 1 1 5 million inhabitants which are mainly located along both sides of the niger river hence are prone to flooding niamey is located between latitudes 13 29 n and longitude 2 09 e in niger africa the area has a mean elevation below 227 m above sea level the city subjects to severe inundations that may inundate up to 150 000 km2 affect thousands of people and cause human economic losses as high as millions of u s dollars the type of houses prominent in each settlement is generally reflective of the perceived level of vulnerability of occupants the current available buildings materials in niamey are informal straw walls mud walls concrete walls and mud walls covered by concrete there are also some temporary houses which are inappropriate in terms of resiliency towards flood nonetheless preference of this house type is possibly due to the facts that its building materials are cheaper and most of the inhabitants are seasonal settlers who are reluctant to invest in the construction of more durable houses fig 3 shows the study area niamey part of the city was built in the riverbed of a dead branch of the niger river and is protected from floods by a system of dikes with crest heights of approximately 181 m while the dikes are very effective during most years they failed in august 2012 after heavy precipitation events upstream of the city fig 4 the subsequent flash flood claimed the lives of 10 people and affected 6535 households the economic losses were estimated to be about 4 3 billion west african cfa franc 6 million usd a significant amount of money given that niger is one of the poorest countries in the world 3 data and methodology in this study we tried to introduce the best possible option to control and manage flood losses according to the least construction costs and minimum risk and aimed to contribute to a better preparedness and a better operational risk management for flash floods in the study region niamey the improvements shall help reducing fatalities and economic damage caused by this kind of natural hazard and making the effects of flooding negligible the proposed methodology is a strategy encompassing hazard exposure and vulnerability components of flood risk as it is shown in the flowchart in fig 5 the first step is input data collection and analysis for this purpose flow data were received from the existing observed data at one hydrometric station at niamey region for the 1980 2014 period moreover in order to represent the stream channel and floodplain as a series of cross sections to the hydraulic model hec ras bathymetric measurements along the niger river within the study area were performed accordingly geometry file that contains physical parameters describing the cross sections was created using the measured data the second step after receiving the data from the existing hydrometric station is calculating extreme flows one method to do so which has been used in this study is using statistical distribution function in the current study extreme flowrates for floods with various return periods ranging from 2 to 1000 yr were calculated using statistical distribution function method for this purpose eight randomly chosen distribution functions generalized extreme value gev pearson iii p iii lognormal 3 parameter ln3 lognormal ln2 generalized logistic glog gumbel ev1 gamma and generalized pareto gpar were used and the best function which fitted the best to the observed data was chosen based on graphical observation and kolmogorov smirnov test ks test the calculated extreme flow rates for various floods with different return periods table 2 were then given to the hydraulic model hec ras in order to determine water level associated with each return period after calculating water level and converting them to the floodplain associated with each return period produced fig 11a and b potential floodplain polygons were digitized in google earth and exported to arcmap in order to calculate the area of potentially affected regions one main land use class of residential was considered in this study at the last step and in order to estimate the possible economic losses induced if such floods happen in the defined area total loss were calculated based on vulnerability functions damage criteria for residential land use class and the proposed adaptation options which are further explained in sections 3 4 and 4 3 depending on the degree of monetization and the degree of physical contact of the hazard flood damage can be classified into four categories of direct tangible indirect tangible direct intangible and indirect intangible dutta et al 2003 in the current study damage estimation is restricted to direct tangible loss of available land use class sequences of the abovementioned steps are shown in a flowchart in fig 5 and results are presented in section 4 the peak discharge values for the niger river watershed within the study area for 2 10 20 50 100 200 500 and 1000 yr flood were calculated using statistical methods the results and the details have been presented in section 4 deciding the best statistical distribution function was based on best curve of observed data received from niamey station the chosen n values for channel and floodplain were estimated based on bed material as well as vegetation type to better represent the physical system and adjust the flood wave progression over the floodplain total number of 390 surveyed channel cross sections were spaced to model transitions between wide and narrow cross sections and represent change in shape and direction of the river 3 1 probabilistic risk estimation according to unisdr 2009 risk is the combination of the probability of an event and its negative consequences i e frequency of the hazard and intensity of the resulted effect determine the risk it is essential to identify risk components in order to have a better assessment and management world meteorological organization wmo 2006 defines the risks to be composed of three elements of hazard exposure and vulnerability hence a thorough assessment of risk requires that an evaluation of each component in a given area be carried out in the context of this study the hazard is defined as flood magnitude which is defined by probability of occurrence and the exposure describes environment in the hazard zone in this research probabilistic risk estimation of the flood in niamey area niger has been investigated with consideration of some adaptation options for decision makers and stakeholders riverine floods in this area cause heavy losses to life and property every year pra is performed to quantify risk and identify the parameters which could have the most impact on safety so that the designs could be improved by reducing vulnerabilities discovered through pra research should be directed at improving our understanding of the process in a way that is directly relevant for practical application 3 2 numerical modelling and hazard mapping 3 2 1 hec ras hec ras one of the most popular hydraulic models simulate steady and unsteady state flow through the river channel the software is free and developed by the u s army corps of engineers usace the application of hec ras software has been reported to be successful in flood studies knebl et al 2005 lian et al 2013 mohammadi et al 2014 the present study applied hec ras 1d to develop a hydrodynamic model of the study area and to determine the extent of floodplain inundation in response to various floods with different return periods in one dimensional models flow is treated along the centre line of the river channel and floodplain as only in the longitudinal direction which is the simplest representation of floodplain flow equations for 1d models can be derived by considering mass and momentum conservation between adjacent cross sections which yield the well known one dimensional saint venant equations 1 conservation of mass q x a t 0 2 conservation of momentum 1 a q t 1 a q 2 a t g h x g s 0 s f 0 where q is the flow discharge q ua u is the cross sectional averaged velocity and a is the cross section area t represents time g is the gravitational acceleration h is the water depth sf is the friction slope and s0 is the channel bed slope numerical techniques are used to solve eqs 1 and 2 and obtain estimates of flow discharge q and water depth h for every cross section at each time step 3 2 2 hydrodynamic model set up in order to model the flooded area under specific scenario the hydraulic model has to know about the properties of the respective catchment such as cross section geometry bathymetric measurements and characteristics bridge and culvert information steady or unsteady flow data for this purpose geometric hydrological and hydraulic data of the niger river was introduced to hec ras in order to estimate flood level for several return periods ranging from 2 to 1000 yr and prepare floodplain zoning for each return period the peak flow data from flow measurement stations in niamey for the period of 1980 to 2014 were given to the hydrodynamic model hec ras in order to compute water surface elevations and develop flood inundation areas along the study area for the flood discharges the steps are as follows first digital terrain model dtm of the niger river system was built under hec georas environment in the arcinfo tin triangular interpolation networks format and imported to the model as an input file the geometry file containing the ras layers and line themes were then created it should be noted that two nodes as well as adequate number of cross sections cut lines were specified in this model fig 6 shows the path at which bathymetric measurements along the niger river within the study area were performed using special instruments the path is shown by green lines total number of 390 surveyed channel cross sections were spaced to model transitions between wide and narrow cross sections and represent change in shape and direction of the river fig 7 shows an example of river cross section moreover 6 levees which protect the city of niamey against flooding from the niger river were set in this model at the last step geometry data flow data and boundary conditions were given to the model in order to perform simulations and obtain water surface profile and velocity data the model was used for each dike elevation and forced with 1000 random flow values taken from the probabilistic distribution of annual maximum discharge values in niamey this resulted in 1000 water level maps one map for each flow value which were each converted into flood loss values using the previously developed loss functions the process is summarized in fig 5 earlier in section 3 the developed hec ras model was calibrated to reproduce the last rating curve over the period 2009 2014 using the available observed elevation data for niamey and bathymetry data for the niger river as illustrated in fig 8 it was found that the calibrated model over the period 2009 2014 almost perfectly reproduced the last rating curve over the indicated period the two curves match well confirming that the calibration process was satisfactory 3 3 vulnerability vulnerability is defined as the characteristics and circumstances of a community system or asset that make it susceptible to the damaging effects of a hazard and varies significantly within a community and over time unisdr 2009 vulnerability with many aspects arising from physical social economic and environmental factors reflects the potential for loss and depends on the economy livelihoods support infrastructure and resilience of the community to cope up with a hazardous event examples may include poor design and construction of buildings inadequate protection of assets lack of public information and awareness and disregard for wise environmental management the influencing indicators of the vulnerability are usually chosen based on the knowledge and experiences of community and experts within the geographical region vulnerability assessment aims to estimate the amount of damage to various infrastructures and assets subjected to a certain hazard the assessment can later be used to choose cost and prioritize mitigation measures according to their short term and long term effectiveness vulnerability is generally represented as a curve of loss as a function of exposure such curves are ideally developed using surveys and statistical analysis 3 3 1 types of buildings in the floodplain and their vulnerability to flooding the main factor that controls the vulnerability of a building to flooding is the material of its walls most buildings in the floodplain in the study area fall into one of the following four categories a mud walls ban b concrete walls dur c mud walls covered by concrete sdu and d informal constructions straw walls cas fig 9 given that information about past losses is not available for the area of interest a number of assumptions based on expert judgement known typical construction types in the study area as well as field surveys were made to generate vulnerability curves amount of damages to a building as a function of water height it is well known that mud and straw constructions are sensitive to water and collapse as soon as the base of the wall is wet therefore it is assumed that 100 of the building is lost when water reaches 0 5 m concrete buildings are assumed to collapse when water reaches 2 5 m while mud walls covered by concrete can stand up to 1 m of water before collapsing this is indeed very subjective but was deemed reasonable enough to proceed with the analysis due to the lack of reliable statistics regarding the prevalence of the different building types in the area we considered six scenarios representing different relative proportions of each of the four types under consideration these scenarios include 1 100 cas 2 100 ban 3 100 dur 4 100 sdu 5 50 ban with 10 dur 20 sdu and 20 cas 6 50 ban with 30 dur 20 sdu and 0 cas scenario 5 is likely to be the scenario that comes closest to the current situation where many houses are built using mud walls scenario 6 represents a situation where informal buildings are banned and where there are more concrete houses it is worth to mention that the functions only account for physical elements and not occupancy levels of the buildings accordingly the following assumptions shown in table 1 are provided for each of the dominant classes of building in the study area fig 10 a d shows the assigned vulnerability functions to the four various types of buildings which correlate the hazard intensity with mean damage ratio mdr the variation of the intensity given in terms of water depth m is illustrated with blue line and standard deviation is depicted with red line the analysis is carried out using ern vulnerability and capra gis two of the software modules of the capra platform 3 4 adaptation options the realization of yearly flooding of the niger river and its potential impacts on the communities residing along the river has prompted much activity in the realm of adaptation which is typically viewed as actions in response to flooding that seek to limit its impacts various definitions for adaptation have been presented so far including both either adjustment in human and or natural systems according to smith 1996 adaptation has been defined as all adjustments in behavior or economic structure that reduce the vulnerability of society to changes in the climate system adaptation has been also defined as building resilience and increasing capacity within a system to cope with change and generally refers to reforming reconstructing and or reorganizing to better manage a new situation the most recent definition of adaptation in unisdr 2009 refers to the adjustment in natural or human system in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects which moderates harm or exploit beneficial opportunities numerous adaptation options and coping strategies ranging from the type of houses lived in to flood preparation and management measures with the main intend of lessening the effect of the hazard could reduce the risk to some extent the predominance of a specific coping strategy within an area is generally reflective of the intensity of flooding experienced in the region irrespective of expected efficacy however the choice of strategies could be influenced by other factors such as finance or even cultural background this section of the paper more focuses on suitable mitigation options and strategies in order to decrease the vulnerability to flooding and hence to reduce property loss the targeted groups are stakeholders governments consultants and academic institutions as well as those who are involved in flood projects huge budget needs to be spent by the governments in order to minimize the damage and losses of floods the budget depends on an estimation of the cost of and the benefit from the action taken when budget is limited and competitive 4 results 4 1 flood peak distribution one important parameter which is essential for water resources management is variations in hydrological conditions that would be determined by hydrological measurements however quantifying the impact of variations require availability of long term data in this study we used the measured and recorded flow rate time series at niamey hydrometric station which shows the discharge measurement m3 s at the station collectively for 34 years from 1980 to 2014 table 2 shows the calculated extreme flow rates using statistical distribution function for various floods with different return periods 4 2 inundation maps after developing the hydrodynamic model for the niger river floodplain cross sections from the elevation contour data of the city of niamey were extracted in order to estimate water surface profiles a total of 988 cross sections were extracted along 160 km of the niger river within the study area accordingly the companion gis utility hec georas was used to convert the water surface profiles at all cross sections from hec ras model into inundation maps and develop plan view extent of flooding over the length of the modelled stream fig 11 a and b presents flood inundation maps for 100 and 1000 yr flood events in the study area the floodplain polygons were overlaid on the image of the area in order to compare the extent of various flood frequency events 4 3 loss exceedance curves the physical damage to the exposed elements in flood events is calculated by means of hazard and vulnerability of the elements in this study central american probabilistic risk assessment capra software was used to generate the loss exceedance curves the software is based on a probabilistic risk assessment methodology and has a set of tools for risk evaluation at different territorial levels probabilistic metrics such as the exceedance probability curve expected annual loss and probable maximum loss are used by the software to evaluate and estimate losses on exposed elements the results illustrate the effect of dike crest height on flood exceedance curves for the six different building material scenarios fig 12 for each type of building material the damage exceedance probability becomes zero after a certain threshold 400 million cfa for mud walls 300 million cfa for concrete walls 200 million cfa for informal constructions and 800 million cfa for mud walls covered by concrete irrespective of the type of building material used increasing the dike crest heights by just 50 cm above present levels might lead to a significant reduction in the exceedance probability of damages subsequent increases of the dike heights still lead to further decreases of the exceedance probability in conclusion the flood risk mitigation option implemented by the niger government with the support of the world bank through pgrc du projet de gestion des risques de catastrophes et de développement urbain disaster risk management and urban development project decreases the probability of physical damages to buildings it seems likely that this also reduces the probability of casualties although this aspect was not part of our analysis in order to look more closely at the effect of building materials on the loss exceedance curve for a given dike height we combined the different scenarios into a single panel and plotted the result for the different dike heights fig 13 as expected the loss exceedance curve for the scenario representing the status quo scenario 5 is below the loss exceedance for 100 dur and above 100 sdu 100 ban and 100 cas when building materials are improved scenario 6 the losses increase without reaching the losses for 100 dur therefore the adaptation option chosen by local population in the floodplain would appear to increase the probability of monetary losses but likely decrease the number of casualties the annual average economic loss for each scenario behaves as expected table 3 i e it decreases with increasing dike height the lowest economic loss corresponds to 100 informal construction and dike heights greater than or equal to 182 5 m however decision makers should not opt for this scenario since the analysis does not account for the risk of human casualties associated with lower quality material another factor that has not been accounted for in this study is the cost of implementing the adaptation options 4 4 efficiency of adaptation options considering the fact that the area is highly prone to flooding and often suffers from loss of lives and damages to properties one proposed adaptation option is changing the buildings material after the catastrophic floods of 2012 most of the houses made with mud walls were destroyed in the study area populations in the most affected areas were offered the option to relocate elsewhere but a significant number of households chose to rebuild their houses on the same site given that most houses built with concrete walls had survived the flood almost all houses were rebuilt using concrete resulting in a lower probability of collapse and less human casualties in case of a similar flood in this study we considered adaptation options in response to the flood risk in niamey region and the impact of undertaking such options on total loss estimation for residential land use class the total loss was evaluated in response to the likelihood of flooding with various return periods range from 2 to 1000 yr the options include raising level of the available flood defense dike and building or strengthening buildings structures using various buildings material the proposed types of buildings material which are chosen according to the availability of them in the study area consist of informal straw walls mud walls concrete walls and mud walls covered by concrete these adaptation options are more to resist environmental change in order to preserve existing infrastructures therefore they might involve significant cost to implement the results generated in this paper allows to quantitatively estimate the gain in resilience that comes from these decisions it can also demonstrate to the decision makers the benefits of implementing policies that encourage people to build with different materials this is the first time a quantitative analysis of flood risk and adaptation options is implemented for the tool we propose to be more effective decision makers should invest in a comprehensive survey of the built environment and exposed assets in the study area additional information on building stock and existing building etc helps in obtaining more accurate information on exposed elements and will be used for decision making in risk management such a survey would allow us to estimate the risk in the current situation and estimate more accurately the benefits of adaptation options 5 conclusion there are many different ways of viewing natural hazard adaptation in general some with focus on resisting to environment changes while others are mainly targeting suiting such changes or a combination of both however necessity of considering some effective parameters such as budget time and available resources which prioritizes available options for each specific case makes the decision makers not to promote one approach over another therefore selection of the best options involves evaluating and assessing various approaches based on specific situation of each case in this study the residential vulnerability to floods in the city of niamey was analyzed in a probabilistic framework total number of 1000 random flow values representing maximum annual flow were generated and converted into loss exceedance curves the sensitivity of the loss exceedance curves to the altitude of flood protection dikes and to the type of buildings material were examined it was found that increasing the height of the dikes would lead to smaller economic losses while rebuilding with better materials would increase the average annual economic losses but might decrease the risk of human casualties in order to select the best adaptation options decision makers have to factor in non economic values as well as associated implementation costs these results should be viewed with caution given the scarcity and low quality of the available data for the study area the results also demonstrate the individual as well as the combined impact of the two considered variables in flood risk estimation in the niger river basin which enable decision makers as well as the regulators to have a better analysis and estimation in choosing the best preventive measures to alleviate the adverse impacts arising from flood events the findings contend that although the proposed structural adaptation option as a resisting to environment approach are applied to the area of interest and considered to be technically feasible other non structural measures which have long term effect of risk mitigation should be taken into consideration especially for highly hazard prone areas non structural measures include public awareness programs policies and laws and their enforcement changes to land use changes in building codes or in infrastructure design and location conflict of interest the

8476,study region city of niamey niger west africa study focus this paper aims to explore the possibility of implementing a probabilistic framework for flood risk estimation for the city of niamey niger a probabilistic set of flood maps were generated by forcing a hec ras model with a stochastically generated ensemble of flood peaks representing the river regime at niamey loss curves were derived from expert judgment and various adaptation options to flood risk were examined by considering two main variables a buildings material b dike height ranged from 180 5 m to 184 m at a 0 5 m interval within a scenario based framework floods with return periods of 2 to 1000 yr were considered in estimating total loss and benefits and costs of different adaptation options were compared new hydrological insights for the region it was found that increasing the height of the dikes would lead to smaller economic losses while rebuilding with better materials would increase the average annual economic losses but might decrease the risk of human casualties individual and combined impact of decision variables on flood risk were estimated for the city of niamey quantitative tools were developed to help decision makers and regulators choose the best preventive measures to mitigate flood risk keywords flood risk probabilistic risk estimation hec ras adaptation options niger river niamey 1 introduction flood could affect our environment and in most of vulnerable areas of the world may cause damages including loss of human life damage to property and crop interruption to transportation and utility services and other damages arisen from economic activity disruption the number of people who could be affected by flood is reported to be more than all the other natural hazards together asian disaster reduction center 2011 one reason could be the increasing trend of flooding over the last 30 years freer et al 2013 moreover floods which last for several days endanger affected people to exposure to water borne and vector borne diseases which could lead to death at some regions along the river bed sediment deposits could significantly reduce the flood passage capacity of the river hence increase the amount of the area in the vicinity of the river which could be inundated in case of flooding two main categories of flood damages are identified as tangible and intangible damages tangible flood damages could be estimated and expressed in monetary value and are further classified as direct caused by direct contact of floodwater and indirect types both direct and indirect damages are subdivided into primary and secondary damages dutta et al 2003 intangible damages direct or indirect cannot be directly assessed or measured in monetary values mainly due to their subjectivity examples of such damages are casualties and health effects indirect damages are those caused by disruption to physical and economic linkages such as interruption of traffic flow and loss of personal income and business profit to assess these type of damages a multidisciplinary approach integrating engineering social science and economic knowledge should be applied since considering only engineering factors is not sufficient therefore in this study only direct tangible losses are being considered risk is defined as the magnitude of a hazard in terms of its frequency and intensity accordingly flood risk analysis which includes flood hazard mapping hydraulic structure design urban drainage system planning and reservoir management is a method to quantify flood frequency and its damage overall as the environmental agency s strategy for flood risk management environment agency 2003 states flood risk estimation is to estimate the probability that the safety standard would be exceeded flood risk assessments consists of the following main components a flood hazard b exposure and c vulnerability flood hazard i e depth velocity discharge and flood frequency is defined by the probability and magnitude of flooding flood hazard assessment estimates the probabilities of different magnitudes of damaging flood conditions such as the depth and duration of inundation and flow velocity different parameters including meteorological hydrological hydraulic and topographic properties of the watershed channels and floodplains at upstream and downstream of the location of interest affect the magnitudes for the various probabilities when flood hazards cause damages to assets the value of the assets as well as the relationship between the flood hazard and damage to the assets are examined by exposure i e the population and assets located in flood prone areas and vulnerability i e the susceptibility of the exposed elements to the hazard analysis the results of such analysis may be represented with inundation depth damage functions for the structures which predict the damage corresponding to specific water depth increases in loss levels during the recent centuries made the stakeholders and decision makers to work harder in order to find the scientific approaches to prevent the occurrence of such extreme events and in the areas that the occurrence could not be prevented to diminish the loss levels as much as possible the need for flood risk evaluation and assessment is more recognized in flood prone and vulnerable regions since the loss level in affected areas is directly proportional to the level of vulnerability and exposure of the area growing vulnerability to floods could be related to various economic social cultural political and environmental drivers in the case of the current study area other causal factors of vulnerability could play an important role in diminishing resilience and capacity to cope with and adapt to the extreme events some of these factors are lack of any type of early warning system using low strength constructional material in the residential areas that are mainly located near the niger river and lack of enough disaster recovery and rehabilitation time due to yearly flooding in the region through proposing some adaptation options the main goal of this research is to develop a probabilistic framework in order to evaluate impact of the proposed adaptation options to flood risk in niamey the area of interest it also aims to help decision makers to contribute to improvements in the ability of niamey community to better respond in the scenario of any disastrous flooding event 1 1 deterministic and probabilistic risk assessment risk assessments are being performed using two main approaches deterministic and probabilistic approaches flood risk analysis based on the traditional t year event deterministic approach is used to assess disaster impacts of a given hazard scenario and does not account for the full range of possible floods therefore provides an incomplete representation of the risk in deterministic approach which considers the impact of a single risk scenario it is not easy to relate the damages of a single flood to the cost of infrastructure for instance in a probabilistic framework all possible scenarios their likelihood and associate impacts are being considered probabilistic methods are used to obtain more refined estimates of hazard frequencies and damages however probabilistic methods are characterized by inherent uncertainties because they incorporate the concept of randomness partly related to the natural randomness of hazards and partly because of our incomplete understanding and measurement of the hazards exposure and vulnerability under consideration oecd 2012 probabilistic risk assessment pra has one primary advantage over its deterministic counterpart it provides the distribution of estimated exposure and risk which makes it more realistic compared to too conservative deterministic method the probabilistic approach has been subject to increasing popularity amongst researchers in recent years as it accommodates for the specification of uncertainty apel et al 2006 2008 purvis et al 2008 di baldassarre et al 2009b 2010 neal et al 2013 dyck and willems 2013 ganguli and reddy 2013 dale et al 2014 jalayer et al 2014 shortridge et al 2017 tang et al 2018 in addition to describing uncertainty in the model inputs probabilistic modelling also provides information on the uncertainty in the model output despite the better results of risk assessment using probabilistic approach complex and specific mathematical calculations in this approach make it more challenging to use deterministic modelling in contrast whilst ignoring uncertainty has the pragmatic advantage of simplicity in analysis and results historical losses can explain the past however they do not necessarily provide a good guide to the future since most disasters that could happen have not happened yet unisdr 2013 pra resolves this problem posed by the limits of historical data through simulating future disasters which are likely to occur based on scientific evidence unisdr 2015 therefore probabilistic flood risk assessment is the subject of various recent projects and has been considered by many others as an example dyck and willems 2013 developed a probabilistic flood risk assessment methodology to estimate the recurrence rate of flood losses to geographically distributed properties in the large areas where limited information is available they presented the results of the application of their methodology to river flood loss from residential buildings in belgium while considering all the major sources of uncertainty that introduce variation on the flood losses the methodology simplifies the necessary calculations considerably and estimates the model parameters either directly from general topographic information and historical observations or on the basis of simulated model results in another study apel et al 2006 developed complex spatially distributed models representing the relevant meteorological hydrological hydraulic geo technical and socio economic processes a simple probabilistic model consists of modules each representing one process of the flood disaster chain complemented these complex deterministic models in order to assess flood risk the simple stochastic approach allows a large number of simulation runs in a monte carlo framework thus providing the basis for a probabilistic risk assessment apel et al 2006 applied the proposed model to quantify flood risk including an estimation of flood damage for an example area at the river rhine they also investigated the effect of upstream levee breaches on the flood risk at the lower reaches based on the satisfactory results they suggested the proposed model concept to be used for the integrated assessment of flood risks in flood prone areas as well as cost benefit assessment and risk based design of flood protection measures and as a decision support tool for flood management one challenge in the application of probabilistic framework is the availability of data and knowledge to generate the joint probability distributions it is therefore legitimate to ask if it is applicable in practical cases especially in developing countries this study explores the possibility of implementing pra with very limited data in a region that has not been studied in much detail to the best knowledge of the authors 1 2 floodplain mapping flood plain management has been received a significant attention within the past decades thanks to the ever developing tools that enable proper analysis of river systems nowadays a hydraulic analysis is often required by federal state provincial and local regulations prior to any development or construction in a floodplain in order to predict the effects of such activities on the floodplain researchers have developed various computer models to aid engineers in accurate floodplain modelling and management the choice of the model depends on the application purpose level of accuracy required and computational efficiency demands computer programs which are being used to simulate the general hydraulic procedures vary from simple uniform flow assumptions to multidimensional models in order to compute a water surface profile essentially all steady gradually varied flow hydraulics programs use the direct step and standard step methods all of the models are using the four main equations comprising the typical hydraulic analysis the continuity energy momentum and manning equations flood analysis have been done using various approaches such as analysis based on in situ observation hagen and lu 2011 using remote sensing data chormanski et al 2011 haq et al 2012 and numerical models for cases which in situ flood observation and remote sensing data are not available di baldassarre et al 2009a ruiz bellet et al 2015 schober et al 2015 numerical modeling which could be done by one dimensional 1d or two dimensional 2d models enables flood simulating under different scenarios some typical hydrodynamic models which have been used for modelling flood inundation include tuflow classic 1d faster sobek suite mike11 mike hydro river mascaret infoworks rs telemac sipson and hec ras amongst them hydrologic engineering center river analysis system hec ras model is one of the most widely used programs for floodplain modelling which has been continuously improved since its initial release version 1 0 in 1995 1 3 exposure quantification and analysis exposure represents the economic and social values that are likely to be affected by floods it includes people livelihoods environmental services and resources infrastructure or economic social and cultural assets in places that could be adversely affected several methods have been used to analyze and quantify the exposure which is considered the main driver of observed increase in flood damages hallegatte et al 2013 ipcc 2012 de moel et al 2011 exposure can be quantified by the number or the value of elements at risk röthlisberger et al 2017 considered two types of exposure indicators the density of exposed assets exposed number of assets per km2 and the share of exposed assets share of exposed assets compared to the total number of assets in a specific region in their study they applied different aggregation and normalization methods on object specific information about the building stock and flood hazards map with the case study of switzerland they investigated the impact of the aggregation scheme on resultant differences to help decision makers in risk management according to their findings more information is provided by spatial cluster analysis for the prioritization of flood protection measures than simple maps of spatially aggregated data represented in quantiles paprotny et al 2018 presented the historical analysis of natural hazards in europe hanze database which contains maps of exposures in 37 countries at various resolutions and a database of past disasters the exposure information consists of high resolution gridded data with information on land use population production and wealth geographic information system gis is commonly used to intersect land use data with inundation data to extract the exposed objects in floodplain using flood hazard data land use information asset data and hazard maps can be analyzed in a gis system to quantify the assets at risk fig 1 accordingly asset values which depend on the type of the elements at risk tangible and intangible have to be estimated however not many studies on risk assessment have explained explicit approaches for the estimation of assets one reason could be that many risk analyses do not use any quantitative indicators or that absolute damage functions are used for damage modelling moreover when land use data are used to identify the affected sectors monetary values are not given size of the study area the available input data and the required level of accuracy of the risk assessment are the important factors affecting the detail of asset estimation several researchers have demonstrated the capability of geo information techniques adeaga 2009 mayomi et al 2013 nkeki et al 2013 fuchs et al 2017 fuchs et al 2017 presented a spatially explicit object based temporal assessment of elements at risk to mountain hazards in austria and switzerland in their study they used two different data sets to assess flood hazard exposure information on flood hazards and data on residential buildings inventory they first combined available hazard maps with nation wide flood modeling results to obtain spatial information on flood hazards and later the hazard information was overlaid with building inventory data in a geographic information system in a research by daffi et al 2014 flood inundation maps were overlaid on the settlement map of the study area in order to obtain the exposure map and view those that will be affected by flood likewise the land uses that would be inundated by the flood were achieved by overlaying the flood inundation maps on the landsat land use classified maps abah 2013 also used arcview gis package to digitize a topographic map and through gis overlay and manipulative functions he mapped flood risk zones in makurdi town nigeria mayomi et al 2013 used gis and global positional systems gps measurements in their study to identify the settlements that are within the floodplain by integrating the mapped settlements and the terrain model of the area adelekan 2009 and oyinloye et al 2013 used both quantitative and qualitative methods by using gis coupled with analyzed data acquired from questionnaires and interviews to better understand the susceptibility level of the people and properties in the study area whereas in small scale studies such as the case in the study by rogelis et al 2014 exposure analysis could be done without applying the advanced technologies in their study data from the census the municipal cadaster and field visits were used to classify the buildings located in the area of study according to construction type estimate the value for each exposed element and identify the population exposed risk assessment in their study addressed 4 8 km reach of the caldera river located in the municipality of boquete in panama in the current study and in order to quantify the flood exposure here residential buildings the output of the hec ras model describing flood prone areas hazard maps was imported to google earth software potential floodplain polygons which identify the buildings in the flood prone areas were then digitized in google earth fig 2 for this purpose visual interpretation was applied to the google earth images in order to identify the number of properties buildings at risk of flooding it should be mentioned that in the current study one main land use class of residential was considered subsequently the digitized buildings polygons were exported to arcmap to calculate the total area of potentially affected regions buildings are considered exposed if the polygons are partially or completely within the flood prone area according to the flood hazard maps after all processing steps our dataset includes 2600 potentially flooded buildings with a total area of 170 193 30 m2 2 study area regional features niger river the third longest river in africa and the principal river of western africa extends about 4200 km 2600 mi mabogunje 2014 with a total basin area of 2 117 700 km2 817 600 mi2 gleick 2000 however less than half of the basin is considered to be active drainage area kerres 2010 niger river traverses four countries guinea mali niger and nigeria and discharges through the niger delta into the atlantic ocean the river discharge is 192 km3 y raux et al 2011 niger river basin covers 44 5 of niger which equals to 24 8 of the basin total area fao 1997 the niger river floods yearly during the rainy season may through october the most recent floods in the region which caused by heavy rains between 13 and 14 june 2017 caused severe damage in several parts of the country with niamey and tillabéri the most severely affected according to the reports 14 people have died 456 households have been affected and 395 homes have collapsed because of the floods and heavy rain ocha june 2017 floodlist in africa news 2017 since 2010 significant damages including damages to property and loss of life among people in the vicinity of the river have been reported in niamey the region of interest in this study descroix et al 2012 sighomnou et al 2011 2013 acted and oxfam report 2012 however to the best knowledge of the authors no detailed studies on the amount of losses in the study area neither any research on evaluation of any adaptation options for the region have been reported so far niamey the largest city of niger is also the most populated one with a population estimate of 1 1 5 million inhabitants which are mainly located along both sides of the niger river hence are prone to flooding niamey is located between latitudes 13 29 n and longitude 2 09 e in niger africa the area has a mean elevation below 227 m above sea level the city subjects to severe inundations that may inundate up to 150 000 km2 affect thousands of people and cause human economic losses as high as millions of u s dollars the type of houses prominent in each settlement is generally reflective of the perceived level of vulnerability of occupants the current available buildings materials in niamey are informal straw walls mud walls concrete walls and mud walls covered by concrete there are also some temporary houses which are inappropriate in terms of resiliency towards flood nonetheless preference of this house type is possibly due to the facts that its building materials are cheaper and most of the inhabitants are seasonal settlers who are reluctant to invest in the construction of more durable houses fig 3 shows the study area niamey part of the city was built in the riverbed of a dead branch of the niger river and is protected from floods by a system of dikes with crest heights of approximately 181 m while the dikes are very effective during most years they failed in august 2012 after heavy precipitation events upstream of the city fig 4 the subsequent flash flood claimed the lives of 10 people and affected 6535 households the economic losses were estimated to be about 4 3 billion west african cfa franc 6 million usd a significant amount of money given that niger is one of the poorest countries in the world 3 data and methodology in this study we tried to introduce the best possible option to control and manage flood losses according to the least construction costs and minimum risk and aimed to contribute to a better preparedness and a better operational risk management for flash floods in the study region niamey the improvements shall help reducing fatalities and economic damage caused by this kind of natural hazard and making the effects of flooding negligible the proposed methodology is a strategy encompassing hazard exposure and vulnerability components of flood risk as it is shown in the flowchart in fig 5 the first step is input data collection and analysis for this purpose flow data were received from the existing observed data at one hydrometric station at niamey region for the 1980 2014 period moreover in order to represent the stream channel and floodplain as a series of cross sections to the hydraulic model hec ras bathymetric measurements along the niger river within the study area were performed accordingly geometry file that contains physical parameters describing the cross sections was created using the measured data the second step after receiving the data from the existing hydrometric station is calculating extreme flows one method to do so which has been used in this study is using statistical distribution function in the current study extreme flowrates for floods with various return periods ranging from 2 to 1000 yr were calculated using statistical distribution function method for this purpose eight randomly chosen distribution functions generalized extreme value gev pearson iii p iii lognormal 3 parameter ln3 lognormal ln2 generalized logistic glog gumbel ev1 gamma and generalized pareto gpar were used and the best function which fitted the best to the observed data was chosen based on graphical observation and kolmogorov smirnov test ks test the calculated extreme flow rates for various floods with different return periods table 2 were then given to the hydraulic model hec ras in order to determine water level associated with each return period after calculating water level and converting them to the floodplain associated with each return period produced fig 11a and b potential floodplain polygons were digitized in google earth and exported to arcmap in order to calculate the area of potentially affected regions one main land use class of residential was considered in this study at the last step and in order to estimate the possible economic losses induced if such floods happen in the defined area total loss were calculated based on vulnerability functions damage criteria for residential land use class and the proposed adaptation options which are further explained in sections 3 4 and 4 3 depending on the degree of monetization and the degree of physical contact of the hazard flood damage can be classified into four categories of direct tangible indirect tangible direct intangible and indirect intangible dutta et al 2003 in the current study damage estimation is restricted to direct tangible loss of available land use class sequences of the abovementioned steps are shown in a flowchart in fig 5 and results are presented in section 4 the peak discharge values for the niger river watershed within the study area for 2 10 20 50 100 200 500 and 1000 yr flood were calculated using statistical methods the results and the details have been presented in section 4 deciding the best statistical distribution function was based on best curve of observed data received from niamey station the chosen n values for channel and floodplain were estimated based on bed material as well as vegetation type to better represent the physical system and adjust the flood wave progression over the floodplain total number of 390 surveyed channel cross sections were spaced to model transitions between wide and narrow cross sections and represent change in shape and direction of the river 3 1 probabilistic risk estimation according to unisdr 2009 risk is the combination of the probability of an event and its negative consequences i e frequency of the hazard and intensity of the resulted effect determine the risk it is essential to identify risk components in order to have a better assessment and management world meteorological organization wmo 2006 defines the risks to be composed of three elements of hazard exposure and vulnerability hence a thorough assessment of risk requires that an evaluation of each component in a given area be carried out in the context of this study the hazard is defined as flood magnitude which is defined by probability of occurrence and the exposure describes environment in the hazard zone in this research probabilistic risk estimation of the flood in niamey area niger has been investigated with consideration of some adaptation options for decision makers and stakeholders riverine floods in this area cause heavy losses to life and property every year pra is performed to quantify risk and identify the parameters which could have the most impact on safety so that the designs could be improved by reducing vulnerabilities discovered through pra research should be directed at improving our understanding of the process in a way that is directly relevant for practical application 3 2 numerical modelling and hazard mapping 3 2 1 hec ras hec ras one of the most popular hydraulic models simulate steady and unsteady state flow through the river channel the software is free and developed by the u s army corps of engineers usace the application of hec ras software has been reported to be successful in flood studies knebl et al 2005 lian et al 2013 mohammadi et al 2014 the present study applied hec ras 1d to develop a hydrodynamic model of the study area and to determine the extent of floodplain inundation in response to various floods with different return periods in one dimensional models flow is treated along the centre line of the river channel and floodplain as only in the longitudinal direction which is the simplest representation of floodplain flow equations for 1d models can be derived by considering mass and momentum conservation between adjacent cross sections which yield the well known one dimensional saint venant equations 1 conservation of mass q x a t 0 2 conservation of momentum 1 a q t 1 a q 2 a t g h x g s 0 s f 0 where q is the flow discharge q ua u is the cross sectional averaged velocity and a is the cross section area t represents time g is the gravitational acceleration h is the water depth sf is the friction slope and s0 is the channel bed slope numerical techniques are used to solve eqs 1 and 2 and obtain estimates of flow discharge q and water depth h for every cross section at each time step 3 2 2 hydrodynamic model set up in order to model the flooded area under specific scenario the hydraulic model has to know about the properties of the respective catchment such as cross section geometry bathymetric measurements and characteristics bridge and culvert information steady or unsteady flow data for this purpose geometric hydrological and hydraulic data of the niger river was introduced to hec ras in order to estimate flood level for several return periods ranging from 2 to 1000 yr and prepare floodplain zoning for each return period the peak flow data from flow measurement stations in niamey for the period of 1980 to 2014 were given to the hydrodynamic model hec ras in order to compute water surface elevations and develop flood inundation areas along the study area for the flood discharges the steps are as follows first digital terrain model dtm of the niger river system was built under hec georas environment in the arcinfo tin triangular interpolation networks format and imported to the model as an input file the geometry file containing the ras layers and line themes were then created it should be noted that two nodes as well as adequate number of cross sections cut lines were specified in this model fig 6 shows the path at which bathymetric measurements along the niger river within the study area were performed using special instruments the path is shown by green lines total number of 390 surveyed channel cross sections were spaced to model transitions between wide and narrow cross sections and represent change in shape and direction of the river fig 7 shows an example of river cross section moreover 6 levees which protect the city of niamey against flooding from the niger river were set in this model at the last step geometry data flow data and boundary conditions were given to the model in order to perform simulations and obtain water surface profile and velocity data the model was used for each dike elevation and forced with 1000 random flow values taken from the probabilistic distribution of annual maximum discharge values in niamey this resulted in 1000 water level maps one map for each flow value which were each converted into flood loss values using the previously developed loss functions the process is summarized in fig 5 earlier in section 3 the developed hec ras model was calibrated to reproduce the last rating curve over the period 2009 2014 using the available observed elevation data for niamey and bathymetry data for the niger river as illustrated in fig 8 it was found that the calibrated model over the period 2009 2014 almost perfectly reproduced the last rating curve over the indicated period the two curves match well confirming that the calibration process was satisfactory 3 3 vulnerability vulnerability is defined as the characteristics and circumstances of a community system or asset that make it susceptible to the damaging effects of a hazard and varies significantly within a community and over time unisdr 2009 vulnerability with many aspects arising from physical social economic and environmental factors reflects the potential for loss and depends on the economy livelihoods support infrastructure and resilience of the community to cope up with a hazardous event examples may include poor design and construction of buildings inadequate protection of assets lack of public information and awareness and disregard for wise environmental management the influencing indicators of the vulnerability are usually chosen based on the knowledge and experiences of community and experts within the geographical region vulnerability assessment aims to estimate the amount of damage to various infrastructures and assets subjected to a certain hazard the assessment can later be used to choose cost and prioritize mitigation measures according to their short term and long term effectiveness vulnerability is generally represented as a curve of loss as a function of exposure such curves are ideally developed using surveys and statistical analysis 3 3 1 types of buildings in the floodplain and their vulnerability to flooding the main factor that controls the vulnerability of a building to flooding is the material of its walls most buildings in the floodplain in the study area fall into one of the following four categories a mud walls ban b concrete walls dur c mud walls covered by concrete sdu and d informal constructions straw walls cas fig 9 given that information about past losses is not available for the area of interest a number of assumptions based on expert judgement known typical construction types in the study area as well as field surveys were made to generate vulnerability curves amount of damages to a building as a function of water height it is well known that mud and straw constructions are sensitive to water and collapse as soon as the base of the wall is wet therefore it is assumed that 100 of the building is lost when water reaches 0 5 m concrete buildings are assumed to collapse when water reaches 2 5 m while mud walls covered by concrete can stand up to 1 m of water before collapsing this is indeed very subjective but was deemed reasonable enough to proceed with the analysis due to the lack of reliable statistics regarding the prevalence of the different building types in the area we considered six scenarios representing different relative proportions of each of the four types under consideration these scenarios include 1 100 cas 2 100 ban 3 100 dur 4 100 sdu 5 50 ban with 10 dur 20 sdu and 20 cas 6 50 ban with 30 dur 20 sdu and 0 cas scenario 5 is likely to be the scenario that comes closest to the current situation where many houses are built using mud walls scenario 6 represents a situation where informal buildings are banned and where there are more concrete houses it is worth to mention that the functions only account for physical elements and not occupancy levels of the buildings accordingly the following assumptions shown in table 1 are provided for each of the dominant classes of building in the study area fig 10 a d shows the assigned vulnerability functions to the four various types of buildings which correlate the hazard intensity with mean damage ratio mdr the variation of the intensity given in terms of water depth m is illustrated with blue line and standard deviation is depicted with red line the analysis is carried out using ern vulnerability and capra gis two of the software modules of the capra platform 3 4 adaptation options the realization of yearly flooding of the niger river and its potential impacts on the communities residing along the river has prompted much activity in the realm of adaptation which is typically viewed as actions in response to flooding that seek to limit its impacts various definitions for adaptation have been presented so far including both either adjustment in human and or natural systems according to smith 1996 adaptation has been defined as all adjustments in behavior or economic structure that reduce the vulnerability of society to changes in the climate system adaptation has been also defined as building resilience and increasing capacity within a system to cope with change and generally refers to reforming reconstructing and or reorganizing to better manage a new situation the most recent definition of adaptation in unisdr 2009 refers to the adjustment in natural or human system in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects which moderates harm or exploit beneficial opportunities numerous adaptation options and coping strategies ranging from the type of houses lived in to flood preparation and management measures with the main intend of lessening the effect of the hazard could reduce the risk to some extent the predominance of a specific coping strategy within an area is generally reflective of the intensity of flooding experienced in the region irrespective of expected efficacy however the choice of strategies could be influenced by other factors such as finance or even cultural background this section of the paper more focuses on suitable mitigation options and strategies in order to decrease the vulnerability to flooding and hence to reduce property loss the targeted groups are stakeholders governments consultants and academic institutions as well as those who are involved in flood projects huge budget needs to be spent by the governments in order to minimize the damage and losses of floods the budget depends on an estimation of the cost of and the benefit from the action taken when budget is limited and competitive 4 results 4 1 flood peak distribution one important parameter which is essential for water resources management is variations in hydrological conditions that would be determined by hydrological measurements however quantifying the impact of variations require availability of long term data in this study we used the measured and recorded flow rate time series at niamey hydrometric station which shows the discharge measurement m3 s at the station collectively for 34 years from 1980 to 2014 table 2 shows the calculated extreme flow rates using statistical distribution function for various floods with different return periods 4 2 inundation maps after developing the hydrodynamic model for the niger river floodplain cross sections from the elevation contour data of the city of niamey were extracted in order to estimate water surface profiles a total of 988 cross sections were extracted along 160 km of the niger river within the study area accordingly the companion gis utility hec georas was used to convert the water surface profiles at all cross sections from hec ras model into inundation maps and develop plan view extent of flooding over the length of the modelled stream fig 11 a and b presents flood inundation maps for 100 and 1000 yr flood events in the study area the floodplain polygons were overlaid on the image of the area in order to compare the extent of various flood frequency events 4 3 loss exceedance curves the physical damage to the exposed elements in flood events is calculated by means of hazard and vulnerability of the elements in this study central american probabilistic risk assessment capra software was used to generate the loss exceedance curves the software is based on a probabilistic risk assessment methodology and has a set of tools for risk evaluation at different territorial levels probabilistic metrics such as the exceedance probability curve expected annual loss and probable maximum loss are used by the software to evaluate and estimate losses on exposed elements the results illustrate the effect of dike crest height on flood exceedance curves for the six different building material scenarios fig 12 for each type of building material the damage exceedance probability becomes zero after a certain threshold 400 million cfa for mud walls 300 million cfa for concrete walls 200 million cfa for informal constructions and 800 million cfa for mud walls covered by concrete irrespective of the type of building material used increasing the dike crest heights by just 50 cm above present levels might lead to a significant reduction in the exceedance probability of damages subsequent increases of the dike heights still lead to further decreases of the exceedance probability in conclusion the flood risk mitigation option implemented by the niger government with the support of the world bank through pgrc du projet de gestion des risques de catastrophes et de développement urbain disaster risk management and urban development project decreases the probability of physical damages to buildings it seems likely that this also reduces the probability of casualties although this aspect was not part of our analysis in order to look more closely at the effect of building materials on the loss exceedance curve for a given dike height we combined the different scenarios into a single panel and plotted the result for the different dike heights fig 13 as expected the loss exceedance curve for the scenario representing the status quo scenario 5 is below the loss exceedance for 100 dur and above 100 sdu 100 ban and 100 cas when building materials are improved scenario 6 the losses increase without reaching the losses for 100 dur therefore the adaptation option chosen by local population in the floodplain would appear to increase the probability of monetary losses but likely decrease the number of casualties the annual average economic loss for each scenario behaves as expected table 3 i e it decreases with increasing dike height the lowest economic loss corresponds to 100 informal construction and dike heights greater than or equal to 182 5 m however decision makers should not opt for this scenario since the analysis does not account for the risk of human casualties associated with lower quality material another factor that has not been accounted for in this study is the cost of implementing the adaptation options 4 4 efficiency of adaptation options considering the fact that the area is highly prone to flooding and often suffers from loss of lives and damages to properties one proposed adaptation option is changing the buildings material after the catastrophic floods of 2012 most of the houses made with mud walls were destroyed in the study area populations in the most affected areas were offered the option to relocate elsewhere but a significant number of households chose to rebuild their houses on the same site given that most houses built with concrete walls had survived the flood almost all houses were rebuilt using concrete resulting in a lower probability of collapse and less human casualties in case of a similar flood in this study we considered adaptation options in response to the flood risk in niamey region and the impact of undertaking such options on total loss estimation for residential land use class the total loss was evaluated in response to the likelihood of flooding with various return periods range from 2 to 1000 yr the options include raising level of the available flood defense dike and building or strengthening buildings structures using various buildings material the proposed types of buildings material which are chosen according to the availability of them in the study area consist of informal straw walls mud walls concrete walls and mud walls covered by concrete these adaptation options are more to resist environmental change in order to preserve existing infrastructures therefore they might involve significant cost to implement the results generated in this paper allows to quantitatively estimate the gain in resilience that comes from these decisions it can also demonstrate to the decision makers the benefits of implementing policies that encourage people to build with different materials this is the first time a quantitative analysis of flood risk and adaptation options is implemented for the tool we propose to be more effective decision makers should invest in a comprehensive survey of the built environment and exposed assets in the study area additional information on building stock and existing building etc helps in obtaining more accurate information on exposed elements and will be used for decision making in risk management such a survey would allow us to estimate the risk in the current situation and estimate more accurately the benefits of adaptation options 5 conclusion there are many different ways of viewing natural hazard adaptation in general some with focus on resisting to environment changes while others are mainly targeting suiting such changes or a combination of both however necessity of considering some effective parameters such as budget time and available resources which prioritizes available options for each specific case makes the decision makers not to promote one approach over another therefore selection of the best options involves evaluating and assessing various approaches based on specific situation of each case in this study the residential vulnerability to floods in the city of niamey was analyzed in a probabilistic framework total number of 1000 random flow values representing maximum annual flow were generated and converted into loss exceedance curves the sensitivity of the loss exceedance curves to the altitude of flood protection dikes and to the type of buildings material were examined it was found that increasing the height of the dikes would lead to smaller economic losses while rebuilding with better materials would increase the average annual economic losses but might decrease the risk of human casualties in order to select the best adaptation options decision makers have to factor in non economic values as well as associated implementation costs these results should be viewed with caution given the scarcity and low quality of the available data for the study area the results also demonstrate the individual as well as the combined impact of the two considered variables in flood risk estimation in the niger river basin which enable decision makers as well as the regulators to have a better analysis and estimation in choosing the best preventive measures to alleviate the adverse impacts arising from flood events the findings contend that although the proposed structural adaptation option as a resisting to environment approach are applied to the area of interest and considered to be technically feasible other non structural measures which have long term effect of risk mitigation should be taken into consideration especially for highly hazard prone areas non structural measures include public awareness programs policies and laws and their enforcement changes to land use changes in building codes or in infrastructure design and location conflict of interest the

8477,study region são paulo state brazil study focus this study assessed the influence of forest plantations on streamflow in a gauged catchment 85 ha covered with fast growing eucalyptus sp plantations one strategy for reducing the effects of plantations on streamflow is to reduce the area of a catchment occupied by forest and in this context our objectives were to simulate the effects on streamflow of different proportions of forest cover 70 50 and 0 of the forest cover moreover we used low flow indices q90 and 7q10 to examine the effects of such scenarios on water availability for downstream users new hydrological insights fast growing forest plantation areas have been expanding globally with simultaneously increasing concerns about the water consumption of these forests especially in water limited regions with consequences for downstream users simulations of scenarios with varying forest cover proportions showed an annual streamflow increase of 90 when clear cutting had removed the forest cover in the catchment the 100 forest cover scenario produced rates of streamflow below the low flow indices resulting in less water availability for downstream water users the reduction in forest cover proportion at the catchment scale promoted an attenuation of water use therefore forest plantation management should adopt management strategies such as regulating the forest cover proportion to minimize the effects on water supply for downstream water users keywords clear cut proportion flow duration curve eucalyptus forest low flow indices forest age mosaic hydrological model 1 introduction the area occupied by fast growing forest plantations is expanding in several parts of the world payn et al 2015 at the same time the area of forest plantation in brazil currently exceeds 7 5 million hectares iba 2016 these expansions are accompanied by a parallel increase in concerns regarding water use jackson et al 2005 calder 2007 such concerns are mainly related to the decrease in water availability to downstream users van dijk and keenan 2007 guzha et al 2018 and the effects on low flows farley et al 2005 beck et al 2013 the effects on streamflow are high evapotranspiration rates associated with fast growing highly productive forests which are typical characteristics of eucalyptus forest plantations scott 2005 these effects are characterized by an observed decrease in streamflow following reforestation bosch and hewlett 1982 guzha et al 2018 accompanied by an increase in streamflow following forest clear cutting scott 2005 due to this relationship one way to minimize the effects of forest plantations on streamflow might be to control the proportion of forest cover at the catchment scale which has the potential to modify the streamflow regime zhang et al 2012 for this reason it is important to understand the relationship between streamflow and forest cover proportion in order to better manage forest plantations and avoid water use conflicts brown et al 2013 this is especially necessary in regions where fast growing forest is the predominant land use swanson et al 2000 defries and eshleman 2004 as well as in water limited regions van dijk and keenan 2007 since decreases in streamflow related to forest expansion can reduce water availability and consequently may enhance water use conflicts farley et al 2005 scott 2005 van dijk and keenan 2007 in this context alternative forest management strategies may minimize the effects on streamflow in a catchment vanclay 2009 some alternative forest management strategies include i increasing the rotation cycle to allow the recovery of streamflow to original levels scott and prinsloo 2008 ii choosing species with higher water use efficiency to increase wood production without increasing water use forrester et al 2010 iii establishing forest stands with different ages to minimize the peak water consumption vertessy et al 2003 ferraz et al 2013 and iv choosing forest plantation locations relative to the stream network for reaching the potential areas in catchment planning kalantari et al 2014 however some of these management practices are costly which may hinder their practical implementation taking this difficulty into account the use of hydrological models can be an alternative tool for providing responses to the effectiveness of alternative strategies for forest management defries and eshleman 2004 guzha et al 2018 in this study we used a simple conceptual hydrological model developed by brown et al 2006 and widely used by shao et al 2009 and zhang et al 2012 to predict the effects of forest plantations on streamflow following a change in the proportion of forest cover increases in forest plantation area can lead to low flow reduction brown et al 2005 which will affect water availability at the catchment scale and consequently water availability for downstream water users van dijk and keenan 2007 therefore understanding these changes in a streamflow regime is necessary to the development of strategies for water resources management zhang et al 2012 the aim of this study is to simulate the hydrological effects of different forest cover scenarios and discuss forest plantation occupation planning as a tool for water conservation and implementation of the hydrosolidarity concept in forestry activities 2 material and methods 2 1 study area aiming to best represent the climatic conditions and management practices under which fast growing planted forests are distributed in brazil we used a gauged catchment located in the state of são paulo 23 02 01 s 48 37 30 w fig 1 this region is representative of the climatic conditions and management practices of fast growing plantation forests in brazil the catchment area is 85 8 ha with 95 forest cover 85 fast growing forest plantations in which eucalyptus spp and pinus spp occupy 76 and 9 of the catchment area respectively and 10 native vegetation buffer along the stream and 5 of the area consisting of roads the mean annual temperature in the region is 19 4 c with a mean annual precipitation of 1319 mm with rainfall mostly concentrated in the summer period october to march based on a 40 year time series 1950 1990 alvares et al 2013 soil types are both typic hapludox and rhodic hapludox gonçalves et al 2012 which are typical tropical soils 2 2 datasets streamflow was measured using an h flume equipped with an automatic stage recorder thalimedes shaft enconder sensor with a 15 minute resolution coupled with a datalogger precipitation was measured with an automatic rain gauge tr 525i texas electronics and recorded at 30 min intervals by a data logger located 1 km from the stream gauge the streamflow and rainfall data used in this paper are from august 2009 to december 2016 fig 2 potential evaporation pet in mm h 1 was estimated using penman s formulation as given in shuttleworth 1993 for this estimation the meteorological data of net radiation mj m 2 d 1 air temperature c relative humidity and wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 were obtained from an automatic station located 1 km from the streamflow gauge with a 30 min recording interval 2 3 forest cover change simulations to simulate the effects of forest cover changes by forest cover proportion on streamflow we used the forest cover flow change fcfc model brown et al 2006 which is based on a downward approach sivapalan et al 2003 this model uses streamflow observations to simulate the effects of forest cover due to management podger et al 2005 and requires few inputs such as daily precipitation daily flow and daily potential evapotranspiration in addition the proportion of the catchment area under forest cover before and after changes is required input as a percentage brown et al 2006 the effects of forest cover changes on the flow duration curve fdc were simulated by linking the area under the curve parameters five parameters of the fdc that capture the key components of the curve see best et al 2003 and mean annual streamflow as predicted by zhang s curve zhang et al 2001 the fdc parameters are optimized to fit observed and predicted data the ctf cease to flow percentile and q50 parameters were derived directly from measured data while the other three parameters slope at the origin of the normalized fdc exponent for the upper sections of the normalized fdc and lower section of the normalized fdc were obtained by maximizing the nash and sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the coefficient of efficiency can be used to obtain a measure of goodness of fit with values closer to one reflecting the best fit zhang et al 2012 calibration was carried out with the catchment completely forested i e 100 forest cover in this work forest cover in a catchment was considered to be the sum of forest plantation and native vegetation the proportions of simulated forest cover were 70 50 and 0 of the catchment area scenarios with 100 forest cover were considered as observed data for treatment comparisons 2 4 clear cut scenarios and implications for water availability values for streamflow were obtained by integrating the area under the fdc in each simulated scenario this was done by calculating the sum of the flow axis y in the curve for the full percentage of time the flow is exceeded axis x in the curve afterwards these values were compared with the 100 forest cover scenario for calculating the effects of changes in forest cover on streamflow based on the analysis of the effects of forest cover change on high and low flows we considered flow between 70 and 99 of the time to be exceeding the low flow index smakhtin 2001 in this study we used 70 of the time as the low flow index then changes in the values of high and low flow from the different simulation scenarios were compared to the 100 forest cover scenario in order to calculate relative changes low flow indices q90 and 7q10 were obtained using a regional regression approach for the state of são paulo see liazi et al 1988 and wolff et al 2014 thus based on these indices it is possible to assess the proportion of forest plantation cover under which the low flows are kept above such indices forest plantation effects on streamflow were estimated by comparing simulated fdcs with low flow indices 3 results 3 1 model calibration and simulated forest cover scenarios observed and simulated data indicated a good agreement during calibration nse 0 92 all water years presented efficiency coefficient values greater than 0 8 which is consistent with results from previous studies e g zhang et al 2012 based on these analyses the model was considered an acceptable simulation predicted fdcs differ in slope and shape between the different forest cover scenarios fig 3 flow indices obtained from a regional regression approach were 0 41 mm for 7q10 and 0 51 mm for q90 the fdc from the simulated 0 forest cover scenario remained above both 7q10 and q90 indices for all periods this was not the case for the fdcs of the 50 70 and 100 forest cover simulations that remained below the low flow indices for different periods of time fig 3 forest loss correlated directly with increasing total discharge as shown in the fdcs fig 3 for example with 0 forest cover the increase was approximately 90 1610 7 mm relative to the 100 forest cover scenario the 70 and 50 forest cover simulations in turn generated relatively smaller increases in total streamflow of 27 483 6 mm and 45 805 6 mm respectively considering low flows 70 of time the 100 forest cover scenario resulted in a 12 36 mm streamflow the 0 forest cover scenario produced streamflow increases of 91 112 mm relative to the 100 forest cover scenario for 70 and 50 forest cover the values of low flow increased 27 3 4 mm and 45 5 6 mm respectively relative to 100 forest cover see fig 3 3 2 downstream water availability comparing our simulated flow values with the reference indices we found a direct relationship between water use and the proportion of forest cover our results indicated that under 100 forest cover daily flows values were below the reference low flow indices 13 and 31 of the time for 7q10 and q90 respectively fig 3 in other words our results indicate a water use of 21 1 and 79 2 mm higher than 7q10 and q90 respectively resulting in lower water availability for downstream water users in the 70 forest cover scenario most of the daily flows were higher than 7q10 only 1 of the time were below this threshold in addition daily streamflow was lower than q90 11 of the time or 17 1 mm as for the 50 forest cover simulation all daily streamflow values were higher than 7q10 and only 4 of the time were the values lower than q90 4 1 mm of water use above q90 4 discussion 4 1 flow duration curve changes related to forest cover the relationship between changes in simulated forest cover proportions and variations in fdcs is in line with previously reported effects of land use change on streamflow dynamics bosch and hewlett 1982 sikka et al 2003 brown et al 2013 that is our results showed an increase in annual streamflow for all simulations that decreased forest cover these results are in line with previous studies that have also found that a decrease in forest cover results in an annual flow increase stednick 1996 brown et al 2005 guzha et al 2018 this increase is associated with a decrease in evapotranspiration hewlett and hibbert 1967 burt and swank 1992 and it could be more evident at short rotation forest plantations since they have higher evapotranspiration rates lima et al 2012a gonçalves et al 2013 taking low flow indices into account the 0 forest cover results increases of 60 relative to the 100 forest cover scenario are in accordance with studies that assessed increases in streamflow following reductions in forest cover in temperate regions hornbeck et al 1993 brown et al 2005 and in tropical regions guzha et al 2018 4 2 downstream water availability in the 100 forest cover scenario streamflow spends the highest percentage of time below the low flow indices as a result of higher evapotranspiration rates when the catchment is entirely under forest consequently less water is available for downstream water users the results presented here were obtained in a region with a mean annual rainfall of 1300 mm alvares et al 2013 in regions with lower mean annual precipitation or in regions with a precipitation deficiency expected from climate change e g southwestern europe africa and the usa payn et al 2015 it is possible that the effect of forest plantations on streamflow might be more severe farley et al 2005 van dijk and keenan 2007 lima et al 2012a 2012b for regions with high annual rainfall levels the probability of flow falling below the low flow reference indices is reduced although it is still very likely to occur keenan and van dijk 2010 as forest plantation water use also depends on the occurrence of rainfall carvalho et al 2016 our simulations indicate that a forest mosaic i e different proportions of forest cover within the catchment area has a lower impact on streamflow because of differences in evapotranspiration rates between forest and non forest areas as evidenced in the work of zhang et al 2001 the search for hydrosolidarity forest management strategies lima et al 2012a 2012b has increasing importance for forest plantations since conflicts of water use are being debated and climatic scenarios of reduced rainfall could exacerbate this problem van dijk and keenan 2007 for instance in years with precipitation levels lower than the average e g drought in sao paulo state 2014 coelho et al 2016a 2016b low flow values could be lower than the low flow indices increasing water use conflicts calder 2007 lima et al 2012a 2012b if the area of fast growing forest relative to the total catchment area is known it is possible to predict and avoid water use conflicts and to guide management practices and policies that contribute to water conservation farley et al 2005 in this paper it is a notable finding that varying the type of forest cover in different areas of the catchment as a consequence of deliberate forest occupation planning includes forest management practices that may have positive impacts on diminishing conflicts concerning water use at the catchment scale 4 3 management strategies fast growing forest plantations are characterized by management strategies aimed at increasing production on short rotations however since the sustainability of forest plantations is demanded by both society and government alexandra and campbell 2003 payn et al 2015 several studies have highlighted management strategies that promote soil conservation and water quality sustainability ullrich and volk 2009 her et al 2016 following this discussion our objective is to promote water availability at the catchment scale as the main objective of management strategies for the sustainability of fast growing forest plantations our results show that the proportion of forest cover at the catchment scale could be used to avoid water use conflicts we propose to use low flow indices as a tool to create a threshold for water availability therefore management strategies should be used to limit forest cover effects on streamflow keeping low flow above low flow indices although native vegetation differs from fast growing forest plantations including by water consumption ferraz et al 2013 planning the land use land cover of a catchment must include the native vegetation cover proportion in brazil native vegetation covers approximately 30 of private land sparovek et al 2010 and is correlated with the evapotranspiration rates of the catchment ferraz et al 2013 the other 70 of the catchment area could be used for production and to mitigate forest plantation effects on streamflow via alternative management strategies therefore mosaic land use at the catchment scale e g forest plantation and native vegetation forest plantation and cultures with different evapotranspiration rates or areas with no cultures could be used as a management strategy to enhance water availability in forest plantations ferraz et al 2013 on the other hand water availability is strongly related to rainfall brown et al 2005 lane et al 2005 in non water limited regions water use conflicts could be less pronounced and hence increases in forest cover proportion at the catchment scale could be suitable however dry seasons and drought should be taken into consideration for this decision coelho et al 2016b special attention should be taken in water limited regions in which water availability could be drastically reduced by dry seasons and drought pinheiro et al 2017 water availability issues in these regions could be avoided if management strategies were used to mitigate the effects of fast growing forest on water yield to reduce the effects of forest plantations on streamflow some countries are using strategies which limit expansion to manage the hydrological effects of forest plantations dye and versfeld 2007 greenwood 2013 in brazil the amount of forest plantation is not limited despite expansions in water limited regions and water use conflicts with downstream users ferraz et al 2013 management strategies such as those discussed here should be adopted to avoid future policies that could limit the expansion of fast growing forest plantations in brazil for example employing mosaic land use and planning the forest cover proportion plantation and native vegetation in a catchment can be a strategy for conciliation of conservation and production needs in the same area when some catchment areas are used for production fast growing forest plantation other catchment areas could be used to increase water availability for downstream users we can then utilize a land sharing strategy to conciliate conservation and production at the catchment scale however forest management practices with respect to forest harvesting and planting could be economically unfeasible at the catchment scale scale issues were discussed in previous studies zhang et al 2003 2017 brown et al 2007 and the effects on water resources are higher at the local scale catchment than at the regional scale landscape van dijk et al 2007 although forest management planning has been conducted at the landscape scale due to the large areas covered with forest it should be noted that water conservation decisions must be made at the catchment scale since at this local scale the effects of forest cover are more relevant van dijk et al 2007 planning water use on the catchment scale is a challenge to decision makers this paper highlights the importance of controlling forest cover proportion as a management strategy for mitigating conflicts between water users in the same catchment based on our results management strategies concerned with forest cover proportion and water management planning on the catchment scale should be used for water regulation especially in water limited regions 5 conclusion the lack of hydrological forest planning can lead to water conflicts involving local populations and the forestry sector mainly as a result of decreases in low flow in this context it is possible to conclude that planning the amount of forest at the catchment scale could be used as a management strategy to reduce the effects of plantations on streamflow furthermore with the use of low flow indices it is possible to define forest cover thresholds for attenuating plantation effects and water availability to downstream water use thus low flow indices can be used as a reference to guide forest management

8477,study region são paulo state brazil study focus this study assessed the influence of forest plantations on streamflow in a gauged catchment 85 ha covered with fast growing eucalyptus sp plantations one strategy for reducing the effects of plantations on streamflow is to reduce the area of a catchment occupied by forest and in this context our objectives were to simulate the effects on streamflow of different proportions of forest cover 70 50 and 0 of the forest cover moreover we used low flow indices q90 and 7q10 to examine the effects of such scenarios on water availability for downstream users new hydrological insights fast growing forest plantation areas have been expanding globally with simultaneously increasing concerns about the water consumption of these forests especially in water limited regions with consequences for downstream users simulations of scenarios with varying forest cover proportions showed an annual streamflow increase of 90 when clear cutting had removed the forest cover in the catchment the 100 forest cover scenario produced rates of streamflow below the low flow indices resulting in less water availability for downstream water users the reduction in forest cover proportion at the catchment scale promoted an attenuation of water use therefore forest plantation management should adopt management strategies such as regulating the forest cover proportion to minimize the effects on water supply for downstream water users keywords clear cut proportion flow duration curve eucalyptus forest low flow indices forest age mosaic hydrological model 1 introduction the area occupied by fast growing forest plantations is expanding in several parts of the world payn et al 2015 at the same time the area of forest plantation in brazil currently exceeds 7 5 million hectares iba 2016 these expansions are accompanied by a parallel increase in concerns regarding water use jackson et al 2005 calder 2007 such concerns are mainly related to the decrease in water availability to downstream users van dijk and keenan 2007 guzha et al 2018 and the effects on low flows farley et al 2005 beck et al 2013 the effects on streamflow are high evapotranspiration rates associated with fast growing highly productive forests which are typical characteristics of eucalyptus forest plantations scott 2005 these effects are characterized by an observed decrease in streamflow following reforestation bosch and hewlett 1982 guzha et al 2018 accompanied by an increase in streamflow following forest clear cutting scott 2005 due to this relationship one way to minimize the effects of forest plantations on streamflow might be to control the proportion of forest cover at the catchment scale which has the potential to modify the streamflow regime zhang et al 2012 for this reason it is important to understand the relationship between streamflow and forest cover proportion in order to better manage forest plantations and avoid water use conflicts brown et al 2013 this is especially necessary in regions where fast growing forest is the predominant land use swanson et al 2000 defries and eshleman 2004 as well as in water limited regions van dijk and keenan 2007 since decreases in streamflow related to forest expansion can reduce water availability and consequently may enhance water use conflicts farley et al 2005 scott 2005 van dijk and keenan 2007 in this context alternative forest management strategies may minimize the effects on streamflow in a catchment vanclay 2009 some alternative forest management strategies include i increasing the rotation cycle to allow the recovery of streamflow to original levels scott and prinsloo 2008 ii choosing species with higher water use efficiency to increase wood production without increasing water use forrester et al 2010 iii establishing forest stands with different ages to minimize the peak water consumption vertessy et al 2003 ferraz et al 2013 and iv choosing forest plantation locations relative to the stream network for reaching the potential areas in catchment planning kalantari et al 2014 however some of these management practices are costly which may hinder their practical implementation taking this difficulty into account the use of hydrological models can be an alternative tool for providing responses to the effectiveness of alternative strategies for forest management defries and eshleman 2004 guzha et al 2018 in this study we used a simple conceptual hydrological model developed by brown et al 2006 and widely used by shao et al 2009 and zhang et al 2012 to predict the effects of forest plantations on streamflow following a change in the proportion of forest cover increases in forest plantation area can lead to low flow reduction brown et al 2005 which will affect water availability at the catchment scale and consequently water availability for downstream water users van dijk and keenan 2007 therefore understanding these changes in a streamflow regime is necessary to the development of strategies for water resources management zhang et al 2012 the aim of this study is to simulate the hydrological effects of different forest cover scenarios and discuss forest plantation occupation planning as a tool for water conservation and implementation of the hydrosolidarity concept in forestry activities 2 material and methods 2 1 study area aiming to best represent the climatic conditions and management practices under which fast growing planted forests are distributed in brazil we used a gauged catchment located in the state of são paulo 23 02 01 s 48 37 30 w fig 1 this region is representative of the climatic conditions and management practices of fast growing plantation forests in brazil the catchment area is 85 8 ha with 95 forest cover 85 fast growing forest plantations in which eucalyptus spp and pinus spp occupy 76 and 9 of the catchment area respectively and 10 native vegetation buffer along the stream and 5 of the area consisting of roads the mean annual temperature in the region is 19 4 c with a mean annual precipitation of 1319 mm with rainfall mostly concentrated in the summer period october to march based on a 40 year time series 1950 1990 alvares et al 2013 soil types are both typic hapludox and rhodic hapludox gonçalves et al 2012 which are typical tropical soils 2 2 datasets streamflow was measured using an h flume equipped with an automatic stage recorder thalimedes shaft enconder sensor with a 15 minute resolution coupled with a datalogger precipitation was measured with an automatic rain gauge tr 525i texas electronics and recorded at 30 min intervals by a data logger located 1 km from the stream gauge the streamflow and rainfall data used in this paper are from august 2009 to december 2016 fig 2 potential evaporation pet in mm h 1 was estimated using penman s formulation as given in shuttleworth 1993 for this estimation the meteorological data of net radiation mj m 2 d 1 air temperature c relative humidity and wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 were obtained from an automatic station located 1 km from the streamflow gauge with a 30 min recording interval 2 3 forest cover change simulations to simulate the effects of forest cover changes by forest cover proportion on streamflow we used the forest cover flow change fcfc model brown et al 2006 which is based on a downward approach sivapalan et al 2003 this model uses streamflow observations to simulate the effects of forest cover due to management podger et al 2005 and requires few inputs such as daily precipitation daily flow and daily potential evapotranspiration in addition the proportion of the catchment area under forest cover before and after changes is required input as a percentage brown et al 2006 the effects of forest cover changes on the flow duration curve fdc were simulated by linking the area under the curve parameters five parameters of the fdc that capture the key components of the curve see best et al 2003 and mean annual streamflow as predicted by zhang s curve zhang et al 2001 the fdc parameters are optimized to fit observed and predicted data the ctf cease to flow percentile and q50 parameters were derived directly from measured data while the other three parameters slope at the origin of the normalized fdc exponent for the upper sections of the normalized fdc and lower section of the normalized fdc were obtained by maximizing the nash and sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the coefficient of efficiency can be used to obtain a measure of goodness of fit with values closer to one reflecting the best fit zhang et al 2012 calibration was carried out with the catchment completely forested i e 100 forest cover in this work forest cover in a catchment was considered to be the sum of forest plantation and native vegetation the proportions of simulated forest cover were 70 50 and 0 of the catchment area scenarios with 100 forest cover were considered as observed data for treatment comparisons 2 4 clear cut scenarios and implications for water availability values for streamflow were obtained by integrating the area under the fdc in each simulated scenario this was done by calculating the sum of the flow axis y in the curve for the full percentage of time the flow is exceeded axis x in the curve afterwards these values were compared with the 100 forest cover scenario for calculating the effects of changes in forest cover on streamflow based on the analysis of the effects of forest cover change on high and low flows we considered flow between 70 and 99 of the time to be exceeding the low flow index smakhtin 2001 in this study we used 70 of the time as the low flow index then changes in the values of high and low flow from the different simulation scenarios were compared to the 100 forest cover scenario in order to calculate relative changes low flow indices q90 and 7q10 were obtained using a regional regression approach for the state of são paulo see liazi et al 1988 and wolff et al 2014 thus based on these indices it is possible to assess the proportion of forest plantation cover under which the low flows are kept above such indices forest plantation effects on streamflow were estimated by comparing simulated fdcs with low flow indices 3 results 3 1 model calibration and simulated forest cover scenarios observed and simulated data indicated a good agreement during calibration nse 0 92 all water years presented efficiency coefficient values greater than 0 8 which is consistent with results from previous studies e g zhang et al 2012 based on these analyses the model was considered an acceptable simulation predicted fdcs differ in slope and shape between the different forest cover scenarios fig 3 flow indices obtained from a regional regression approach were 0 41 mm for 7q10 and 0 51 mm for q90 the fdc from the simulated 0 forest cover scenario remained above both 7q10 and q90 indices for all periods this was not the case for the fdcs of the 50 70 and 100 forest cover simulations that remained below the low flow indices for different periods of time fig 3 forest loss correlated directly with increasing total discharge as shown in the fdcs fig 3 for example with 0 forest cover the increase was approximately 90 1610 7 mm relative to the 100 forest cover scenario the 70 and 50 forest cover simulations in turn generated relatively smaller increases in total streamflow of 27 483 6 mm and 45 805 6 mm respectively considering low flows 70 of time the 100 forest cover scenario resulted in a 12 36 mm streamflow the 0 forest cover scenario produced streamflow increases of 91 112 mm relative to the 100 forest cover scenario for 70 and 50 forest cover the values of low flow increased 27 3 4 mm and 45 5 6 mm respectively relative to 100 forest cover see fig 3 3 2 downstream water availability comparing our simulated flow values with the reference indices we found a direct relationship between water use and the proportion of forest cover our results indicated that under 100 forest cover daily flows values were below the reference low flow indices 13 and 31 of the time for 7q10 and q90 respectively fig 3 in other words our results indicate a water use of 21 1 and 79 2 mm higher than 7q10 and q90 respectively resulting in lower water availability for downstream water users in the 70 forest cover scenario most of the daily flows were higher than 7q10 only 1 of the time were below this threshold in addition daily streamflow was lower than q90 11 of the time or 17 1 mm as for the 50 forest cover simulation all daily streamflow values were higher than 7q10 and only 4 of the time were the values lower than q90 4 1 mm of water use above q90 4 discussion 4 1 flow duration curve changes related to forest cover the relationship between changes in simulated forest cover proportions and variations in fdcs is in line with previously reported effects of land use change on streamflow dynamics bosch and hewlett 1982 sikka et al 2003 brown et al 2013 that is our results showed an increase in annual streamflow for all simulations that decreased forest cover these results are in line with previous studies that have also found that a decrease in forest cover results in an annual flow increase stednick 1996 brown et al 2005 guzha et al 2018 this increase is associated with a decrease in evapotranspiration hewlett and hibbert 1967 burt and swank 1992 and it could be more evident at short rotation forest plantations since they have higher evapotranspiration rates lima et al 2012a gonçalves et al 2013 taking low flow indices into account the 0 forest cover results increases of 60 relative to the 100 forest cover scenario are in accordance with studies that assessed increases in streamflow following reductions in forest cover in temperate regions hornbeck et al 1993 brown et al 2005 and in tropical regions guzha et al 2018 4 2 downstream water availability in the 100 forest cover scenario streamflow spends the highest percentage of time below the low flow indices as a result of higher evapotranspiration rates when the catchment is entirely under forest consequently less water is available for downstream water users the results presented here were obtained in a region with

thus particularly impact its extreme values hagemann et al 2011 mudelsee et al 2010 the underlying principle and thus the most crucial assumption is that the bias correction factors retrieved by any such methods must necessarily be considered valid for the future assuming a temporal stationarity and thus introducing another yet often neglected source of uncertainty teutschbein and seibert 2012 hence it must be argued that bc methods might falsify the original climate change signal ccs of rcms with extreme values being stronger affected than means themeßl et al 2012 regarding the influence of the use of bias corrected data on hydrological modeling muerth et al 2012 point out that individual simulations with a strong inherent bias visibly affect the ccs of hydrological indicators the overall mean ccs of large rcm ensembles i e multiple member of a rcm driven by the same gcm with changing initial conditions however seem to be less sensitive to bc many studies investigated the removal of bias in rcms resulting in a myriad of methods and various performances for specific purposes e g maraun et al 2010 themeßl et al 2012 the study by muerth et al 2012 investigated the influence of bc on the representation of observed runoff the impact of cc on the runoff regime and the effect of bc on the future change in hydrological indicators over a single catchment in bavaria hagemann et al 2011 state that the hydrological ccs at certain locations and for specific seasons might be affected by the bc of raw gcm data this impact of bc on the ccs of hydrological indicators is also significant if outputs from corrected rcms are applied as a meteorological driver of hydrological models muerth et al 2012 cloke et al 2013 investigated the impact of bc on the ccs of extreme discharges for the upper severn catchment england and found that it is even stronger than for mean flows to further investigate this specific topic in the course of its routine operations in water resources management e g design of flood detention basins based on a threshold for extreme high flows the bavarian environment agency bayerisches landesamt für umwelt lfu requested to analyze the performance of three bias correction methods local intensity scaling quantile mapping linear scaling for multiple bavarian catchments in the framework of the bi klim 1 1 einfluss der biaskorrektur

data on water balance modeling and assessment of climate impacts for bavarian catchments project these specific bc approaches are chosen for being considered state of the art methods to adjust the systematic differences between rcm data and observations ehret et al 2012 hence the purpose of this study was a to determine the most sufficiently performing bias correction method as a standard approach for the bavarian domain see fig 1 upper left and b to quantify and evaluate the effects of bias correction on the ccs of specific hydrological indicators for river catchments located in bavaria germany this paper focuses on the effects of bias correction on the ccs of hydrological indicators the climate simulations ensemble for this study includes three different rcms the cosmo clm

racmo v2 1 of the knmi van meijgaard et al 2008 all driven by the same global circulation model gcm echam5 roeckner et al 2003 further referred to as cclm remo racmo the hydrological model wasim schulla 2012 was applied to determine the impacts of bc to the ccs in the hydrology of several selected bavarian catchments the performance of bc methods is evaluated by comparing long term flow regimes as well as specific flow indicators resulting from the hydrological modeling a reference data set of observed data was set up at the beginning of the project this dataset is further used as the observational reference for hydrological modeling and bias correction the effects of bc on the ccs of the catchment s hydrology are investigated using the same hydrological indicators 2 study area data and methods 2 1 study area the study area covers the major bavarian river basins including their headwaters in southern germany and partly adjoining states austria to the south czech republic to the east furtherly referred to as hydrological bavaria it comprises 18 hydrological catchments modeled separately with the water balance simulation model wasim schulla 2012 at the lfu as illustrated in fig 1 left furthermore this figure shows the surrounding domain upper left blue box used for the bias correction of the rcm data for the bavarian catchments lower left the following sections will focus on catchment 5 representing the iller lech river system and parts of the danube in particular results are shown for the mindel river sub basin up to the gauge offingen fig 1 right red outline covering an area of about 929 km² since it represents a relatively pristine basin with only limited effects from water management infrastructure other catchments lech river to the east or iller river to the west are heavily impacted by artificial reservoirs and dams which imposes additional challenges on the hydrological modeling outside the scope of this study this sub basin is characterized by pre alpine topography showing a s n gradient from the gauge in the north at 440 m a s l to the highest peak in the south at 860 m a s l the long term precipitation sums follow this gradient ranging from 1100 mm in the southern part to 750 mm in the north mean temperatures range from 1 c january to about 18 c august and the mean annual evapotranspiration is around 570 mm with a mean flow of 12 2 m³ s ranging from 11 5 m³ s in the summer to 12 9 m³ s in winter the overall annual runoff variation in this pluvio nival flow regime remains quite small 2 2 data the data for this study is provided by the lfu covering the 18 catchments and including measured values from stream gauges and meteorological stations as well as grid based meteorological data performing bias correction requires a meteorological reference to compute the change factors based on a distribution function or simple deltas for the modification of the rcm values here a reference data set based on a regular grid was created by combining meteorological data from different sources table 1 for different regions fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of the different data sources and types for the climatological variables with station values covering the danube tributaries to the south and hyras raster covering the northern tributaries as well as the main catchment except for air humidity h in two northern catchments wind speed w and radiation r are interpolated from station measurements for the entire hydrological bavaria all meteorological data are available on a daily basis the adjacent grids of each region of are spatially merged for each time step in combination both data sets provide a regular grid at the resolution of the hydrological model of 1 x 1 km² covering the entire bavarian domain the different data sets hyras and interpolated station data exhibit patterns due to the different development schemes hence the danube catchments show a more pronounced topographical pattern while the main catchment shows a more diffuse picture the sharp transition between the regions might influence results of affected catchments however the different schemes have no impact on the findings shown in this study the different sources of meteorological data are applied to the respective hydrological model for the catchments of fig 1 the reference period for this study covers the period from 1971 to 2000 this period was chosen since meteorological data was available in sufficient spatial and temporal coverage the presented investigation on the impacts of bias correction on ccs is based on data from three different rcms all using echam5 as the driving gcm two were provided by the lfu the cclm and remo these rcms are frequently used in other climate change related projects funded by the lfu e g kliwa adaptalp climchalp since their high spatial resolution is considered to be advantageous for applications in high relief terrain as bavaria especially over the alps in order to show the performance of bc on a coarse resolution model the racmo rcm with a spatial resolution of 50 km was applied in this study the respective characteristics of each rcm are given in table 2 the driving gcm and its members i e gcm runs with slightly altered initial conditions are the same for all three rcms hence the differences in the results using the different rcm ensembles cclm racmo remo originate from the differences in the rcm configurations e g resolution domain size however as with the gcm members variations between rcm members originate from their respective initial conditions in contrast to racmo and cclm with three members each there is only one member available for the remo rcm furthermore the remo precipitation shows a shift in precipitation fields in mountainous areas due to luv and lee effects a minor precipitation event from clouds at 3000 m altitude might be shifted by up to 15 km if affected by wind speeds up to 10 m s göttel 2009 this spatial offset has to be considered in all further analysis table 3 illustrates the long term yearly mean values of the different meteorological variables of the reference data set and the raw rcms as well as their respective absolute and relative biases the biases are considerable especially for temperature and precipitation of all cclm members and for temperature of the remo rcm also precipitation biases for the racmo rcm are significant 10 wind speed global radiation and relative air humidity also exhibit strong relative biases however their absolute deviations are rather small a proper correction of the bias of precipitation and air temperature is most important to allow hydrological models to produce reasonable outputs however since the hydrological model applied in this study requires all the above mentioned variables they are also corrected for a better representation of the observed values 2 3 methods for the purpose of analyzing the influence of the bias correction on the climate change signal a model chain was introduced fig 3 with the bi klim data base as central component this data base includes all the pre and post processed rcm data raw scaled and bias corrected the bias correction is conducted at rcm resolution thus a spatial aggregation of the reference data set to the rcm scale was performed after bias correction the rcm data was further downscaled to the hydrological model grid applying the scaling tool scalmet marke 2008 the influence of the bias correction on the climate change signal of the hydrological regimes was analyzed by applying all available raw and preprocessed data to the hydrological model wasim for the mindel sub basin within the iller lech catchment 2 3 1 bias correction methods rcm data usually display a statistical mismatch to recorded meteorological variables a bias in order to make the data better applicable and acceptable for users various methods have been developed to correct such biases via transformation algorithms to statistically match the observations a good overview of the various available approaches for bias correction is given by teutschbein and seibert 2012 the usual methods share the assumption that the retrieved correction factors and addendums are considered stationary in space and time thus they are taken to be valid for the reference and the scenario period as well this assumption is not challenged here as the paper is focused on assessing the impacts of this common practice a common shortcoming of dynamic rcm data is the overestimation of the number of days with very little precipitation teutschbein and seibert 2012 this problem refers to the size of the raster cells of a rcm in combination with the convection of moist air as the moist air reaches full saturation at a certain height with decreasing temperature it will induce rainfall for a large area within a rcm this process is further referred to as the drizzle effect dai 2006 dai 2006 also points out that this area wide drizzle would not occur under natural conditions due to atmospheric instabilities and refers this effect to the model scale consequently this particular portion of the rcm precipitation has to be removed in advance of the bias correction to avoid its influence on the modification factors kjellström et al 2010 tested several thresholds for a minimum precipitation amount for handling the drizzle effect and found 1 mm day to be a good value to remove excess drizzle precipitation from model data values up to this threshold do not significantly contribute to overall precipitation sums dai 2001 thus this approach was applied for the elimination of the drizzle for all available rcm data in this study in contrast to the variability between the different rcms the changes in initial conditions of the driving gcm for the three members of the cclm and racmo induce an internal variability between these members of the particular rcm which can be considered as natural variability elía and côté 2010 muerth et al 2012 to maintain this variability between the members of the cclm and racmo rcm a multi member bias correction was performed here a single set of correction factors is derived using the statistics of all the three respective members of the rcm muerth et al 2012 instead of one set for each of the members this allows for ascribing the differences in the annual course to the respective member of these small rcm ensembles furthermore this ensures that a measure for the natural climate variability is maintained as mentioned above for this study we used three different methods for bias correction which are briefly described here the correction factors are calculated on a monthly 1 factor per month as well as on a yearly one factor per year basis additionally the multi member approach is applied to either of the sets of correction factors furthermore values of relative air humidity are corrected in terms of dew point temperature applying the magnus formula for conversion since air temperature is required for the transformation a good match between those two variables is maintained 2 3 1 1 linear scaling ls linear scaling is applied according to lenderink et al 2007 with slight changes regarding the long term averages for this approach we used the additive air temperature c 1 or multiplicative precipitation 2 differences between the monthly yearly averages of the reference and the rcm data for the reference period similar to teutschbein and seibert 2012 the resulting correction factors are then applied to each daily t value of the entire time series of the rcm by addition or multiplication depending on the climate parameter to be corrected 1 t r c m c o r t t r c m t t o b s t r c m 2 p r c m c o r t p r c m t p o b s p r c m the multiplicative approach also applies for the parameters wind speed and global radiation since these parameters have an absolute zero value like precipitation whereas for air humidity the additive approach is used 2 3 1 2 quantile mapping qm the quantile mapping approach attempts to adjust the distribution function of values of the rcm to match the distribution function of observed values for the reference period sennikovs and bethers 2009 teutschbein and seibert 2012 thus the correction factors depend directly on the values of both time series this study uses a modified empirical quantile mapping approach based on an daily translation after mpelasoka and chiew 2009 apart from the usual multiplicative correction factors the adapted approach of this study also provides additive factors to adjust temperature and relative air humidity via dew point temperature the distribution function for rcm and observed values is created by a division of the values using percentiles in a first step the values of each percentile i with i 2k 1 k 0 49 for both time series observations and raw model data are defined if the percentile is in between two values of a time series a weighted mean will be calculated the second step performs a cubic interpolation of the predefined percentile values to n percentiles in order to prevent sharp edges between percentiles the cubic interpolation to represent the fitting of the 50 percentile points is preferred over a linear interpolation in this study the number n of percentiles can be altered and typically ranges between 0 and 100 for this investigation a value of 50 was chosen as this number was considered to sufficiently represent the distribution since every value of the time series is affected by the correction also extreme values will be adjusted those new extreme values are achieved by an extrapolation of the percentile values 99 and 1 for the corrected model time series this allows for the calculation of correction factors for the lowermost and uppermost percentile in the last step the n percentiles are derived from the time series to be corrected this also applies for the raw model time series for the future period hence there are n values of the time series to be corrected and n correction factors for the respective percentiles afterwards the correction factors closest to the respective percentile are assigned to the values of the original rcm time series all these steps also apply for time series of single months which leads to 12n correction values 2 3 1 3 local intensity scaling loci the local intensity scaling method schmidli et al 2006 only applies for precipitation values this approach is based on a scaling factor depending on wet day intensities 3 and a wet day threshold wdt derived from the wet day frequency of daily observed pobs and model data prcm 3 s p o b s p o b s p o b s w d t p o b s w d t p r c m p r c m p r c m w d t p r c m w d t the corrected time series is then calculated as follows 4 p r c m c o r m a x p o b s w d t s p r c m t p r c m w d t 0 after the bias correction the new model data by definition have the same wet day frequency and intensity as the observed time series schmidli et al 2006 however the overall precipitation sums may differ as for this method only the targeted statistics will match the statistics derived from the observation values muerth et al 2012 in order to draw conclusions about the effects of this approach the remaining parameters are corrected with the qm method 2 3 2 the hydrological model wasim the water balance simulation model wasim was employed to perform the hydrological modeling wasim is characterized as a distributed grid based regular irregular mainly physically based deterministic type of model using constant time steps with internally flexible sub time steps schulla 2012 it is frequently applied for various climate change impact studies foltyn et al 2017 kleinn et al 2005 rößler and löffler 2010 or for the analysis on the need for bias correction e g muerth et al 2012 in this study we applied existing calibrated and validated configurations of wasim for the catchments of the hydrological bavaria and the following results focus on the results for the mindel sub basin gauge offingen calculated using the model setup for the iller lech river system catchment 5 fig 1 the model was set up in 1 km spatial resolution and a daily time step and the parameters were derived for the calibration period from 1994 to 1998 and validated for the consecutive period between 1998 and 2003 these time slices were chosen since the number of available meteorological input data was larger the authors of the model udata pöhler et al 2009 evaluated the modeled discharge fit by the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 for raw nse and logarithmic lognse model outputs furthermore a long term simulation run from 1971 to 2003 was evaluated to test the overall model performance including years with less available input data the results for the different modeling periods table 4 for the mindel catchment show a fairly good representation of the observed runoff by the model nse 0 5 and lognse 0 65 the lack of available input data might influence the performance of the long term simulation 3 results 3 1 bias correction results the hydrological model for the iller lech catchment is driven by the observed data reference data set as well as by the raw and corrected data of the dynamical rcms the modeled runoff obtained from driving the model with the reference data set forms the basis to assess the influence of the different bias correction methods for the different hydrological model outputs a codification for the composition of the different rcm and bias correction methods is given in table 5 the long term flow regimes for the reference period between 1971 and 2000 shown in fig 4 illustrate the more or less distinct differences between the model runs using observed data obs and those using the raw rcm data downscaled to the hydrological model resolution while the regimes of the racmo model mainly differ from the reference during the winter months the results using the cclm model overestimate the reference by almost 100 throughout all seasons due to significantly higher modeled precipitation the runoff produced by the remo model data however underestimates the reference entirely regarding the weak seasonal course the modeled regimes of the cclm and remo data show higher similarity to the reference furthermore fig 4 shows the inter annual variability of the simulations using raw rcm datasets colored boxplots compared to the variability of the model run produced with observed data transparent box plot since there is no overlap between the upper or lower quantiles of simulations results of raw rcm data these models differ significantly from each other however the variability of the racmo model simulations is similar to the variability of the results using observed data since the notches of both boxplots as well as the median exhibit a good agreement the variability of modeled results using raw cclm and remo rcms in contrast differs significantly from the reference regime fig 5 shows the results of the hydrological modeling using the bias corrected rcm data bc1 for the bias corrected racmo data using monthly correction factors the results of the hydrological modeling are best for the 2nd member 7 5 qm m m2 8 for other members and bc methods see table 6 showing only minor differences of about 2 m³ s 2 m³ s for other members and bc methods e g 4m³ s in spring of m1 during the summer and fall season in general while the regimes produced by monthly corrected racmo data systematically underestimate the observations 4 m³ s to 2 m³ s throughout the year the results with annual correction coefficients exhibit an overestimation in winter 1 m³ s to 5 m³ s and underestimation in summer up to 5 m³ s in august the flow regimes of the cclm as well as remo model show good adjustment especially for member 2 and 3 of the cclm with only minor differences regarding those produced with monthly correction factors despite the huge deviation of the raw cclm data the bias correction is able to satisfactorily reproduce the observed runoff the results using yearly correction factors depict that the seasonal course of the results produced by raw rcm data is maintained in the corrected data however the correction leads to a shift of the respective regime to a slightly lower level in most cases this results in a slightly higher deviation from the observed data compared to the bc1 data based on monthly values the relative overall differences between the reference regime and those generated by the corrected rcm data given in table 6 show that best adjustment is gained by the models cclm member 2 and 3 as well as remo this is due to the finer resolution and an already better representation of the seasonal course in the raw data furthermore these values illustrate that in most cases qm leads to the best adjustment the differences of this approach are in most cases considerably lower e g racmo m1 qm m 9 4 locy y 16 1 furthermore yearly correction factors yield greater deviations for almost all rcms also the internal variations between the members of the cclm and racmo seem to be maintained by the multi member correction approach the single set of correction factors for the remo rcm however does not produce better results compared to the multi member approach since the differences are comparable to those of the cclm and racmo e g remo qm m 6 8 to racmo qm m 7 5 3 2 changes in hydrological signals the changes in hydrological signals are analyzed for the near future scenario period ranging from 2021 to 2050 since data for the cclm rcm is only available for this period to determine the effects of bias correction of rcm data on the hydrological ccs we applied eight different flow indicators as described in table 7 the extreme value statistics of the low and high flow indicators of a certain return period are based on the pearson iii distribution dvwk 1979 1983 the flow indicators for the reference period 1971 2000 show good agreement with observations for the hydrological data produced by bias corrected rcm time series in terms of mean flow low flow and mean high flows compared to the reference ref however the extreme high flow indicators show greater deviations fig 6 exemplarily illustrates this behavior for the racmo rcm and is representative for the results of the cclm and remo rcm as well whereas inter member differences are very small for mf lf mlf 7lf2 mhf and hf2 the hf and hf100 depict significant variations between the different correction methods these distinct differences in hf and hf100 for the various bc methods originate from their statistical characteristics the hf index represents the highest runoff value of a chosen period e g 30 years hence the runoff simulations using bc data might not capture this specific value since the driving bc meteorology is possibly lacking a proper representation of extreme values the hf100 is a statistical extrapolation based on yearly hf events of a certain period thus the insufficient representation of hf values when using the bc meteorology directly affects the hf100 values hf2 on the other hand is based on annual hf events in this case an extrapolation is obsolete since the available runoff time series are sufficiently long e g 30 years fig 7 shows the ccs for the different seasons djf mam jja son of the raw and corrected rcms the different seasons exhibit various changes in the signal the internal variability between the members of the cclm and racmo rcms is visible and maintained by the applied correction methods a warm and moist signal remains warm and moist signals in summer jja are rather small for the remo rcm while in winter and spring they are larger for all rcms apart from cclm m1 and m3 and racmo m1 and m3 for qm m the ccs of bc1 data for the winter period show little deviations from the bc0 signal this is also visible for the other seasons and the cclm and racmo model for almost all bc methods greater deviations in ccs between bc0 and bc1 data are present in the spring and fall season the shift in precipitation fields as described earlier might be accountable for this larger change in signals by the various rcm methods since this shift is adjusted by the correction as well the following graphs fig 8 10 show the results of the ccs analysis for streamflow while the bars illustrate the relative change signal i e relative difference between reference and future scenario on rcm to rcm basis of the flow indicators the numbers below represent their respective absolute values m³ s it should be mentioned that the relative change signals might indicate a more severe change than the absolute value actually provides for this is obviously pronounced for the low flow indicators for the racmo and cclm rcms the change signals of all three members are illustrated member 1 red member 2 blue member 3 green the solid bar represents the raw rcm bc0 inherent climate change signal ccs the shaded bar the induced changes according to the bias corrected model data fig 8 illustrates the changes in the ccs of the original rcm and bias corrected model data for racmo the mean flow shows little to no difference between the change signals throughout all members regarding the absolute values except for member 2 and 3 qm m values which is ascribed to a strong wet signal in winter see fig 7 as well as the relative signals thus in this case bias correction does not contribute to uncertainty in long term water balance assessments changes in mean flows under new climate conditions since the ccs is not affected by the corrected data considering the lf only member 1 and 2 show differences between the ccs of bc0 and bc1 relative and absolute absolute and relative values of member 3 vary around the same magnitude furthermore the lf depicts that natural variability between the three members is conserved by the multi member bias correction approach with the 2nd member showing a negative signal whereas the other two members deviate positively the absolute and relative ccs of the other low flow indicators mlf 7lf2 vary just slightly since the absolute ccs values are close to zero the shift in direction may be neglected the high flow indicators however show more distinct differences between the bc0 raw rcm ccs and those produced using bias corrected data the mhf exhibits the least distinctive absolute and relative deviations as well as the hf2 furthermore the different methods lead to large differences between bc0 ccs and bc1 ccs which holds especially for the 3rd member of the hf indicator here the relative bc0 ccs is below 20 but the bc1 ccs of the loci methods are 5 and greater 50 respectively the absolute value of the loci y method exceeds the bc0 value by over 100 19 5 m³ s bc0 to 47 8 m³ s loci y in contrast to the low flow indicators the shift in ccs direction within a member is more severe regarding the hf100 member 1 ls m shows a decrease by 32 2 m³ s whereas the bc0 displays a slight increase of 4 9 m³ s the differences in ccs of the flow indicators are more pronounced for the cclm model results fig 9 the mf shows varying relative changes of the ccs which is a direct response to the input data for all seasons see fig 7 but the absolute values differ only very little compared to the racmo model the absolute differences of the ccs for the low flow indicators between the bc1 and bc0 are higher for cclm data only the 3rd member using the monthly adjustment factors shows similarities to the raw rcm however the absolute changes are very small again the high flow indicators show major differences in ccs between the bc1 and bc0 values for both relative and absolute numbers these changes are less severe for the mhf and in some cases for the hf2 however the bc1 data in most cases overestimate the ccs of hf and hf100 for the members 1 and 2 by up to 145 hf bc1 m1 loci y 54 1 m³ s bc0 m1 3 7 m³ s and underestimate the ccs for the 3rd member the remo model data induce the most severe changes in ccs of the flow indicators between the original rcm and the bc1 results fig 10 here almost every indicator switches from a negative signal in bc0 to a positive in bc1 or vice versa except for the mhf while the bc0 data depict a reduction in mf and all low flow indicators the bc1 data mostly show a slight increase the ccs of the hf and the hf100 indicator exhibit considerable differences between bc0 and bc1 data while the raw rcm data for these indicators depict an increase of less than 20 the bias corrected data reveal a significant decrease between about 30 hf100 qm m and over 50 hf ls y as mentioned in section 2 2 the bc0 remo inherent spatial offset of precipitation fields might influence the ccs all bias correction methods remove this shift from the bc0 data 4 conclusions and discussion the results of the hydrological modeling using the bc0 rcm data clarify the indispensable need for bias correction for climate impact studies if the results significantly differ from observations and data are applied for subsequent hydrological applications e g water management the long term yearly flow regimes of the cclm and remo differ from the reference however apart from the winter season the raw racmo model shows a good regime representation for the mindel catchment the different correction approaches account for good adjustment of the modeled runoff to the reference of observed data when applied to raw cclm and remo data the regime simulated using the modified racmo data on the other hand are at least comparable to the results using the raw data in general while in northern bavaria the available models fit their respective reference equally well after correction exemplarily shown in fig 11 for the gauge kemmern outlet of catchment 18 lower left map of fig 1 the racmo model shows some greater differences in adjustment after the correction in the southern part of bavaria since the bias correction is performed on the rcm scale using the spatially aggregated reference data localized small scale events within aggregation are also averaged and smoothed hence this aggregation to the coarse rcm model resolution of 50 km is considered to be the major source for the partly huge deviations especially in distinctive topography like the alps considering the uncertainties added by applying bias correction to raw rcm data e g by losing coherence between variables assumption of temporal stationarity of correction factors discrepancy in scales between rcm and observations and the little effect it has on the racmo data the raw data might also be useful however judging from the indicators the qm approach using monthly correction factors shows the best results and thus supports earlier suggestions by themeßl et al 2011 high flow indicators are an exception which was also found by muerth et al 2012 however it should be mentioned that the applied hydrological model wasim is not specifically calibrated for high flows thus this must influence rare and single extreme high flow events like the hf and hf100 combined with the bc1 rcms a sufficient match with the reference can hardly be achieved and might occur randomly such flood extremes are usually triggered by extreme precipitation events at the far end of the cumulative distribution function or the highest percentiles of occurrence for which the correction factors may only be able to provide insufficient approximations in conclusion this study confirms that the qm approach applied to all meteorological variables results in a better representation of mean streamflow indicators across bavaria than the other two investigated methods regarding extreme flow indicators hf hf100 these methods are still not able to reproduce the statistics of the observations at the upper end of the distribution for any bavarian region however if extreme flow indicators are of particular interest e g if a flood detention basin should be designed to store runoff up to a certain hf threshold and other indicators e g mean flow are well represented by raw rcm data hattermann et al 2014 suggest to correct discharge values by their return periods using extreme value statistics the analysis for the gauge offingen also shows that the bias correction of rcm data affects the ccs of hydrological indicators to an extent that may not be negligible for subsequent applications e g hydrological modelling water management or the design flood protection infrastructure differences in the relative ccs of mean flow indicators between raw and corrected data are small in most cases the relative signals of bc1 low flow indicators show more severe deviations from the reference signal of the bc0 rcm data this effect of bias correction on the ccs of mean indicators is also shown by stagl and hattermann 2015 and muerth et al 2012 hence in this case raw rcm data can be considered useful unless overall characteristics of these data absolute values seasonality significantly differ from those of the observations in this case the rcm data might not be suitable for climate change impact assessment absolute values in ccs show less difference and are mostly of the same magnitude this applies at least for the mean and low flow indicators the bias correction depicts a stronger impact on the ccs for high flow indicators despite regional disparities in absolute quantities this holds true for other catchments of the hydrological bavaria that was analyzed for streamflow fig 12 emphasizes this result showing the ccs for the racmo rcm at the gauge kemmern the remo rcm shows significant deviations in the ccs across all indicators due to the correction of the inherent spatial drift of precipitation fields furthermore since only a single member was available a particular extreme event within this realization e g high precipitation event during spring affects the bias correction as well as the ccs the member bound derivation of correction factors i e deriving the factors using one member of a rcm only might result in a misleading adjustment for this specific season hence this may lead indirectly to a fraud of the ccs which could be avoided by a multi member approach if more realizations would have been available showing different seasonal values therefore this study shows that the application of bias corrected rcm data for hydrological modeling has an impact on the ccs of streamflow indicators derived for catchments situated in southern and northern bavaria catchment 5 and 18 fig 1 lower left map furthermore the impacts on the ccs of extreme high flow indicators can be severe up to or greater than 100 similar effects have been found by cloke et al 2013 over a catchment situated in england hence the applicability of bias correction approaches for extreme values is still questionable and further development should be made to account for extreme value

made in climate research to improve process understanding and advance computation power to allow for higher resolution dynamical regional climate models rcm kotlarski et al 2014 meanwhile a large number of rcm results have been made available to a growing user community showing a broad range of variability and bias christensen et al 2008 giorgi et al 2009 kotlarski et al 2014 van der linden and mitchell 2009 reasons for deviations from observations are manifold and encounter various sources of uncertainty such as errors in reference data sets ehret et al 2012 the spatio temporal scale gap between rcms and observations differences in model parameterizations e g for convection maraun et al 2010 the selection of sres emission scenarios sres nakicenovic 2000 or recently developed representative concentration pathways rcp van vuuren et al 2011 however affects the climate change signal for the future period rcm data is made freely available through various data bases ensembles

physical ecological and or socio economic aspects e g runoff regimes extreme discharge biodiversity water management hattermann et al 2014 lenderink et al 2007 majone et al 2012 stagl and hattermann 2015 however the increasing resolution of rcms is mostly still too coarse for smaller scale investigations in hydrology so additional downscaling techniques must be applied cloke et al 2013 besides this scale issue rcms often exhibit pronounced systematic deviations from any given reference period which are considered as bias ehret et al 2012 kotlarski et al 2014 maraun 2016 if large enough these biases can result in significantly and often non linearly different outputs from subsequent models e g for hydrological models chen et al 2011 which are usually calibrated against observations thus the bias between the observations and the models has to be removed before the data is applicable for impact models several methods have been developed for this purpose and are often critically discussed ehret et al 2012 maraun et al 2010 recent studies indicate that bias correction bc methods can have different effects on the distribution of any given parameter e g precipitation and can thus particularly impact its extreme values hagemann et al 2011 mudelsee et al 2010 the underlying principle and thus the most crucial assumption is that the bias correction factors retrieved by any such methods must necessarily be considered valid for the future assuming a temporal stationarity and thus introducing another yet often neglected source of uncertainty teutschbein and seibert 2012 hence it must be argued that bc methods might falsify the original climate change signal ccs of rcms with extreme values being stronger affected than means themeßl et al 2012 regarding the influence of the use of bias corrected data on hydrological modeling muerth et al 2012 point out that individual simulations with a strong inherent bias visibly affect the ccs of hydrological indicators the overall mean ccs of large rcm ensembles i e multiple member of a rcm driven by the same gcm with changing initial conditions however seem to be less sensitive to bc many studies investigated the removal of bias in rcms resulting in a myriad of methods and various performances for specific purposes e g maraun et al 2010 themeßl et al 2012 the study by muerth et al 2012 investigated the influence of bc on the representation of observed runoff the impact of cc on the runoff regime and the effect of bc on the future change in hydrological indicators over a single catchment in bavaria hagemann et al 2011 state that the hydrological ccs at certain locations and for specific seasons might be affected by the bc of raw gcm data this impact of bc on the ccs of hydrological indicators is also significant if outputs from corrected rcms are applied as a meteorological driver of hydrological models muerth et al 2012 cloke et al 2013 investigated the impact of bc on the ccs of extreme discharges for the upper severn catchment england and found that it is even stronger than for mean flows to further investigate this specific topic in the course of its routine operations in water resources management e g design of flood detention basins based on a threshold for extreme high flows the bavarian environment agency bayerisches landesamt für umwelt lfu requested to analyze the performance of three bias correction methods local intensity scaling quantile mapping linear scaling for multiple bavarian catchments in the framework of the bi klim 1 1 einfluss der biaskorrektur dynamischer regionaler klimamodelldaten auf die wasserhaushaltsmodellierung und klimafolgenabschätzung in bayerischen flussgebieten bi klim impact of bias correction of dynamic regional climate model data on water balance modeling and assessment of climate impacts for bavarian catchments project these specific bc approaches are chosen for being considered state of the art methods to adjust the systematic differences between rcm data and observations ehret et al 2012 hence the purpose of this study was a to determine the most sufficiently performing bias correction method as a standard approach for the bavarian domain see fig 1 upper left and b to quantify and evaluate the effects of bias correction on the ccs of specific hydrological indicators for river catchments located in bavaria germany this paper focuses on the effects of bias correction on the ccs of hydrological indicators the climate simulations ensemble for this study includes three different rcms the cosmo clm cclm 4 8 berg et al 2013 wagner et al 2013 of the karlsruhe institute of technology kit 2 2 institute of meteorology and climate research department troposphere research imk tro of the kit 2011

protection baden württemberg and water management and factory department rheinland pfalz the remo uba 3 3 max planck institute mpi under contract to the german federal environment agency 2006 and racmo v2 1 of the knmi van meijgaard et al 2008 all driven by the same global circulation model gcm echam5 roeckner et al 2003 further referred to as cclm remo racmo the hydrological model wasim schulla 2012 was applied to determine the impacts of bc to the ccs in the hydrology of several selected bavarian catchments the performance of bc methods is evaluated by comparing long term flow regimes as well as specific flow indicators resulting from the hydrological modeling a reference data set of observed data was set up at the beginning of the project this dataset is further used as the observational reference for hydrological modeling and bias correction the effects of bc on the ccs of the catchment s hydrology are investigated using the same hydrological indicators 2 study area data and methods 2 1 study area the study area covers the major bavarian river basins including their headwaters in southern germany and partly adjoining states austria to the south czech republic to the east furtherly referred to as hydrological bavaria it comprises 18 hydrological catchments modeled separately with the water balance simulation model wasim schulla 2012 at the lfu as illustrated in fig 1 left furthermore this figure shows the surrounding domain upper left blue box used for the bias correction of the rcm data for the bavarian catchments lower left the following sections will focus on catchment 5 representing the iller lech river system and parts of the danube in particular results are shown for the mindel river sub basin up to the gauge offingen fig 1 right red outline covering an area of about 929 km² since it represents a relatively pristine basin with only limited effects from water management infrastructure other catchments lech river to the east or iller river to the west are heavily impacted by artificial reservoirs and dams which imposes additional challenges on the hydrological modeling outside the scope of this study this sub basin is characterized by pre alpine topography showing a s n gradient from the gauge in the north at 440 m a s l to the highest peak in the south at 860 m a s l the long term precipitation sums follow this gradient ranging from 1100 mm in the southern part to 750 mm in the north mean temperatures range from 1 c january to about 18 c august and the mean annual evapotranspiration is around 570 mm with a mean flow of 12 2 m³ s ranging from 11 5 m³ s in the summer to 12 9 m³ s in winter the overall annual runoff variation in this pluvio nival flow regime remains quite small 2 2 data the data for this study is provided by the lfu covering the 18 catchments and including measured values from stream gauges and meteorological stations as well as grid based meteorological data performing bias correction requires a meteorological reference to compute the change factors based on a distribution function or simple deltas for the modification of the rcm values here a reference data set based on a regular grid was created by combining meteorological data from different sources table 1 for different regions fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of the different data sources and types for the climatological variables with station values covering the danube tributaries to the south and hyras raster covering the northern tributaries as well as the main catchment except for air humidity h in two northern catchments wind speed w and radiation r are interpolated from station measurements for the entire hydrological bavaria all meteorological data are available on a daily basis the adjacent grids of each region of are spatially merged for each time step in combination both data sets provide a regular grid at the resolution of the hydrological model of 1 x 1 km² covering the entire bavarian domain the different data sets hyras and interpolated station data exhibit patterns due to the different development schemes hence the danube catchments show a more pronounced topographical pattern while the main catchment shows a more diffuse picture the sharp transition between the regions might influence results of affected catchments however the different schemes have no impact on the findings shown in this study the different sources of meteorological data are applied to the respective hydrological model for the catchments of fig 1 the reference period for this study covers the period from 1971 to 2000 this period was chosen since meteorological data was available in sufficient spatial and temporal coverage the presented investigation on the impacts of bias correction on ccs is based on data from three different rcms all using echam5 as the driving gcm two were provided by the lfu the cclm and remo these rcms are frequently used in other climate change related projects funded by the lfu e g kliwa adaptalp climchalp since their high spatial resolution is considered to be advantageous for applications in high relief terrain as bavaria especially over the alps in order to show the performance of bc on a coarse resolution model the racmo rcm with a spatial resolution of 50 km was applied in this study the respective characteristics of each rcm are given in table 2 the driving gcm and its members i e gcm runs with slightly altered initial conditions are the same for all three rcms hence the differences in the results using the different rcm ensembles cclm racmo remo originate from the differences in the rcm configurations e g resolution domain size however as with the gcm members variations between rcm members originate from their respective initial conditions in contrast to racmo and cclm with three members each there is only one member available for the remo rcm furthermore the remo precipitation shows a shift in precipitation fields in mountainous areas due to luv and lee effects a minor precipitation event from clouds at 3000 m altitude might be shifted by up to 15 km if affected by wind speeds up to 10 m s göttel 2009 this spatial offset has to be considered in all further analysis table 3 illustrates the long term yearly mean values of the different meteorological variables of the reference data set and the raw rcms as well as their respective absolute and relative biases the biases are considerable especially for temperature and precipitation of all cclm members and for temperature of the remo rcm also precipitation biases for the racmo rcm are significant 10 wind speed global radiation and relative air humidity also exhibit strong relative biases however their absolute deviations are rather small a proper correction of the bias of precipitation and air temperature is most important to allow hydrological models to produce reasonable outputs however since the hydrological model applied in this study requires all the above mentioned variables they are also corrected for a better representation of the observed values 2 3 methods for the purpose of analyzing the influence of the bias correction on the climate change signal a model chain was introduced fig 3 with the bi klim data base as central component this data base includes all the pre and post processed rcm data raw scaled and bias corrected the bias correction is conducted at rcm resolution thus a spatial aggregation of the reference data set to the rcm scale was performed after bias correction the rcm data was further downscaled to the hydrological model grid applying the scaling tool scalmet marke 2008 the influence of the bias correction on the climate change signal of the hydrological regimes was analyzed by applying all available raw and preprocessed data to the hydrological model wasim for the mindel sub basin within the iller lech catchment 2 3 1 bias correction methods rcm data usually display a statistical mismatch to recorded meteorological variables a bias in order to make the data better applicable and acceptable for users various methods have been developed to correct such biases via transformation algorithms to statistically match the observations a good overview of the various available approaches for bias correction is given by teutschbein and seibert 2012 the usual methods share the assumption that the retrieved correction factors and addendums are considered stationary in space and time thus they are taken to be valid for the reference and the scenario period as well this assumption is not challenged here as the paper is focused on assessing the impacts of this common practice a common shortcoming of dynamic rcm data is the overestimation of the number of days with very little precipitation teutschbein and seibert 2012 this problem refers to the size of the raster cells of a rcm in combination with the convection of moist air as the moist air reaches full saturation at a certain height with decreasing temperature it will induce rainfall for a large area within a rcm this process is further referred to as the drizzle effect dai 2006 dai 2006 also points out that this area wide drizzle would not occur under natural conditions due to atmospheric instabilities and refers this effect to the model scale consequently this particular portion of the rcm precipitation has to be removed in advance of the bias correction to avoid its influence on the modification factors kjellström et al 2010 tested several thresholds for a minimum precipitation amount for handling the drizzle effect and found 1 mm day to be a good value to remove excess drizzle precipitation from model data values up to this threshold do not significantly contribute to overall precipitation sums dai 2001 thus this approach was applied for the elimination of the drizzle for all available rcm data in this study in contrast to the variability between the different rcms the changes in initial conditions of the driving gcm for the three members of the cclm and racmo induce an internal variability between these members of the particular rcm which can be considered as natural variability elía and côté 2010 muerth et al 2012 to maintain this variability between the members of the cclm and racmo rcm a multi member bias correction was performed here a single set of correction factors is derived using the statistics of all the three respective members of the rcm muerth et al 2012 instead of one set for each of the members this allows for ascribing the differences in the annual course to the respective member of these small rcm ensembles furthermore this ensures that a measure for the natural climate variability is maintained as mentioned above for this study we used three different methods for bias correction which are briefly described here the correction factors are calculated on a monthly 1 factor per month as well as on a yearly one factor per year basis additionally the multi member approach is applied to either of the sets of correction factors furthermore values of relative air humidity are corrected in terms of dew point temperature applying the magnus formula for conversion since air temperature is required for the transformation a good match between those two variables is maintained 2 3 1 1 linear scaling ls linear scaling is applied according to lenderink et al 2007 with slight changes regarding the long term averages for this approach we used the additive air temperature c 1 or multiplicative precipitation 2 differences between the monthly yearly averages of the reference and the rcm data for the reference period similar to teutschbein and seibert 2012 the resulting correction factors are then applied to each daily t value of the entire time series of the rcm by addition or multiplication depending on the climate parameter to be corrected 1 t r c m c o r t t r c m t t o b s t r c m 2 p r c m c o r t p r c m t p o b s p r c m the multiplicative approach also applies for the parameters wind speed and global radiation since these parameters have an absolute zero value like precipitation whereas for air humidity the additive approach is used 2 3 1 2 quantile mapping qm the quantile mapping approach attempts to adjust the distribution function of values of the rcm to match the distribution function of observed values for the reference period sennikovs and bethers 2009 teutschbein and seibert 2012 thus the correction factors depend directly on the values of both time series this study uses a modified empirical quantile mapping approach based on an daily translation after mpelasoka and chiew 2009 apart from the usual multiplicative correction factors the adapted approach of this study also provides additive factors to adjust temperature and relative air humidity via dew point temperature the distribution function for rcm and observed values is created by a division of the values using percentiles in a first step the values of each percentile i with i 2k 1 k 0 49 for both time series observations and raw model data are defined if the percentile is in between two values of a time series a weighted mean will be calculated the second step performs a cubic interpolation of the predefined percentile values to n percentiles in order to prevent sharp edges between percentiles the cubic interpolation to represent the fitting of the 50 percentile points is preferred over a linear interpolation in this study the number n of percentiles can be altered and typically ranges between 0 and 100 for this investigation a value of 50 was chosen as this number was considered to sufficiently represent the distribution since every value of the time series is affected by the correction also extreme values will be adjusted those new extreme values are achieved by an extrapolation of the percentile values 99 and 1 for the corrected model time series this allows for the calculation of correction factors for the lowermost and uppermost percentile in the last step the n percentiles are derived from the time series to be corrected this also applies for the raw model time series for the future period hence there are n values of the time series to be corrected and n correction factors for the respective percentiles afterwards the correction factors closest to the respective percentile are assigned to the values of the original rcm time series all these steps also apply for time series of single months which leads to 12n correction values 2 3 1 3 local intensity scaling loci the local intensity scaling method schmidli et al 2006 only applies for precipitation values this approach is based on a scaling factor depending on wet day intensities 3 and a wet day threshold wdt derived from the wet day frequency of daily observed pobs and model data prcm 3 s p o b s p o b s p o b s w d t p o b s w d t p r c m p r c m p r c m w d t p r c m w d t the corrected time series is then calculated as follows 4 p r c m c o r m a x p o b s w d t s p r c m t p r c m w d t 0 after the bias correction the new model data by definition have the same wet day frequency and intensity as the observed time series schmidli et al 2006 however the overall precipitation sums may differ as for this method only the targeted statistics will match the statistics derived from the observation values muerth et al 2012 in order to draw conclusions about the effects of this approach the remaining parameters are corrected with the qm method 2 3 2 the hydrological model wasim the water balance simulation model wasim was employed to perform the hydrological modeling wasim is characterized as a distributed grid based regular irregular mainly physically based deterministic type of model using constant time steps with internally flexible sub time steps schulla 2012 it is frequently applied for various climate change impact studies foltyn et al 2017 kleinn et al 2005 rößler and löffler 2010 or for the analysis on the need for bias correction e g muerth et al 2012 in this study we applied existing calibrated and validated configurations of wasim for the catchments of the hydrological bavaria and the following results focus on the results for the mindel sub basin gauge offingen calculated using the model setup for the iller lech river system catchment 5 fig 1 the model was set up in 1 km spatial resolution and a daily time step and the parameters were derived for the calibration period from 1994 to 1998 and validated for the consecutive period between 1998 and 2003 these time slices were chosen since the number of available meteorological input data was larger the authors of the model udata pöhler et al 2009 evaluated the modeled discharge fit by the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 for raw nse and logarithmic lognse model outputs furthermore a long term simulation run from 1971 to 2003 was evaluated to test the overall model performance including years with less available input data the results for the different modeling periods table 4 for the mindel catchment show a fairly good representation of the observed runoff by the model nse 0 5 and lognse 0 65 the lack of available input data might influence the performance of the long term simulation 3 results 3 1 bias correction results the hydrological model for the iller lech catchment is driven by the observed data reference data set as well as by the raw and corrected data of the dynamical rcms the modeled runoff obtained from driving the model with the reference data set forms the basis to assess the influence of the different bias correction methods for the different hydrological model outputs a codification for the composition of the different rcm and bias correction methods is given in table 5 the long term flow regimes for the reference period between 1971 and 2000 shown in fig 4 illustrate the more or less distinct differences between the model runs using observed data obs and those using the raw rcm data downscaled to the hydrological model resolution while the regimes of the racmo model mainly differ from the reference during the winter months the results using the cclm model overestimate the reference by almost 100 throughout all seasons due to significantly higher modeled precipitation the runoff produced by the remo model data however underestimates the reference entirely regarding the weak seasonal course the modeled regimes of the cclm and remo data show higher similarity to the reference furthermore fig 4 shows the inter annual variability of the simulations using raw rcm datasets colored boxplots compared to the variability of the model run produced with observed data transparent box plot since there is no overlap between the upper or lower quantiles of simulations results of raw rcm data these models differ significantly from each other however the variability of the racmo model simulations is similar to the variability of the results using observed data since the notches of both boxplots as well as the median exhibit a good agreement the variability of modeled results using raw cclm and remo rcms in contrast differs significantly from the reference regime fig 5 shows the results of the hydrological modeling using the bias corrected rcm data bc1 for the bias corrected racmo data using monthly correction factors the results of the hydrological modeling are best for the 2nd member 7 5 qm m m2 8 for other members and bc methods see table 6 showing only minor differences of about 2 m³ s 2 m³ s for other members and bc methods e g 4m³ s in spring of m1 during the summer and fall season in general while the regimes produced by monthly corrected racmo data systematically underestimate the observations 4 m³ s to 2 m³ s throughout the year the results with annual correction coefficients exhibit an overestimation in winter 1 m³ s to 5 m³ s and underestimation in summer up to 5 m³ s in august the flow regimes of the cclm as well as remo model show good adjustment especially for member 2 and 3 of the cclm with only minor differences regarding those produced with monthly correction factors despite the huge deviation of the raw cclm data the bias correction is able to satisfactorily reproduce the observed runoff the results using yearly correction factors depict that the seasonal course of the results produced by raw rcm data is maintained in the corrected data however the correction leads to a shift of the respective regime to a slightly lower level in most cases this results in a slightly higher deviation from the observed data compared to the bc1 data based on monthly values the relative overall differences between the reference regime and those generated by the corrected rcm data given in table 6 show that best adjustment is gained by the models cclm member 2 and 3 as well as remo this is due to the finer resolution and an already better representation of the seasonal course in the raw data furthermore these values illustrate that in most cases qm leads to the best adjustment the differences of this approach are in most cases considerably lower e g racmo m1 qm m 9 4 locy y 16 1 furthermore yearly correction factors yield greater deviations for almost all rcms also the internal variations between the members of the cclm and racmo seem to be maintained by the multi member correction approach the single set of correction factors for the remo rcm however does not produce better results compared to the multi member approach since the differences are comparable to those of the cclm and racmo e g remo qm m 6 8 to racmo qm m 7 5 3 2 changes in hydrological signals the changes in hydrological signals are analyzed for the near future scenario period ranging from 2021 to 2050 since data for the cclm rcm is only available for this period to determine the effects of bias correction of rcm data on the hydrological ccs we applied eight different flow indicators as described in table 7 the extreme value statistics of the low and high flow indicators of a certain return period are based on the pearson iii distribution dvwk 1979 1983 the flow indicators for the reference period 1971 2000 show good agreement with observations for the hydrological data produced by bias corrected rcm time series in terms of mean flow low flow and mean high flows compared to the reference ref however the extreme high flow indicators show greater deviations fig 6 exemplarily illustrates this behavior for the racmo rcm and is representative for the results of the cclm and remo rcm as well whereas inter member differences are very small for mf lf mlf 7lf2 mhf and hf2 the hf and hf100 depict significant variations between the different correction methods these distinct differences in hf and hf100 for the various bc methods originate from their statistical characteristics the hf index represents the highest runoff value of a chosen period e g 30 years hence the runoff simulations using bc data might not capture this specific value since the driving bc meteorology is possibly lacking a proper representation of extreme values the hf100 is a statistical extrapolation based on yearly hf events of a certain period thus the insufficient representation of hf values when using the bc meteorology directly affects the hf100 values hf2 on the other hand is based on annual hf events in this case an extrapolation is obsolete since the available runoff time series are sufficiently long e g 30 years fig 7 shows the ccs for the different seasons djf mam jja son of the raw and corrected rcms the different seasons exhibit various changes in the signal the internal variability between the members of the cclm and racmo rcms is visible and maintained by the applied correction methods a warm and moist signal remains warm and moist signals in summer jja are rather small for the remo rcm while in winter and spring they are larger for all rcms apart from cclm m1 and m3 and racmo m1 and m3 for qm m the ccs of bc1 data for the winter period show little deviations from the bc0 signal this is also visible for the other seasons and the cclm and racmo model for almost all bc methods greater deviations in ccs between bc0 and bc1 data are present in the spring and fall season the shift in precipitation fields as described earlier might be accountable for this larger change in signals by the various rcm methods since this shift is adjusted by the correction as well the following graphs fig 8 10 show the results of the ccs analysis for streamflow while the bars illustrate the relative change signal i e relative difference between reference and future scenario on rcm to rcm basis of the flow indicators the numbers below represent their respective absolute values m³ s it should be mentioned that the relative change signals might indicate a more severe change than the absolute value actually provides for this is obviously pronounced for the low flow indicators for the racmo and cclm rcms the change signals of all three members are illustrated member 1 red member 2 blue member 3 green the solid bar represents the raw rcm bc0 inherent climate change signal ccs the shaded bar the induced changes according to the bias corrected model data fig 8 illustrates the changes in the ccs of the original rcm and bias corrected model data for racmo the mean flow shows little to no difference between the change signals throughout all members regarding the absolute values except for member 2 and 3 qm m values which is ascribed to a strong wet signal in winter see fig 7 as well as the relative signals thus in this case bias correction does not contribute to uncertainty in long term water balance assessments changes in mean flows under new climate conditions since the ccs is not affected by the corrected data considering the lf only member 1 and 2 show differences between the ccs of bc0 and bc1 relative and absolute absolute and relative values of member 3 vary around the same magnitude furthermore the lf depicts that natural variability between the three members is conserved by the multi member bias correction approach with the 2nd member showing a negative signal whereas the other two members deviate positively the absolute and relative ccs of the other low flow indicators mlf 7lf2 vary just slightly since the absolute ccs values are close to zero the shift in direction may be neglected the high flow indicators however show more distinct differences between the bc0 raw rcm ccs and those produced using bias corrected data the mhf exhibits the least distinctive absolute and relative deviations as well as the hf2 furthermore the different methods lead to large differences between bc0 ccs and bc1 ccs which holds especially for the 3rd member of the hf indicator here the relative bc0 ccs is below 20 but the bc1 ccs of the loci methods are 5 and greater 50 respectively the absolute value of the loci y method exceeds the bc0 value by over 100 19 5 m³ s bc0 to 47 8 m³ s loci y in contrast to the low flow indicators the shift in ccs direction within a member is more severe regarding the hf100 member 1 ls m shows a decrease by 32 2 m³ s whereas the bc0 displays a slight increase of 4 9 m³ s the differences in ccs of the flow indicators are more pronounced for the cclm model results fig 9 the mf shows varying relative changes of the ccs which is a direct response to the input data for all seasons see fig 7 but the absolute values differ only very little compared to the racmo model the absolute differences of the ccs for the low flow indicators between the bc1 and bc0 are higher for cclm data only the 3rd member using the monthly adjustment factors shows similarities to the raw rcm however the absolute changes are very small again the high flow indicators show major differences in ccs between the bc1 and bc0 values for both relative and absolute numbers these changes are less severe for the mhf and in some cases for the hf2 however the bc1 data in most cases overestimate the ccs of hf and hf100 for the members 1 and 2 by up to 145 hf bc1 m1 loci y 54 1 m³ s bc0 m1 3 7 m³ s and underestimate the ccs for the 3rd member the remo model data induce the most severe changes in ccs of the flow indicators between the original rcm and the bc1 results fig 10 here almost every indicator switches from a negative signal in bc0 to a positive in bc1 or vice versa except for the mhf while the bc0 data depict a reduction in mf and all low flow indicators the bc1 data mostly show a slight increase the ccs of the hf and the hf100 indicator exhibit considerable differences between bc0 and bc1 data while the raw rcm data for these indicators depict an increase of less than 20 the bias corrected data reveal a significant decrease between about 30 hf100 qm m and over 50 hf ls y as mentioned in section 2 2 the bc0 remo inherent spatial offset of precipitation fields might influence the ccs all bias correction methods remove this shift from the bc0 data 4 conclusions and discussion the results of the hydrological modeling using the bc0 rcm data clarify the indispensable need for bias correction for climate impact studies if the results significantly differ from observations and data are applied for subsequent hydrological applications e g water management the long term yearly flow regimes of the cclm and remo differ from the reference however apart from the winter season the raw racmo model shows a good regime representation for the mindel catchment the different correction approaches account for good adjustment of the modeled runoff to the reference of observed data when applied to raw cclm and remo data the regime simulated using the modified racmo data on the other hand are at least comparable to the results using the raw data in general while in northern bavaria the available models fit their respective reference equally well after correction exemplarily shown in fig 11 for the gauge kemmern outlet of catchment 18 lower left map of fig 1 the racmo model shows some greater differences in adjustment after the correction in the southern part of bavaria since the bias correction is performed on the rcm scale using the spatially aggregated reference data localized small scale events within aggregation are also averaged and smoothed hence this aggregation to the coarse rcm model resolution of 50 km is considered to be the major source for the partly huge deviations especially in distinctive topography like the alps considering the uncertainties added by applying bias correction to raw rcm data e g by losing coherence between variables assumption of temporal stationarity of correction factors discrepancy in scales between rcm and observations and the little effect it has on the racmo data the raw data might also be useful however judging from the indicators the qm approach using monthly correction factors shows the best results and thus supports earlier suggestions by themeßl et al 2011 high flow indicators are an exception which was also found by muerth et al 2012 however it should be mentioned that the applied hydrological model wasim is not specifically calibrated for high flows thus this must influence rare and single extreme high flow events like the hf and hf100 combined with the bc1 rcms a sufficient match with the reference can hardly be achieved and might occur randomly such flood extremes are usually triggered by extreme precipitation events at the far end of the cumulative distribution function or the highest percentiles of occurrence for which the correction factors may only be able to provide insufficient approximations in conclusion this study confirms that the qm approach applied to all meteorological variables results in a better representation of mean streamflow indicators across bavaria than the other two investigated methods regarding extreme flow indicators hf hf100 these methods are still not able to reproduce the statistics of the observations at the upper end of the distribution for any bavarian region however if extreme flow indicators are of particular interest e g if a flood detention basin should be designed to store runoff up to a certain hf threshold and other indicators e g mean flow are well represented by raw rcm data hattermann et al 2014 suggest to correct discharge values by their return periods using extreme value statistics the analysis for the gauge offingen also shows that the bias correction of rcm data affects the ccs of hydrological indicators to an extent that may not be negligible for subsequent applications e g hydrological modelling water management or the design flood protection infrastructure differences in the relative ccs of mean flow indicators between raw and corrected data are small in most cases the relative signals of bc1 low flow indicators show more severe deviations from the reference signal of the bc0 rcm data this effect of bias correction on the ccs of mean indicators is also shown by stagl and hattermann 2015 and muerth et al 2012 hence in this case raw rcm data can be considered useful unless overall characteristics of these data absolute values seasonality significantly differ from those of the observations in this case the rcm data might not be suitable for climate change impact assessment absolute values in ccs show less difference and are mostly of the same magnitude this applies at least for the mean and low flow indicators the bias correction depicts a stronger impact on the ccs for high flow indicators despite regional disparities in absolute quantities this holds true for other catchments of the hydrological bavaria that was analyzed for streamflow fig 12 emphasizes this result showing the ccs for the racmo rcm at the gauge kemmern the remo rcm shows significant deviations in the ccs across all indicators due to the correction of the inherent spatial drift of precipitation fields furthermore since only a single member was available a particular extreme event within this realization e g high precipitation event during spring affects the bias correction as well as the ccs the member bound derivation of correction factors i e deriving the factors using one member of a rcm only might result in a misleading adjustment for this specific season hence this may lead indirectly to a fraud of the ccs which could be avoided by a multi member approach if more realizations would have been available showing different seasonal values therefore this study shows that the application of bias corrected rcm data for hydrological modeling has an impact on the ccs of streamflow indicators derived for catchments situated in southern and northern bavaria catchment 5 and 18 fig 1 lower left map furthermore the impacts on the ccs of extreme high flow indicators can be severe up to or greater than 100 similar effects have been found by cloke et al 2013 over a catchment situated in england hence the applicability of bias correction approaches for extreme values is still questionable and further development should be made to account for extreme value

8479,study region eight u s states bordering the north american laurentian great lakes study focus variable infiltration capacity vic model simulations based on data from an ensemble of atmospheric ocean general circulation models aogcms used for the intergovernmental panel on climate change s ipcc s fifth assessment report ar5 were used to quantify potential climate change impacts on winter weather and hydrology in the study region and understand implications for its tourism sector new hydrologic insights for the region by the 2080s climate change could result in winters that are shorter by over a month reductions of over a month in days with snow depths required for many kinds of winter recreation declines in average holiday snow depths of 50 percent or more and reductions in the percent area of the study region that would be considered viable for winter tourism from about 22 percent to 0 3 percent days with temperatures suitable for artificial snowmaking decline to less than a month annually making it potentially less feasible as an adaptation strategy all of the region s current ski resorts are operating in areas that will become non viable for winter tourism businesses under a high emissions scenario given the economic importance of the winter tourism industry in the study region businesses and communities should consider climate change and potential adaptation strategies in their future planning and overall decision making keywords tourism winter weather climate change cmip5 vic model 1 introduction cold season hydrologic processes play an important role in shaping the physical behavior of north america s laurentian great lakes low air temperatures have a significant impact on the formation and break up of lake ice and subsequently lake dynamics in warmer months of the year mishra et al 2011b frozen soils and seasonal freeze thaw patterns affect infiltration soil properties and overall land energy balances cherkauer and lettenmaier 1999 lemke et al 2007 seasonal snowpack plays an important role in surface energy and water budgets soil temperatures surface albedo and evapotranspiration cohen and rind 1991 dyer and mote 2006 karl et al 1993 mortsch et al 2000 rodell and houser 2004 sinha and cherkauer 2008 snowpack and snowmelt runoff also affect seasonal streamflow behavior including peak streamflow during the spring and the development and replenishment of lakes and wetlands in the region mishra and cherkauer 2011 cold weather phenomena are also important to many economic sectors in the great lakes especially tourism winter tourism is highly dependent on temperature snow cover snowfall length of the snow season and the presence or absence of snow during winter holidays in recent years desirable conditions for winter tourism are perceived to have become less reliable by great lakes tourism professionals chin 2016 previous research has also shown that tourism business owners are already adapting to changing conditions for example by offering snowshoes in lieu of cross country skiing and adopting snowmaking to account for reductions in snowfall and snowpack burakowski and magnusson 2012 chin 2016 scott et al 2008 quantitative hydrologic analyses support tourism stakeholders perceptions that winter weather has become less suitable for winter recreation in recent decades average winter and spring temperatures have both been increasing in the great lakes region while seasonally frozen ground has been decreasing over the last century especially in the spring mortsch et al 2000 sinha and cherkauer 2008 similarly the last spring freeze has shifted earlier in the year leading to shorter winter seasons pryor 2013 pryor et al 2014 the great lakes has also been experiencing shifts in precipitation from snow to rain earlier annual snowmelt and reductions in spring snow cover brown 2000 brown and goodison 1996 dyer and mote 2006 hodgkins et al 2007 several studies have been conducted to determine how winter weather has changed in recent decades brown and braaten 1998 examined changes in monthly snow depth and snow cover duration in canada and found that both had decreased from 1946 to 1995 especially in march mote et al 2005 found in their study evidence of declines in winter snowpack for western north america from 1916 2002 durand et al 2009 looked at daily snow depth the number of days with snow on the ground the maximum continuous time period with snow coverage and minimum 100 day snow depths in the french alps from the late 1950 s to early 2000s and found a decreasing trend in snow coverage at low elevations though this was not the case for medium to high elevations similarly hendrikx et al 2012 investigated potential changes in mean peak snow water equivalent swe snow duration fraction of precipitation as snow and average maximum swe in new zealand using output from atmospheric ocean general circulation models aogcms and found decreases in snow coverage at low elevations and in a few cases marginal increases at very high elevations in addition the intergovernmental panel on climate change s ipcc s fifth assessment report ar5 states that both cold temperature extremes and the amount of snow and ice have been decreasing globally since 1950 and are likely to continue to do so with future climate change ipcc 2014 mote et al 2005 future climate change projections for the great lakes region support the conclusion that changes to its winter weather and hydrology will continue and intensify byun and hamlet 2018 winkler et al 2014 temperatures are expected to continue to increase leading to reductions in cold spells and extremely cold days and further shortening winters hayhoe and wubbles 2007 wuebbles et al 2010 increasing temperatures could also affect river and lake ice thickness and break up bates et al 2008 karl et al 1993 predict that decreases in snow cover could come in future decades as a result of temperature increases despite some past findings that total annual snowfall will remain relatively steady hayhoe and wuebbles 2007 the redistribution of precipitation as rain versus snow could lead to higher runoff and increased flooding in the region byun et al in review hayhoe et al 2010 karl et al 1993 mortsch et al 2000 rosenzweig et al 2002 in terms of how these changes will affect winter tourism specifically scott et al 2006 2003 scott and mcboyle 2007 used a snow model coupled with the variable infiltration capacity vic model to look at changes in snow depths appropriate for skiing and snowmobiling in the northeastern united states and canada using climate projections from three different aogcms for two emissions scenarios they found the potential for significant losses for the ski and snowmobiling industries due to declines in seasonal snowpack though artificial snowmaking reduced some of this vulnerability studies by durand et al 2009 and hendrikx et al 2012 also indicate the potential for economic losses specifically for downhill ski resorts due to decreases in snow cover duration and the amount of snow cover at elevations where these businesses typically operate wobus et al 2017 recently quantified potential losses for winter recreation due to climate change as being in the hundreds of millions of dollars across the united states overall these findings suggest that without adaptation winter based tourism businesses could face significant losses or even failure due to future climate change impacts on great lakes winter weather and hydrology while artificial snowmaking might mitigate some decreases in snow reliability it is a strategy that is very resource intensive both financially and in terms of water use rixen et al 2011 steiger and mayer 2008 in addition research indicates that tourists acceptance of artificial snowmaking is equivocal pütz et al 2011 technological advances will also likely be needed for snowmaking to be effective in the future due to current limitations on temperatures for snowmaking usually below 2 c wobus et al 2017 subsequently alternative strategies need to also be considered in discussions about climate change preparedness these findings also support the argument that winter tourism businesses need to be proactively preparing for potential changes in future cold and snow conditions in a way that takes into account a number of competing interests regional scale analyses of future climate projections related to winter weather can assist with these efforts this work builds on existing analyses by considering how climate change could impact winter weather and hydrology important to tourism for the u s portion of the north american laurentian great lakes region statistically downscaled climatic data from aogcms which constitute ipcc ar5 have been used to run vic model simulations of snow processes for this analysis the overall objective of this study is to produce detailed information about potential climate change impacts on winter weather and hydrologic response in the great lakes that is directly relevant to winter recreation and tourism and that can be used to help tourism managers think about climate change and adaptation strategies for the future in summary the following research questions are being considered 1 how will climate change affect winter conditions in the great lakes through the end of the century 2 how could changes in winter processes affect winter recreation and tourism in the region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the north american laurentian great lakes system is the largest freshwater system on earth containing about 20 percent of the global freshwater supply grannemann and reeves 2005 it is made up of five hydrologically connected lakes erie huron michigan ontario and superior with a cumulative volume of roughly 22 quadrillion liters mcbean and motiee 2008 and a drainage area of 770 000 square km croley 1990 the great lakes are bordered by eight u s states and one canadian province across the great lakes region average annual precipitation ranges from about 680 to 1190 mm and average temperature ranges from about 13 to 1 c in january and 17 to 23 c in july hodgkins et al 2007 winter tourism added over 3 5 billion to great lakes states economies during the 2009 2010 season burakowski and magnusson 2012 the total gross annual revenue of downhill skiing and snowboarding areas in great lakes states is estimated at about 1 6 billion national ski areas association 2016 snowmobiling adds about 800 million annually to michigan s economy alone stoddard 2017 snowshoeing snowboarding and ice fishing are also popular forms of winter recreation overall winter tourism provided close to 63 000 jobs in great lakes states during the 2009 2010 season burakowski and magnusson 2012 2 2 the variable infiltration capacity vic model the vic model is a land surface hydrology model that can be used to simulate water and energy balances for large watersheds as well as streamflow when paired with a routing model gao et al 2009 liang et al 1996 1994 lohmann et al 1996 wood et al 1992 typically the vic model is set up to run based on gridded locations calculating a wide variety of output variables for each cell at the designated time step based on climate soil and vegetation input data the vic model assumes that at the macro scale vertical transfers are more important than horizontal transfers in determining water and energy balances at each location at a large spatial scale so each grid cell is simulated individually daily meteorological data is provided to the vic model for at least daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperature and average wind speed for each grid cell which was the time step used for the simulations in this study the model is also able to handle sub daily meteorological information and the energy balance snow model is typically as here run at an hourly time step andreadis et al 2009 in this study output from a series of vic model simulations was used to quantify changes in cold processes and determine the potential impacts of climate change on winter weather in the great lakes the vic model determines changes in snow conditions using the energy balance for each individual grid cell snowpack is represented using a two layer scheme with energy exchange occurring only at the surface andreadis et al 2009 gao et al 2009 for these simulations changes in the density of snowpack were calculated based an algorithm developed from typical monthly snow density measurements bras 1990 while snow albedo was determined according to a u s army corps of engineers algorithm gao et al 2009 minimum 0 5 c and maximum temperature 2 c thresholds for rain and snow respectively determine the form in which precipitation falls the vic model has been used in several different studies to examine cold processes in the great lakes especially its western region sinha et al 2010 used the vic model to examine the effects of historical climate variability on soil frost soil temperature and snow water equivalent in the great lakes while mishra et al 2011a and mishra et al 2011b used the vic model to examine historical trends in lake ice phenology mishra and cherkauer 2011 also used the vic model to consider the role of cold season climate extremes and variability on the inundation extent of lakes and wetlands based on historical trends for this study the vic model was set up to include u s states around the great lakes at a 1 16 grid cell resolution fig 1 three soil layers were defined for this iteration of the model with soil properties for each grid cell being extracted from the 1998 conus soil dataset livneh et al 2014 miller and white 1998 a total of eleven land cover types were defined for the model simulations land cover fractions for each grid cell were determined using data from nasa s moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis with the international geosphere biosphere programme s igbp s global vegetation classification scheme as measured in 2000 hansen et al 2000 livneh et al 2014 2 3 selection of vic model climate forcing data climate data from the world climate research programme s coupled model intercomparison program phase 5 cmip5 was used to run vic model simulations for this study the cmip5 dataset is comprised of an ensemble of climate models produced through a coordinated effort by research groups around the world with the aim of meeting the most major priorities of user communities see taylor et al 2012 for additional details output from an ensemble of cmip5 model runs was statistically downscaled using the hybrid delta hd method hamlet et al 2013 as described in byun and hamlet 2018 and used to analyze climate change impacts for the study region regridded historical daily precipitation maximum surface air temperature and minimum surface air temperature measurements covering the united states portion of the great lakes region for 1915 2013 were adjusted based on monthly temperature and precipitation averages calculated from the ensemble of cmip5 model runs byun and hamlet 2018 chiu et al in review the full set of aogcms used which were selected based on satisfactory representation of historical midwest climate and to include models that best represent the central tendency and outermost range of possible climate futures is shown in table 1 the daily wind data used is based on daily climatology pre 1950 and national center for atmospheric research ncar reanalysis simulations post 1950 chiu et al in review two representative concentration pathways rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 were analyzed to understand the effects of medium low and high levels of carbon dioxide concentrations byun and hamlet 2018 moss et al 2010 extensive calibration and validation of the model in terms of its simulation of cold and snow processes was outside the scope of this study however the model has been evaluated based on its ability to simulate streamflow in 40 different watersheds chiu et al in review as part of this analysis a gauge undercatch correction was applied to the meteorological forcing data because of apparent issues with snowfall measurements resulting in good model performance in general the vic model has been shown to do well at simulating snow andreadis et al 2009 2 4 selection of metrics a review of existing literature determined the metrics used to evaluate the potential impacts of climate change on winter weather and hydrology and associated impacts on the tourism sector for this study based on work by the ccl clivar jcomm expert team et on climate change detection and indices etccdi zhang 2013 length of winter or the number of days between the first and last occurrence of at least 6 days with a daily average temperature of less than 5 c was selected as one of the metrics cold days or the number of days where the maximum daily temperature is below 5 c was also used to further explore how winter weather might change in the future additional metrics were determined based on a review of existing studies looking specifically at climate change and winter tourism scott et al 2008 defined favorable conditions for downhill skiing as a snow depth of 30 cm and for snowmobiling as a snow depth of 15 cm with a maximum daily temperature of less than 15 c and a 2 day precipitation total of less than 20 mm kundzewicz et al 2008 on the other hand defined appropriate snow depths for snowboarding as 30 cm and for downhill skiing as 40 cm here the kundzewicz et al metric 40 cm was used to look at days for downhill skiing because scott et al included snowmaking in their analysis snowmaking has not been incorporated into the vic model simulations completed for this work so metrics accounting for it were deemed inappropriate for this application however the number of days with temperatures required for artificial snowmaking i e the number of days where the maximum daily temperature is less than 2 c was used to determine how climate change could affect the ability of winter tourism businesses to use this practice in the future wobus et al 2017 a snow depth of 15 cm was used to determine the number of days appropriate for snowmobiling this depth also reflects the number of days that would be conducive to other types of winter recreation like snowshoeing and cross county skiing finally three additional criteria were used to evaluate climate change impacts on winter tourism 1 viable areas for downhill ski resorts defined as areas with snow depths of at least 30 cm for over 100 days during the year 2 viable areas for other types of winter tourism businesses defined as areas with snow depths of at least 15 cm for over 100 days during the year and 3 average holiday snow depths defined as the average daily snow depth from december 22 to january 2 durand et al 2009 scott et al 2008 the full set of metrics used in this analysis is summarized in table 2 thirty year averages for a relative time period of 1980 2010 were calculated and compared for each metric these averages were calculated by first finding the 30 year average for each grid cell and then computing a spatial average for the entire model domain a year was defined as being from july 1 of the previous year to june 30 of the current year to ensure that the entire winter season was captured in a single year the near future period is based on climate projections for a 30 year window centered on the 2020s 2011 2040 the mid future period on climate projections for the 2050s 2041 2070 and the far future period on climate projections for the 2080s 2071 2100 respectively the results of this analysis are presented in the following section historical maps of 30 year averages are based on vic simulations forced by gridded observational data for the study domain maps of future 30 year averages are based on mean values calculated from vic simulations forced by the set of six downscaled aogcms byun and hamlet 2018 state names are abbreviated as follows illinois il indiana in michigan mi minnesota mn new york ny ohio oh pennsylvania pa and wisconsin wi 3 results and discussion historical 1980 2010 30 year spatial averages for the full study domain of each of the metrics selected for this analysis are listed in table 3 the winter season has historically averaged close to 5 months across the study region with a little over 3 weeks of cold days as previously defined days with appropriate snow depths for downhill skiing have averaged about 4 weeks and days with appropriate snow depths for snowmobiling have averaged about 8 1 2 weeks annually a little over 2 months each year on average have had temperatures suitable for artificial snowmaking for historical conditions close to 9 percent of the study region would be considered viable for downhill ski resorts and close to 23 percent viable for other types of winter tourism businesses holiday snow depths have averaged about 18 6 cm across the study region the first metric considered is length of winter as shown in table 4 the ensemble of aogcms predicts that the length of winter will decrease from the historical to the future periods for the entire domain and each state the reduction in the near future period is around 2 weeks mid future period about 3 weeks and far future period about a month or more for both rcps plots illustrating spatial patterns for the length of winter across the great lakes region are shown in fig 2 as seen in fig 2 a the historical average for the length of winter for the study region ranges from around 70 days in the southern portion of the study region to over 200 days in the northern portion of the study region plots of 30 year averages for the future periods fig 2 b g show that the greatest decreases in the length of winter generally occur in the most northern parts of the study region likely due to a greater sensitivity to climate change at higher latitudes byun and hamlet 2018 these decreases are around 3 4 weeks in the near future period fig 2 b and e 5 6 weeks in the mid future period fig 2 c and f and 6 10 weeks in the far future period fig 2 d and g table 5 shows analysis results for cold days similar to length of winter the ensemble of aogcms predicts that the number of cold days annually will decrease from the historical to the future periods reductions range from a few days to a few weeks through the end of the century spatial plots for the number of cold days also show similar spatial patterns to those found for length of winter fig 3 the greatest reductions in the number of cold days occur in the northern part of the study region with the number of days declining by over a month in terms of days for downhill skiing and days for snowmobiling the vic model simulations predict a decrease in the number of days with appropriate snow depths for both activities tables 6 and 7 reflecting the significant decrease overall in snow depths for the study region through the end of the century as a result of climate change the aogcms predict a decrease of up to 19 days for downhill skiing and 21 days for snowmobiling in the near future a decrease of up to 26 days and 21 days in the mid future and a decrease of up to 33 days and 38 days in the far future for rcp 4 5 for rcp 8 5 decreases of 19 and 23 are predicted for the near future 37 and 47 for the mid future and 50 and 62 for the far future for downhill skiing and snowmobiling respectively new york generally experiences the greatest reductions in the number of days for downhill skiing and wisconsin generally experiences the greatest reductions in the number of days for snowmobiling figs 4 and 5 top show the historical 30 year averages for days for downhill skiing and snowmobiling respectively the areas with the greatest number of days with appropriate snow depths for both activities are concentrated in areas with higher elevations and around the lakes averaging about 6 months annually in peak locations for both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the number of days for downhill skiing and snowmobiling across most of the southern part of the study region decreases to zero through the 2080s in areas that historically experience more days with appropriate snow depths for downhill skiing and snowmobiling the decrease in the number of days is more severe with declines of about 1 2 months through the end of the century analysis by byun and hamlet 2018 shows that these steep reductions in snow depths are caused by more precipitation falling as rain rather than snow due to rising temperatures in terms of days with temperatures required for artificial snowmaking the ensemble of aogcms predicts a decrease in the number of days in the future table 8 declines are similar to those seen with other metrics ranging from about a week in the near future to about a month in the far future under both rcps as shown in fig 6 reductions in the number of days with temperatures required for artificial snowmaking are greatest in the northern part of the study region which corresponds to the region where this practice is also most likely to be used to try and offset losses in reliable snow cover and winter weather in northern minnesota and new york the number of days with temperatures suitable for artificial snowmaking could decrease by 50 percent or more in the far future the simulation results also show that viable areas for downhill ski resorts and viable areas for other winter tourism businesses will decline in spatial extent due to reductions in overall snow depths as a result of climate change table 9 and 10 while only about 8 7 percent of the study region would be considered viable for downhill ski resorts historically table 3 it is possible that essentially the entire region will experience less than 100 days of at least 30 cm of snow on an annual basis similar declines are also predicted in terms of the viable area for other types of winter tourism businesses fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of viable areas for downhill ski resorts and other winter tourism businesses once again these areas are concentrated at higher elevations and around the lakes when considered in conjunction with the current locations of ski resorts these results suggest that only 80 of 122 businesses are currently operating in areas that are would be historically classified as viable for downhill ski resorts and other winter tourism businesses in addition all current ski resorts are operating in areas that will become non viable based on rcp 8 5 by the 2080s average holiday snow depths are also predicted to decline in the future table 11 in addition to declines in average daily holiday snow depths of half or more through the end of the century only new york will have holiday snow depths of over 15 cm the threshold used to determine the number of days with appropriate snow cover for snowmobiling and other types of winter tourism activities at the end of the century under rcp 4 5 and no states will experience depths of over 15 cm under rcp 8 5 for the mid future and far future periods fig 8 shows historical and future 30 year averages for holiday snow depths across the study region similar to the previous snow depth related variables areas with the highest averages for holiday snow depths are concentrated at higher elevations and around the lakes the greatest declines occur in areas in the northern part of the study domain that historically experience colder weather and also currently support ski resorts overall these results demonstrate that changes to the study region s winter weather and hydrology will significantly affect its ability to support winter tourism by the end of the century 4 discussion and conclusions the aogcms analyzed in this study predict that cold weather and associated cold processes in the great lakes region could decline substantially by the end of the century as a result of climate change in general winter weather both in terms of cold temperatures and snow cover will decline significantly in the study region which will have significant impacts on the region s hydrologic processes as shown through shorter winters fewer cold days and steep declines in snow depths these impacts in turn are expected to have serious implications for local winter tourism businesses the decrease in the length of winter presents obvious problems for the long term sustainability of winter tourism businesses as revenues will need to be made during timeframes that are shortened by over a month businesses may be able to compensate for some shortening of their operating seasons by hiring fewer staff or planning to open and close at later or earlier dates respectively however this would also likely stifle business growth and affect communities that are reliant on winter tourism over time gilaberte búrdalo et al 2014 instead increasing operations in the shoulder seasons such as opening up trails and slopes to mountain biking may be a more effective approach reductions in the number of cold days would have similar effects on winter tourism businesses but a gradual warming in the winter months at least in the short term could encourage customers to engage more in outdoor activities in the winter if there is still adequate snow cover for other recreational opportunities like snowshoeing and cross country skiing over the long term however the reduction in the number of cold days to a week or less per year is likely to drive tourists further northward if they want to engage in winter recreation business operators will have to be cognizant of changing patterns in winter weather and ready to adapt as conditions change for example transportation to recreation areas may improve due to reduced snow providing additional opportunities to generate revenue if businesses can bring in customers for alternate winter activities when it comes to the number of days for downhill skiing and snowmobiling the aogcms predict that the number of days appropriate for both activities could decline by a few weeks to over a month in the great lakes region for both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 by the 2080s supporting analysis shows that overall snowfall will decline due to rising temperatures and the resulting conversion of precipitation from snow to rain byun and hamlet 2018 these losses will likely require more drastic action from skiing and snowmobiling related businesses as well as other nature based winter tourism businesses to make up for lost revenue from the reduction in reliable snow cover such as a diversification of winter offerings an expansion of summer operations or an increased reliance on artificial snowmaking for artificial snowmaking however these results show that the number of days with temperatures required for this practice to be used also decreases in the future to less than a month annually technological advancements may be able to deal with some of the reductions in the number of days that artificial snowmaking can be used but it is unlikely to be able to account for the full extent of losses in terms of snow cover especially over the long term in addition the costs of artificial snowmaking will rise as natural snow cover continues to decline forcing business owners to balance costs against their profit margin damm et al 2014 however available water will likely increase by the 2080s so water supplies may support additional artificial snowmaking if it remains cost effective the percent of viable area for downhill ski resorts declines to close to zero by the end of the century average holiday snow depths are also predicted to decline by half or more by the end of the century this is key for winter tourism in the great lakes region because these variables have been shown to be important indicators of business viability similar declines are seen in the percent of viable area for other types of winter tourism businesses in addition the areas with the greatest declines in these variables also correspond with current locations of ski resorts in the great lakes over the long term this could result in business closure or relocation grooming of slopes may help to reduce the amount of snow required to safely operate downhill ski areas however this practice may also become ineffective as temperatures rise and snow cover declines over time while an in depth economic analysis was not within the scope of this study the results of previous work can provide some indication of the potential economic impacts of climate change on winter tourism in the great lakes states for the states in the northern portion of the study region and the ones most impacted by declines in winter weather winter tourism added about 506 billion to the economy in the case of minnesota to about 845 billion in the case of new york during the 2009 2010 season burakowski and magnusson 2012 in addition when comparing skier visits in the five years with the most snow with the five years with the least snow from 2001 to 2016 hagenstad et al 2018 found that low snow years resulted in declines in patronage and seasonal revenue for all eight states in the study region given these findings it is evident that declines in weather conditions conducive to winter tourism could have significant impacts on the economies of these eight states overall these results imply that certain states in the great lakes like michigan and new york could experience significant losses in terms of reliable snow cover for winter tourism and recreation by the middle of the century due to climate change effects on regional weather and hydrology these results are similar to those found in existing research though the declines in winter weather are more extreme for some areas than those predicted by other aogcms and snow models scott et al 2008 wobus et al 2017 for example in their analysis of the northeast winter recreation tourism sector scott et al 2008 found that only western new york became nonviable for winter tourism through the end of the century regardless declines in winter weather and hydrology are projected to have major impacts on winter tourism throughout the great lakes 5 future research as previously discussed the results of this work suggest that the impacts of climate change on winter weather and hydrology could be significant for winter tourism businesses in the great lakes requiring action to prepare for the future while there are some businesses that are already adapting to perceived reductions in the reliability of winter weather in the great lakes it is often difficult for tourism businesses to plan for the long term as they operate on relatively short timescales this analysis provides information that could be useful to tourism business owners in terms of preparing for climate change as it provides information that can be easily summarized for different locations and quantifies changes in winter weather and hydrology that are directly relevant to winter tourism additionally while the results of this study are presented in the context of winter tourism changes to the region s overall winter weather and hydrologic patterns will have implications that extend to other economic environmental and social areas there are a few important limitations of this study first aogcm driven climate data cannot fully represent small scale storms such as those that occur at the sub grid cell scale including localized precipitation events which may impact snow process on the ground also the vegetation parameters used for the vic model simulations in this work are stationary so they do not capture possible changes in hydrologic physical responses in the future caused by land use change for example given the predicted 8 c increase in temperature at the end of the century it cannot be expected that the natural ecosystem will remain the same in some areas of the study domain in the future the interpretation of these results for decision making should take into account these potential limitations there are a number of directions in which this work could continue when it comes to input data from the aogcms additional work to calibrate and validate the model for the study region could improve the reliability of these projections and ensure that they are realistically simulating cold processes for example by validating snow model and precipitation amounts resulting from undercatch corrections to the historical climate data another next step for this analysis would be to incorporate artificial snowmaking into vic model simulations as done by scott et al 2008 or to use the model to assess potential changes in processes that are important to other forms of winter recreation and tourism activities such as ice cover for ice fishing when considering how climate change could impact tourism businesses further exploring how changes in winter weather directly relate to economic revenue and cost benefit analyses of different adaptation options would be useful such as wobus et al s 2017 and hagenstad et al s 2018 studies considering specific measures of revenue associated with winter tourism this would include quantifying in greater depth the value of other winter activities like ice fishing and snowshoeing as well as additional revenue that could be generated from the expansion of spring and fall shoulder season activities similarly an expanded in depth assessment of how climate change could impact tourism communities that are reliant on winter tourism and recreation in the great lakes could provide important insights for the region s policymakers research focused on the feasibility and acceptability of different adaptation options as well as the potential impact of climate change on tourists perceptions and behaviors around winter tourism and recreation in the great lakes would also help improve understanding of how climate change could affect the competitive advantage of popular winter destinations in the region for example building on rutty et al s 2017 study of recent adaptations by the ski industry to relatively poor winter conditions further work in cooperation with winter tourism business owners could also help with the assessment and evaluation of different types of adaptation strategies that could keep businesses viable with climate change gilaberte búrdalo et al 2014 furthermore expanding the scope of this study to consider how changes in winter weather and hydrology might affect the region more broadly would be beneficial to understanding greater implications for water policy and management while the great lakes region has and will continue to be water rich climate change impacts on winter weather and hydrologic patterns will have broader implications for the region s water supplies and potentially increase conflict between users at different times of the year policymakers may be forced to regulate the use of water resources between different sectors proactive planning and consideration of how these patterns may change over time will allow for some consideration of how to move forward as the climate continues to change acknowledgments this research was supported by the department of education s graduate assistance in areas of national need program under grant 104127 the purdue university

8479,study region eight u s states bordering the north american laurentian great lakes study focus variable infiltration capacity vic model simulations based on data from an ensemble of atmospheric ocean general circulation models aogcms used for the intergovernmental panel on climate change s ipcc s fifth assessment report ar5 were used to quantify potential climate change impacts on winter weather and hydrology in the study region and understand implications for its tourism sector new hydrologic insights for the region by the 2080s climate change could result in winters that are shorter by over a month reductions of over a month in days with snow depths required for many kinds of winter recreation declines in average holiday snow depths of 50 percent or more and reductions in the percent area of the study region that would be considered viable for winter tourism from about 22 percent to 0 3 percent days with temperatures suitable for artificial snowmaking decline to less than a month annually making it potentially less feasible as an adaptation strategy all of the region s current ski resorts are operating in areas that will become non viable for winter tourism businesses under a high emissions scenario given the economic importance of the winter tourism industry in the study region businesses and communities should consider climate change and potential adaptation strategies in their future planning and overall decision making keywords tourism winter weather climate change cmip5 vic model 1 introduction cold season hydrologic processes play an important role in shaping the physical behavior of north america s laurentian great lakes low air temperatures have a significant impact on the formation and break up of lake ice and subsequently lake dynamics in warmer months of the year mishra et al 2011b frozen soils and seasonal freeze thaw patterns affect infiltration soil properties and overall land energy balances cherkauer and lettenmaier 1999 lemke et al 2007 seasonal snowpack plays an important role in surface energy and water budgets soil temperatures surface albedo and evapotranspiration cohen and rind 1991 dyer and mote 2006 karl et al 1993 mortsch et al 2000 rodell and houser 2004 sinha and cherkauer 2008 snowpack and snowmelt runoff also affect seasonal streamflow behavior including peak streamflow during the spring and the development and replenishment of lakes and wetlands in the region mishra and cherkauer 2011 cold weather phenomena are also important to many economic sectors in the great lakes especially tourism winter tourism is highly dependent on temperature snow cover snowfall length of the snow season and the presence or absence of snow during winter holidays in recent years desirable conditions for winter tourism are perceived to have become less reliable by great lakes tourism professionals chin 2016 previous research has also shown that tourism business owners are already adapting to changing conditions for example by offering snowshoes in lieu of cross country skiing and adopting snowmaking to account for reductions in snowfall and snowpack burakowski and magnusson 2012 chin 2016 scott et al 2008 quantitative hydrologic analyses support tourism stakeholders perceptions that winter weather has become less suitable for winter recreation in recent decades average winter and spring temperatures have both been increasing in the great lakes region while seasonally frozen ground has been decreasing over the last century especially in the spring mortsch et al 2000 sinha and cherkauer 2008 similarly the last spring freeze has shifted earlier in the year leading to shorter winter seasons pryor 2013 pryor et al 2014 the great lakes has also been experiencing shifts in precipitation from snow to rain earlier annual snowmelt and reductions in spring snow cover brown 2000 brown and goodison 1996 dyer and mote 2006 hodgkins et al 2007 several studies have been conducted to determine how winter weather has changed in recent decades brown and braaten 1998 examined changes in monthly snow depth and snow cover duration in canada and found that both had decreased from 1946 to 1995 especially in march mote et al 2005 found in their study evidence of declines in winter snowpack for western north america from 1916 2002 durand et al 2009 looked at daily snow depth the number of days with snow on the ground the maximum continuous time period with snow coverage and minimum 100 day snow depths in the french alps from the late 1950 s to early 2000s and found a decreasing trend in snow coverage at low elevations though this was not the case for medium to high elevations similarly hendrikx et al 2012 investigated potential changes in mean peak snow water equivalent swe snow duration fraction of precipitation as snow and average maximum swe in new zealand using output from atmospheric ocean general circulation models aogcms and found decreases in snow coverage at low elevations and in a few cases marginal increases at very high elevations in addition the intergovernmental panel on climate change s ipcc s fifth assessment report ar5 states that both cold temperature extremes and the amount of snow and ice have been decreasing globally since 1950 and are likely to continue to do so with future climate change ipcc 2014 mote et al 2005 future climate change projections for the great lakes region support the conclusion that changes to its winter weather and hydrology will continue and intensify byun and hamlet 2018 winkler et al 2014 temperatures are expected to continue to increase leading to reductions in cold spells and extremely cold days and further shortening winters hayhoe and wubbles 2007 wuebbles et al 2010 increasing temperatures could also affect river and lake ice thickness and break up bates et al 2008 karl et al 1993 predict that decreases in snow cover could come in future decades as a result of temperature increases despite some past findings that total annual snowfall will remain relatively steady hayhoe and wuebbles 2007 the redistribution of precipitation as rain versus snow could lead to higher runoff and increased flooding in the region byun et al in review hayhoe et al 2010 karl et al 1993 mortsch et al 2000 rosenzweig et al 2002 in terms of how these changes will affect winter tourism specifically scott et al 2006 2003 scott and mcboyle 2007 used a snow model coupled with the variable infiltration capacity vic model to look at changes in snow depths appropriate for skiing and snowmobiling in the northeastern united states and canada using climate projections from three different aogcms for two emissions scenarios they found the potential for significant losses for the ski and snowmobiling industries due to declines in seasonal snowpack though artificial snowmaking reduced some of this vulnerability studies by durand et al 2009 and hendrikx et al 2012 also indicate the potential for economic losses specifically for downhill ski resorts due to decreases in snow cover duration and the amount of snow cover at elevations where these businesses typically operate wobus et al 2017 recently quantified potential losses for winter recreation due to climate change as being in the hundreds of millions of dollars across the united states overall these findings suggest that without adaptation winter based tourism businesses could face significant losses or even failure due to future climate change impacts on great lakes winter weather and hydrology while artificial snowmaking might mitigate some decreases in snow reliability it is a strategy that is very resource intensive both financially and in terms of water use rixen et al 2011 steiger and mayer 2008 in addition research indicates that tourists acceptance of artificial snowmaking is equivocal pütz et al 2011 technological advances will also likely be needed for snowmaking to be effective in the future due to current limitations on temperatures for snowmaking usually below 2 c wobus et al 2017 subsequently alternative strategies need to also be considered in discussions about climate change preparedness these findings also support the argument that winter tourism businesses need to be proactively preparing for potential changes in future cold and snow conditions in a way that takes into account a number of competing interests regional scale analyses of future climate projections related to winter weather can assist with these efforts this work builds on existing analyses by considering how climate change could impact winter weather and hydrology important to tourism for the u s portion of the north american laurentian great lakes region statistically downscaled climatic data from aogcms which constitute ipcc ar5 have been used to run vic model simulations of snow processes for this analysis the overall objective of this study is to produce detailed information about potential climate change impacts on winter weather and hydrologic response in the great lakes that is directly relevant to winter recreation and tourism and that can be used to help tourism managers think about climate change and adaptation strategies for the future in summary the following research questions are being considered 1 how will climate change affect winter conditions in the great lakes through the end of the century 2 how could changes in winter processes affect winter recreation and tourism in the region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the north american laurentian great lakes system is the largest freshwater system on earth containing about 20 percent of the global freshwater supply grannemann and reeves 2005 it is made up of five hydrologically connected lakes erie huron michigan ontario and superior with a cumulative volume of roughly 22 quadrillion liters mcbean and motiee 2008 and a drainage area of 770 000 square km croley 1990 the great lakes are bordered by eight u s states and one canadian province across the great lakes region average annual precipitation ranges from about 680 to 1190 mm and average temperature ranges from about 13 to 1 c in january and 17 to 23 c in july hodgkins et al 2007 winter tourism added over 3 5 billion to great lakes states economies during the 2009 2010 season burakowski and magnusson 2012 the total gross annual revenue of downhill skiing and snowboarding areas in great lakes states is estimated at about 1 6 billion national ski areas association 2016 snowmobiling adds about 800 million annually to michigan s economy alone stoddard 2017 snowshoeing snowboarding and ice fishing are also popular forms of winter recreation overall winter tourism provided close to 63 000 jobs in great lakes states during the 2009 2010 season burakowski and magnusson 2012 2 2 the variable infiltration capacity vic model the vic model is a land surface hydrology model that can be used to simulate water and energy balances for large watersheds as well as streamflow when paired with a routing model gao et al 2009 liang et al 1996 1994 lohmann et al 1996 wood et al 1992 typically the vic model is set up to run based on gridded locations calculating a wide variety of output variables for each cell at the designated time step based on climate soil and vegetation input data the vic model assumes that at the macro scale vertical transfers are more important than horizontal transfers in determining water and energy balances at each location at a large spatial scale so each grid cell is simulated individually daily meteorological data is provided to the vic model for at least daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperature and average wind speed for each grid cell which was the time step used for the simulations in this study the model is also able to handle sub daily meteorological information and the energy balance snow model is typically as here run at an hourly time step andreadis et al 2009 in this study output from a series of vic model simulations was used to quantify changes in cold processes and determine the potential impacts of climate change on winter weather in the great lakes the vic model determines changes in snow conditions using the energy balance for each individual grid cell snowpack is represented using a two layer scheme with energy exchange occurring only at the surface andreadis et al 2009 gao et al 2009 for these simulations changes in the density of snowpack were calculated based an algorithm developed from typical monthly snow density measurements bras 1990 while snow albedo was determined according to a u s army corps of engineers algorithm gao et al 2009 minimum 0 5 c and maximum temperature 2 c thresholds for rain and snow respectively determine the form in which precipitation falls the vic model has been used in several different studies to examine cold processes in the great lakes especially its western region sinha et al 2010 used the vic model to examine the effects of historical climate variability on soil frost soil temperature and snow water equivalent in the great lakes while mishra et al 2011a and mishra et al 2011b used the vic model to examine historical trends in lake ice phenology mishra and cherkauer 2011 also used the vic model to consider the role of cold season climate extremes and variability on the inundation extent of lakes and wetlands based on historical trends for this study the vic model was set up to include u s states around the great lakes at a 1 16 grid cell resolution fig 1 three soil layers were defined for this iteration of the model with soil properties for each grid cell being extracted from the 1998 conus soil dataset livneh et al 2014 miller and white 1998 a total of eleven land cover types were defined for the model simulations land cover fractions for each grid cell were determined using data from nasa s moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis with the international geosphere biosphere programme s igbp s global vegetation classification scheme as measured in 2000 hansen et al 2000 livneh et al 2014 2 3 selection of vic model climate forcing data climate data from the world climate research programme s coupled model intercomparison program phase 5 cmip5 was used to run vic model simulations for this study the cmip5 dataset is comprised of an ensemble of climate models produced through a coordinated effort by research groups around the world with the aim of meeting the most major priorities of user communities see taylor et al 2012 for additional details output from an ensemble of cmip5 model runs was statistically downscaled using the hybrid delta hd method hamlet et al 2013 as described in byun and hamlet 2018 and used to analyze climate change impacts for the study region regridded historical daily precipitation maximum surface air temperature and minimum surface air temperature measurements covering the united states portion of the great lakes region for 1915 2013 were adjusted based on monthly temperature and precipitation averages calculated from the ensemble of cmip5 model runs byun and hamlet 2018 chiu et al in review the full set of aogcms used which were selected based on satisfactory representation of historical midwest climate and to include models that best represent the central tendency and outermost range of possible climate futures is shown in table 1 the daily wind data used is based on daily climatology pre 1950 and national center for atmospheric research ncar reanalysis simulations post 1950 chiu et al in review two representative concentration pathways rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 were analyzed to understand the effects of medium low and high levels of carbon dioxide concentrations byun and hamlet 2018 moss et al 2010 extensive calibration and validation of the model in terms of its simulation of cold and snow processes was outside the scope of this study however the model has been evaluated based on its ability to simulate streamflow in 40 different watersheds chiu et al in review as part of this analysis a gauge undercatch correction was applied to the meteorological forcing data because of apparent issues with snowfall measurements resulting in good model performance in general the vic model has been shown to do well at simulating snow andreadis et al 2009 2 4 selection of metrics a review of existing literature determined the metrics used to evaluate the potential impacts of climate change on winter weather and hydrology and associated impacts on the tourism sector for this study based on work by the ccl clivar jcomm expert team et on climate change detection and indices etccdi zhang 2013 length of winter or the number of days between the first and last occurrence of at least 6 days with a daily average temperature of less than 5 c was selected as one of the metrics cold days or the number of days where the maximum daily temperature is below 5 c was also used to further explore how winter weather might change in the future additional metrics were determined based on a review of existing studies looking specifically at climate change and winter tourism scott et al 2008 defined favorable conditions for downhill skiing as a snow depth of 30 cm and for snowmobiling as a snow depth of 15 cm with a maximum daily temperature of less than 15 c and a 2 day precipitation total of less than 20 mm kundzewicz et al 2008 on the other hand defined appropriate snow depths for snowboarding as 30 cm and for downhill skiing as 40 cm here the kundzewicz et al metric 40 cm was used to look at days for downhill skiing because scott et al included snowmaking in their analysis snowmaking has not been incorporated into the vic model simulations completed for this work so metrics accounting for it were deemed inappropriate for this application however the number of days with temperatures required for artificial snowmaking i e the number of days where the maximum daily temperature is less than 2 c was used to determine how climate change could affect the ability of winter tourism businesses to use this practice in the future wobus et al 2017 a snow depth of 15 cm was used to determine the number of days appropriate for snowmobiling this depth also reflects the number of days that would be conducive to other types of winter recreation like snowshoeing and cross county skiing finally three additional criteria were used to evaluate climate change impacts on winter tourism 1 viable areas for downhill ski resorts defined as areas with snow depths of at least 30 cm for over 100 days during the year 2 viable areas for other types of winter tourism businesses defined as areas with snow depths of at least 15 cm for over 100 days during the year and 3 average holiday snow depths defined as the average daily snow depth from december 22 to january 2 durand et al 2009 scott et al 2008 the full set of metrics used in this analysis is summarized in table 2 thirty year averages for a relative time period of 1980 2010 were calculated and compared for each metric these averages were calculated by first finding the 30 year average for each grid cell and then computing a spatial average for the entire model domain a year was defined as being from july 1 of the previous year to june 30 of the current year to ensure that the entire winter season was captured in a single year the near future period is based on climate projections for a 30 year window centered on the 2020s 2011 2040 the mid future period on climate projections for the 2050s 2041 2070 and the far future period on climate projections for the 2080s 2071 2100 respectively the results of this analysis are presented in the following section historical maps of 30 year averages are based on vic simulations forced by gridded observational data for the study domain maps of future 30 year averages are based on mean values calculated from vic simulations forced by the set of six downscaled aogcms byun and hamlet 2018 state names are abbreviated as follows illinois il indiana in michigan mi minnesota mn new york ny ohio oh pennsylvania pa and wisconsin wi 3 results and discussion historical 1980 2010 30 year spatial averages for the full study domain of each of the metrics selected for this analysis are listed in table 3 the winter season has historically averaged close to 5 months across the study region with a little over 3 weeks of cold days as previously defined days with appropriate snow depths for downhill skiing have averaged about 4 weeks and days with appropriate snow depths for snowmobiling have averaged about 8 1 2 weeks annually a little over 2 months each year on average have had temperatures suitable for artificial snowmaking for historical conditions close to 9 percent of the study region would be considered viable for downhill ski resorts and close to 23 percent viable for other types of winter tourism businesses holiday snow depths have averaged about 18 6 cm across the study region the first metric considered is length of winter as shown in table 4 the ensemble of aogcms predicts that the length of winter will decrease from the historical to the future periods for the entire domain and each state the reduction in the near future period is around 2 weeks mid future period about 3 weeks and far future period about a month or more for both rcps plots illustrating spatial patterns for the length of winter across the great lakes region are shown in fig 2 as seen in fig 2 a the historical average for the length of winter for the study region ranges from around 70 days in the southern portion of the study region to over 200 days in the northern portion of the study region plots of 30 year averages for the future periods fig 2 b g show that the greatest decreases in the length of winter generally occur in the most northern parts of the study region likely due to a greater sensitivity to climate change at higher latitudes byun and hamlet 2018 these decreases are around 3 4 weeks in the near future period fig 2 b and e 5 6 weeks in the mid future period fig 2 c and f and 6 10 weeks in the far future period fig 2 d and g table 5 shows analysis results for cold days similar to length of winter the ensemble of aogcms predicts that the number of cold days annually will decrease from the historical to the future periods reductions range from a few days to a few weeks through the end of the century spatial plots for the number of cold days also show similar spatial patterns to those found for length of winter fig 3 the greatest reductions in the number of cold days occur in the northern part of the study region with the number of days declining by over a month in terms of days for downhill skiing and days for snowmobiling the vic model simulations predict a decrease in the number of days with appropriate snow depths for both activities tables 6 and 7 reflecting the significant decrease overall in snow depths for the study region through the end of the century as a result of climate change the aogcms predict a decrease of up to 19 days for downhill skiing and 21 days for snowmobiling in the near future a decrease of up to 26 days and 21 days in the mid future and a decrease of up to 33 days and 38 days in the far future for rcp 4 5 for rcp 8 5 decreases of 19 and 23 are predicted for the near future 37 and 47 for the mid future and 50 and 62 for the far future for downhill skiing and snowmobiling respectively new york generally experiences the greatest reductions in the number of days for downhill skiing and wisconsin generally experiences the greatest reductions in the number of days for snowmobiling figs 4 and 5 top show the historical 30 year averages for days for downhill skiing and snowmobiling respectively the areas with the greatest number of days with appropriate snow depths for both activities are concentrated in areas with higher elevations and around the lakes averaging about 6 months annually in peak locations for both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the number of days for downhill skiing and snowmobiling across most of the southern part of the study region decreases to zero through the 2080s in areas that historically experience more days with appropriate snow depths for downhill skiing and snowmobiling the decrease in the number of days is more severe with declines of about 1 2 months through the end of the century analysis by byun and hamlet 2018 shows that these steep reductions in snow depths are caused by more precipitation falling as rain rather than snow due to rising temperatures in terms of days with temperatures required for artificial snowmaking the ensemble of aogcms predicts a decrease in the number of days in the future table 8 declines are similar to those seen with other metrics ranging from about a week in the near future to about a month in the far future under both rcps as shown in fig 6 reductions in the number of days with temperatures required for artificial snowmaking are greatest in the northern part of the study region which corresponds to the region where this practice is also most likely to be used to try and offset losses in reliable snow cover and winter weather in northern minnesota and new york the number of days with temperatures suitable for artificial snowmaking could decrease by 50 percent or more in the far future the simulation results also show that viable areas for downhill ski resorts and viable areas for other winter tourism businesses will decline in spatial extent due to reductions in overall snow depths as a result of climate change table 9 and 10 while only about 8 7 percent of the study region would be considered viable for downhill ski resorts historically table 3 it is possible that essentially the entire region will experience less than 100 days of at least 30 cm of snow on an annual basis similar declines are also predicted in terms of the viable area for other types of winter tourism businesses fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of viable areas for downhill ski resorts and other winter tourism businesses once again these areas are concentrated at higher elevations and around the lakes when considered in conjunction with the current locations of ski resorts these results suggest that only 80 of 122 businesses are currently operating in areas that are would be historically classified as viable for downhill ski resorts and other winter tourism businesses in addition all current ski resorts are operating in areas that will become non viable based on rcp 8 5 by the 2080s average holiday snow depths are also predicted to decline in the future table 11 in addition to declines in average daily holiday snow depths of half or more through the end of the century only new york will have holiday snow depths of over 15 cm the threshold used to determine the number of days with appropriate snow cover for snowmobiling and other types of winter tourism activities at the end of the century under rcp 4 5 and no states will experience depths of over 15 cm under rcp 8 5 for the mid future and far future periods fig 8 shows historical and future 30 year averages for holiday snow depths across the study region similar to the previous snow depth related variables areas with the highest averages for holiday snow depths are concentrated at higher elevations and around the lakes the greatest declines occur in areas in the northern part of the study domain that historically experience colder weather and also currently support ski resorts overall these results demonstrate that changes to the study region s winter weather and hydrology will significantly affect its ability to support winter tourism by the end of the century 4 discussion and conclusions the aogcms analyzed in this study predict that cold weather and associated cold processes in the great lakes region could decline substantially by the end of the century as a result of climate change in general winter weather both in terms of cold temperatures and snow cover will decline significantly in the study region which will have significant impacts on the region s hydrologic processes as shown through shorter winters fewer cold days and steep declines in snow depths these impacts in turn are expected to have serious implications for local winter tourism businesses the decrease in the length of winter presents obvious problems for the long term sustainability of winter tourism businesses as revenues will need to be made during timeframes that are shortened by over a month businesses may be able to compensate for some shortening of their operating seasons by hiring fewer staff or planning to open and close at later or earlier dates respectively however this would also likely stifle business growth and affect communities that are reliant on winter tourism over time gilaberte búrdalo et al 2014 instead increasing operations in the shoulder seasons such as opening up trails and slopes to mountain biking may be a more effective approach reductions in the number of cold days would have similar effects on winter tourism businesses but a gradual warming in the winter months at least in the short term could encourage customers to engage more in outdoor activities in the winter if there is still adequate snow cover for other recreational opportunities like snowshoeing and cross country skiing over the long term however the reduction in the number of cold days to a week or less per year is likely to drive tourists further northward if they want to engage in winter recreation business operators will have to be cognizant of changing patterns in winter weather and ready to adapt as conditions change for example transportation to recreation areas may improve due to reduced snow providing additional opportunities to generate revenue if businesses can bring in customers for alternate winter activities when it comes to the number of days for downhill skiing and snowmobiling the aogcms predict that the number of days appropriate for both activities could decline by a few weeks to over a month in the great lakes region for both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 by the 2080s supporting analysis shows that overall snowfall will decline due to rising temperatures and the resulting conversion of precipitation from snow to rain byun and hamlet 2018 these losses will likely require more drastic action from skiing and snowmobiling related businesses as well as other nature based winter tourism businesses to make up for lost revenue from the reduction in reliable snow cover such as a diversification of winter offerings an expansion of summer operations or an increased reliance on artificial snowmaking for artificial snowmaking however these results show that the number of days with temperatures required for this practice to be used also decreases in the future to less than a month annually technological advancements may be able to deal with some of the reductions in the number of days that artificial snowmaking can be used but it is unlikely to be able to account for the full extent of losses in terms of snow cover especially over the long term in addition the costs of artificial snowmaking will rise as natural snow cover continues to decline forcing business owners to balance costs against their profit margin damm et al 2014 however available water will likely increase by the 2080s so water supplies may support additional artificial snowmaking if it remains cost effective the percent of viable area for downhill ski resorts declines to close to zero by the end of the century average holiday snow depths are also predicted to decline by half or more by the end of the century this is key for winter tourism in the great lakes region because these variables have been shown to be important indicators of business viability similar declines are seen in the percent of viable area for other types of winter tourism businesses in addition the areas with the greatest declines in these variables also correspond with current locations of ski resorts in the great lakes over the long term this could result in business closure or relocation grooming of slopes may help to reduce the amount of snow required to safely operate downhill ski areas however this practice may also become ineffective as temperatures rise and snow cover declines over time while an in depth economic analysis was not within the scope of this study the results of previous work can provide some indication of the potential economic impacts of climate change on winter tourism in the great lakes states for the states in the northern portion of the study region and the ones most impacted by declines in winter weather winter tourism added about 506 billion to the economy in the case of minnesota to about 845 billion in the case of new york during the 2009 2010 season burakowski and magnusson 2012 in addition when comparing skier visits in the five years with the most snow with the five years with the least snow from 2001 to 2016 hagenstad et al 2018 found that low snow years resulted in declines in patronage and seasonal revenue for all eight states in the study region given these findings it is evident that declines in weather conditions conducive to winter tourism could have significant impacts on the economies of these eight states overall these results imply that certain states in the great lakes like michigan and new york could experience significant losses in terms of reliable snow cover for winter tourism and recreation by the middle of the century due to climate change effects on regional weather and hydrology these results are similar to those found in existing research though the declines in winter weather are more extreme for some areas than those predicted by other aogcms and snow models scott et al 2008 wobus et al 2017 for example in their analysis of the northeast winter recreation tourism sector scott et al 2008 found that only western new york became nonviable for winter tourism through the end of the century regardless declines in winter weather and hydrology are projected to have major impacts on winter tourism throughout the great lakes 5 future research as previously discussed the results of this work suggest that the impacts of climate change on winter weather and hydrology could be significant for winter tourism businesses in the great lakes requiring action to prepare for the future while there are some businesses that are already adapting to perceived reductions in the reliability of winter weather in the great lakes it is often difficult for tourism businesses to plan for the long term as they operate on relatively short timescales this analysis provides information that could be useful to tourism business owners in terms of preparing for climate change as it provides information that can be easily summarized for different locations and quantifies changes in winter weather and hydrology that are directly relevant to winter tourism additionally while the results of this study are presented in the context of winter tourism changes to the region s overall winter weather and hydrologic patterns will have implications that extend to other economic environmental and social areas there are a few important limitations of this study first aogcm driven climate data cannot fully represent small scale storms such as those that occur at the sub grid cell scale including localized precipitation events which may impact snow process on the ground also the vegetation parameters used for the vic model simulations in this work are stationary so they do not capture possible changes in hydrologic physical responses in the future caused by land use change for example given the predicted 8 c increase in temperature at the end of the century it cannot be expected that the natural ecosystem will remain the same in some areas of the study domain in the future the interpretation of these results for decision making should take into account these potential limitations there are a number of directions in which this work could continue when it comes to input data from the aogcms additional work to calibrate and validate the model for the study region could improve the reliability of these projections and ensure that they are realistically simulating cold processes for example by validating snow model and precipitation amounts resulting from undercatch corrections to the historical climate data another next step for this analysis would be to incorporate artificial snowmaking into vic model simulations as done by scott et al 2008 or to use the model to assess potential changes in processes that are important to other forms of winter recreation and tourism activities such as ice cover for ice fishing when considering how climate change could impact tourism businesses further exploring how changes in winter weather directly relate to economic revenue and cost benefit analyses of different adaptation options would be useful such as wobus et al s 2017 and hagenstad et al s 2018 studies considering specific measures of revenue associated with winter tourism this would include quantifying in greater depth the value of other winter activities like ice fishing and snowshoeing as well as additional revenue that could be generated from the expansion of spring and fall shoulder season activities similarly an expanded in depth assessment of how climate change could impact tourism communities that are reliant on winter tourism and recreation in the great lakes could provide important insights for the region s policymakers research focused on the feasibility and acceptability of different adaptation options as well as the potential impact of climate change on tourists perceptions and behaviors around winter tourism and recreation in the great lakes would also help improve understanding of how climate change could affect the competitive advantage of popular winter destinations in the region for example building on rutty et al s 2017 study of recent adaptations by the ski industry to relatively poor winter conditions further work in cooperation with winter tourism business owners could also help with the assessment and evaluation of different types of adaptation strategies that could keep businesses viable with climate change gilaberte búrdalo et al 2014 furthermore expanding the scope of this study to consider how changes in winter weather and hydrology might affect the region more broadly would be beneficial to understanding greater implications for water policy and management while the great lakes region has and will continue to be water rich climate change impacts on winter weather and hydrologic patterns will have broader implications for the region s water supplies and potentially increase conflict between users at different times of the year policymakers may be forced to regulate the use of water resources between different sectors proactive planning and consideration of how these patterns may change over time will allow for some consideration of how to move forward as the
