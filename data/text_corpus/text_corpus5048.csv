change spatial dynamics model cellular automata model scenarios 1 introduction large scale and complex land use and cover change lucc has significantly intensified in the last century due to such anthropogenic processes as agricultural and urban expansion landscape homogenization and others meyer and turner 1992 ramankutty et al 2006 spatially modern land use systems directly compete with remained less disturbed natural forests and grasslands and more traditional heterogeneous family agriculture freitas et al 2013 miranda et al 2015 the evaluation of lucc environmental and social effects of landscape homogenization degradation and conversion of natural vegetation such as the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services the increase of greenhouse gas emissions and socio economic and cultural impacts remain a challenge and are considered a very significant research topic due to their magnitude newbold et al 2015 gossner et al 2016 in the present days the impacts of urban and agricultural expansion and landscape homogenization occur at all scales from global to local this is also true in southern brazil where rapid and intensive conversion degradation lucc processes have occurred in the past century and have especially accelerated since the 1950s with the expansion of the agribusiness following the so called green revolution and with the big boost of forestry in the late 1960s consolidated in the period from 1980 to 2000 egler 2001 overbeck et al 2007 de moraes gon√ßalves et al 2013 the lucc is closely related to decision making processes applied to environmental management and territorial planning being useful the use of scenarios that are possible perspectives of the future based on economical social cultural and technological conditions alcamo et al 2006 spatially explicit and quantitative scenarios are based on modelling and analysis of actual lucc transitions considered as conversions from one land use and cover class to another e g forest to urban and modifications of conditions within a broad category e g small farm agriculture to large scale agriculture meyer and turner 1992 different approaches have been developed and applied for lucc modelling and analysis as non spatial models based on economic theories of development and econometric statistical applications and spatial models based on computational approaches as probabilistic cellular automata and agent based modelling briassoulis 2000 verburg et al 2006 since the late 1970 s tobler 1979 computational spatial dynamics models have been developed using self organizing complex systems notions as cellular automata which are used to represent the evolution of complex global structures emerging from simple local neighbourhood rules wolfram 1984 lewin 1992 such computational models evolved to modelling frameworks like dinamica ego soares filho et al 2002 moland engelen et al 2007 and clue s verburg et al 2002 including modular functions for implementing lucc models procedures according to cellular automata and or probabilistic approaches in the case of clue s some of the implementation disadvantages of the different spatial dynamics models are related to difficulties of the cellular automata approach to represent multiple and competitive transitions verburg et al 2002 and to the computational limits related to spatial resolution bringing the need to resample the original data to coarser resolutions even in urban models almeida et al 2008 some assumptions made by existing models may present some limitation in that they unrealistically assume temporal stationarity as the markovian approach considering the same behaviour during all time steps of the model which is not an usual characteristic of complex systems mandelbrot and hudson 2010 the same can be said of the spatial stationarity assuming the non existence of clusters and the homogeneity of the spatial conditions by using global parameters in the models fotheringham et al 2002 to contribute to some of these remaining challenges we developed a spatial dynamics computational model in the fortran 90 language denominated landscam landscape dynamics simulation cellular automata model freitas 2013 it has adopted a open modular structure which facilitates the implementation of new routines and the alteration and the model adaptation by new users and studies the landscam modelling approach was based on the main lucc models such as dinamica ego soares filho et al 2002 moland engelen et al 2007 and clue s verburg et al 2002 adopting a modular structure including the main procedures involved in the lucc spatial dynamics model these procedures offer the tools to perform transition demands definition spatial analysis for generating transition probabilities maps simulation functions for spatial allocation of lucc transitions tools for calibrating and validating the model simulations results and generating prognosis scenarios soares filho et al 2002 verburg et al 2002 2006 in our lucc model we have applied these methods and techniques in a conjugate way focusing on a the use of regions for model parametrization and calibration to deal with spatial heterogeneity and non stationarity b the classification and application of lucc processes to simplify and enhance modelling in case of multiple land use and cover classes and transitions c the use of deterministic and stochastic approaches in the spatial allocation of the transitions d maximum freedom for model parameterization allowing the user several options e model stability and performance even when using less performing computers allowing the use of large extent raster datasets and the implementation of lucc models in a variety of spatial resolution offered by existing remotely sensed data e g landsat aster sentinel etc the main differences of the landscam approach compared to the modelling structure of the cited models are a the model orientation for lucc process allowing the aggregation of multiple land use and cover transitions simplifying lucc modelling of study areas with multiple and complex land use and cover transitions b the mandatory application of regions defined by the user for transition demands calculation transitions spatial allocation and model calibration c the development of procedures for spatial allocation of transitions divided on a deterministic cellular automata and a stochastic patch generation functions transition demands and spatial allocation parameters are defined regionally according to zones chosen by the user which may represent municipalities districts river basins and other regional configurations in consequence the user can easily adopt macro and micro spatial scale relationships in the definition of transition demands and in the model parameterization the objective of this work was to present the implementation of the spatial dynamics model landscam and the results from the simulation of land use and cover change lucc in the period between 1986 2002 and 2008 and scenarios generation until 2030 for a region characterized by multiple competitive and complex lucc processes in the upper uruguay river basin 2 study area the study area comprises 12 000 km2 of the upper uruguay river basin figure including 18 municipalities in the border of rio grande do sul and santa catarina states in southern brazil its two more important municipalities are lages a regional urban industrial and services center and campos novos which concentrates the largest agricultural production with other municipalities being mainly rural mosaics of large scale and small farming agriculture and less developed urbanization and industrialization the area is located in an ecotone between the atlantic forest and southern fields or pampa biomes originally covered by araucaria forest and high altitude grasslands respectively the occupation of this area by european colonization began in the late xix century resulting in rapid and widespread lucc during the xx century especially from the 1950s following the expansion of large scale mechanized agriculture and silviculture resulting in the degradation and conversion of native forests and grasslands at the same time as the traditional heterogeneous areas of colonial small farming were converted also to modern homogeneous land uses 3 methods 3 1 data to implement our model we have used a landscape hierarchical zoning units as regions spatial regimes b multitemporal land use maps based on remote sensing data classification as dependent variables c physical thematic environmental maps and geomorphometric data ecological landscape metrics derived from land use and cover classification and social census data as independent variables d euclidean distance based variables distance from roads and rivers all variables were processed and organized in geographic information system gis and geographic objects based image analysis geobia environments we provide a detailed characterization of the data processing and the data in supplement section 1 in this study we adopted the landscape hierarchical zoning based on an integrative framework for landscape analysis in the upper uruguay area freitas et al 2012 freitas and santos 2013 2014 as spatial regimes i e regions modelled with different parameters reflecting the presence of spatial heterogeneity and local spatial association bailey and gatrell 1995 the landscape hierarchy was based on holons inspired in the application of the holon theory koestler 1978 to landscape integrated analysis monteiro 2001 representing a more flexible hierarchy than the typical bottom up or top down approaches from taxonomy the holons concept conveys the idea that subsystems at each level within a hierarchy are janus faced they act as wholes when facing downwards and as parts when facing upwards wu 1999 we adopted the landscape hierarchical zoning based on an integrative geobia framework for landscape analysis in the upper uruguay area freitas et al 2012 freitas and santos 2013 2014 in this study we utilized two hierarchical levels a landscape planning units lpu result of a compatibilization procedure of biophysical landscape units grounded on the rural census tracts of the demographic census of 2000 ibge 2000 and b holons inspired in the application of the holon theory koestler 1978 to landscape integrated analysis monteiro 2001 a higher hierarchical level 5 units result of cluster analysis on the lpu physical ecological and social variables the landscape hierarchical zoning defined by freitas et al 2012 freitas and santos 2013 2014 presents two hierarchical levels of holons at a higher hierarchical level we have 3 zones a a zone dominated by urbanization large scale agriculture and silviculture expansion processes including economically more active areas in terms of production and services holon a1 b a zone based on traditional practices of small farm agriculture composed by a heterogeneous mosaic of different land uses and including the larger patches of remaining forest holon a2 c a zone dominated by native grasslands permeated by silviculture large scale and small farm agriculture activities in some areas holon a3 from the division and reshaping of these landscape units it was defined a lower hierarchical level composed by 5 zones holon b1 rural belt around campos novos city dominated by large scale agriculture activities due to landscape potentialities as well developed soils in a plain plateau holon b2 traditional small farming area with remaining patches of forest correlated to landscape conditions as shallow soils and rugged relief holon b3 area dominated by native grassland presenting a relatively recent advance of agrosilvicultural activities according to more varied landscape conditions holon b4 conserved native grassland area covering shallow litholic soils in a high and plain plateau traditionally used by expansive cattle breeding holon b5 surrounding area of the urban industrial and services regional center of lages dominated by urbanization and silviculture expansion in a transition landscape in fig 1 we present the lower hierarchical level with landscape profiles representing the variation of landscape factors and its correlations following the geomorphological patterns 3 2 lucc modelling the landscam structure follows the majority of the existing lucc models being composed by six consecutive modules the six modules comprising landscam are consecutively assembled as follows a calculation of transition demands b definition and mapping of lucc processes c generation of transition probabilities maps d spatial allocation of lucc transitions e calibration and validation of the simulation results f generation of lucc prognosis scenarios 3 2 1 definition of transition demands and lucc processes mapping the first model module is composed by two complementary functions for calculating the transition demand and mapping the land use and cover changes using the initial and final land use and cover maps as inputs these functions are complementary with the transition demand result being used for coding the classified lucc processes the calculation of transition demand is based on a cross tabulation between the initial and final land use and cover maps resulting a transition demand matrix this transition demand matrix is calculated according to the markov chains method markov 2006 for each region provided by the user landscape zoning map in our study case considering a single time step which can be divided on multiple steps at the spatial allocation module markov chains are mathematical models used to describe processes moving in a sequence of steps and through a finite number of discrete states œâ the peculiarity of this kind of stochastic or random process is the presence of a particular property called as markov property which a state depends exclusively on the previous state desregarding the previous history mathematically the markov chains model can be expressed by the following equation 1 p x t 1 x x 0 x 0 x 1 x 1 x t x t p x t 1 x x t x t where the probability of the random variable x t 1 of assuming a value x giving the value at previous time steps x 0 x 1 x t is equal to the probability of assuming the value x giving that assumed the value x t at the previous moment thus the transition probability is the probability of the random variable x t of assuming a determinated value belonging to the space of states at the next moment x t 1 also called as step 3 2 2 definition and mapping of lucc processes based on the transition demand matrix results the user can define a codification of the actual transitions according to an unique value for each transition other option is to classify transitions clustering the transitions representing lucc processes as we choose in our study area due to the multiple land use and cover transitions this classification of the land use and cover transitions is provided by a lucc processes matrix fig 2 such matrix was based on the adaptation of the lucc processes defined by freitas et al 2013 for this study area this lucc process oriented approach is important for the modelling of areas with multiple and complex land use and cover transitions allowing a simplification of the procedure for the generation of transition probabilities maps especially in our study case among the 42 possible and the 21 actual land use and cover transitions we classified seven lucc processes only the resulting lucc processes map is used as input in the next module generation of transition probabilities maps and together with the lucc processes matrix in the spatial allocation module 3 2 3 generation of transition probabilities maps for the generation of transition probabilities maps as in other lucc models verburg et al 2002 soares filho et al 2002 xu et al 2016 we choose a multivariate binary logistic regression technique hosmer and lemeshow 2000 this technique indicates the probability of a cell to assume a certain transition according to a set of continuous and categorical independent variables the procedure developed for this analysis is composed by three steps a spatial balanced random sampling of the dependent and independent variables b logistic regression analysis and c calculation of the transition probabilities maps spatial balanced random sampling for the initial spatial balanced random sampling of the dependent and independent variables we implemented a module inspired in the random sampling tool of the clue s model verburg et al 2002 detailed in section 2 1 of supplement such module is divided in two consecutive steps a definition of the sampled pixels indexes b generation of the tables with the independent variables data logistic regression analysis we performed the logistic regression analysis of the lucc processes by using the r base r development core team 2008 and design harrel junior 2012 packages the initial procedure for variables selection was a stepwise backward logistic regression based on wald statistic using a significance level of 0 10 to not discard important variables related to the lucc processes dependent variables we adopted this significance level according to the recommendations of hosmer and lemeshow 2000 that considered significance levels between 0 05 and 0 2 to select the independent variables present in the final models we evaluated the outcomes from the stepwise regression according to three criteria the effective contribution of the variables the presence of multicollinearity effects between independent variables and the model performance to evaluate the contribution of the variables we performed two analysis of variance anova tests the deviance value test considering the inclusion of each variable alone in the model compared to the null model just intercept and the likelihood ratio test considering the exclusion of each variable from the model we evaluated the multicollinearity issues using the variance inflation factor vif that estimates the increase in the regression coefficients related to collinearity between independent variables variables with vif greater than 10 present multicollinearity issues neter et al 1985 the performance of logistic regression models is based on the receiver operating characteristic roc curve and its area under curve auc with values ranging from 0 5 to 1 when the model can not distinguish none of the groups of success and failure classifications the auc value is equal to 0 5 and when there is a perfect separation between them the auc value is equal to 1 for example the auc value equal to 0 8 represents a greater number of successful classifications in 80 of the cases in a random sampling hosmer and lemeshow 2000 calculation of the transition probabilities maps to perform the calculation of the transition probabilities maps we developed an individual module for each lucc process modelled by logistic regression this module inputs are i the continuous and categorical independent variables raster layers and ii a list including the intercept and the variables coefficients from this inputs the transition probabilities maps are calculated according to the logistic regression model 2 p i j e Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 1 x 1 i j Œ≤ n xn i j 1 e Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 1 x 1 i j Œ≤ n xn i j where p i j is the transition probability in each pixel Œ≤ 0 is the model intercept Œ≤ 1 n is the coefficient of each independent variable and xn i j is the value of the independent variable in each pixel 3 2 4 spatial allocation of lucc transitions for the spatial allocation of the lucc transitions we developed a module to perform simulations based on a deterministic cellular automata algorithm aside a stochastic region growing patch generation algorithm beyond differences on the implementation of the algorithms the major differences in relation to other lucc models e g dinamica ego is related to the separation between the deterministic and stochastic spatial allocation functions other difference is the use of regions for the spatial allocation of the transition demands allowing more control to the modeller according to the knowledge of intra regional realities and the coupling of regional and local scale demand models the inputs of the spatial allocation module are the initial land use and cover map the regions map the transition probabilities maps the lucc processes matrix and the regional transition demands the parameters defined by the modeller are the number of neighbours from 1 to 8 considered in a 3x3 cellular automata window the number of time steps and the percentage from 0 to 100 of the transition demands to be allocated by each one of the two allocation functions the initial procedure for the spatial allocation of the lucc transitions is the generation of the transition demands in multiple time steps according to the number of time steps defined by the modeller then is performed the proportional division of the transition demands according to the percentage of the deterministic cellular automata function defined by the modeller for each transition following the equation 3 td tr pca tr cellular automata 100 ppg tr patch generation 100 nt where td r is the total transition demand t in region r in a single time step pca is the percentage of the deterministic cellular automata function ppg is the percentage of the stochastic patch generation function where ppg 100 pca and nt is the number of time steps deterministic cellular automata function to reach the transition demands according to the expansion of existing land use and cover patches e g expansion of current agricultural patches in the border with a forest patch we developed deterministic cellular automata based routines for neighbourhood analysis and candidate pixels ordination in an interactive procedure the neighbourhood analysis 3x3 pixels moore neighbourhood counts the number of pixels from the same class of the central pixel and the number of neighbours from each class based on this neighbour analysis the candidates pixels are filtered according to the following if then clause 4 if nl v then m ijr l ijr where nl is the number of cells from class l in the 3 3 pixels window m ijr is the central pixel of the window from class m in region r l ijr is a pixel present at the candidates pixels list to the transition from class m to class l and v is the number of neighbours parameter defined by the modeller fig 3 after this initial candidates pixels filtering these are ordered according to the transition probabilities maps for each transition identified by the lucc process matrix finally the candidates pixels are chosen until satisfaction of each transition demand required in each region stochastic patch generation function for the generation of patches simulating lucc transitions e g new patches of agriculture or silviculture located inside native grassland matrix we developed a growing region procedure from seeds pixels chosen in a stochastic way the parameters defined by the modeller are the average and standard deviation of the patch area in square meters of each transition tables 1 and 2 these area parameters can be calculated from the lucc transitions changes between initial and final land use and cover maps in gis environment or landscape metrics software macgarigal and marks 1995 outside the model the number of random seeds and the area of each patch to be grown are defined according to a gaussian distribution with the area average and standard deviation parameters the seeds from each initial class of the transitions are selected to change for the final class and in several iterations the neighbouring pixels are selected in a radial circular pattern until the calculated patch area is achieved fig 4 3 2 5 calibration and validation of simulations for the calibration and validation of the model simulations in the two periods from 1986 to 2002 and from 2002 to 2008 we compared the simulated land use and cover maps to the real land use and cover in the final time step 2002 and 2008 respectively based on the validation results we performed the calibration of the model parameters and selected the best simulation result the calibrated parameters were the number of time steps 16 and 20 respectively the number of neighbours in the cellular automata 3 in both time periods and the proportion between the cellular automata and the patch generation functions for each lucc transition the validation technique adopted was the multi resolution validation procedure based on moving windows costanza 1989 designed for the evaluation of ecological simulation models and is frequently used in lucc models soares filho et al 2002 verburg et al 2002 castella and verburg 2007 this validation procedure detailed in supplement section 2 4 is based on the fit proportions at each moving window with increasing size from 1 1 to 15 15 pixels defined as 1 the proportion of coincidences between the simulated and the real maps the multi resolution validation procedure based on moving windows costanza 1989 is performed at all moving windows being aggregated according to the following formula 5 f w s 1 t w 1 i 1 c a 1 i a 2 i 2 w 2 s t w where f w is the fit for window size w w is the pixels dimension of one side of the window a ki is the number of cells of class i in map k in the sampling window c is the number of different classes in the window s is the sampling window of dimension w by w sliding through the map one pixel at a time and t w is the total number of sampling windows in the map for window size w an overall degree of fit between the simulated and the real maps is determined by the weighted average of the fits at the different windows sizes which allows more weight to be given to smaller sampling window sizes using the following formula 6 f t w 1 n f w e k w 1 w 1 n e k w 1 where f t is the weighted average of the fits over all windows sizes f w is the fit at the window of dimension w w is the pixels dimension of one side of the window and k is a constant this formula presents an exponential decay function of the weight to be given to small versus large sampling window determined by the value of k where if k 0 all windows have the same weight and if k 1 only the smallest windows will be important these validation measures were used for the comparison on the calibration of the simulation parameters beginning the calibration from a deterministic model and slowly incorporating randomness in the model the initial model parameters configuration is generated using just the deterministic cellular automata function 100 of the proportion between the functions for all transitions as the resulting simulation does not change the modeller can evaluate the role of the random effects from the patch generation function which can be gradually introduced in the parametrization 3 2 6 generation of lucc scenarios due to the lack of local scale data and the incompatible scale of regional and global demand models we adopted an empirical and theoretical approach implementing a system dynamics model for the definition of future transition demands as other lucc models xu et al 2016 we generated three base lucc scenarios according to three different perspectives on socio economic development a a business as usual bau scenario following the present trend of the capitalist development b an economic scenario reflecting the magnification and intensification of the present model of capitalist development and c an ecological scenario representing an alternative strategy based on sustainable and participative development for scenario generation we defined different increments on the regional transition demands related to the lucc processes identified according to the landscape zoning typologies for the definition of the increment rates on the original transition demands from the period of years 2002 to 2008 we implemented a system dynamics model in the netlogo modelling environment wilensky 1999 this system dynamics model was based on four factors related to the lucc scenarios capital and environment representing the values and emphasis of the model of development adopted by society and traditional and modern technologies representing the adopted types of technologies the factors related to the intensification of the model of capitalist development were represented by values ranging from 0 to 0 5 while the factors related to alternative development scenarios assumed values ranging from 0 to 0 5 fig 5 from these scenarios factors according to a system dynamics model fig 6 we calculate the increment rate on the transition demands following this formula 7 inc sc d t d t w k z m y e u t d t d t where inc sc is the increment rate of the transition demand for each lucc process d t k is the capital factor m is the modern technology factor e is the environmental factor t is the traditional technology factor w z y e u are constants these constants ranging from 0 7 to 0 9 are fixed rates for each factor according to the factors importance in each region and lucc process 4 results and discussion 4 1 regional transition demands the predominant transition demands were small farm agriculture to forest in the period from 1986 to 2002 while in the period from 2002 to 2008 were the transitions related to silviculture expansion when considering other transitions and related lucc processes there was a similar behaviour in the two time periods excepting for holon b3 which presented an overall demand increase related to the faster pace of landscape change in it holon b1 presented a predominance of transition demands associated with degradation intensification and extensification processes holon b2 showed a predominance of transitions associated with forest regeneration degradation and intensification processes holon b4 presented lower transition demands typical of its predominant land use of extensive cattle breeding in holon b5 occurred the predominance of transitions related to silviculture expansion degradation and urbanization the resulting transition demands from the two modelling time periods are presented in supplement tables 4 and 5 4 2 maps of lucc processes the results of the mapping of lucc processes in the two time periods fig 7 were used as the basis to define the dependent variables in the logistic regression models applied for the calculation of the transition probabilities maps the adoption of a process oriented approach allowed simplification of this model procedure that would be otherwise complicated when applying lucc dynamic models in areas with multiple and complex lucc processes due to the high number of land use and cover classes and lucc transitions 4 3 transition probabilities maps the transition probabilities maps for the lucc processes figs 8 and 9 were based on the logistic regression models the lucc process models in the two time periods presented a number of independent variables from 3 to 14 significance levels lower than 0 07 the logistic regression models presented overall good performance as shown by auc values ranging from 0 808 forest degradation to 0 908 urbanization in 1986 2002 and from 0 738 regeneration to 0 931 urbanization in 2002 2008 the independent variables were determined by interactions between geomorphometric elevation slope and local relief landscape metrics distance between patches edge density patch number patch area largest patch index fractal dimension and shape index environmental maps geomorphological units and soils associations euclidean distance distance from roads rivers and urban patches and social population density and economically active population variables confirming the interdependence of physical ecological and social lucc driving factors found by freitas et al 2013 these models are detailed in supplement tables 4 and 5 showing the selected independent variables the odds ratio coefficients the significance levels p values and the area under the curve auc 4 4 lucc simulations results calibration and validation the results of the simulations in the two periods can be considered moderate to good as the fitting of the multi resolution moving windows validation procedure sampling windows size from 1 1 to 15 15 pixels the simulated model fit was also compared to that of a null model initial and final land use being the same as the validation of a simulation not presenting changes in the modelling period this comparative analysis is a reference for evaluating the validation results since it is uncommon that the validation of simulation results would present greater values than the null models pontius et al 2008 the validation of the simulation results of the period from 1986 to 2002 fig 10 presented better performance global average fit equal to 0 771 than the null model 0 703 fig 11 this can be related to the smaller complexity and intensity of the lucc transition patterns in this period the comparison of the simulated and the real land use and cover classes areas in 2002 table 3 presented errors lower than 2 8 excepting the urban class 9 57 in contrast the validation of the simulation results of the period from 2002 to 2008 fig 12 presented comparatively worse performance global average fit equal to 0 646 than the null model 0 708 fig 13 this can be related to the greater complexity and intensity of the lucc transition patterns in this period especially the silviculture expansion and small farm agriculture related processes the comparison of the simulated and the real land use and cover classes areas in 2008 table 3 presented errors lower than 3 5 4 5 lucc simulations discussion the lucc patterns of the simulation from 1986 to 2002 followed the main characteristics of the land use systems and landscape mosaics typical of the different landscape zones degradation and intensification processes related to large scale agriculture dominated changes in the modern and productive agricultural area of holon b1 holon b2 characterized by traditional small farming agriculture or smallholdings was dominated by regeneration and the small farm agriculture extensification and degradation lucc processes in holon b3 landscape mosaic originally composed by native grasslands and extensive cattle breeding concentrated the silviculture expansion in this time period holon b4 presented small changes in the traditional extensive cattle grazing while holon b5 concentrated the urbanization process around the city of lages which presented a large population increase in this period in relation to the model calibration of the partitioning between the deterministic cellular automata and the stochastic patches generated for this first period from 1986 to 2002 table 4 a larger number of lucc transitions followed the pattern of expansion of the pre existing patches represented by the cellular automata function while the patch generation function was more frequently used to represent the transitions related to silviculture expansion process and the transition from native grasslands to large scale agriculture despite the difficulties in modelling lucc transitions in the period from 2002 to 2008 lucc patterns also followed the landscape mosaics characteristics transitions related to extensification and intensification occurred in the rural belt around the city of campos novos in holon b1 forest regeneration processes occurred especially in the areas of traditional small farming in holon b2 holon b3 experienced increased degradation related to mixed and large scale agricultures holon b4 showed relatively little changes with some new silviculture expansion transitions dominating lucc in the surrounding of the urban industrial regional center of lages in holon b5 suggesting an inherent connection between silviculture expansion and the industrial mode of production in this last time period a greater proportion of the stochastic patch generation function was used table 5 especially to represent the transitions related to the intense silviculture expansion process however a majority of lucc transitions appeared to be generally related to the expansion of the previous land use and cover patches as in the previous period table 6 4 6 lucc scenario simulation the three lucc scenarios bau economic and ecological of the period from 2008 to 2030 fig 14 corresponded to possible lucc trends according to different development alternatives resulting from the actions of multiple decision making agents operating at different scales during simulation we performed the increment calibration on the original transition demands of the latest simulation period from 2002 to 2008 to achieve more realistic scenarios according to the different landscape potentialities and the saturation indicators of lucc processes of each region when considering the estimation of the total area of forests and native grasslands among the three scenarios fig 15 the largest amount of forests were obtained for the ecological scenario the smallest in the economic scenario representing the higher or lower degree of concern with landscape conservation and environmentally sustainable land use activities while an intermediate value was found in the business as usual bau scenario the total amount of silviculture and large scale agriculture in the three scenarios showed an inverse relation to the increasing or decreasing area of forests and native grasslands suggesting a close relation between these land use classes and degradation lucc processes the total area of small farm agriculture was larger in bau and intermediate than in the in economic scenario in agreement with the expansion and contraction of the intensification and extensification processes while the smallest area was found in the ecological scenario due to greater importance of the regeneration process the total area of the urban class did not show large variations between the three scenarios due to the spatial concentration of urbanization and to verticalization in the detriment of urban sprawling the three lucc scenarios fig 16 presented some possible lucc trends according to the model of development adopted by the society and its agents at multiple decision making scales during the scenarios simulations to achieve more realistic scenarios according to the different landscape potentialities and the saturation signals of lucc processes of each region we performed the calibration of the increments on the original transition demands of the latest simulation period from 2002 to 2008 in relation to the total area of the land cover classes in the three scenarios fig 15 larger area was found in the ecological scenario intermediate total area in the bau scenario and smaller area in the economic scenario which represent the higher or lower degree of concern with landscape conservation and environmentally sustainable land use activities the total amount of silviculture and large scale agriculture in the three scenarios showed an inverse relation to the increase or decrease of land cover classes revealing the close relation between these land use classes and degradation lucc processes the total area of mixed agriculture was larger in bau and intermediate in economic scenarios according to the expansion and contraction of the intensification and extensification processes while the smaller areas were found in the ecological scenario according to a greater presence of the regeneration process the total area of urban class did not show large variations between the three scenarios due to the elevated spatial concentration of urbanization and to the vertical expansion trend of the cities in the detriment of the urban patch growing itself 4 7 lucc scenarios discussion results from business as usual scenario highlighted the danger of the current development trajectory for future landscape conservation conditions associated with silviculture expansion around lages in holon b5 demands associated with silviculture expansion were estimated to be reduced in 30 in comparison to present levels suggesting a saturation trend of silviculture expansion in the next years to satisfy the current transition demands of silviculture expansion holon b4 has received the majority of missing transitions in relation to its proximity to holon b5 and its prevailing native grasslands land cover another region presenting saturation tendencies was the rural belt in holon b1 where increased extensification could be related to an accommodation of large scale agriculture in more suitable and productive areas holon b3 presented an increasing trend of native grasslands degradation by large scale agriculture around the city of esmeralda and forest degradation in conjunction with silviculture expansion in the other areas holon b2 was dominated by the competitive degradation and regeneration lucc processes related to small farm agriculture the economic scenario representing the expansion and intensification of the present development model suggested stronger environmental impacts related to silviculture expansion in holon b5 transition demands related to silviculture expansion were reduced in 20 in this holon according to the saturation of this lucc process in the region while holon b4 received the majority of the remaining silviculture expansion transitions despite the trend of saturation of agricultural activities in the rural belt in holon b1 the intensification processes continued to increase in the economic scenario holon b3 presented an increase of native grasslands degradation around esmeralda city by large scale agriculture and of degradation by small farm agriculture and silviculture expansion processes holon b2 presented an increase of degradation and a decrease of regeneration lucc processes revealing an imbalance of the traditional land use dynamics pattern of the familiar agriculture region the ecological scenario attempted to represent an alternative model of development focused on the valorization of environmental management and traditional technologies also influenced by modern scientific techniques as agroecology herrera 1981 hence the transition demands of silviculture expansion in holon b5 decreased in 80 due to the saturation trend of these activities around lages city in this scenario holon b4 presented small transition demands due to the importance of native grasslands conservation holon b1 presented an increase of extensification and a decrease of intensification processes reflecting a valorization of agroecological practices and products e g organic foods and products and the concentration of large scale agriculture in more productive and suitable areas holon b3 presented a decrease of the degradation processes by large scale and mixed agriculture as well as a decrease in silviculture expansion representing slower paces of alteration of the natural land cover in holon b2 the degradation by small farm agriculture decreased while the regeneration process increased following a more generalized adoption of agroecological and conservationist practices in its landscape mosaics a traditional technologies core area 5 conclusion the lucc spatial dynamics model presented in this study offered a contribution to the generation of simulations and scenarios in situations of multiple competitive and complex lucc processes the modelling approach based on the combination of process oriented procedures spatial analysis on lucc transitions spatial regimes parametrization deterministic and stochastic spatial allocation functions validation techniques and systems dynamics for scenarios generation was successful and can be complemented by several improvements to achieve more realistic models an example of future enhancements is the development of non stationary methods for the definition of transition demands which were based on a stationary markovian approach the use of spatial regimes landscape hierarchical zoning in this study in the model parametrization especially in the transition demands definition allowed an important control over the spatial allocation results the possibility of dividing the spatial allocation in deterministic cellular automata and stochastic patches generation functions facilitated the calibration procedures starting from determinism and gradually incorporating stochasticity in the lucc models the use of a

model developed in this study provided contributions to the generation of simulations and scenarios in situations related to multiple competitive and complex lucc processes keywords land use and cover change spatial dynamics model cellular automata model scenarios 1 introduction large scale and complex land use and cover change lucc has significantly intensified in the last century due to such anthropogenic processes as agricultural and urban expansion landscape homogenization and others meyer and turner 1992 ramankutty et al 2006 spatially modern land use systems directly compete with remained less disturbed natural forests and grasslands and more traditional heterogeneous family agriculture freitas et al 2013 miranda et al 2015 the evaluation of lucc environmental and social effects of landscape homogenization degradation and conversion of natural vegetation such as the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services the increase of greenhouse gas emissions and socio economic and cultural impacts remain a challenge and are considered a very significant research topic due to their magnitude newbold et al 2015 gossner et al 2016 in the present days the impacts of urban and agricultural expansion and landscape homogenization occur at all scales from global to local this is also true in southern brazil where rapid and intensive conversion degradation lucc processes have occurred in the past century and have especially accelerated since the 1950s with the expansion of the agribusiness following the so called green revolution and with the big boost of forestry in the late 1960s consolidated in the period from 1980 to 2000 egler 2001 overbeck et al 2007 de moraes gon√ßalves et al 2013 the lucc is closely related to decision making processes applied to environmental management and territorial planning being useful the use of scenarios that are possible perspectives of the future based on economical social cultural and technological conditions alcamo et al 2006 spatially explicit and quantitative scenarios are based on modelling and analysis of actual lucc transitions considered as conversions from one land use and cover class to another e g forest to urban and modifications of conditions within a broad category e g small farm agriculture to large scale agriculture meyer and turner 1992 different approaches have been developed and applied for lucc modelling and analysis as non spatial models based on economic theories of development and econometric statistical applications and spatial models based on computational approaches as probabilistic cellular automata and agent based modelling briassoulis 2000 verburg et al 2006 since the late 1970 s tobler 1979 computational spatial dynamics models have been developed using self organizing complex systems notions as cellular automata which are used to represent the evolution of complex global structures emerging from simple local neighbourhood rules wolfram 1984 lewin 1992 such computational models evolved to modelling frameworks like dinamica ego soares filho et al 2002 moland engelen et al 2007 and clue s verburg et al 2002 including modular functions for implementing lucc models procedures according to cellular automata and or probabilistic approaches in the case of clue s some of the implementation disadvantages of the different spatial dynamics models are related to difficulties of the cellular automata approach to represent multiple and competitive transitions verburg et al 2002 and to the computational limits related to spatial resolution bringing the need to resample the original data to coarser resolutions even in urban models almeida et al 2008 some assumptions made by existing models may present some limitation in that they unrealistically assume temporal stationarity as the markovian approach considering the same behaviour during all time steps of the model which is not an usual characteristic of complex systems mandelbrot and hudson 2010 the same can be said of the spatial stationarity assuming the non existence of clusters and the homogeneity of the spatial conditions by using global parameters in the models fotheringham et al 2002 to contribute to some of these remaining challenges we developed a spatial dynamics computational model in the fortran 90 language denominated landscam landscape dynamics simulation cellular automata model freitas 2013 it has adopted a open modular structure which facilitates the implementation of new routines and the alteration and the model adaptation by new users and studies the landscam modelling approach was based on the main lucc models such as dinamica ego soares filho et al 2002 moland engelen et al 2007 and clue s verburg et al 2002 adopting a modular structure including the main procedures involved in the lucc spatial dynamics model these procedures offer the tools to perform transition demands definition spatial analysis for generating transition probabilities maps simulation functions for spatial allocation of lucc transitions tools for calibrating and validating the model simulations results and generating prognosis scenarios soares filho et al 2002 verburg et al 2002 2006 in our lucc model we have applied these methods and techniques in a conjugate way focusing on a the use of regions for model parametrization and calibration to deal with spatial heterogeneity and non stationarity b the classification and application of lucc processes to simplify and enhance modelling in case of multiple land use and cover classes and transitions c the use of deterministic and stochastic approaches in the spatial allocation of the transitions d maximum freedom for model parameterization allowing the user several options e model stability and performance even when using less performing computers allowing the use of large extent raster datasets and the implementation of lucc models in a variety of spatial resolution offered by existing remotely sensed data e g landsat aster sentinel etc the main differences of the landscam approach compared to the modelling structure of the cited models are a the model orientation for lucc process allowing the aggregation of multiple land use and cover transitions simplifying lucc modelling of study areas with multiple and complex land use and cover transitions b the mandatory application of regions defined by the user for transition demands calculation transitions spatial allocation and model calibration c the development of procedures for spatial allocation of transitions divided on a deterministic cellular automata and a stochastic patch generation functions transition demands and spatial allocation parameters are defined regionally according to zones chosen by the user which may represent municipalities districts river basins and other regional configurations in consequence the user can easily adopt macro and micro spatial scale relationships in the definition of transition demands and in the model parameterization the objective of this work was to present the implementation of the spatial dynamics model landscam and the results from the simulation of land use and cover change lucc in the period between 1986 2002 and 2008 and scenarios generation until 2030 for a region characterized by multiple competitive and complex lucc processes in the upper uruguay river basin 2 study area the study area comprises 12 000 km2 of the upper uruguay river basin figure including 18 municipalities in the border of rio grande do sul and santa catarina states in southern brazil its two more important municipalities are lages a regional urban industrial and services center and campos novos which concentrates the largest agricultural production with other municipalities being mainly rural mosaics of large scale and small farming agriculture and less developed urbanization and industrialization the area is located in an ecotone between the atlantic forest and southern fields or pampa biomes originally covered by araucaria forest and high altitude grasslands respectively the occupation of this area by european colonization began in the late xix century resulting in rapid and widespread lucc during the xx century especially from the 1950s following the expansion of large scale mechanized agriculture and silviculture resulting in the degradation and conversion of native forests and grasslands at the same time as the traditional heterogeneous areas of colonial small farming were converted also to modern homogeneous land uses 3 methods 3 1 data to implement our model we have used a landscape hierarchical zoning units as regions spatial regimes b multitemporal land use maps based on remote sensing data classification as dependent variables c physical thematic environmental maps and geomorphometric data ecological landscape metrics derived from land use and cover classification and social census data as independent variables d euclidean distance based variables distance from roads and rivers all variables were processed and organized in geographic information system gis and geographic objects based image analysis geobia environments we provide a detailed characterization of the data processing and the data in supplement section 1 in this study we adopted the landscape hierarchical zoning based on an integrative framework for landscape analysis in the upper uruguay area freitas et al 2012 freitas and santos 2013 2014 as spatial regimes i e regions modelled with different parameters reflecting the presence of spatial heterogeneity and local spatial association bailey and gatrell 1995 the landscape hierarchy was based on holons inspired in the application of the holon theory koestler 1978 to landscape integrated analysis monteiro 2001 representing a more flexible hierarchy than the typical bottom up or top down approaches from taxonomy the holons concept conveys the idea that subsystems at each level within a hierarchy are janus faced they act as wholes when facing downwards and as parts when facing upwards wu 1999 we adopted the landscape hierarchical zoning based on an integrative geobia framework for landscape analysis in the upper uruguay area freitas et al 2012 freitas and santos 2013 2014 in this study we utilized two hierarchical levels a landscape planning units lpu result of a compatibilization procedure of biophysical landscape units grounded on the rural census tracts of the demographic census of 2000 ibge 2000 and b holons inspired in the application of the holon theory koestler 1978 to landscape integrated analysis monteiro 2001 a higher hierarchical level 5 units result of cluster analysis on the lpu physical ecological and social variables the landscape hierarchical zoning defined by freitas et al 2012 freitas and santos 2013 2014 presents two hierarchical levels of holons at a higher hierarchical level we have 3 zones a a zone dominated by urbanization large scale agriculture and silviculture expansion processes including economically more active areas in terms of production and services holon a1 b a zone based on traditional practices of small farm agriculture composed by a heterogeneous mosaic of different land uses and including the larger patches of remaining forest holon a2 c a zone dominated by native grasslands permeated by silviculture large scale and small farm agriculture activities in some areas holon a3 from the division and reshaping of these landscape units it was defined a lower hierarchical level composed by 5 zones holon b1 rural belt around campos novos city dominated by large scale agriculture activities due to landscape potentialities as well developed soils in a plain plateau holon b2 traditional small farming area with remaining patches of forest correlated to landscape conditions as shallow soils and rugged relief holon b3 area dominated by native grassland presenting a relatively recent advance of agrosilvicultural activities according to more varied landscape conditions holon b4 conserved native grassland area covering shallow litholic soils in a high and plain plateau traditionally used by expansive cattle breeding holon b5 surrounding area of the urban industrial and services regional center of lages dominated by urbanization and silviculture expansion in a transition landscape in fig 1 we present the lower hierarchical level with landscape profiles representing the variation of landscape factors and its correlations following the geomorphological patterns 3 2 lucc modelling the landscam structure follows the majority of the existing lucc models being composed by six consecutive modules the six modules comprising landscam are consecutively assembled as follows a calculation of transition demands b definition and mapping of lucc processes c generation of transition probabilities maps d spatial allocation of lucc transitions e calibration and validation of the simulation results f generation of lucc prognosis scenarios 3 2 1 definition of transition demands and lucc processes mapping the first model module is composed by two complementary functions for calculating the transition demand and mapping the land use and cover changes using the initial and final land use and cover maps as inputs these functions are complementary with the transition demand result being used for coding the classified lucc processes the calculation of transition demand is based on a cross tabulation between the initial and final land use and cover maps resulting a transition demand matrix this transition demand matrix is calculated according to the markov chains method markov 2006 for each region provided by the user landscape zoning map in our study case considering a single time step which can be divided on multiple steps at the spatial allocation module markov chains are mathematical models used to describe processes moving in a sequence of steps and through a finite number of discrete states œâ the peculiarity of this kind of stochastic or random process is the presence of a particular property called as markov property which a state depends exclusively on the previous state desregarding the previous history mathematically the markov chains model can be expressed by the following equation 1 p x t 1 x x 0 x 0 x 1 x 1 x t x t p x t 1 x x t x t where the probability of the random variable x t 1 of assuming a value x giving the value at previous time steps x 0 x 1 x t is equal to the probability of assuming the value x giving that assumed the value x t at the previous moment thus the transition probability is the probability of the random variable x t of assuming a determinated value belonging to the space of states at the next moment x t 1 also called as step 3 2 2 definition and mapping of lucc processes based on the transition demand matrix results the user can define a codification of the actual transitions according to an unique value for each transition other option is to classify transitions clustering the transitions representing lucc processes as we choose in our study area due to the multiple land use and cover transitions this classification of the land use and cover transitions is provided by a lucc processes matrix fig 2 such matrix was based on the adaptation of the lucc processes defined by freitas et al 2013 for this study area this lucc process oriented approach is important for the modelling of areas with multiple and complex land use and cover transitions allowing a simplification of the procedure for the generation of transition probabilities maps especially in our study case among the 42 possible and the 21 actual land use and cover transitions we classified seven lucc processes only the resulting lucc processes map is used as input in the next module generation of transition probabilities maps and together with the lucc processes matrix in the spatial allocation module 3 2 3 generation of transition probabilities maps for the generation of transition probabilities maps as in other lucc models verburg et al 2002 soares filho et al 2002 xu et al 2016 we choose a multivariate binary logistic regression technique hosmer and lemeshow 2000 this technique indicates the probability of a cell to assume a certain transition according to a set of continuous and categorical independent variables the procedure developed for this analysis is composed by three steps a spatial balanced random sampling of the dependent and independent variables b logistic regression analysis and c calculation of the transition probabilities maps spatial balanced random sampling for the initial spatial balanced random sampling of the dependent and independent variables we implemented a module inspired in the random sampling tool of the clue s model verburg et al 2002 detailed in section 2 1 of supplement such module is divided in two consecutive steps a definition of the sampled pixels indexes b generation of the tables with the independent variables data logistic regression analysis we performed the logistic regression analysis of the lucc processes by using the r base r development core team 2008 and design harrel junior 2012 packages the initial procedure for variables selection was a stepwise backward logistic regression based on wald statistic using a significance level of 0 10 to not discard important variables related to the lucc processes dependent variables we adopted this significance level according to the recommendations of hosmer and lemeshow 2000 that considered significance levels between 0 05 and 0 2 to select the independent variables present in the final models we evaluated the outcomes from the stepwise regression according to three criteria the effective contribution of the variables the presence of multicollinearity effects between independent variables and the model performance to evaluate the contribution of the variables we performed two analysis of variance anova tests the deviance value test considering the inclusion of each variable alone in the model compared to the null model just intercept and the likelihood ratio test considering the exclusion of each variable from the model we evaluated the multicollinearity issues using the variance inflation factor vif that estimates the increase in the regression coefficients related to collinearity between independent variables variables with vif greater than 10 present multicollinearity issues neter et al 1985 the performance of logistic regression models is based on the receiver operating characteristic roc curve and its area under curve auc with values ranging from 0 5 to 1 when the model can not distinguish none of the groups of success and failure classifications the auc value is equal to 0 5 and when there is a perfect separation between them the auc value is equal to 1 for example the auc value equal to 0 8 represents a greater number of successful classifications in 80 of the cases in a random sampling hosmer and lemeshow 2000 calculation of the transition probabilities maps to perform the calculation of the transition probabilities maps we developed an individual module for each lucc process modelled by logistic regression this module inputs are i the continuous and categorical independent variables raster layers and ii a list including the intercept and the variables coefficients from this inputs the transition probabilities maps are calculated according to the logistic regression model 2 p i j e Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 1 x 1 i j Œ≤ n xn i j 1 e Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 1 x 1 i j Œ≤ n xn i j where p i j is the transition probability in each pixel Œ≤ 0 is the model intercept Œ≤ 1 n is the coefficient of each independent variable and xn i j is the value of the independent variable in each pixel 3 2 4 spatial allocation of lucc transitions for the spatial allocation of the lucc transitions we developed a module to perform simulations based on a deterministic cellular automata algorithm aside a stochastic region growing patch generation algorithm beyond differences on the implementation of the algorithms the major differences in relation to other lucc models e g dinamica ego is related to the separation between the deterministic and stochastic spatial allocation functions other difference is the use of regions for the spatial allocation of the transition demands allowing more control to the modeller according to the knowledge of intra regional realities and the coupling of regional and local scale demand models the inputs of the spatial allocation module are the initial land use and cover map the regions map the transition probabilities maps the lucc processes matrix and the regional transition demands the parameters defined by the modeller are the number of neighbours from 1 to 8 considered in a 3x3 cellular automata window the number of time steps and the percentage from 0 to 100 of the transition demands to be allocated by each one of the two allocation functions the initial procedure for the spatial allocation of the lucc transitions is the generation of the transition demands in multiple time steps according to the number of time steps defined by the modeller then is performed the proportional division of the transition demands according to the percentage of the deterministic cellular automata function defined by the modeller for each transition following the equation 3 td tr pca tr cellular automata 100 ppg tr patch generation 100 nt where td r is the total transition demand t in region r in a single time step pca is the percentage of the deterministic cellular automata function ppg is the percentage of the stochastic patch generation function where ppg 100 pca and nt is the number of time steps deterministic cellular automata function to reach the transition demands according to the expansion of existing land use and cover patches e g expansion of current agricultural patches in the border with a forest patch we developed deterministic cellular automata based routines for neighbourhood analysis and candidate pixels ordination in an interactive procedure the neighbourhood analysis 3x3 pixels moore neighbourhood counts the number of pixels from the same class of the central pixel and the number of neighbours from each class based on this neighbour analysis the candidates pixels are filtered according to the following if then clause 4 if nl v then m ijr l ijr where nl is the number of cells from class l in the 3 3 pixels window m ijr is the central pixel of the window from class m in region r l ijr is a pixel present at the candidates pixels list to the transition from class m to class l and v is the number of neighbours parameter defined by the modeller fig 3 after this initial candidates pixels filtering these are ordered according to the transition probabilities maps for each transition identified by the lucc process matrix finally the candidates pixels are chosen until satisfaction of each transition demand required in each region stochastic patch generation function for the generation of patches simulating lucc transitions e g new patches of agriculture or silviculture located inside native grassland matrix we developed a growing region procedure from seeds pixels chosen in a stochastic way the parameters defined by the modeller are the average and standard deviation of the patch area in square meters of each transition tables 1 and 2 these area parameters can be calculated from the lucc transitions changes between initial and final land use and cover maps in gis environment or landscape metrics software macgarigal and marks 1995 outside the model the number of random seeds and the area of each patch to be grown are defined according to a gaussian distribution with the area average and standard deviation parameters the seeds from each initial class of the transitions are selected to change for the final class and in several iterations the neighbouring pixels are selected in a radial circular pattern until the calculated patch area is achieved fig 4 3 2 5 calibration and validation of simulations for the calibration and validation of the model simulations in the two periods from 1986 to 2002 and from 2002 to 2008 we compared the simulated land use and cover maps to the real land use and cover in the final time step 2002 and 2008 respectively based on the validation results we performed the calibration of the model parameters and selected the best simulation result the calibrated parameters were the number of time steps 16 and 20 respectively the number of neighbours in the cellular automata 3 in both time periods and the proportion between the cellular automata and the patch generation functions for each lucc transition the validation technique adopted was the multi resolution validation procedure based on moving windows costanza 1989 designed for the evaluation of ecological simulation models and is frequently used in lucc models soares filho et al 2002 verburg et al 2002 castella and verburg 2007 this validation procedure detailed in supplement section 2 4 is based on the fit proportions at each moving window with increasing size from 1 1 to 15 15 pixels defined as 1 the proportion of coincidences between the simulated and the real maps the multi resolution validation procedure based on moving windows costanza 1989 is performed at all moving windows being aggregated according to the following formula 5 f w s 1 t w 1 i 1 c a 1 i a 2 i 2 w 2 s t w where f w is the fit for window size w w is the pixels dimension of one side of the window a ki is the number of cells of class i in map k in the sampling window c is the number of different classes in the window s is the sampling window of dimension w by w sliding through the map one pixel at a time and t w is the total number of sampling windows in the map for window size w an overall degree of fit between the simulated and the real maps is determined by the weighted average of the fits at the different windows sizes which allows more weight to be given to smaller sampling window sizes using the following formula 6 f t w 1 n f w e k w 1 w 1 n e k w 1 where f t is the weighted average of the fits over all windows sizes f w is the fit at the window of dimension w w is the pixels dimension of one side of the window and k is a constant this formula presents an exponential decay function of the weight to be given to small versus large sampling window determined by the value of k where if k 0 all windows have the same weight and if k 1 only the smallest windows will be important these validation measures were used for the comparison on the calibration of the simulation parameters beginning the calibration from a deterministic model and slowly incorporating randomness in the model the initial model parameters configuration is generated using just the deterministic cellular automata function 100 of the proportion between the functions for all transitions as the resulting simulation does not change the modeller can evaluate the role of the random effects from the patch generation function which can be gradually introduced in the parametrization 3 2 6 generation of lucc scenarios due to the lack of local scale data and the incompatible scale of regional and global demand models we adopted an empirical and theoretical approach implementing a system dynamics model for the definition of future transition demands as other lucc models xu et al 2016 we generated three base lucc scenarios according to three different perspectives on socio economic development a a business as usual bau scenario following the present trend of the capitalist development b an economic scenario reflecting the magnification and intensification of the present model of capitalist development and c an ecological scenario representing an alternative strategy based on sustainable and participative development for scenario generation we defined different increments on the regional transition demands related to the lucc processes identified according to the landscape zoning typologies for the definition of the increment rates on the original transition demands from the period of years 2002 to 2008 we implemented a system dynamics model in the netlogo modelling environment wilensky 1999 this system dynamics model was based on four factors related to the lucc scenarios capital and environment representing the values and emphasis of the model of development adopted by society and traditional and modern technologies representing the adopted types of technologies the factors related to the intensification of the model of capitalist development were represented by values ranging from 0 to 0 5 while the factors related to alternative development scenarios assumed values ranging from 0 to 0 5 fig 5 from these scenarios factors according to a system dynamics model fig 6 we calculate the increment rate on the transition demands following this formula 7 inc sc d t d t w k z m y e u t d t d t where inc sc is the increment rate of the transition demand for each lucc process d t k is the capital factor m is the modern technology factor e is the environmental factor t is the traditional technology factor w z y e u are constants these constants ranging from 0 7 to 0 9 are fixed rates for each factor according to the factors importance in each region and lucc process 4 results and discussion 4 1 regional transition demands the predominant transition demands were small farm agriculture to forest in the period from 1986 to 2002 while in the period from 2002 to 2008 were the transitions related to silviculture expansion when considering other transitions and related lucc processes there was a similar behaviour in the two time periods excepting for holon b3 which presented an overall demand increase related to the faster pace of landscape change in it holon b1 presented a predominance of transition demands associated with degradation intensification and extensification processes holon b2 showed a predominance of transitions associated with forest regeneration degradation and intensification processes holon b4 presented lower transition demands typical of its predominant land use of extensive cattle breeding in holon b5 occurred the predominance of transitions related to silviculture expansion degradation and urbanization the resulting transition demands from the two modelling time periods are presented in supplement tables 4 and 5 4 2 maps of lucc processes the results of the mapping of lucc processes in the two time periods fig 7 were used as the basis to define the dependent variables in the logistic regression models applied for the calculation of the transition probabilities maps the adoption of a process oriented approach allowed simplification of this model procedure that would be otherwise complicated when applying lucc dynamic models in areas with multiple and complex lucc processes due to the high number of land use and cover classes and lucc transitions 4 3 transition probabilities maps the transition probabilities maps for the lucc processes figs 8 and 9 were based on the logistic regression models the lucc process models in the two time periods presented a number of independent variables from 3 to 14 significance levels lower than 0 07 the logistic regression models presented overall good performance as shown by auc values ranging from 0 808 forest degradation to 0 908 urbanization in 1986 2002 and from 0 738 regeneration to 0 931 urbanization in 2002 2008 the independent variables were determined by interactions between geomorphometric elevation slope and local relief landscape metrics distance between patches edge density patch number patch area largest patch index fractal dimension and shape index environmental maps geomorphological units and soils associations euclidean distance distance from roads rivers and urban patches and social population density and economically active population variables confirming the interdependence of physical ecological and social lucc driving factors found by freitas et al 2013 these models are detailed in supplement tables 4 and 5 showing the selected independent variables the odds ratio coefficients the significance levels p values and the area under the curve auc 4 4 lucc simulations results calibration and validation the results of the simulations in the two periods can be considered moderate to good as the fitting of the multi resolution moving windows validation procedure sampling windows size from 1 1 to 15 15 pixels the simulated model fit was also compared to that of a null model initial and final land use being the same as the validation of a simulation not presenting changes in the modelling period this comparative analysis is a reference for evaluating the validation results since it is uncommon that the validation of simulation results would present greater values than the null models pontius et al 2008 the validation of the simulation results of the period from 1986 to 2002 fig 10 presented better performance global average fit equal to 0 771 than the null model 0 703 fig 11 this can be related to the smaller complexity and intensity of the lucc transition patterns in this period the comparison of the simulated and the real land use and cover classes areas in 2002 table 3 presented errors lower than 2 8 excepting the urban class 9 57 in contrast the validation of the simulation results of the period from 2002 to 2008 fig 12 presented comparatively worse performance global average fit equal to 0 646 than the null model 0 708 fig 13 this can be related to the greater complexity and intensity of the lucc transition patterns in this period especially the silviculture expansion and small farm agriculture related processes the comparison of the simulated and the real land use and cover classes areas in 2008 table 3 presented errors lower than 3 5 4 5 lucc simulations discussion the lucc patterns of the simulation from 1986 to 2002 followed the main characteristics of the land use systems and landscape mosaics typical of the different landscape zones degradation and intensification processes related to large scale agriculture dominated changes in the modern and productive agricultural area of holon b1 holon b2 characterized by traditional small farming agriculture or smallholdings was dominated by regeneration and the small farm agriculture extensification and degradation lucc processes in holon b3 landscape mosaic originally composed by native grasslands and extensive cattle breeding concentrated the silviculture expansion in this time period holon b4 presented small changes in the traditional extensive cattle grazing while holon b5 concentrated the urbanization process around the city of lages which presented a large population increase in this period in relation to the model calibration of the partitioning between the deterministic cellular automata and the stochastic patches generated for this first period from 1986 to 2002 table 4 a larger number of lucc transitions followed the pattern of expansion of the pre existing patches represented by the cellular automata function while the patch generation function was more frequently used to represent the transitions related to silviculture expansion process and the transition from native grasslands to large scale agriculture despite the difficulties in modelling lucc transitions in the period from 2002 to 2008 lucc patterns also followed the landscape mosaics characteristics transitions related to extensification and intensification occurred in the rural belt around the city of campos novos in holon b1 forest regeneration processes occurred especially in the areas of traditional small farming in holon b2 holon b3 experienced increased degradation related to mixed and large scale agricultures holon b4 showed relatively little changes with some new silviculture expansion transitions dominating lucc in the surrounding of the urban industrial regional center of lages in holon b5 suggesting an inherent connection between silviculture expansion and the industrial mode of production in this last time period a greater proportion of the stochastic patch generation function was used table 5 especially to represent the transitions related to the intense silviculture expansion process however a majority of lucc transitions appeared to be generally related to the expansion of the previous land use and cover patches as in the previous period table 6 4 6 lucc scenario simulation the three lucc scenarios bau economic and ecological of the period from 2008 to 2030 fig 14 corresponded to possible lucc trends according to different development alternatives resulting from the actions of multiple decision making agents operating at different scales during simulation we performed the increment calibration on the original transition demands of the latest simulation period from 2002 to 2008 to achieve more realistic scenarios according to the different landscape potentialities and the saturation indicators of lucc processes of each region when considering the estimation of the total area of forests and native grasslands among the three scenarios fig 15 the largest amount of forests were obtained for the ecological scenario the smallest in the economic scenario representing the higher or lower degree of concern with landscape conservation and environmentally sustainable land use activities while an intermediate value was found in the business as usual bau scenario the total amount of silviculture and large scale agriculture in the three scenarios showed an inverse relation to the increasing or decreasing area of forests and native grasslands suggesting a close relation between these land use classes and degradation lucc processes the total area of small farm agriculture was larger in bau and intermediate than in the in economic scenario in agreement with the expansion and contraction of the intensification and extensification processes while the smallest area was found in the ecological scenario due to greater importance of the regeneration process the total area of the urban class did not show large variations between the three scenarios due to the spatial concentration of urbanization and to verticalization in the detriment of urban sprawling the three lucc scenarios fig 16 presented some possible lucc trends according to the model of development adopted by the society and its agents at multiple decision making scales during the scenarios simulations to achieve more realistic scenarios according to the different landscape potentialities and the saturation signals of lucc processes of each region we performed the calibration of the increments on the original transition demands of the latest simulation period from 2002 to 2008 in relation to the total area of the land cover classes in the three scenarios fig 15 larger area was found in the ecological scenario intermediate total area in the bau scenario and smaller area in the economic scenario which represent the higher or lower degree of concern with landscape conservation and environmentally sustainable land use activities the total amount of silviculture and large scale agriculture in the three scenarios showed an inverse relation to the increase or decrease of land cover classes revealing the close relation between these land use classes and degradation lucc processes the total area of mixed agriculture was larger in bau and intermediate in economic scenarios according to the expansion and contraction of the intensification and extensification processes while the smaller areas were found in the ecological scenario according to a greater presence of the regeneration process the total area of urban class did not show large variations between the three scenarios due to the elevated spatial concentration of urbanization and to the vertical expansion trend of the cities in the detriment of the urban patch growing itself 4 7 lucc scenarios discussion results from business as usual scenario highlighted the danger of the current development trajectory for future landscape conservation conditions associated with silviculture expansion around lages in holon b5 demands associated with silviculture expansion were estimated to be reduced in 30 in comparison to present levels suggesting a saturation trend of silviculture expansion in the next years to satisfy the current transition demands of silviculture expansion holon b4 has received the majority of missing transitions in relation to its proximity to holon b5 and its prevailing native grasslands land cover another region presenting saturation tendencies was the rural belt in holon b1 where increased extensification could be related to an accommodation of large scale agriculture in more suitable and productive areas holon b3 presented an increasing trend of native grasslands degradation by large scale agriculture around the city of esmeralda and forest degradation in conjunction with silviculture expansion in the other areas holon b2 was dominated by the competitive degradation and regeneration lucc processes related to small farm agriculture the economic scenario representing the expansion and intensification of the present development model suggested stronger environmental impacts related to silviculture expansion in holon b5 transition demands related to silviculture expansion were reduced in 20 in this holon according to the saturation of this lucc process in the region while holon b4 received the majority of the remaining silviculture expansion transitions despite the trend of saturation of agricultural activities in the rural belt in holon b1 the intensification processes continued to increase in the economic scenario holon b3 presented an increase of native grasslands degradation around esmeralda city by large scale agriculture and of degradation by small farm agriculture and silviculture expansion processes holon b2 presented an increase of degradation and a decrease of regeneration lucc processes revealing an imbalance of the traditional land use dynamics pattern of the familiar agriculture region the ecological scenario attempted to represent an alternative model of development focused on the valorization of environmental management and traditional technologies also influenced by modern scientific techniques as agroecology herrera 1981 hence the transition demands of silviculture expansion in holon b5 decreased in 80 due to the saturation trend of these activities around lages city in this scenario holon b4 presented small transition demands due to the importance of native grasslands conservation holon b1 presented an increase of extensification and a decrease of intensification processes reflecting a valorization of agroecological practices and products e g organic foods and products and the concentration of large scale agriculture in more productive and suitable areas holon b3 presented a decrease of the degradation processes by large scale and mixed agriculture as well as a decrease in silviculture expansion representing slower paces of alteration of the natural land cover in holon b2 the degradation by small farm agriculture decreased while the regeneration process increased following a more generalized adoption of agroecological and conservationist practices in its landscape mosaics a traditional technologies core area 5 conclusion the lucc spatial dynamics model presented in this study offered a contribution to the generation of simulations and scenarios in situations of multiple competitive and complex lucc processes the modelling approach based on the combination of process oriented procedures spatial analysis on lucc transitions spatial regimes parametrization deterministic and stochastic spatial allocation functions validation techniques and systems dynamics for scenarios generation was successful and can be complemented by several improvements to achieve more realistic models an example of future enhancements is the development of non stationary methods for the definition of transition demands which were based on a stationary markovian approach the use of spatial regimes landscape hierarchical zoning in this study in the model parametrization especially in the transition demands definition allowed an important control over the spatial allocation results the possibility of dividing the spatial allocation in deterministic cellular automata and stochastic patches generation functions facilitated the calibration procedures starting from determinism and gradually incorporating stochasticity in the lucc models the use of a theoretical approach for systems dynamics modelling allowed an overview on the application of different models of development by society despite the inherent limitation of scenarios generation with

25241,the composition and health of forests across western north america have shown signs of change over the last half century associated with altered climate conditions most models developed to predict responses to variation in climate assume that the ecological distribution of adult trees provides a sound basis for projecting potential shifts in a species range under a dynamic climate however recently established seedlings may more closely reflect changes in climate conditions this study combined the simple widely tested physiological model 3 pg with an empirical regeneration dataset composed of 21 097 plots to assess regional scale changes in tree species distributions across british columbia canada we geographically registered all plot locations to correspond with topographically adjusted 1 km monthly climatic data for the period 2000 2009 by comparing the distribution of seedlings to that of mature trees present in an earlier period 1950 1975 we could assess where alterations in the environment have occurred and the extent to which changes may make a species vulnerable to replacement in some places or likely to regenerate and migrate elsewhere decision tree models were developed to assess the relative importance of suboptimal temperatures frost soil water deficits and evaporative demand on the growth and distribution of four widely distributed species douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii lodgepole pine pinus contorta western larch larix occidentalis and subalpine fir abies lasiocarpa tree responses varied by species with areas suitable for lodgepole pine experiencing the largest relative increase in summer drought and areas dominated by western larch experiencing the least those areas modelled as suitable for species range expansions occurred 79 sd 16 of the time in places where seedlings of a designated species were predicted in 2000 2009 using the regeneration dataset we conclude that employing seedling surveys in concert with tree surveys provide valuable ecological insights when predicting species responses to climate shifts keywords process based model tree species distributions 3 pg model forest regeneration climate

communities depend on forests for timber as well as for their cultural and spiritual values millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 maintaining these ecosystem services requires an improved understanding of how forests are responding to a changing climate increases in disturbances caused by insect attacks raffa et al 2008 anderegg et al 2015 diseases ramsfield et al 2016 woods et al 2010 and wildfires westerling et al 2006 are associated with climatic variation over recent decades ipcc 2014 small changes in temperature and precipitation impact seedlings more than adult trees whereas the opposite is the case with bark beetles and wind storms the life stage of a species individual matters in predicting the future composition of a forest bose et al 2016 bell et al 2014 niinemets 2010 in some parts of a species range a shift in climate may induce stress while elsewhere conditions may improve fostering range expansion mathys et al 2017 coops et al 2011 rehfeldt et al 2014 gray and hamann 2013 most species distribution modelling efforts attempt to include a large part if not all of a species natural range in doing this there is an underlying assumption that the climatic envelope encompassing the species range represents those niches where a species is able to survive in the presence of the existing complement of organisms this complement includes not only other tree species but biological agents that limit tree growth and survival including native and introduced herbivores and pathogens climate change may reduce niche space not necessarily because a species might not grow as well but because previously benign relationships become lethal the response of different tree species to climate can be characterized by quantifying relationships between species occurrence and environmental variables guisan and thuiller 2005 data mining approaches such as random forest algorithms have also been employed first to accurately assess current patterns of a species distribution and then to demarcate probable future habitat rehfeldt et al 2014 iverson et al 2008 for example gray and hamann 2013 used a climate envelope model with random forest algorithm to map the potential future distribution of major tree species in western north america coops et al 2009 introduced a hybrid modelling approach that compared the environmental sensitivities of different western tree species with those predicted using a process based model parameterized for a single widely distributed conifer pseudotsuga menziesii an alternative approach based on the observed growth of different populations observed in common garden experiments has been used to predict responses to assisted migration of different genotypes under a changing climate wang et al 2010 o neill et al 2008 unfortunately data requirements for genetics based models limit the approach to a few widely studied species aitken and bemmels 2016 although the majority of biologically based climate response models rely on species occurrence data acquired for mature trees nitschke and innes 2008 provide a notable exception by modelling species responses within their regeneration niche we believe that a modelling approach based on the distribution of tree seedlings has merit because the fate of seedlings at the front or rear margin of a species distribution is a more sensitive harbinger of the future than the response of mature trees malcolm et al 2002 bell et al 2014 bose et al 2016 by incorporating tree seedlings in species distribution models we gain insights as to how climatic variation affects reproductive success in both previously established and newly occupied niches bose et al 2016 to date the paucity of seedling data has limited our ability both to assess and model the effects of climate change on forest composition at large spatial scales blanco et al 2009 weiskittel et al 2011 parmesan et al 2011 in this study we took advantage of databases available both on seedlings and established trees using a hybrid model developed by coops et al 2009 we combined these geographically registered datasets with physiologically defined climatic variables to run decision tree models for both seedlings and mature trees of four widely distributed species in british columbia bc this hybrid model allowed us to combine process based modeling with sophisticated machine learning algorithms by relating species occurrences with the relative importance of four environmental limitations on photosynthesis rather than simply employing climatic data in an earlier study mathys et al 2014 mapped the baseline distribution of native tree species using climate and soil information with an average accuracy of 84 the objective of this study was to refine these models to evaluate the extent that predicted tree species shifts were in agreement with seedling observations of four species we focused the area analysed on bc and selected interior and coastal douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii mirb franco var glauca beissn franco and pseudotsuga menziesii mirb franco var menziesii lodgepole pine pinus contorta dougl western larch larix occidentalis nutt and subalpine fir abies lasiocarpa hook for the analysis finally we inferred changes in environmental constraints on species distributions over the past decade compared to baseline conditions 1950 1975 2 methods 2 1 study area our study area included all forested areas in british columbia the most biologically diverse province in canada fig 1 the province contains distinct ecosystems ranging from coastal forests to alpine tundra meidinger and pojar 1991 it is part of the pacific northwest region extending south from the yukon and northwest territories across british columbia the region encompasses terrains ranging from the coast mountains and southern rockies to the interior plateau and great plains valentine et al 1978 the maritime influence of the pacific ocean combined with orographic effects of inland mountain ranges accounts for the diverse climate and precipitation patterns recorded throughout the study area meidinger and pojar 1991 the coast mountains cast a rain shadow leading to arid conditions in the south central interior of bc vegetation throughout the province predominantly comprises coniferous forest to make comparisons between seedling and tree life stages across the study area we selected species with wide distributions and different ranges including those with a high economic and ecological value below we provide some ecological information on the four species selected for analysis the coastal variety of douglas fir is distributed within the marine west coast forest ecoregion representing the densest and most productive ecoregion in bc klinka et al 1999 the interior variety of douglas fir occurs in montane forests within the northwest forested mountains including the thompson okanagan plateau where it is often associated with an understory of grass at higher elevations interior douglas fir occurs in mixed forests including those dominated by lodgepole pine or western larch lodgepole pine grows in montane and subalpine forests throughout the northwest forested mountains in bc it is the most widely distributed tree species in bc and a major source of timber klinka et al 1999 lodgepole pine is a pioneer species that regenerates in even aged stands following fire and it occurs less frequently in southern bc with western larch western larch is present in montane forests of southeastern bc on the thompson okanagan plateau and in the columbia mountains it generally grows in mixed species stands and is nearly absent on very moist sites klinka et al 1999 this deciduous conifer is of high ecological and economic value and considered the most productive species of the larix genus in north america rehfeldt and jaquish 2010 subalpine fir is largely restricted to high elevation forests where winter snowpack accumulates throughout the northwestern forested mountain ecoregion in bc it occurs in continental climates and is nearly absent in warmer and drier climates klinka et al 1999 2 2 sampling species distributions species occurrence data were obtained for mature trees defined as well established sapling and pole sized trees dbh 1 3 cm as well as for seedlings which were defined as individuals 1 3 m in height the presence and absence of tree seedlings were acquired from the comprehensive results reporting silviculture updates and land status tracking system database provided by the b c ministry of forests lands and natural resource operations 2014 seedling data were collected from forest openings caused by natural disturbance and forest harvesting and include both natural regeneration and planted species a total of 21 097 seedling plot locations were mapped from centroids of polygons over forest openings with an accuracy of about 500 m similar information on the presence or absence of adult trees of focal species were obtained for 8909 locations from centroids of stand level polygons acquired from protected forested areas and using a three phase photo and ground based sampling design across all forested land in bc schroeder et al 2010 the accuracy of tree plot locations was approximately 500 m distributions of the survey plots for trees and seedlings are presented in fig 1 2 3 climate and soil data climatic data required for modelling included monthly mean air temperature precipitation evaporative demand the frequency of frost and solar radiation the datasets were compiled at a spatial resolution of 1 km monthly maximum and minimum air temperature and total precipitation were acquired from climatewna which downscales 2 5 gridded arcmin prism parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model data wang et al 2016 daly et al 2008 the climate data were refined to accommodate steep transitions in mountainous areas by adjusting temperature values of heterogeneous terrain based on longitude latitude and elevation using a dynamic local regression function wang et al 2016 we generated elevation data by resampling a 90 m digital elevation model dem obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm to the desired resolution of 1 km to obtain vapour pressure deficit vpd values we first calculated maximum vpd as the difference between saturated vapour pressure at minimum and maximum temperatures the average monthly daytime vpd was then derived as two thirds of maximum vpd to obtain a mean daytime value rather than one based on daily extremes waring 2000 the number of days per month with subfreezing temperatures 2 c was calculated from empirical equations with mean minimum temperature coops et al 1998 monthly total incoming shortwave radiation was acquired by combining synoptic and topographic variations obtained from published data sources hember et al 2017 fu and rich 2002 schroeder et al 2009 soil properties required for modelling included available soil water holding capacity and soil fertility soil maps depicting the spatial variation of these properties were derived at 1 km resolution by taking advantage of the link between soils climate and forest productivity accordingly coops et al 2012 estimated soil properties through model inversion and optimization techniques by adjusting maximum leaf area index laimax values to correspond with those detected by modis satellite imagery available soil water was allowed to vary from 0 to 300 mm whereas soil fertility was ranked from 0 representing the poorest soils to 1 for the most fertile soils landsberg and waring 1997 in areas where laimax 3 0 it was assumed that available soil water was more limiting than fertility an assumption previously confirmed with field observations by runyon et al 1994 soil fertility increased in importance on sites where laimax 3 0 accounting for regional variations in soil properties has shown to improve model predictions of the distribution of tree species mathys et al 2014 2 4 modelling tree and seedling distributions we used a hybrid approach to model tree and seedling distributions that combined a process based model with automated decision tree analysis fig 2 coops et al 2009 the first step involved employing physiological principles to model the environmental constraints imposed on a reference species that affect its current distribution the second step involved running decision tree analysis for each species to determine how different combinations of environmental limitations define their distribution the hybrid model was run separately for trees and seedlings to produce species distributions over different time periods there are a variety of physiologically based process models but only few have been designed to scale projections of photosynthesis structural growth and mortality across landscapes nightingale et al 2004 among the most widely used is the physiological principles predicting growth 3 pg model landsberg and waring 1997 the 3 pg model differs from others primarily in a number of simplifying assumptions 1 that monthly mean climatic data are adequate to capture seasonal trends in growth 2 that autotrophic respiration ra and net primary production npp are approximately equal fractions of gross photosynthesis gpp and 3 that the proportion of npp allocated to roots decreases linearly from 60 to 25 as nutrients particularly nitrogen become more available landsberg and sands 2011 the 3 pg model calculates gross photosynthesis canopy evaporation and transpiration growth allocation and litter production at monthly intervals it reduces potential photosynthesis and transpiration by imposing restrictions on stomatal conductance through modifiers as defined above between 0 and 1 for suboptimal temperatures frost high daytime evaporative demand and drought as imposed by a soil water deficit landsberg and waring 1997 the soil water modifier is determined as a non linear function of the ratio of the amount of water available in the root zone compared to the maximum value which is the difference between the water content at field capacity and that at wilting point the available water content is calculated from knowledge of the previous month s water storage less the amount of the current month s precipitation minus evaporation and transpiration any excess water beyond field capacity drains below the rooting zone or runs off the surface transpiration is calculated from the penman monteith equation which incorporates a canopy conductance term derived from stomatal conductance and lai landsberg and waring 1997 monteith 1965 outputs of the 3 pg model include environmental constraints on species growth such as mean monthly values of air temperature frequency of frost soil water and daytime vpd these were normalized by assuming a continuous scale between 0 and 1 where factors causing no limitations received a value of 1 while those preventing photosynthesis received a value of 0 we then averaged the monthly climatic growth modifiers seasonally and annually for modelling purposes we chose douglas fir as our reference species to parameterize the 3 pg model ideally the parameterization would be carried out for each species individually however the comprehensive data required for this task is only available for the most widely studied species instead the relative importance of environmental constraints on other species was described using decision tree analysis in terms of how their tolerances deviated from optimal conditions of douglas fir decision tree models were developed by combining presence and absence data recorded in surveys with corresponding geographically registered climatic data decision tree models defined areas where a species appeared to be well adapted as well as where it approached its ecological limits coops et al 2009 coops et al 2011 to construct decision tree models we first extracted seasonal averages of climate modifiers at each of the plots where a species was recorded the relative importance of each of the seasonal environmental variables was then ranked using decision tree regression software dtreg sherrod 2010 to predict the presence and absence of each tree species across the region we built separate decision tree models for each set of survey data for mature trees we used the climate growth modifiers produced from a decision tree analysis using monthly averaged climate data from 1950 to 1975 whereas for seedlings we used a more recent warmer and drier period from 2000 to 2009 waring et al 2014 model accuracies table 1 were evaluated using a 10 fold cross validation technique breiman et al 1984 and a kappa statistic Œ∫ we predicted the potential expansion or contraction of each tree species range with 2000 2009 climatic data using decision tree analyses established under baseline conditions in the 1950 1975 period if the probability of a tree species occurrence was 70 in 2000 2009 while under baseline conditions it was predicted to be absent we designated such areas as suitable for species expansion alternatively species in areas where the environment was predicted to be no longer favourable for a species 70 of the years since 2000 were considered vulnerable to replacement by other species mathys et al 2017 the potential for range expansion under a rapidly changing climate is often much larger than can be attained at least without assisted migration in recognition of this fact we set a limit of 200 m as the maximum distance a population of a tree species can migrate annually this value was derived from information in the paleoecological records mathys et al 2017 davis 1989 beckage et al 2008 finally we used the decision tree models developed for seedlings in 2000 2009 to assess the extent of agreement with decision tree models based on tree data acquired in 1950 1975 and projected to the period of 2000 2009 to identify areas of likely range expansion and contraction in this paper we did not attempt to predict the location of disturbances in response to variation in climate but see waring et al 2011 waring and coops 2016 3 results 3 1 changes to climatic growth modifiers the importance of the assessed seasonal climatic modifiers averaged across all plots differed among species during the baseline period 1950 1975 fig 3 both douglas fir and lodgepole pine were limited mainly by suboptimal air temperature and frost in winter when these modifiers restricted growth by over 85 growth of these two species was not severally limited by soil water deficits 38 39 or evaporative demand 29 33 in summer on sites occupied by douglas fir growth was also constrained by suboptimal temperatures and frost occurrence in spring and fall but the major limitations were imposed in winter the growth of subalpine fir in higher elevation forests was severely restricted 82 by low temperatures in spring and fall limitations from drought and high evaporative demand caused 30 restrictions on subalpine fir growth during baseline conditions in contrast western larch experienced soil water deficits during summer in southeastern bc that limited photosynthesis by up to 55 while frost imposed 20 reductions in growth in spring and fall comparison of the two time periods 1950 1975 and 2000 2009 showed that the greatest mean differences of the seasonal modifiers occurred predominantly in spring and summer at the surveyed plots fig 4 tree seedlings have been exposed to increased summer soil water deficits under recent climate conditions than mature trees were during the earlier period 1950 1975 summer vpd also showed some decreases in 2000 2009 compared to baseline conditions springtime temperatures and frost became less limiting between these periods although on average they remained the most constraining environmental factors at the species level both lodgepole pine and subalpine fir had the greatest shift in mean seasonal modifier values suggesting weaker constraints from unfavourable spring temperature and frost but increased limitations by drought and vapour pressure deficits in 2000 2009 compared to 1950 1975 fig 5 areas favourable for these two species registered the largest relative increase from the effect of drought in summer whereas those areas dominated by western larch experienced the least all species experienced a rise in spring temperatures across their current ranges and these were most pronounced for subalpine fir and lodgepole pine and least pronounced for douglas fir in contrast summer vapor pressure deficits increased the most in areas occupied by lodgepole pine and least in areas favourable for western larch with regard to limitations by spring frost conditions improved the most for subalpine fir and changed the least for douglas fir environmental conditions in bc are improving for douglas fir as soils become drier and frost less frequent during the active growing season 3 2 species vulnerability assessment vulnerability of tree species to a changing climate in 2000 2009 compared to baseline conditions is shown in fig 6 illustrating climatically suitable areas for species expansion as well as where a species is predicted to encounter increased stress lodgepole pine was predicted to become increasingly stressed throughout its historic range in the interior of bc with changing climate conditions fig 6a approximately 4 of its baseline distribution was classified as no longer suitable with some areas 1 becoming climatically suitable for range expansion table 2 western larch displayed the greatest potential for range expansion 10 of the four species analyzed in this study fig 6b table 2 western larch was projected to expand northwest from its historic range in interior bc and displayed only limited stress under recent climate conditions to assess model performance we compared the areas of predicted species range expansions and contractions with habitat favourable for seedlings table 2 fig 6 in general there was good agreement between areas where trees were projected to expand or contract their range and the observed distribution of tree seedlings as simulated based on records in the results database the areas deemed suitable for expansion agreed 79 on average with successful seedling establishment and areas classified as stressed had an average agreement of 77 with areas where the seedlings were absent 4 discussion in this study we applied an approach that identifies emerging shifts in the distribution of species by comparing the observed distributions and potential growth responses of two life stages seedlings and trees information on seedling occurrences obtained from the regeneration database served as a sensitive early indicator of tree responses to climate change estimates of species vulnerabilities from this study agreed well in most cases with observed seedling establishment table 2 the distribution of subalpine fir seedlings displayed the lowest agreement with areas we predicted as stressed the lower number of tree plots compared with those for seedlings may have led to a higher accuracy of the regeneration predictions table 2 in any case our analysis suggests that the projected stress at these sites is not yet sufficiently severe to induce mortality of the species in general differences in the distribution and climate exposures of seedlings compared to those of trees established last century provided evidence that some species expansions have already occurred in response to climate change lenoir et al 2009 tree responses to changing environmental limitations during the two periods varied among the four species analysed both lodgepole pine and subalpine fir experienced the greatest changes in environmental constraints on sites where they currently occur and also had the most areas classified as stressed in the model predictions in the past sites occupied by these species experienced only limited soil water deficits that situation is now changing posing increased stress on the species although lodgepole pine is a widely distributed species adapted to a range of environments klinka et al 1999 warmer temperatures and reduced frost can create an environment for both competing species and damaging biotic agents to thrive in recent years lodgepole pine forests have been exposed to increased bark beetle attack and diseases that have affected forest health and may limit their habitat in the future monserud et al 2008 mckenney et al 2007 mathys et al 2017 carroll et al 2006 mather et al 2010 in contrast the two temperate species douglas fir and western larch both displayed the opportunity and capacity to expand northward as changing environmental conditions such as increasing air temperatures and reduced snowpack are likely providing favourable conditions for this species to migrate incorporating a large regeneration dataset together with climate data in physiological modelling provided valuable information on crucial environmental stressors impacting species distribution patterns results from this study indicated that warmer temperatures reduced frost and increased drought occurred in some places in recent years causing shifts in forest composition all species analysed in this study became increasingly limited by soil water deficits as environmental factors such as low temperatures and frost occurrences became less constraining with climate change this greater exposure to summer drought will be important to monitor to determine a species ability to tolerate such changing conditions species that are more drought adapted such as douglas fir have a competitive advantage as warming trends continue in agreement with this study the suitable habitat of more southern species such as douglas fir and ponderosa pine has been projected to expand northward and upward by rehfeldt et al 2014 and gray and hamann 2013 these two studies projected an even greater northward expansion of douglas fir range within the northwest forested mountains than our study although at a lower frequency 5 gray and hamann 2013 rehfeldt et al 2014 the suitable habitat of western larch has also been previously predicted to expand northward in bc rehfeldt and jaquish 2010 and management practices now allow planting small amounts of western larch north and west of its current distribution jaquish 2010 areas we classified as suitable for western larch expansion agreed well with the mapped guidelines for seed transfers by rehfeldt and jaquish 2010 although we also predicted areas further northwest in the thompson okanagan plateau to become suitable with changing climate conditions empirical studies that have analysed the distribution of trees and seedlings generally report migrations of species toward higher altitudes and latitudes woodall et al 2009 monleon and lintz 2015 lenoir et al 2009 although caution has been expressed in using the distribution of different life stages as evidence of species range shifts sittaro et al 2017 in the dry portions of western us the distribution of tree seedlings was predicted to decline especially in subalpine areas bell et al 2014 the effects of climate change are greater at higher altitudes where tree species are most sensitive to changing conditions lenoir et al 2009 kullman 2007 unlike these empirical studies our approach allowed us to not only assess divergences in tree and seedling distributions but also to predict changes to the physiologically based stresses that are limiting the species and offer some insights that may modify forest management practices to buffer conditions against rapid change it may be simplified to assume that species responses to changing environmental conditions are identical for seedlings and mature trees tree seedling distributions are not only affected by growth but also by germination and success in establishment blanco et al 2009 factors that are currently omitted by the 3 pg model nonetheless the tree seedling inventory used in this study reflects the occurrences of those species that had successfully established and survived in their natural environment the results database focused on areas that have undergone silvicultural activities for reforestation and that have been planted with seedlings it would be valuable to also have information available on natural regeneration in bc to compare with model predictions still the current dataset was useful in providing insights on the actual inventory of regeneration in the province as influenced by forest management practices furthermore seedlings were only planted within current species ranges thus species shifts as identified in this study reflect climatic influences rather than changes in management practices continuous forest monitoring in permanent plots at decadal intervals would improve our models in addition to our understanding of how a progressively changing climate impacts tree mortality and regeneration and thereby forest composition it is also desirable to seek more representative data on species growth distribution and site characteristics we encourage a multitude of approaches to improve models including those incorporating interactions with rising atmospheric concentrations of co2 waring and gao 2016 and genetic effects wang et al 2010 including forest disturbances in species distribution models should improve predictions of stresses that are expected to increase with climate change rehfeldt and jaquish 2010 for example by incorporating projections of fire occurrences waring and coops 2016 or outbreaks of insects and pathogens woods et al 2010 mather et al 2010 incorporating a regeneration module within 3 pg would also improve predictions by including microclimatic variation in light and frost ribbens and pacala 1994 canham et al 1994 it would be more challenging to create a model that included the mechanical limitations imposed by browsing snow and ice holmgren et al 1997 the version of the 3 pg model used in this study is also only applicable for conifer trees recently the model has been modified to account for deciduous and mixed species forests by adjusting for differences in light absorption and within canopy vertical gradients in climate forrester and tang 2016 differentiating soil water access for seedlings versus trees would also refine model predictions as we highlight the increased importance of drought on species growth for example young ponderosa pine trees have been found to be more sensitive to drought earlier in the season compared to older trees irvine et al 2002 accounting for differences in rooting depth with tree age can contribute to improving predictions of species responses from regeneration to maturity this study highlighted how climate shifts are leading to changes in tree species distribution patterns as affected by alterations of the environmental limitations on species growth employing an extensive regeneration dataset allowed us to compare and contrast predicted areas suitable for tree species range expansion with those where tree seedlings have been successfully established while species such as lodgepole pine and subalpine fir likely experienced increased stress with climate change there was potential for species such as douglas fir and western larch to expand their range as survival conditions improved knowledge of the crucial stressors on tree species and where to expect potential for species range expansions can be useful for forest managers developing mitigation practices to climate change the most important contribution of our analysis is perhaps the approach itself where the distribution of two life stages in a species are compared in reference to their appearance or absence on recorded plots over contrasting periods representing subtle but progressive shifts in climatic conditions we hope to see the approach extended and tested more widely in western north america and beyond acknowledgements we appreciate the support obtained by a grant from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa

turner matt leroy and caroline wood from the ministry of forests lands and natural resource operations and rural development for providing the regeneration plot information from the results database

support over the years 
25241,the composition and health of forests across western north america have shown signs of change over the last half century associated with altered climate conditions most models developed to predict responses to variation in climate assume that the ecological distribution of adult trees provides a sound basis for projecting potential shifts in a species range under a dynamic climate however recently established seedlings may more closely reflect changes in climate conditions this study combined the simple widely tested physiological model 3 pg with an empirical regeneration dataset composed of 21 097 plots to assess regional scale changes in tree species distributions across british columbia canada we geographically registered all plot locations to correspond with topographically adjusted 1 km monthly climatic data for the period 2000 2009 by comparing the distribution of seedlings to that of mature trees present in an earlier period 1950 1975 we could assess where alterations in the environment have occurred and the extent to which changes may make a species vulnerable to replacement in some places or likely to regenerate and migrate elsewhere decision tree models were developed to assess the relative importance of suboptimal temperatures frost soil water deficits and evaporative demand on the growth and distribution of four widely distributed species douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii lodgepole pine pinus contorta western larch larix occidentalis and subalpine fir abies lasiocarpa tree responses varied by species with areas suitable for lodgepole pine experiencing the largest relative increase in summer drought and areas dominated by western larch experiencing the least those areas modelled as suitable for species range expansions occurred 79 sd 16 of the time in places where seedlings of a designated species were predicted in 2000 2009 using the regeneration dataset we conclude that employing seedling surveys in concert with tree surveys provide valuable ecological insights when predicting species responses to climate shifts keywords process based model tree species distributions 3 pg model forest regeneration climate

communities depend on forests for timber as well as for their cultural and spiritual values millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 maintaining these ecosystem services requires an improved understanding of how forests are responding to a changing climate increases in disturbances caused by insect attacks raffa et al 2008 anderegg et al 2015 diseases ramsfield et al 2016 woods et al 2010 and wildfires westerling et al 2006 are associated with climatic variation over recent decades ipcc 2014 small changes in temperature and precipitation impact seedlings more than adult trees whereas the opposite is the case with bark beetles and wind storms the life stage of a species individual matters in predicting the future composition of a forest bose et al 2016 bell et al 2014 niinemets 2010 in some parts of a species range a shift in climate may induce stress while elsewhere conditions may improve fostering range expansion mathys et al 2017 coops et al 2011 rehfeldt et al 2014 gray and hamann 2013 most species distribution modelling efforts attempt to include a large part if not all of a species natural range in doing this there is an underlying assumption that the climatic envelope encompassing the species range represents those niches where a species is able to survive in the presence of the existing complement of organisms this complement includes not only other tree species but biological agents that limit tree growth and survival including native and introduced herbivores and pathogens climate change may reduce niche space not necessarily because a species might not grow as well but because previously benign relationships become lethal the response of different tree species to climate can be characterized by quantifying relationships between species occurrence and environmental variables guisan and thuiller 2005 data mining approaches such as random forest algorithms have also been employed first to accurately assess current patterns of a species distribution and then to demarcate probable future habitat rehfeldt et al 2014 iverson et al 2008 for example gray and hamann 2013 used a climate envelope model with random forest algorithm to map the potential future distribution of major tree species in western north america coops et al 2009 introduced a hybrid modelling approach that compared the environmental sensitivities of different western tree species with those predicted using a process based model parameterized for a single widely distributed conifer pseudotsuga menziesii an alternative approach based on the observed growth of different populations observed in common garden experiments has been used to predict responses to assisted migration of different genotypes under a changing climate wang et al 2010 o neill et al 2008 unfortunately data requirements for genetics based models limit the approach to a few widely studied species aitken and bemmels 2016 although the majority of biologically based climate response models rely on species occurrence data acquired for mature trees nitschke and innes 2008 provide a notable exception by modelling species responses within their regeneration niche we believe that a modelling approach based on the distribution of tree seedlings has merit because the fate of seedlings at the front or rear margin of a species distribution is a more sensitive harbinger of the future than the response of mature trees malcolm et al 2002 bell et al 2014 bose et al 2016 by incorporating tree seedlings in species distribution models we gain insights as to how climatic variation affects reproductive success in both previously established and newly occupied niches bose et al 2016 to date the paucity of seedling data has limited our ability both to assess and model the effects of climate change on forest composition at large spatial scales blanco et al 2009 weiskittel et al 2011 parmesan et al 2011 in this study we took advantage of databases available both on seedlings and established trees using a hybrid model developed by coops et al 2009 we combined these geographically registered datasets with physiologically defined climatic variables to run decision tree models for both seedlings and mature trees of four widely distributed species in british columbia bc this hybrid model allowed us to combine process based modeling with sophisticated machine learning algorithms by relating species occurrences with the relative importance of four environmental limitations on photosynthesis rather than simply employing climatic data in an earlier study mathys et al 2014 mapped the baseline distribution of native tree species using climate and soil information with an average accuracy of 84 the objective of this study was to refine these models to evaluate the extent that predicted tree species shifts were in agreement with seedling observations of four species we focused the area analysed on bc and selected interior and coastal douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii mirb franco var glauca beissn franco and pseudotsuga menziesii mirb franco var menziesii lodgepole pine pinus contorta dougl western larch larix occidentalis nutt and subalpine fir abies lasiocarpa hook for the analysis finally we inferred changes in environmental constraints on species distributions over the past decade compared to baseline conditions 1950 1975 2 methods 2 1 study area our study area included all forested areas in british columbia the most biologically diverse province in canada fig 1 the province contains distinct ecosystems ranging from coastal forests to alpine tundra meidinger and pojar 1991 it is part of the pacific northwest region extending south from the yukon and northwest territories across british columbia the region encompasses terrains ranging from the coast mountains and southern rockies to the interior plateau and great plains valentine et al 1978 the maritime influence of the pacific ocean combined with orographic effects of inland mountain ranges accounts for the diverse climate and precipitation patterns recorded throughout the study area meidinger and pojar 1991 the coast mountains cast a rain shadow leading to arid conditions in the south central interior of bc vegetation throughout the province predominantly comprises coniferous forest to make comparisons between seedling and tree life stages across the study area we selected species with wide distributions and different ranges including those with a high economic and ecological value below we provide some ecological information on the four species selected for analysis the coastal variety of douglas fir is distributed within the marine west coast forest ecoregion representing the densest and most productive ecoregion in bc klinka et al 1999 the interior variety of douglas fir occurs in montane forests within the northwest forested mountains including the thompson okanagan plateau where it is often associated with an understory of grass at higher elevations interior douglas fir occurs in mixed forests including those dominated by lodgepole pine or western larch lodgepole pine grows in montane and subalpine forests throughout the northwest forested mountains in bc it is the most widely distributed tree species in bc and a major source of timber klinka et al 1999 lodgepole pine is a pioneer species that regenerates in even aged stands following fire and it occurs less frequently in southern bc with western larch western larch is present in montane forests of southeastern bc on the thompson okanagan plateau and in the columbia mountains it generally grows in mixed species stands and is nearly absent on very moist sites klinka et al 1999 this deciduous conifer is of high ecological and economic value and considered the most productive species of the larix genus in north america rehfeldt and jaquish 2010 subalpine fir is largely restricted to high elevation forests where winter snowpack accumulates throughout the northwestern forested mountain ecoregion in bc it occurs in continental climates and is nearly absent in warmer and drier climates klinka et al 1999 2 2 sampling species distributions species occurrence data were obtained for mature trees defined as well established sapling and pole sized trees dbh 1 3 cm as well as for seedlings which were defined as individuals 1 3 m in height the presence and absence of tree seedlings were acquired from the comprehensive results reporting silviculture updates and land status tracking system database provided by the b c ministry of forests lands and natural resource operations 2014 seedling data were collected from forest openings caused by natural disturbance and forest harvesting and include both natural regeneration and planted species a total of 21 097 seedling plot locations were mapped from centroids of polygons over forest openings with an accuracy of about 500 m similar information on the presence or absence of adult trees of focal species were obtained for 8909 locations from centroids of stand level polygons acquired from protected forested areas and using a three phase photo and ground based sampling design across all forested land in bc schroeder et al 2010 the accuracy of tree plot locations was approximately 500 m distributions of the survey plots for trees and seedlings are presented in fig 1 2 3 climate and soil data climatic data required for modelling included monthly mean air temperature precipitation evaporative demand the frequency of frost and solar radiation the datasets were compiled at a spatial resolution of 1 km monthly maximum and minimum air temperature and total precipitation were acquired from climatewna which downscales 2 5 gridded arcmin prism parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model data wang et al 2016 daly et al 2008 the climate data were refined to accommodate steep transitions in mountainous areas by adjusting temperature values of heterogeneous terrain based on longitude latitude and elevation using a dynamic local regression function wang et al 2016 we generated elevation data by resampling a 90 m digital elevation model dem obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm to the desired resolution of 1 km to obtain vapour pressure deficit vpd values we first calculated maximum vpd as the difference between saturated vapour pressure at minimum and maximum temperatures the average monthly daytime vpd was then derived as two thirds of maximum vpd to obtain a mean daytime value rather than one based on daily extremes waring 2000 the number of days per month with subfreezing temperatures 2 c was calculated from empirical equations with mean minimum temperature coops et al 1998 monthly total incoming shortwave radiation was acquired by combining synoptic and topographic variations obtained from published data sources hember et al 2017 fu and rich 2002 schroeder et al 2009 soil properties required for modelling included available soil water holding capacity and soil fertility soil maps depicting the spatial variation of these properties were derived at 1 km resolution by taking advantage of the link between soils climate and forest productivity accordingly coops et al 2012 estimated soil properties through model inversion and optimization techniques by adjusting maximum leaf area index laimax values to correspond with those detected by modis satellite imagery available soil water was allowed to vary from 0 to 300 mm whereas soil fertility was ranked from 0 representing the poorest soils to 1 for the most fertile soils landsberg and waring 1997 in areas where laimax 3 0 it was assumed that available soil water was more limiting than fertility an assumption previously confirmed with field observations by runyon et al 1994 soil fertility increased in importance on sites where laimax 3 0 accounting for regional variations in soil properties has shown to improve model predictions of the distribution of tree species mathys et al 2014 2 4 modelling tree and seedling distributions we used a hybrid approach to model tree and seedling distributions that combined a process based model with automated decision tree analysis fig 2 coops et al 2009 the first step involved employing physiological principles to model the environmental constraints imposed on a reference species that affect its current distribution the second step involved running decision tree analysis for each species to determine how different combinations of environmental limitations define their distribution the hybrid model was run separately for trees and seedlings to produce species distributions over different time periods there are a variety of physiologically based process models but only few have been designed to scale projections of photosynthesis structural growth and mortality across landscapes nightingale et al 2004 among the most widely used is the physiological principles predicting growth 3 pg model landsberg and waring 1997 the 3 pg model differs from others primarily in a number of simplifying assumptions 1 that monthly mean climatic data are adequate to capture seasonal trends in growth 2 that autotrophic respiration ra and net primary production npp are approximately equal fractions of gross photosynthesis gpp and 3 that the proportion of npp allocated to roots decreases linearly from 60 to 25 as nutrients particularly nitrogen become more available landsberg and sands 2011 the 3 pg model calculates gross photosynthesis canopy evaporation and transpiration growth allocation and litter production at monthly intervals it reduces potential photosynthesis and transpiration by imposing restrictions on stomatal conductance through modifiers as defined above between 0 and 1 for suboptimal temperatures frost high daytime evaporative demand and drought as imposed by a soil water deficit landsberg and waring 1997 the soil water modifier is determined as a non linear function of the ratio of the amount of water available in the root zone compared to the maximum value which is the difference between the water content at field capacity and that at wilting point the available water content is calculated from knowledge of the previous month s water storage less the amount of the current month s precipitation minus evaporation and transpiration any excess water beyond field capacity drains below the rooting zone or runs off the surface transpiration is calculated from the penman monteith equation which incorporates a canopy conductance term derived from stomatal conductance and lai landsberg and waring 1997 monteith 1965 outputs of the 3 pg model include environmental constraints on species growth such as mean monthly values of air temperature frequency of frost soil water and daytime vpd these were normalized by assuming a continuous scale between 0 and 1 where factors causing no limitations received a value of 1 while those preventing photosynthesis received a value of 0 we then averaged the monthly climatic growth modifiers seasonally and annually for modelling purposes we chose douglas fir as our reference species to parameterize the 3 pg model ideally the parameterization would be carried out for each species individually however the comprehensive data required for this task is only available for the most widely studied species instead the relative importance of environmental constraints on other species was described using decision tree analysis in terms of how their tolerances deviated from optimal conditions of douglas fir decision tree models were developed by combining presence and absence data recorded in surveys with corresponding geographically registered climatic data decision tree models defined areas where a species appeared to be well adapted as well as where it approached its ecological limits coops et al 2009 coops et al 2011 to construct decision tree models we first extracted seasonal averages of climate modifiers at each of the plots where a species was recorded the relative importance of each of the seasonal environmental variables was then ranked using decision tree regression software dtreg sherrod 2010 to predict the presence and absence of each tree species across the region we built separate decision tree models for each set of survey data for mature trees we used the climate growth modifiers produced from a decision tree analysis using monthly averaged climate data from 1950 to 1975 whereas for seedlings we used a more recent warmer and drier period from 2000 to 2009 waring et al 2014 model accuracies table 1 were evaluated using a 10 fold cross validation technique breiman et al 1984 and a kappa statistic Œ∫ we predicted the potential expansion or contraction of each tree species range with 2000 2009 climatic data using decision tree analyses established under baseline conditions in the 1950 1975 period if the probability of a tree species occurrence was 70 in 2000 2009 while under baseline conditions it was predicted to be absent we designated such areas as suitable for species expansion alternatively species in areas where the environment was predicted to be no longer favourable for a species 70 of the years since 2000 were considered vulnerable to replacement by other species mathys et al 2017 the potential for range expansion under a rapidly changing climate is often much larger than can be attained at least without assisted migration in recognition of this fact we set a limit of 200 m as the maximum distance a population of a tree species can migrate annually this value was derived from information in the paleoecological records mathys et al 2017 davis 1989 beckage et al 2008 finally we used the decision tree models developed for seedlings in 2000 2009 to assess the extent of agreement with decision tree models based on tree data acquired in 1950 1975 and projected to the period of 2000 2009 to identify areas of likely range expansion and contraction in this paper we did not attempt to predict the location of disturbances in response to variation in climate but see waring et al 2011 waring and coops 2016 3 results 3 1 changes to climatic growth modifiers the importance of the assessed seasonal climatic modifiers averaged across all plots differed among species during the baseline period 1950 1975 fig 3 both douglas fir and lodgepole pine were limited mainly by suboptimal air temperature and frost in winter when these modifiers restricted growth by over 85 growth of these two species was not severally limited by soil water deficits 38 39 or evaporative demand 29 33 in summer on sites occupied by douglas fir growth was also constrained by suboptimal temperatures and frost occurrence in spring and fall but the major limitations were imposed in winter the growth of subalpine fir in higher elevation forests was severely restricted 82 by low temperatures in spring and fall limitations from drought and high evaporative demand caused 30 restrictions on subalpine fir growth during baseline conditions in contrast western larch experienced soil water deficits during summer in southeastern bc that limited photosynthesis by up to 55 while frost imposed 20 reductions in growth in spring and fall comparison of the two time periods 1950 1975 and 2000 2009 showed that the greatest mean differences of the seasonal modifiers occurred predominantly in spring and summer at the surveyed plots fig 4 tree seedlings have been exposed to increased summer soil water deficits under recent climate conditions than mature trees were during the earlier period 1950 1975 summer vpd also showed some decreases in 2000 2009 compared to baseline conditions springtime temperatures and frost became less limiting between these periods although on average they remained the most constraining environmental factors at the species level both lodgepole pine and subalpine fir had the greatest shift in mean seasonal modifier values suggesting weaker constraints from unfavourable spring temperature and frost but increased limitations by drought and vapour pressure deficits in 2000 2009 compared to 1950 1975 fig 5 areas favourable for these two species registered the largest relative increase from the effect of drought in summer whereas those areas dominated by western larch experienced the least all species experienced a rise in spring temperatures across their current ranges and these were most pronounced for subalpine fir and lodgepole pine and least pronounced for douglas fir in contrast summer vapor pressure deficits increased the most in areas occupied by lodgepole pine and least in areas favourable for western larch with regard to limitations by spring frost conditions improved the most for subalpine fir and changed the least for douglas fir environmental conditions in bc are improving for douglas fir as soils become drier and frost less frequent during the active growing season 3 2 species vulnerability assessment vulnerability of tree species to a changing climate in 2000 2009 compared to baseline conditions is shown in fig 6 illustrating climatically suitable areas for species expansion as well as where a species is predicted to encounter increased stress lodgepole pine was predicted to become increasingly stressed throughout its historic range in the interior of bc with changing climate conditions fig 6a approximately 4 of its baseline distribution was classified as no longer suitable with some areas 1 becoming climatically suitable for range expansion table 2 western larch displayed the greatest potential for range expansion 10 of the four species analyzed in this study fig 6b table 2 western larch was projected to expand northwest from its historic range in interior bc and displayed only limited stress under recent climate conditions to assess model performance we compared the areas of predicted species range expansions and contractions with habitat favourable for seedlings table 2 fig 6 in general there was good agreement between areas where trees were projected to expand or contract their range and the observed distribution of tree seedlings as simulated based on records in the results database the areas deemed suitable for expansion agreed 79 on average with successful seedling establishment and areas classified as stressed had an average agreement of 77 with areas where the seedlings were absent 4 discussion in this study we applied an approach that identifies emerging shifts in the distribution of species by comparing the observed distributions and potential growth responses of two life stages seedlings and trees information on seedling occurrences obtained from the regeneration database served as a sensitive early indicator of tree responses to climate change estimates of species vulnerabilities from this study agreed well in most cases with observed seedling establishment table 2 the distribution of subalpine fir seedlings displayed the lowest agreement with areas we predicted as stressed the lower number of tree plots compared with those for seedlings may have led to a higher accuracy of the regeneration predictions table 2 in any case our analysis suggests that the projected stress at these sites is not yet sufficiently severe to induce mortality of the species in general differences in the distribution and climate exposures of seedlings compared to those of trees established last century provided evidence that some species expansions have already occurred in response to climate change lenoir et al 2009 tree responses to changing environmental limitations during the two periods varied among the four species analysed both lodgepole pine and subalpine fir experienced the greatest changes in environmental constraints on sites where they currently occur and also had the most areas classified as stressed in the model predictions in the past sites occupied by these species experienced only limited soil water deficits that situation is now changing posing increased stress on the species although lodgepole pine is a widely distributed species adapted to a range of environments klinka et al 1999 warmer temperatures and reduced frost can create an environment for both competing species and damaging biotic agents to thrive in recent years lodgepole pine forests have been exposed to increased bark beetle attack and diseases that have affected forest health and may limit their habitat in the future monserud et al 2008 mckenney et al 2007 mathys et al 2017 carroll et al 2006 mather et al 2010 in contrast the two temperate species douglas fir and western larch both displayed the opportunity and capacity to expand northward as changing environmental conditions such as increasing air temperatures and reduced snowpack are likely providing favourable conditions for this species to migrate incorporating a large regeneration dataset together with climate data in physiological modelling provided valuable information on crucial environmental stressors impacting species distribution patterns results from this study indicated that warmer temperatures reduced frost and increased drought occurred in some places in recent years causing shifts in forest composition all species analysed in this study became increasingly limited by soil water deficits as environmental factors such as low temperatures and frost occurrences became less constraining with climate change this greater exposure to summer drought will be important to monitor to determine a species ability to tolerate such changing conditions species that are more drought adapted such as douglas fir have a competitive advantage as warming trends continue in agreement with this study the suitable habitat of more southern species such as douglas fir and ponderosa pine has been projected to expand northward and upward by rehfeldt et al 2014 and gray and hamann 2013 these two studies projected an even greater northward expansion of douglas fir range within the northwest forested mountains than our study although at a lower frequency 5 gray and hamann 2013 rehfeldt et al 2014 the suitable habitat of western larch has also been previously predicted to expand northward in bc rehfeldt and jaquish 2010 and management practices now allow planting small amounts of western larch north and west of its current distribution jaquish 2010 areas we classified as suitable for western larch expansion agreed well with the mapped guidelines for seed transfers by rehfeldt and jaquish 2010 although we also predicted areas further northwest in the thompson okanagan plateau to become suitable with changing climate conditions empirical studies that have analysed the distribution of trees and seedlings generally report migrations of species toward higher altitudes and latitudes woodall et al 2009 monleon and lintz 2015 lenoir et al 2009 although caution has been expressed in using the distribution of different life stages as evidence of species range shifts sittaro et al 2017 in the dry portions of western us the distribution of tree seedlings was predicted to decline especially in subalpine areas bell et al 2014 the effects of climate change are greater at higher altitudes where tree species are most sensitive to changing conditions lenoir et al 2009 kullman 2007 unlike these empirical studies our approach allowed us to not only assess divergences in tree and seedling distributions but also to predict changes to the physiologically based stresses that are limiting the species and offer some insights that may modify forest management practices to buffer conditions against rapid change it may be simplified to assume that species responses to changing environmental conditions are identical for seedlings and mature trees tree seedling distributions are not only affected by growth but also by germination and success in establishment blanco et al 2009 factors that are currently omitted by the 3 pg model nonetheless the tree seedling inventory used in this study reflects the occurrences of those species that had successfully established and survived in their natural environment the results database focused on areas that have undergone silvicultural activities for reforestation and that have been planted with seedlings it would be valuable to also have information available on natural regeneration in bc to compare with model predictions still the current dataset was useful in providing insights on the actual inventory of regeneration in the province as influenced by forest management practices furthermore seedlings were only planted within current species ranges thus species shifts as identified in this study reflect climatic influences rather than changes in management practices continuous forest monitoring in permanent plots at decadal intervals would improve our models in addition to our understanding of how a progressively changing climate impacts tree mortality and regeneration and thereby forest composition it is also desirable to seek more representative data on species growth distribution and site characteristics we encourage a multitude of approaches to improve models including those incorporating interactions with rising atmospheric concentrations of co2 waring and gao 2016 and genetic effects wang et al 2010 including forest disturbances in species distribution models should improve predictions of stresses that are expected to increase with climate change rehfeldt and jaquish 2010 for example by incorporating projections of fire occurrences waring and coops 2016 or outbreaks of insects and pathogens woods et al 2010 mather et al 2010 incorporating a regeneration module within 3 pg would also improve predictions by including microclimatic variation in light and frost ribbens and pacala 1994 canham et al 1994 it would be more challenging to create a model that included the mechanical limitations imposed by browsing snow and ice holmgren et al 1997 the version of the 3 pg model used in this study is also only applicable for conifer trees recently the model has been modified to account for deciduous and mixed species forests by adjusting for differences in light absorption and within canopy vertical gradients in climate forrester and tang 2016 differentiating soil water access for seedlings versus trees would also refine model predictions as we highlight the increased importance of drought on species growth for example young ponderosa pine trees have been found to be more sensitive to drought earlier in the season compared to older trees irvine et al 2002 accounting for differences in rooting depth with tree age can contribute to improving predictions of species responses from regeneration to maturity this study highlighted how climate shifts are leading to changes in tree species distribution patterns as affected by alterations of the environmental limitations on species growth employing an extensive regeneration dataset allowed us to compare and contrast predicted areas suitable for tree species range expansion with those where tree seedlings have been successfully established while species such as lodgepole pine and subalpine fir likely experienced increased stress with climate change there was potential for species such as douglas fir and western larch to expand their range as survival conditions improved knowledge of the crucial stressors on tree species and where to expect potential for species range expansions can be useful for forest managers developing mitigation practices to climate change the most important contribution of our analysis is perhaps the approach itself where the distribution of two life stages in a species are compared in reference to their appearance or absence on recorded plots over contrasting periods representing subtle but progressive shifts in climatic conditions we hope to see the approach extended and tested more widely in western north america and beyond acknowledgements we appreciate the support obtained by a grant from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa

25242,climate change can lead to an increased frequency of extreme weather events which may induce a decline in tree vitality rendering the forest more vulnerable to other stress factors in this study we used the ecosystem model lpj guess to compare the npp of boreal conifers on till soil and sandy soil simulating the growth of norway spruce during the 21st century using climate model projections corresponding to rcp 8 5 model runs with and without nitrogen cycling enabled in combination with two different approaches to implement the dynamics of non structural carbohydrates nsc were compared the simulations showed that the forest productivity in sweden is influenced by an interplay between site specific temperature conditions and precipitation local differences in soil conditions can have an impact on the productivity mediated by soil water and nutrient content a warmer climate will lead to a longer growing season but the productivity increase will partly be offset by a higher frequency of drought stress in summer and higher autotrophic respiration in winter the ecosystem model runs indicated that periods with drought stress can cause low nsc levels leading to time periods with decreased defence capacity against attacks by secondary agents such as bark beetles the risks may however not become apparent until the forest stands are middle aged the model results are discussed in relation to current forestry practice with norway spruce picea abies commonly being planted on dry soils better suited for scots pine pinus sylvestris in order to reduce moose browsing

alces bergqvist et al 2001 bergstr√∂m and bergqvist 1999 tree growth and vitality are highly influenced by environmental conditions and norway spruce grows better on till soils than scots pine but is more sensitive to dry spells and root rot on sandy soils bergquist et al 2005 bergqvist 2016 this have created a concern that spruce stands on pine soils may perform less well in the future in particular after being exposed to a severe drought stress bergqvist 2016 the concern includes that drought stress may predispose the spruce trees to attacks by the spruce bark beetle ips typographus which is capable of killing millions of mature spruce trees during outbreaks marini et al 2017 the issue described above is strongly linked to the potential impact of climate change and the development of adaptation strategies a warmer climate may be beneficial for the forestry sector in northern europe resulting in a longer growing period with increased productivity bergh et al 2003 eriksson et al 2015 koca et al 2006 however climate change may also increase the risk of storm damage particularly in spruce forests as a consequence of increased occurrence of unfrozen soil and heavy precipitation during autumn and winter months when wind storms are common j√∂nsson et al 2015 spruce bark beetle outbreaks are commonly triggered by storm events as stormfelled spruce trees with low defence capacity can lead to rapid population build up which triggers aggregated attacks on living trees j√∂nsson et al 2012 heat spells and drought often aggravate bark beetle outbreaks christiansen and bakke 1988 as warm weather can trigger flight activity of bark beetles in late summer j√∂nsson et al 2011 and tree drought stress can lead to lowered defence capacity netherer et al 2016 coniferous trees have constitutive as well as induced defence systems christiansen and bakke 1997 the constitutive defence consists of resin ducts and the activation of the induced defence e g by bark beetle attacks leads to mass production of resin and formation of reaction zones franceschi et al 2005 zhao et al 2011 the tree defence capacity is linked to the amount of carbohydrates that can be used for defensive reactions christiansen et al 1987 guerard et al 2007 the storage of non structural carbohydrates mainly mobile carbohydrates and starch can be used as a proxy for assessing tree vulnerability and response to climate stress breda et al 2006 as trees allocate energy resources to storage reserves in order to meet seasonal demands and buffer for stressful events chapin et al 1990 hoch et al 2003 climate change with warmer winters may have a negative impact on the storage as the temperature dependent maintenance respiration will increase at a time when the light dependent photosynthesis is low or inactive kalberer et al 2006 ecosystem modelling is useful for assessing potential future conditions and model assessments of climate impact on primary production risk of storm damage and subsequent bark beetle attacks have been carried out j√∂nsson et al 2015 2012 lagergren et al 2012 however ecosystem model assessments are commonly performed at a regional to global scale and local differences in soil conditions or carry over effects conveyed by non structural carbohydrates are generally not accounted for in this study we therefore applied the ecosystem model lpj guess to assess potential climate effects on tree vitality quantified in terms of annual net primary production npp and amount of non structural carbohydrates nsc as proxies of bark beetle defence capacity model runs with and without nitrogen cycling enabled in combination with two different approaches to quantify nsc were compared to assess the effect of model setup to address climate change effects we used an ensemble of climate model data corresponding to rcp 8 5 and focused on climate impacts on net primary production autotrophic respiration during winter and soil water content covering a range of climate factors and soil conditions our hypothesis was that an increase in npp caused by a warmer climate will be offset both by dry spells during summer and elevated winter time respiration with spruce stands planted on sandy soils being more prone to negative effects in terms of low nsc storage than spruce stands on till soils 2 material and methods 2 1 dynamic vegetation model the dynamic vegetation model lpj guess simulates the development of plant individuals through the processes of establishment growth and mortality and the simulated vegetation development takes generic natural disturbances into account smith et al 2001 the model has mechanistic representation of the competition for resources and it includes stocks and fluxes to simulate the ecosystem s water and carbon cycles smith et al 2001 we used this model as it has been adapted to simulate the effect of formal management schemes representative of swedish forest management practice including planting of seedlings to generate an even aged monoculture forest stand pre commercial thinning thinning and clearcutting lagergren et al 2012 lpj guess accounts for the co2 fertilization effect also leading to an increased water use efficiency and for the temperature effect on tree photosynthesis with a warmer climate leading to a longer growing season lpj guess estimates of npp are in line with other terrestrial carbon cycle models as well as data from face experiments piao et al 2013 furthermore model code to capture the nitrogen cycle has recently been implemented which influences the photosynthesis as well as the proportion of carbon allocated between above ground and below ground biomass smith et al 2014 the vegetation dynamics is simulated for patches representing an area of 1000 m2 in which the plant individuals are grouped in age class and species specific cohorts the model requires a spin up period of 400 years to allow for soil formation and establishment of forest vegetation plant functional types are distinguished by the parameter settings of climatic limits for establishment and survival temperature response of phenology and photosynthesis tree allometry turnover rates root distribution and drought tolerance the model simulations of this study included two plant functional types boreal coniferous forest parameterised for norway spruce and an understory layer represented by c3 grass 2 2 climate data lpj guess is driven by gridded climate data using daily data on temperature precipitation and radiation and annual data on co2 concentration and nitrogen deposition data used in this study were selected from the euro cordex ensemble of regionally downscaled climate model scenario data for 1971 2099 with a daily temporal resolution and a spatial resolution of 0 44 0 44 approximately 50 50 km kotlarski et al 2014 for the spin up period with the first simulation year corresponding to real year 1500 the 1971 2000 period of climate data was repeated to generate a stable baseline to assess the effect of a distinct climate change signal climate model data representing radiative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 moss et al 2010 were used the data were selected in a two step procedure in the first step the temperature and precipitation data of all the 11 ensemble members representing rcp 8 5 had been bias corrected according to the quantile mapping method wilcke et al 2013 using mesan euro4m as reference in the second step a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to extract a representative sub ensemble wilcke and b√§rring 2016 with the aim of reducing the number of time consuming ecosystem model simulations without losing information on potential climate development and uncertainties represented by the overall ensemble the hierarchical cluster analysis was based on data from two time periods 1971 2000 and 2059 2098 and three measures of importance for vegetation growth 1 cumulative degree days above 5 c 2 temperature and precipitation in spring and summer may to july and 3 temperature and precipitation in late summer and autumn august to october by this procedure four representative ensemble members were identified table 1 corresponding to factor 7 in the analysis of model results details are provided in section 2 4 co2 concentration associated with rcp8 5 was obtained from the rcp database http tntcat iiasa ac at 8787 rcpdb 2 3 model settings model simulations combining seven factors with different parameter settings were performed to generate an ensemble of lpj guess model runs to quantifying model trends over space and time as well as model uncertainties fig 1 two of the factors relate to site conditions 1 three sites were selected to capture large scale environmental gradients and 2 local variations in soil conditions were assessed for each site by including simulations representing two soil texture classes sand and till two of the factors relate to temporal aspects of climate change and forest stand development 3 three time periods 2010 2029 2040 2059 and 2080 2099 were selected to capture the impact of climate change during the 21st century according to scenario rcp 8 5 and 4 three forest stand age classes corresponding to young mid age and mature forest were simulated to assess differences over a rotation period the three final factors address model uncertainties by 5 comparing lpj guess simulations with and without nitrogen cycling enabled 6 using two different approaches to quantify nsc and 7 comparing model runs driven by different climate model datasets model simulations were carried out for three sites in sweden factor 1 situated in the counties of kalmar v√§rmland and v√§sternorrland figure abbreviations v√§rml and v norrl each site corresponds to a climate grid cell and the sites were selected to capture different environmental conditions table 2 according to the following three criteria i the sites should cover a distinct gradient in latitude and consequently also in temperature and day length ii the sites should cover a gradient in the difference between potential and actual evapotranspiration iii the sites should be situated in a region with severe browsing of pine saplings which have led to a high fraction of the drier sites most suitable for scots pine being regenerated with norway spruce for site selection table 2 hydrological information was obtained from the swedish hydrological meteorological institute www smhi se klimatdata hydrologi avdunstning 2017 05 15 sapling damage and regeneration information was obtained from the swedish moose browsing inventory in 2016 by the swedish forest agency https skogsstyrelsen se abin 2017 05 15 to assess the effect of soil conditions factor 2 on tree vitality the simulations were done for both moist soil and dry soil types differing in the parameterisation of k and h max table 3 in haxeltine and prentice 1996 k is the empirical scalar of the water content dependent percolation from the upper soil layer to the lower soil layer mm day 1 the percolation at field capacity of the upper layer h max is the fraction of available water volume fraction of water at field capacity minus fraction of water at wilting point the moist soil type represents a till with high fraction of silt and clay k 4 mm day 1 h max 16 whereas the dry soil type represents a coarse well sorted sandy soil k 5 mm day 1 h max 4 in both soils the upper soil layer was 0 5 m deep and the lower 1 0 m which implies that the maximum store of available water was 240 mm 80 mm in upper layer in the till and 60 mm 20 mm in upper layer in the sand the parameters for the root distribution in norway spruce were set to 80 of the roots in the upper layer and 20 in the lower layer rosengren and stjernquist 2004 for each period three age classes were simulated a young 0 19 years a mid age 30 49 years and an old forest stand 80 99 years factor 4 ten patches were simulated for each age class providing replicates that differ in the history of random disturbance events during the spin up period forest management started in 1780 1860 depending on what age class and period to be simulated by turning natural disturbance off and implementing 100 years rotation periods with harvesting of tree stem biomass for example the patches with trees that were 30 49 years old in 2040 2059 had been clear cut three times in 1810 1910 and 2010 after harvest natural regeneration of conifers was simulated to occur to generate even aged monocultures to account for site specific differences in productivity and resulting timing of management pre commercial thinning pct was implemented at a stand age of 8 9 and 11 years in kalmar v√§rmland and v√§sternorrland respectively allowing a maximum of 2300 2000 and 1680 saplings per ha the pct was done from below by taking away the youngest cohorts in first order after the pct no further tree establishment was allowed natural disturbances were not simulated for managed forests in order to generate results that were not influenced by confounding random factors model runs were carried out both with and without n cycling factor 5 using gridded historical and rcp 8 5 scenario data of n deposition lamarque et al 2010 2011 that is with n cycling enabled the nitrogen cycle is explicitly modelled including deposition biological n fixation uptake by vegetation losses by leaching and decomposition of soil organic matter as influenced by the c n ratio soil water content temperature and texture smith et al 2014 an important difference between the two model runs was the parameterisation of Œ± a that reduce quantum efficiency co2 assimilation per unit photosynthetic active radiation absorbed from leaf to canopy level Œ± a was set to 0 55 without n cycling and 0 70 with n cycling enabled with the photosynthetic efficiency being dynamically reduced by n limitations furthermore the autotrophic respiration is linked to the c n in living biomass which is flexible with n cycling and fixed without the Œ± a values have been calibrated by smith et al 2014 to obtain comparable global scale estimates of the main ecosystem c stocks and flows with both settings for the period 1961 1990 this study includes two different approaches to quantify nsc factor 6 the model runs with the two different settings were denoted nsc off and nsc on respectively differing in how the nsc is linked to a loan or a storage and scaled in relation to the carbon mass in sapwood or canopy the original lpj guess code nsc off does not explicitly account for nsc storage but during years when the biomass increment in terms of allocation of resources to leaves and fine roots exceeds available resources a loan of up to 80 of the annual deficit is allowed for further limited to not exceed 20 of the carbon mass in sapwood if the c debt becomes larger leaf and root biomass is reduced to satisfy tree allometry requirements in this study an alternative code explicitly accounting for storage of nsc was implemented as part of the annual allocation routine simulated by the end of each year nsc on eq 1 while the nsc storage has commonly been defined from measurements i e in terms of concentration it is the outcome in terms of altered pool sizes that is of key interest hartmann and trumbore 2016 this study therefor focuses on carbon pools rather than concentrations the maximum nsc storage pool nscmax was set to be twice as large as the pool of structural carbohydrates in the canopy an approximation based on data on total leaf mass per nsc pool in above ground xylem in evergreen coniferous tree species hoch et al 2003 that is the maximum storage is dynamically scaled in relation to the climate and nitrogen dependent tree allometry and annual growth the allocation to nsc storage at time t nsct was calculated on the basis of the storage at previous time step t 1 as the lowest positive amount of either the gap in nsc storage nscmax nsct 1 or the amount of carbohydrates available for storage photosynthesist autotropic respirationt the remaining carbohydrates were allocated to growth nppt eq 2 1 nsct nsct 1 max

npp biomass and soil water content swc corresponding to model runs generated to cover all combinations of the seven factors were included in the analysis of results the result section includes information on these aspects in relation to site and soil specific conditions factor 1 and 2 temporal aspects factor 3 and 4 model parameterisation factor 5 and 6 and selection of climate data factor 7 statistical analysis comparing the variation among factors were carried out in matlab 2015a using the anovan function the analysis of npp includes a comparison over years to assess the net increase or decrease in primary production in response to altered climate conditions an analysis of the winter npp nppw calculated as a sum of the monthly npp during october to february generated a proxy of the wintertime autotrophic respiration to account for the dependence of autotrophic respiration on total living biomass which in turn can be influenced by the climate conditions a normalised measure of the mean winter npp nppwn was calculated as nppw divided by the total biomass the biomass was quantified as the carbon storage in living trees kg c m 2 including the amount of non structural carbohydrates nsc kg c m 2 the relative soil water content swc was calculated as the fraction of the water holding capacity in the upper soil layer that was filled with water to generate a proxy of tree drought stress the frequency of months with swc less than 0 2 over the 20 year periods was used lagergren and lindroth 2002 the result section includes drought frequency estimates for june july and august as these are the months with highest likelihood of tree drought stress and the complete dataset on swc for the summer and winter months are presented in supplement 1 the ensemble of model simulations were sequentially averaged over all but one factor site period soil type age class n cycling nsc accounting and climate data to generate estimated averages of npp nsc and swc 3 results 3 1 simulated trends in production and biomass the ensemble of lpj guess simulations including the full range of parameter settings indicated that the npp ranges from 0 26 kg c m 2 at the northernmost site in v√§sternorrland to 0 30 0 31 at the sites in v√§rmland and kalmar under current climate conditions the simulation period averages were slightly higher 0 03 kg c m 2 table 3 the simulated productivity differed significantly between the two soil classes being about 20 higher for conifer stands on till 0 33 0 36 kg c m 2 than on sandy soils 0 18 0 25 kg c m 2 in comparison with npp estimates based on data from the swedish national forest inventory nfi nilsson and corey 2013 the modelled npp was within the observed range for spruce and pine in v√§sternorrland and on sandy soils in v√§rmland but significantly lower for till soils in v√§rmland and all soils in kalmar fig 2 the ensemble simulations indicated that npp could increase on average by 10 15 at the three sites comparing the end of the 21st century under rcp 8 5 with current climate conditions the trend varied among sites and model settings fig 3 the most pronounced increase over time a doubling of npp was found for young trees 0 19 years old in v√§sternorrland when comparing the simulations with n cycling in general model simulations without n cycling indicated a less pronounced increase with no additional increase or even a slight decrease e g for the till soil in kalmar when comparing the near future with the far future fig 3 furthermore the level of npp was influenced by the forest stand age at all three sites the productivity was low for young trees increasing over time until reaching a peak around the mid ages then entering a stage of slow decline as the trees grow older the inter annual variation in npp was in the order of 10 except for the 0 19 age class for which the recovery from zero npp at harvest generated a strong trend and thereby a large variation over years model simulations with n cycling generated 18 lower npp in v√§sternorrland than at the two other sites whereas the npp did not differ among sites in simulations without n cycling the model simulations with nsc on generated slightly lower npp than the model simulations not accounting for nsc table 3 and for the youngest age class the npp became substantially lower with nsc as a relatively large proportion of the photosynthate were allocated to nsc instead of growth fig 3 the selection of climate model data influenced the simulated npp and simulations driven by the ec earth climate data stood out as they generated 20 25 lower npp than model runs with the other climate data sets showing a covariance with low soil water content during summer table 3 the differences among model runs and trends over time observed for the npp was in turn converted to differences in standing biomass fig 4 3 2 non structural carbohydrates the levels of nsc fig 5 were strongly related to lai as the maximum nsc storage was scaled in relation to the structural carbohydrates of the canopy the youngest trees therefore displayed the largest inter annual variations in nsc induced by the rapid growth and development over time the allocation of nsc to storage nsc on led to less leaf biomass and lower npp estimates than nsc off table 3 the effect was generally most pronounced in combination with n cycling resulting in the lowest estimates of npp and biomass accumulation figs 3 and 5 as inter annual variations in climate conditions influenced the modelled nsc the variation among model runs with different climate data sets was substantially larger than the between year variation within a model run especially for the sand soil fig 5 the lowest nsc level of all simulations was 83 of maximum storage for middle aged forest and 88 for old forest thus none of the model simulations indicated a major effect of combined stressful conditions that would lead to a substantially lowered carbohydrate storage over a period of years 3 3 tree winter respiration the lpj guess simulations indicated that nppw ranges from 20 5 g c m 2 at the northernmost site in v√§sternorrland to 25 9 to 27 5 g c m 2 at kalmar and v√§rmland warmer winters can have a significant impact on the autotrophic respiration and the model simulations corresponding to rcp 8 5 showed that the c losses during the darkest months of winter october to february could become twice as high by end of the century as currently fig 6 table 3 the normalized winter respiration loss showed that the trees lose about 1 of their total biomass in the current climate which can increase to 1 6 by 2080 2099 table 3 the npp loss was higher for the till than the sand soil both in absolute and relative terms this is mainly attributable to differences in respiration level influenced by n status and fraction of living biomass as the autotrophic winter respiration was significantly higher for conifer stands on till than on sandy soils also reflected by the normalised winter respiration values nppwn table 3 the modelled soil temperature is a factor that influences root respiration however this effect was considered negligible as the average difference in modelled soil temperature was 0 01 c root mean squared difference of 0 09 c in relation to the tree size the absolute and relative loss displayed opposite trends with the amount of losses being higher in older forest and the relative loss being higher in young forest that is the relative loss decreases from approximately 0 4 in newly planted forest to around 0 15 in mature forest with the loss in young forest being higher at higher latitudes as it takes longer time for the trees to reach a size at which the respiration levels off as a result of a decreasing sapwood to heartwood ratio model runs with n cycling generated higher n content of sapwood and roots than model runs without n cycling with the consequence that the model simulations displayed a higher sensitivity to elevated temperatures during the darkest months as higher n content is linked to higher respiratory losses there was no difference in the current climate for the northernmost site while the difference was more than 100 for the southern site by the end of the century fig 6 implementing nsc accounting resulted in less negative npp during winter and the model runs driven by different climate data sets ranged between 13 1 to 11 6 g kg 1 table 3 3 4 frequency of low soil water content the simulated level of soil water content was highly dependent on the climate model data with the regional climate model data sets originating from a dynamic downscaling of data from canesm2 and ec earth tending to generate lower swc than data from cerfacs and ipsl for the last time period supplement 1 figs s1 s3 in this study a threshold of 0 2 was used as a proxy of drought stress to enable a comparison among model runs in terms of projected impacts the most pronounced difference among model runs was found for the month of july in v√§sternorrland with the model run driven by ec earth climate data indicating a substantially higher frequency of low swc than the other climate data sets 28 compared with 2 5 furthermore the model simulations indicated that the fraction of years with a mean monthly swc in the upper layer being less than 0 2 ranged from 2 to 11 of the years in v√§sternorrland 5 13 in v√§rmland and 11 17 in kalmar generally being high in june and july and substantially lower in august table 3 the frequency of low swc was about three times higher for sand than till in june whereas the differences were less pronounced in july about 1 4 times higher and august about 1 2 times higher fig 7 9 table 3 the simulations also indicated that younger trees were significantly less likely to experience drought conditions than older trees table 3 in kalmar the drought frequency consistently increased over time in the rcp 8 5 scenario but for v√§rmland there was no further increase after the 2040 2059 period and v√§sternorrland indicated a slight decline for the last period table 4 especially for the till soil simulations with n cycling implied fewer years with low swc with the largest difference found for june in kalmar 2040 2059 low swc in one out of fifty years compared with one out of five years fig 7 model simulations with nsc indicated 1 2 lower frequency of low swc likely related to a slightly lower npp 4 discussion climate change including changes in the frequency and severity of extreme events is likely to influence forest stand productivity and vitality in sweden eriksson et al 2015 in this study we combined regional ecosystem modelling with an analysis of local differences in soil conditions using a dynamic approach to assess potential climate change impacts which cannot be accounted for by traditional empirical forest management models differences in climate vulnerability among forest stands were assessed using a sub ensemble of bias corrected climate model data corresponding to rcp 8 5 the simulations showed that the productivity of boreal conifer forests in sweden is influenced by the fine interplay between site specific temperature conditions and precipitation the model results depicted that local differences in soil conditions have a large impact on the productivity mediated by soil water and nutrient contents which is well known from the empirical relations commonly used for estimations of production potential h√§gglund and lundmark 1977 furthermore the model analysis indicated that model setting explicitly taking nsc and n dynamics into account influences the npp estimates 4 1 model performance the growth of the boreal forests in northern europe is mainly constrained by the dark and cold winter season nemani et al 2003 furthermore fertilisation and irrigation experiments of norway spruce forest stands have indicated that water availability during growing season can be more of a limiting factor for tree growth in the south than in the north of sweden bergh et al 1999 this is in line with the findings of this study with lowest productivity at the northernmost site v√§sternorrland and similar productivity levels at the south site and the central site kalmar and v√§rmland as the benefit of a slightly longer growing season at the south site was offset by a higher frequency of drought stress the lpj guess version without n cycling has been found to generate npp estimates that are similar to other terrestrial carbon cycle models and data from face experiments piao et al 2013 however the modelled npp was generally at the lower end compared with observed forest productivity being closer to the nfi based npp estimates of the northern site than of the southern site and closer to scots pine forest than norway spruce forest fig 2 this generated an age class specific modelled biomass fig 4 that was lower than indicated by forest monitoring table 2 this is in line with a recent study in which npp estimates similar to lpj guess were obtained using biome bgc arguing that the inability to capture the latitudinal gradient in productivity of swedish forests could be due to limited parameter calibration dubber et al 2017 that is despite mechanistic properties the vegetation models are likely not capable of capturing the species specific adaptations to environmental conditions such as latitudinal gradients in light and temperature olsson and j√∂nsson 2014 carbon nitrogen interactions can have a significant influence on the simulated response to climate change and increased ambient co2 concentration piao et al 2013 and for all three sites there was an interaction between the n cycling setting and climate period model runs with n cycling enabled generated slightly lower npp for 2010 2029 and slightly higher npp for 2080 2099 compared with model runs without n cycling the effect was most pronounced for the youngest age class c f fig 3 which is related to that the trees became more light limited without n cycling due to a lower value of Œ± a and a decreasing trend over the years in incoming shortwave radiation lagergren and j√∂nsson 2017 n cycling influenced the model estimates also in terms of low soil water content and risk of drought stress model simulations without n cycling indicated a significantly higher frequency of events with low soil water content than simulations with n cycling due to a lower water use efficiency linked to the lower value of Œ± a smith et al 2014 the nsc accounting implemented in this study generated slightly lower npp values caused by a carry over effect between years this is a result of more restricted growth in years when water was a limiting factor for tree photosynthesis resulting in less carbon allocated to crown development which reflects current understanding of nsc allocation principles hartmann and trumbore 2016 furthermore the simulated risk of summer drought as indicated by a low swc differed significantly among model runs with different climate data sets supplement 1 figs s1 s3 showing the importance of using an ensemble of climate model data to identify key uncertainties associated with future projections littell et al 2011 4 2 trends related to climate change forest growth potential in sweden has been predicted to increase in response to a temperature induced lengthening of the growing season bergh et al 2003 eriksson et al 2015 koca et al 2006 this study confirmed this however it also indicated that the productivity increase will be partly offset by higher autotrophic respiration in winter and higher frequency of drought stress in summer that is the nsc storage of coniferous tree species can be reduced during late winter and early spring if the temperature dependent respiration rate is high while the light dependent photosynthesis is low or inactive kalberer et al 2006 the response to drought stress will depend on the length and intensity of the event as growth limitation caused by mild drought results in accumulation of carbohydrates while the amount of non structural carbohydrates can become reduced during a more severe drought stress mcdowell 2011 low levels of nsc can trigger tree mortality separately or in combination with drought stress galiano et al 2011 hartmann and trumbore 2016 mcdowell 2011 however no indication of cumulative environmental stress leading to severely depleted nsc storage over years was found in this study which included four sets of climate model data generating 80 simulations years for each time period of 20 years the estimated size of nscmax based on a few central europe trees sampled in 1999 2002 hoch et al 2003 is subjected to uncertainties as the nsc pool can show strong seasonal and interannual variations hartmann and trumbore 2016 however the lowest nsc level found in this study 83 of the annual maximum nsc pool is clearly above the suggested minimum level of 46 for coniferous trees adams et al 2017 martinez vilalta et al 2016 indicating that the results of this modelling study are robust in relation to the nscmax parameterization that is the trees are not likely to primarily suffer from carbon depletion but may during shorter periods of reduced nsc availability become more susceptible to attacks by secondary agents such as bark beetles rouault et al 2006 the result of this study is indicative of the study region only as northern europe is less vulnerable to sever drought stress than southern europe climate model projections indicate that this pattern will remain also in a warmer climate as there is medium confidence that climate change will lead to annual precipitation increases in northern europe it is likely that winter mean temperature will rise more in northern than southern europe and summer warming is likely to become more intense in southern than northern europe ipcc 2013 at the local scale soil conditions can modify forest exposure to climate extremes and risk of forest damage the ecosystem model simulation showed that norway spruce on sandy soils were more exposed to drought stress while norway spruce planted on till soils were more exposed to high water saturation during winter supplement 1 figs s4 s6 which in combination with a lower probability of frozen soil conditions in a warmer climate will make them vulnerable to uprooting during a storm event lagergren et al 2012 seidl et al 2011 planting norway spruce trees on sandy soil better suited for scots pine may thus add to the landscape vulnerable to bark beetle attacks by increasing the amount of forest susceptible to drought stress the model simulations indicated that middle age forests are somewhat more sensitive to stressful weather conditions than younger or older forests due to a generally higher leaf biomass and thereby higher water requirement problems associated with unsuitable tree site matching i e planting norway spruce trees on sandy soil more frequently exposed to summer drought may not become apparent until the forest stand is middle aged rouault et al 2006 climate change may worsen the outcome via an altered frequency and intensity of heatwaves and drought spells sou 2007 which can influence the risk of successful spruce bark beetle attacks both via altered tree defence capacity christiansen et al 1987 and altered insect phenology caused by a temperature dependent shift from predominantly one to two generations per year in sweden j√∂nsson et al 2011 j√∂nsson et al 2012 5 conclusions model derived knowledge on forest vulnerability to abiotic stress factors is needed to assess potential future risks and identify suitable adaptation strategies at the landscape level in this study we applied an ecosystem model to address questions related to climate change and forest stand development on two soil texture classes being managed as norway spruce monocultures model runs with four different climate data sets and three sites indicated that the productivity increase induced by a warmer climate leading to a longer growing season in sweden will be partly offset by a higher frequency of drought stress in summer and warm winters with elevated autotrophic respiration the results indicated that non structural carbohydrate depletion caused by cumulative environmental stress is less likely to become a primary cause of tree mortality in sweden but periods with low nsc levels may link to temporary reductions in tree defence capacity acknowledgements this study was financially supported by formas through the

25242,climate change can lead to an increased frequency of extreme weather events which may induce a decline in tree vitality rendering the forest more vulnerable to other stress factors in this study we used the ecosystem model lpj guess to compare the npp of boreal conifers on till soil and sandy soil simulating the growth of norway spruce during the 21st century using climate model projections corresponding to rcp 8 5 model runs with and without nitrogen cycling enabled in combination with two different approaches to implement the dynamics of non structural carbohydrates nsc were compared the simulations showed that the forest productivity in sweden is influenced by an interplay between site specific temperature conditions and precipitation local differences in soil conditions can have an impact on the productivity mediated by soil water and nutrient content a warmer climate will lead to a longer growing season but the productivity increase will partly be offset by a higher frequency of drought stress in summer and higher autotrophic respiration in winter the ecosystem model runs indicated that periods with drought stress can cause low nsc levels leading to time periods with decreased defence capacity against attacks by secondary agents such as bark beetles the risks may however not become apparent until the forest stands are middle aged the model results are discussed in relation to current forestry practice with norway spruce picea abies commonly being planted on dry soils better suited for scots pine pinus sylvestris in order to reduce moose browsing damage of seedlings which in the longer term may create a forest landscape more sensitive to spruce bark beetle attacks keywords climate impact assessment ips typographus lpj guess non structural carbohydrates rcp 8 5 boreal coniferous forest 1 introduction climate change can lead to an increased frequency of extreme weather events ipcc 2013 which may induce a decline in tree vitality rendering the forest more vulnerable to other stress factors breda et al 2006 experiences from the 2003 heat wave in europe indicate that exceedance of species specific physiological tolerance limits and subsequent attacks by forest pests may threaten entire forest stands archaux and wolters 2006 desprez loustau et al 2006 rouault et al 2006 seidl et al 2008 the boreal coniferous forest of northern europe is to a large extent managed as even aged monocultures with final felling clear cutting followed by planting of seedlings the 50 to 150 years rotation periods of even aged forest stands indicate that future scenarios should be taken into account at the timing of regeneration to enable sustained production levels and risk management j√∂nsson et al 2015 norway spruce picea abies is the most common tree species in swedish forests followed by scots pine pinus sylvestris accounting for 42 and 39 of the total standing volume respectively christiansen 2014 in recent years many forest owners have regenerated scots pine forest stands with norway spruce as spruce seedlings are less palatable than pine seedlings and thereby suffer less from heavy browsing by the moose alces alces bergqvist et al 2001 bergstr√∂m and bergqvist 1999 tree growth and vitality are highly influenced by environmental conditions and norway spruce grows better on till soils than scots pine but is more sensitive to dry spells and root rot on sandy soils bergquist et al 2005 bergqvist 2016 this have created a concern that spruce stands on pine soils may perform less well in the future in particular after being exposed to a severe drought stress bergqvist 2016 the concern includes that drought stress may predispose the spruce trees to attacks by the spruce bark beetle ips typographus which is capable of killing millions of mature spruce trees during outbreaks marini et al 2017 the issue described above is strongly linked to the potential impact of climate change and the development of adaptation strategies a warmer climate may be beneficial for the forestry sector in northern europe resulting in a longer growing period with increased productivity bergh et al 2003 eriksson et al 2015 koca et al 2006 however climate change may also increase the risk of storm damage particularly in spruce forests as a consequence of increased occurrence of unfrozen soil and heavy precipitation during autumn and winter months when wind storms are common j√∂nsson et al 2015 spruce bark beetle outbreaks are commonly triggered by storm events as stormfelled spruce trees with low defence capacity can lead to rapid population build up which triggers aggregated attacks on living trees j√∂nsson et al 2012 heat spells and drought often aggravate bark beetle outbreaks christiansen and bakke 1988 as warm weather can trigger flight activity of bark beetles in late summer j√∂nsson et al 2011 and tree drought stress can lead to lowered defence capacity netherer et al 2016 coniferous trees have constitutive as well as induced defence systems christiansen and bakke 1997 the constitutive defence consists of resin ducts and the activation of the induced defence e g by bark beetle attacks leads to mass production of resin and formation of reaction zones franceschi et al 2005 zhao et al 2011 the tree defence capacity is linked to the amount of carbohydrates that can be used for defensive reactions christiansen et al 1987 guerard et al 2007 the storage of non structural carbohydrates mainly mobile carbohydrates and starch can be used as a proxy for assessing tree vulnerability and response to climate stress breda et al 2006 as trees allocate energy resources to storage reserves in order to meet seasonal demands and buffer for stressful events chapin et al 1990 hoch et al 2003 climate change with warmer winters may have a negative impact on the storage as the temperature dependent maintenance respiration will increase at a time when the light dependent photosynthesis is low or inactive kalberer et al 2006 ecosystem modelling is useful for assessing potential future conditions and model assessments of climate impact on primary production risk of storm damage and subsequent bark beetle attacks have been carried out j√∂nsson et al 2015 2012 lagergren et al 2012 however ecosystem model assessments are commonly performed at a regional to global scale and local differences in soil conditions or carry over effects conveyed by non structural carbohydrates are generally not accounted for in this study we therefore applied the ecosystem model lpj guess to assess potential climate effects on tree vitality quantified in terms of annual net primary production npp and amount of non structural carbohydrates nsc as proxies of bark beetle defence capacity model runs with and without nitrogen cycling enabled in combination with two different approaches to quantify nsc were compared to assess the effect of model setup to address climate change effects we used an ensemble of climate model data corresponding to rcp 8 5 and focused on climate impacts on net primary production autotrophic respiration during winter and soil water content covering a range of climate factors and soil conditions our hypothesis was that an increase in npp caused by a warmer climate will be offset both by dry spells during summer and elevated winter time respiration with spruce stands planted on sandy soils being more prone to negative effects in terms of low nsc storage than spruce stands on till soils 2 material and methods 2 1 dynamic vegetation model the dynamic vegetation model lpj guess simulates the development of plant individuals through the processes of establishment growth and mortality and the simulated vegetation development takes generic natural disturbances into account smith et al 2001 the model has mechanistic representation of the competition for resources and it includes stocks and fluxes to simulate the ecosystem s water and carbon cycles smith et al 2001 we used this model as it has been adapted to simulate the effect of formal management schemes representative of swedish forest management practice including planting of seedlings to generate an even aged monoculture forest stand pre commercial thinning thinning and clearcutting lagergren et al 2012 lpj guess accounts for the co2 fertilization effect also leading to an increased water use efficiency and for the temperature effect on tree photosynthesis with a warmer climate leading to a longer growing season lpj guess estimates of npp are in line with other terrestrial carbon cycle models as well as data from face experiments piao et al 2013 furthermore model code to capture the nitrogen cycle has recently been implemented which influences the photosynthesis as well as the proportion of carbon allocated between above ground and below ground biomass smith et al 2014 the vegetation dynamics is simulated for patches representing an area of 1000 m2 in which the plant individuals are grouped in age class and species specific cohorts the model requires a spin up period of 400 years to allow for soil formation and establishment of forest vegetation plant functional types are distinguished by the parameter settings of climatic limits for establishment and survival temperature response of phenology and photosynthesis tree allometry turnover rates root distribution and drought tolerance the model simulations of this study included two plant functional types boreal coniferous forest parameterised for norway spruce and an understory layer represented by c3 grass 2 2 climate data lpj guess is driven by gridded climate data using daily data on temperature precipitation and radiation and annual data on co2 concentration and nitrogen deposition data used in this study were selected from the euro cordex ensemble of regionally downscaled climate model scenario data for 1971 2099 with a daily temporal resolution and a spatial resolution of 0 44 0 44 approximately 50 50 km kotlarski et al 2014 for the spin up period with the first simulation year corresponding to real year 1500 the 1971 2000 period of climate data was repeated to generate a stable baseline to assess the effect of a distinct climate change signal climate model data representing radiative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 moss et al 2010 were used the data were selected in a two step procedure in the first step the temperature and precipitation data of all the 11 ensemble members representing rcp 8 5 had been bias corrected according to the quantile mapping method wilcke et al 2013 using mesan euro4m as reference in the second step a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to extract a representative sub ensemble wilcke and b√§rring 2016 with the aim of reducing the number of time consuming ecosystem model simulations without losing information on potential climate development and uncertainties represented by the overall ensemble the hierarchical cluster analysis was based on data from two time periods 1971 2000 and 2059 2098 and three measures of importance for vegetation growth 1 cumulative degree days above 5 c 2 temperature and precipitation in spring and summer may to july and 3 temperature and precipitation in late summer and autumn august to october by this procedure four representative ensemble members were identified table 1 corresponding to factor 7 in the analysis of model results details are provided in section 2 4 co2 concentration associated with rcp8 5 was obtained from the rcp database http tntcat iiasa ac at 8787 rcpdb 2 3 model settings model simulations combining seven factors with different parameter settings were performed to generate an ensemble of lpj guess model runs to quantifying model trends over space and time as well as model uncertainties fig 1 two of the factors relate to site conditions 1 three sites were selected to capture large scale environmental gradients and 2 local variations in soil conditions were assessed for each site by including simulations representing two soil texture classes sand and till two of the factors relate to temporal aspects of climate change and forest stand development 3 three time periods 2010 2029 2040 2059 and 2080 2099 were selected to capture the impact of climate change during the 21st century according to scenario rcp 8 5 and 4 three forest stand age classes corresponding to young mid age and mature forest were simulated to assess differences over a rotation period the three final factors address model uncertainties by 5 comparing lpj guess simulations with and without nitrogen cycling enabled 6 using two different approaches to quantify nsc and 7 comparing model runs driven by different climate model datasets model simulations were carried out for three sites in sweden factor 1 situated in the counties of kalmar v√§rmland and v√§sternorrland figure abbreviations v√§rml and v norrl each site corresponds to a climate grid cell and the sites were selected to capture different environmental conditions table 2 according to the following three criteria i the sites should cover a distinct gradient in latitude and consequently also in temperature and day length ii the sites should cover a gradient in the difference between potential and actual evapotranspiration iii the sites should be situated in a region with severe browsing of pine saplings which have led to a high fraction of the drier sites most suitable for scots pine being regenerated with norway spruce for site selection table 2 hydrological information was obtained from the swedish hydrological meteorological institute www smhi se klimatdata hydrologi avdunstning 2017 05 15 sapling damage and regeneration information was obtained from the swedish moose browsing inventory in 2016 by the swedish forest agency https skogsstyrelsen se abin 2017 05 15 to assess the effect of soil conditions factor 2 on tree vitality the simulations were done for both moist soil and dry soil types differing in the parameterisation of k and h max table 3 in haxeltine and prentice 1996 k is the empirical scalar of the water content dependent percolation from the upper soil layer to the lower soil layer mm day 1 the percolation at field capacity of the upper layer h max is the fraction of available water volume fraction of water at field capacity minus fraction of water at wilting point the moist soil type represents a till with high fraction of silt and clay k 4 mm day 1 h max 16 whereas the dry soil type represents a coarse well sorted sandy soil k 5 mm day 1 h max 4 in both soils the upper soil layer was 0 5 m deep and the lower 1 0 m which implies that the maximum store of available water was 240 mm 80 mm in upper layer in the till and 60 mm 20 mm in upper layer in the sand the parameters for the root distribution in norway spruce were set to 80 of the roots in the upper layer and 20 in the lower layer rosengren and stjernquist 2004 for each period three age classes were simulated a young 0 19 years a mid age 30 49 years and an old forest stand 80 99 years factor 4 ten patches were simulated for each age class providing replicates that differ in the history of random disturbance events during the spin up period forest management started in 1780 1860 depending on what age class and period to be simulated by turning natural disturbance off and implementing 100 years rotation periods with harvesting of tree stem biomass for example the patches with trees that were 30 49 years old in 2040 2059 had been clear cut three times in 1810 1910 and 2010 after harvest natural regeneration of conifers was simulated to occur to generate even aged monocultures to account for site specific differences in productivity and resulting timing of management pre commercial thinning pct was implemented at a stand age of 8 9 and 11 years in kalmar v√§rmland and v√§sternorrland respectively allowing a maximum of 2300 2000 and 1680 saplings per ha the pct was done from below by taking away the youngest cohorts in first order after the pct no further tree establishment was allowed natural disturbances were not simulated for managed forests in order to generate results that were not influenced by confounding random factors model runs were carried out both with and without n cycling factor 5 using gridded historical and rcp 8 5 scenario data of n deposition lamarque et al 2010 2011 that is with n cycling enabled the nitrogen cycle is explicitly modelled including deposition biological n fixation uptake by vegetation losses by leaching and decomposition of soil organic matter as influenced by the c n ratio soil water content temperature and texture smith et al 2014 an important difference between the two model runs was the parameterisation of Œ± a that reduce quantum efficiency co2 assimilation per unit photosynthetic active radiation absorbed from leaf to canopy level Œ± a was set to 0 55 without n cycling and 0 70 with n cycling enabled with the photosynthetic efficiency being dynamically reduced by n limitations furthermore the autotrophic respiration is linked to the c n in living biomass which is flexible with n cycling and fixed without the Œ± a values have been calibrated by smith et al 2014 to obtain comparable global scale estimates of the main ecosystem c stocks and flows with both settings for the period 1961 1990 this study includes two different approaches to quantify nsc factor 6 the model runs with the two different settings were denoted nsc off and nsc on respectively differing in how the nsc is linked to a loan or a storage and scaled in relation to the carbon mass in sapwood or canopy the original lpj guess code nsc off does not explicitly account for nsc storage but during years when the biomass increment in terms of allocation of resources to leaves and fine roots exceeds available resources a loan of up to 80 of the annual deficit is allowed for further limited to not exceed 20 of the carbon mass in sapwood if the c debt becomes larger leaf and root biomass is reduced to satisfy tree allometry requirements in this study an alternative code explicitly accounting for storage of nsc was implemented as part of the annual allocation routine simulated by the end of each year nsc on eq 1 while the nsc storage has commonly been defined from measurements i e in terms of concentration it is the outcome in terms of altered pool sizes that is of key interest hartmann and trumbore 2016 this study therefor focuses on carbon pools rather than concentrations the maximum nsc storage pool nscmax was set to be twice as large as the pool of structural carbohydrates in the canopy an approximation based on data on total leaf mass per nsc pool in above ground xylem in evergreen coniferous tree species hoch et al 2003 that is the maximum storage is dynamically scaled in relation to the climate and nitrogen dependent tree allometry and annual growth the allocation to nsc storage at time t nsct was calculated on the basis of the storage at previous time step t 1 as the lowest positive amount of either the gap in nsc storage nscmax nsct 1 or the amount of carbohydrates available for storage photosynthesist autotropic respirationt the remaining carbohydrates were allocated to growth nppt eq 2 1 nsct nsct 1 max

npp biomass and soil water content swc corresponding to model runs generated to cover all combinations of the seven factors were included in the analysis of results the result section includes information on these aspects in relation to site and soil specific conditions factor 1 and 2 temporal aspects factor 3 and 4 model parameterisation factor 5 and 6 and selection of climate data factor 7 statistical analysis comparing the variation among factors were carried out in matlab 2015a using the anovan function the analysis of npp includes a comparison over years to assess the net increase or decrease in primary production in response to altered climate conditions an analysis of the winter npp nppw calculated as a sum of the monthly npp during october to february generated a proxy of the wintertime autotrophic respiration to account for the dependence of autotrophic respiration on total living biomass which in turn can be influenced by the climate conditions a normalised measure of the mean winter npp nppwn was calculated as nppw divided by the total biomass the biomass was quantified as the carbon storage in living trees kg c m 2 including the amount of non structural carbohydrates nsc kg c m 2 the relative soil water content swc was calculated as the fraction of the water holding capacity in the upper soil layer that was filled with water to generate a proxy of tree drought stress the frequency of months with swc less than 0 2 over the 20 year periods was used lagergren and lindroth 2002 the result section includes drought frequency estimates for june july and august as these are the months with highest likelihood of tree drought stress and the complete dataset on swc for the summer and winter months are presented in supplement 1 the ensemble of model simulations were sequentially averaged over all but one factor site period soil type age class n cycling nsc accounting and climate data to generate estimated averages of npp nsc and swc 3 results 3 1 simulated trends in production and biomass the ensemble of lpj guess simulations including the full range of parameter settings indicated that the npp ranges from 0 26 kg c m 2 at the northernmost site in v√§sternorrland to 0 30 0 31 at the sites in v√§rmland and kalmar under current climate conditions the simulation period averages were slightly higher 0 03 kg c m 2 table 3 the simulated productivity differed significantly between the two soil classes being about 20 higher for conifer stands on till 0 33 0 36 kg c m 2 than on sandy soils 0 18 0 25 kg c m 2 in comparison with npp estimates based on data from the swedish national forest inventory nfi nilsson and corey 2013 the modelled npp was within the observed range for spruce and pine in v√§sternorrland and on sandy soils in v√§rmland but significantly lower for till soils in v√§rmland and all soils in kalmar fig 2 the ensemble simulations indicated that npp could increase on average by 10 15 at the three sites comparing the end of the 21st century under rcp 8 5 with current climate conditions the trend varied among sites and model settings fig 3 the most pronounced increase over time a doubling of npp was found for young trees 0 19 years old in v√§sternorrland when comparing the simulations with n cycling in general model simulations without n cycling indicated a less pronounced increase with no additional increase or even a slight decrease e g for the till soil in kalmar when comparing the near future with the far future fig 3 furthermore the level of npp was influenced by the forest stand age at all three sites the productivity was low for young trees increasing over time until reaching a peak around the mid ages then entering a stage of slow decline as the trees grow older the inter annual variation in npp was in the order of 10 except for the 0 19 age class for which the recovery from zero npp at harvest generated a strong trend and thereby a large variation over years model simulations with n cycling generated 18 lower npp in v√§sternorrland than at the two other sites whereas the npp did not differ among sites in simulations without n cycling the model simulations with nsc on generated slightly lower npp than the model simulations not accounting for nsc table 3 and for the youngest age class the npp became substantially lower with nsc as a relatively large proportion of the photosynthate were allocated to nsc instead of growth fig 3 the selection of climate model data influenced the simulated npp and simulations driven by the ec earth climate data stood out as they generated 20 25 lower npp than model runs with the other climate data sets showing a covariance with low soil water content during summer table 3 the differences among model runs and trends over time observed for the npp was in turn converted to differences in standing biomass fig 4 3 2 non structural carbohydrates the levels of nsc fig 5 were strongly related to lai as the maximum nsc storage was scaled in relation to the structural carbohydrates of the canopy the youngest trees therefore displayed the largest inter annual variations in nsc induced by the rapid growth and development over time the allocation of nsc to storage nsc on led to less leaf biomass and lower npp estimates than nsc off table 3 the effect was generally most pronounced in combination with n cycling resulting in the lowest estimates of npp and biomass accumulation figs 3 and 5 as inter annual variations in climate conditions influenced the modelled nsc the variation among model runs with different climate data sets was substantially larger than the between year variation within a model run especially for the sand soil fig 5 the lowest nsc level of all simulations was 83 of maximum storage for middle aged forest and 88 for old forest thus none of the model simulations indicated a major effect of combined stressful conditions that would lead to a substantially lowered carbohydrate storage over a period of years 3 3 tree winter respiration the lpj guess simulations indicated that nppw ranges from 20 5 g c m 2 at the northernmost site in v√§sternorrland to 25 9 to 27 5 g c m 2 at kalmar and v√§rmland warmer winters can have a significant impact on the autotrophic respiration and the model simulations corresponding to rcp 8 5 showed that the c losses during the darkest months of winter october to february could become twice as high by end of the century as currently fig 6 table 3 the normalized winter respiration loss showed that the trees lose about 1 of their total biomass in the current climate which can increase to 1 6 by 2080 2099 table 3 the npp loss was higher for the till than the sand soil both in absolute and relative terms this is mainly attributable to differences in respiration level influenced by n status and fraction of living biomass as the autotrophic winter respiration was significantly higher for conifer stands on till than on sandy soils also reflected by the normalised winter respiration values nppwn table 3 the modelled soil temperature is a factor that influences root respiration however this effect was considered negligible as the average difference in modelled soil temperature was 0 01 c root mean squared difference of 0 09 c in relation to the tree size the absolute and relative loss displayed opposite trends with the amount of losses being higher in older forest and the relative loss being higher in young forest that is the relative loss decreases from approximately 0 4 in newly planted forest to around 0 15 in mature forest with the loss in young forest being higher at higher latitudes as it takes longer time for the trees to reach a size at which the respiration levels off as a result of a decreasing sapwood to heartwood ratio model runs with n cycling generated higher n content of sapwood and roots than model runs without n cycling with the consequence that the model simulations displayed a higher sensitivity to elevated temperatures during the darkest months as higher n content is linked to higher respiratory losses there was no difference in the current climate for the northernmost site while the difference was more than 100 for the southern site by the end of the century fig 6 implementing nsc accounting resulted in less negative npp during winter and the model runs driven by different climate data sets ranged between 13 1 to 11 6 g kg 1 table 3 3 4 frequency of low soil water content the simulated level of soil water content was highly dependent on the climate model data with the regional climate model data sets originating from a dynamic downscaling of data from canesm2 and ec earth tending to generate lower swc than data from cerfacs and ipsl for the last time period supplement 1 figs s1 s3 in this study a threshold of 0 2 was used as a proxy of drought stress to enable a comparison among model runs in terms of projected impacts the most pronounced difference among model runs was found for the month of july in v√§sternorrland with the model run driven by ec earth climate data indicating a substantially higher frequency of low swc than the other climate data sets 28 compared with 2 5 furthermore the model simulations indicated that the fraction of years with a mean monthly swc in the upper layer being less than 0 2 ranged from 2 to 11 of the years in v√§sternorrland 5 13 in v√§rmland and 11 17 in kalmar generally being high in june and july and substantially lower in august table 3 the frequency of low swc was about three times higher for sand than till in june whereas the differences were less pronounced in july about 1 4 times higher and august about 1 2 times higher fig 7 9 table 3 the simulations also indicated that younger trees were significantly less likely to experience drought conditions than older trees table 3 in kalmar the drought frequency consistently increased over time in the rcp 8 5 scenario but for v√§rmland there was no further increase after the 2040 2059 period and v√§sternorrland indicated a slight decline for the last period table 4 especially for the till soil simulations with n cycling implied fewer years with low swc with the largest difference found for june in kalmar 2040 2059 low swc in one out of fifty years compared with one out of five years fig 7 model simulations with nsc indicated 1 2 lower frequency of low swc likely related to a slightly lower npp 4 discussion climate change including changes in the frequency and severity of extreme events is likely to influence forest stand productivity and vitality in sweden eriksson et al 2015 in this study we combined regional ecosystem modelling with an analysis of local differences in soil conditions using a dynamic approach to assess potential climate change impacts which cannot be accounted for by traditional empirical forest management models differences in climate vulnerability among forest stands were assessed using a sub ensemble of bias corrected climate model data corresponding to rcp 8 5 the simulations showed that the productivity of boreal conifer forests in sweden is influenced by the fine interplay between site specific temperature conditions and precipitation the model results depicted that local differences in soil conditions have a large impact on the productivity mediated by soil water and nutrient contents which is well known from the empirical relations commonly used for estimations of production potential h√§gglund and lundmark 1977 furthermore the model analysis indicated that model setting explicitly taking nsc and n dynamics into account influences the npp estimates 4 1 model performance the growth of the boreal forests in northern europe is mainly constrained by the dark and cold winter season nemani et al 2003 furthermore fertilisation and irrigation experiments of norway spruce forest stands have indicated that water availability during growing season can be more of a limiting factor for tree growth in the south than in the north of sweden bergh et al 1999 this is in line with the findings of this study with lowest productivity at the northernmost site v√§sternorrland and similar productivity levels at the south site and the central site kalmar and v√§rmland as the benefit of a slightly longer growing season at the south site was offset by a higher frequency of drought stress the lpj guess version without n cycling has been found to generate npp estimates that are similar to other terrestrial carbon cycle models and data from face experiments piao et al 2013 however the modelled npp was generally at the lower end compared with observed forest productivity being closer to the nfi based npp estimates of the northern site than of the southern site and closer to scots pine forest than norway spruce forest fig 2 this generated an age class specific modelled biomass fig 4 that was lower than indicated by forest monitoring table 2 this is in line with a recent study in which npp estimates similar to lpj guess were obtained using biome bgc arguing that the inability to capture the latitudinal gradient in productivity of swedish forests could be due to limited parameter calibration dubber et al 2017 that is despite mechanistic properties the vegetation models are likely not capable of capturing the species specific adaptations to environmental conditions such as latitudinal gradients in light and temperature olsson and j√∂nsson 2014 carbon nitrogen interactions can have a significant influence on the simulated response to climate change and increased ambient co2 concentration piao et al 2013 and for all three sites there was an interaction between the n cycling setting and climate period model runs with n cycling enabled generated slightly lower npp for 2010 2029 and slightly higher npp for 2080 2099 compared with model runs without n cycling the effect was most pronounced for the youngest age class c f fig 3 which is related to that the trees became more light limited without n cycling due to a lower value of Œ± a and a decreasing trend over the years in incoming shortwave radiation lagergren and j√∂nsson 2017 n cycling influenced the model estimates also in terms of low soil water content and risk of drought stress model simulations without n cycling indicated a significantly higher frequency of events with low soil water content than simulations with n cycling due to a lower water use efficiency linked to the lower value of Œ± a smith et al 2014 the nsc accounting implemented in this study generated slightly lower npp values caused by a carry over effect between years this is a result of more restricted growth in years when water was a limiting factor for tree photosynthesis resulting in less carbon allocated to crown development which reflects current understanding of nsc allocation principles hartmann and trumbore 2016 furthermore the simulated risk of summer drought as indicated by a low swc differed significantly among model runs with different climate data sets supplement 1 figs s1 s3 showing the importance of using an ensemble of climate model data to identify key uncertainties associated with future projections littell et al 2011 4 2 trends related to climate change forest growth potential in sweden has been predicted to increase in response to a temperature induced lengthening of the growing season bergh et al 2003 eriksson et al 2015 koca et al 2006 this study confirmed this however it also indicated that the productivity increase will be partly offset by higher autotrophic respiration in winter and higher frequency of drought stress in summer that is the nsc storage of coniferous tree species can be reduced during late winter and early spring if the temperature dependent respiration rate is high while the light dependent photosynthesis is low or inactive kalberer et al 2006 the response to drought stress will depend on the length and intensity of the event as growth limitation caused by mild drought results in accumulation of carbohydrates while the amount of non structural carbohydrates can become reduced during a more severe drought stress mcdowell 2011 low levels of nsc can trigger tree mortality separately or in combination with drought stress galiano et al 2011 hartmann and trumbore 2016 mcdowell 2011 however no indication of cumulative environmental stress leading to severely depleted nsc storage over years was found in this study which included four sets of climate model data generating 80 simulations years for each time period of 20 years the estimated size of nscmax based on a few central europe trees sampled in 1999 2002 hoch et al 2003 is subjected to uncertainties as the nsc pool can show strong seasonal and interannual variations hartmann and trumbore 2016 however the lowest nsc level found in this study 83 of the annual maximum nsc pool is clearly above the suggested minimum level of 46 for coniferous trees adams et al 2017 martinez vilalta et al 2016 indicating that the results of this modelling study are robust in relation to the nscmax parameterization that is the trees are not likely to primarily suffer from carbon depletion but may during shorter periods of reduced nsc availability become more susceptible to attacks by secondary agents such as bark beetles rouault et al 2006 the result of this study is indicative of the study region only as northern europe is less vulnerable to sever drought stress than southern europe climate model projections indicate that this pattern will remain also in a warmer climate as there is medium confidence that climate change will lead to annual precipitation increases in northern europe it is likely that winter mean temperature will rise more in northern than southern europe and summer warming is likely to become more intense in southern than northern europe ipcc 2013 at the local scale soil conditions can modify forest exposure to climate extremes and risk of forest damage the ecosystem model simulation showed that norway spruce on sandy soils were more exposed to drought stress while norway spruce planted on till soils were more exposed to high water saturation during winter supplement 1 figs s4 s6 which in combination with a lower probability of frozen soil conditions in a warmer climate will make them vulnerable to uprooting during a storm event lagergren et al 2012 seidl et al 2011 planting norway spruce trees on sandy soil better suited for scots pine may thus add to the landscape vulnerable to bark beetle attacks by increasing the amount of forest susceptible to drought stress the model simulations indicated that middle age forests are somewhat more sensitive to stressful weather conditions than younger or older forests due to a generally higher leaf biomass and thereby higher water requirement problems associated with unsuitable tree site matching i e planting norway spruce trees on sandy soil more frequently exposed to summer drought may not become apparent until the forest stand is middle aged rouault et al 2006 climate change may worsen the outcome via an altered frequency and intensity of heatwaves and drought spells sou 2007 which can influence the risk of successful spruce bark beetle attacks both via altered tree defence capacity christiansen et al 1987 and altered insect phenology caused by a temperature dependent shift from predominantly one to two generations per year in sweden j√∂nsson et al 2011 j√∂nsson et al 2012 5 conclusions model derived knowledge on forest vulnerability to abiotic stress factors is needed to assess potential future risks and identify suitable adaptation strategies at the landscape level in this study we applied an ecosystem model to address questions related to climate change and forest stand development on two soil texture classes being managed as norway spruce monocultures model runs with four different climate data sets and three sites indicated that the productivity increase induced by a warmer climate leading to a longer growing season in sweden will be partly offset by a higher frequency of drought stress in summer and warm winters with elevated autotrophic respiration the results indicated that non structural carbohydrate depletion caused by cumulative environmental stress is less likely to become a primary cause of tree mortality in sweden but periods with low nsc levels may link to temporary reductions in tree defence capacity acknowledgements this study was financially supported by formas through the

25243,the main result of this article is the crossing effect between two fragments with no isolation on its sides the crossing effect term is given to the phenomenon of relative inversion between the minimum sizes of two patches only varying the growth rate equally in both this phenomenon was found from the determination of the minimal size prediction for the general case of problems with two identical patches this prediction is presented in the explicit form which allows to recuperate all the cases found in the literature as particular cases namely one isolated fragment one single fragment communicating with its neighborhood a system with two identical fragments isolated from the matrix but mutually communicating and a system of two identical fragments inserted in a homogeneous matrix to find the crossing effect a particular case of the general solution is approached which is a single fragment communicating with the matrix with different life difficulties on each side to verify this statement it is proposed an experiment which is an adaptation of other experiments in the literature the confirmation of the phenomenon presented in this work would be new and unexpected on the other hand the refutation of this phenomenon would bring worries to the minimum size models using fkpp equation keywords crossing effect fkpp equation fragmented system population dynamics general minimal size of two identical patches 1 introduction populations living in one nelson and shnerb 1998 or more lopez and bonasora 2017 fragments have been the subject of study in many natural sciences in particular ecology ferraz et al 2007 in fact natural scientists such as physicists artiles et al 2008 kumar and kenkre 2011 mathematicians cantrell et al 1991 hening et al 2017 and others skellam 1951 have been studied models that can describe with some degree of approximation the real phenomenon the study of fragmented regions problem was started by skellam 1951 which proposed a solitary fragment that can harbor life within the patch while outside it life is impossible this problem was improved by ludwig et al 1979 they introduced a non hard region outside the patch in the skellam problem then in the ludwig problem the population in study can go outside the island but cannot live there forever the improvement of ludwig et al brought the need of a smaller fragment than the one found by skellam to enable stable life in the system with only one fragment the natural sequence to ludwig work is the introduction of another fragment in the system now there are two fragments communicating by a region not favorable to life but not infinitely hard in such a way that is possible population elements pass from one fragment to another in this sense there are previous studies for the implicit form to minimal size fragments that enables life for a more general case pamplona da silva and kraenkel 2012 the explicit form for this minimal size was presented by kenkre and kumar 2008 to the case where the life difficulty was the same outside the system and between the patches in this article is proposed one general analytic prediction to minimal size of each fragment in a system of two identical patches this result enables to confirm a previous result pamplona da silva and kraenkel 2012 here called crossing effect the crossing effect term is related to the intersection of two curves in the graphic of fragment size versus growth rate the crossing of the curves may seem only a mathematical curiosity but it is more than it in order to better explain the crossing effect phenomenon associated to this crossing of the two curves it is used two fictitious fragments w and z with very specific and different characteristics for the same species and the same growth rate a 0 for small a 0 w can provide the stable life inside it with a smaller size than z this fact is due to other parameters of the fragments as it is well established in the literature kenkre and kumar 2008 pamplona da silva and kraenkel 2012 and is even intuitive knowing that w for small a 0 should be smaller than z the novelty here presented is that if the growth rate is increased maintaining the other characteristics of the fragments w should be greater than z to provide life within themselves briefly the increase of the growth rate within the fragments produces a relative inversion in the minimum sizes of the fragments the predictions proposed above were found in one dimension where the focus was the minimum length for life existence in two dimensions the study would concern the minimal area azevedo and kraenkel 2012 and it would be necessary to explore the geometry of the fragment kenkre and kumar 2008 which would result in another scope of work not addressed in this paper all cases mentioned previously use fisher 1937 fisher kolmogorov petrovskii piskunov fkpp equation to describe the behavior of a population density u x t in the time t moving in the space x governed by the growth rate a and contained by the saturation rate b in one dimensional it is given by 1 u t d 2 u x 2 a x u bu 2 where d is the diffusion coefficient the parameter a is the growth rate and can be used to describe the environmental conditions of a region the parameter b represents a population intraspecific competition which defines the maximum population that can occupy a specific fragment parameter b is closely linked to the carrying capacity 2 mathematical predictions the mathematical purpose of this article is starting from eq 1 to find the general case to minimal size of each patch in a system of two identical patches see fig 1 a and recover several cases addressed in the literature in addition it is found the minimal size to single non symmetric patch able to sustaining life eq 1 does not have general solution for an arbitrary function a x at any time t but there are two considerations that can help to reach the goal without finding the general solution the first one considers the stationary situation of eq 1 because this represents the situation after the transient solution when there is a stable solution population or the solution is null extinct population the second consideration is to suppress the nonlinear term u 2 one justification for this consideration is that if population extinction occurs without considering the saturation the population will die more quickly when this factor is considered in addition intraspecific competition is important when the population is large however it is insignificant when the population is small thus once when the patch size is close to its minimum size a small stable population is expected and the saturation term may be disregarded these two considerations are in accordance with the ludwig ideas ludwig et al 1979 reinforced by kenkre and kumar 2008 and previous works pamplona da silva and kraenkel 2012 pamplona da silva et al 2017 resulting an ordinary differential equation that can be written as follow 2 d d 2 œÜ d x 2 a x œÜ 0 by choosing the function a x as a piecewise constant eq 2 can be solved easily in any constant piece it describes a heterogeneous region kenkre and kumar 2008 kenkre and kuperman 2003 kraenkel and pamplona da silva 2010 pamplona da silva and kraenkel 2012 where a x 0 represents a patch life region and a x 0 represents a dead region note that there are space heterogeneities but the condition inside each patch is homogeneous and the outside conditions are also homogeneous then there are only abrupt changes in the environment condition and they occur in the frontiers between a patch and a death region the generalization of two communicating identical patches is represented by fig 1a in order to reach the main mathematical objective of this work which is to find the explicit form of the minimum size to each fragment represented in fig 1a that allows the existence of stable life inside the patch it is solved the linear equation eq 2 in each region where a x is constant and it is imposed that the function and its first derivative are continuous at the boundaries between fragments and inhospitable regions following the ideas of ludwig et al and their successors kenkre and kumar 2008 ludwig et al 1979 pamplona da silva et al 2017 these conditions are applied only for the positive values of x x s and x l s because from symmetry the negative side returns the same conditions in order to simplify the notation it is introduced 3 Œ± a a d a solutions to eq 2 are 4 œÜ i x a cosh Œ± p x in region i s x s 5 œÜ ii x b cos Œ± a 0 x œï in region ii s x l s 6 œÜ iii x ce Œ± h x in region iii x l s next it is imposed the matching condition upon œÜ x at each boundary in fact at x s the condition is given by œÜ ii s œÜ i s then 7 b cos Œ± a 0 s œï a cosh Œ± p s at x l s the condition œÜ ii l s œÜ iii l s gives 8 b cos Œ± a 0 l Œ± a 0 s œï ce Œ± h l s not only the function œÜ x should be continuous but also its derivative hence in x s immediately 9 b Œ± a 0 sin Œ± a 0 s œï a Œ± p sinh Œ± p s in x l s 10 b Œ± a 0 sin Œ± a 0 l Œ± a 0 s œï c Œ± h e Œ± h l s dividing eq 9 by eq 7 it follows Œ± a 0 tan Œ± a 0 s œï Œ± p tanh Œ± p s 11 Œ± a 0 s œï arctan Œ± p Œ± a 0 tanh Œ± p s dividing eq 10 by eq 8 it results Œ± a 0 tan Œ± a 0 l Œ± a 0 s œï Œ± h 12 Œ± a 0 l Œ± a 0 s œï arctan Œ± h Œ± a 0 eqs 11 and 12 can be added the convenient form of the result from this operation is 13 l 1 Œ± a 0 arctan Œ± h Œ± a 0 arctan Œ± p Œ± a 0 tanh Œ± p s which can be rewritten in terms of the initial variables as 14 l d a 0 arctan h a 0 arctan p a 0 tanh s p d the expression 14 is one of the main results in this work it is a generalization of all the problems of systems with one patch or two identical patches it is possible to recover all the particular cases of literature from this equation if h and p go to infinity skellam 1951 result is recovered if a finite value is chosen to h p and s ludwid et al formula ludwig et al 1979 is recovered choosing p and s as any finite values and h pamplona da silva et al 2017 prediction is obtained choosing finite values to s and h p kenkre and kumar 2008 result is recovered see the resume in table 1 after re obtaining several known cases on the literature with the general result let us turn to the new problem a single patch with different boundary conditions on each end i e a problem without a symmetric form such as the one presented in fig 1b for this case the minimal size can be obtained directly from eq 14 by taking the limit s namely 15 l sph d a 0 arctan h a 0 arctan p a 0 with eq 15 it is possible to obtain the minimal size for a semi isolated fragment taking the limit h this result is 16 l spi d a 0 œÄ 2 arctan p a 0 eq 16 is in accordance with the previous prediction in pamplona da silva et al 2017 as well as with ludwig et al formula table 1 3 phenomenological considerations many papers are found in the literature on population dynamics modeled by a reaction diffusion equation showing agreement between the theoretical model and experimental results an example is the lin et al 2004 experiment which is composed of a matrix illuminated by ultraviolet light except in a region under a mask that blocks the light this region under the mask can be interpreted as a patch since the bacteria escherichia coli dies when it is illuminated by ultraviolet light in their work lin et al exploit the mask s move another example is the experiment by perry 2005 following the ideas of kenkre and kuperman 2003 the perry experiment confirms the existence of a minimum size for the formation of a stable colony of bacteria in a petri dish perry s experiment uses a modified version of lin s experimental setup with a static patch other experiments can be performed to determine other predictions of minimum sizes such as that of kenkre and kumar 2008 and pamplona da silva et al 2017 this paper presents a new phenomenon linked to minimum fragment sizes namely the crossing effect phenomenon which was previously described in section 1 this phenomenon depends on the existence of minimum sizes for the formation of stable life as proven by perry 2005 knowing that critical domain size exists it is proposed to study how is the behavior of this minimum size in this sense the crossing effect shows something unexpected namely an improvement in the internal conditions of the patches changes its relative quality for the population life inside it as can be seen in fig 1b that was constructed with the expressions of l si e l sh taken from table 1 l sph taken from eq 15 and l spi taken from eq 16 fig 2 shows the crossing of l sh curve with l spi and l sph curves the crossing of l spi with l sh confirms the result of pamplona da silva et al 2017 the semi isolation leads to a high dependence of the minimum fragment size on its internal conditions this result was found by pamplona et al for a system of two patches with a relief in the region between them the novelty presented here is the elimination of the parameter s the length of separation between patches now there is no doubt that this effect does not need the separation between the patches actually it does not need the existence of two neighbors patches for the crossing effect to appear it is necessary a relief on some end but the other boundary does not need to be isolated the crossing of l sh and l sph in fig 2 shows this clearly in other words for this effect to happen it is required that the fragment l sph has one side with a relief p 1 small life difficulty and the other side with a strong life difficulty h 100 while the other fragment has to have the both sides with middle life difficulty h 15 in the last case both sides do not need to have the same life difficulty condition for example crossing effect exists between two l sph curves one with h 100 and p 1 and the other one with h 20 and p 10 the curve l sph with h 20 and p 10 was not plotted in fig 2 because it would be very close to the l sh curve with h 15 the case of only one isolated fragment is yet the worst to life existence once it needs the largest fragment size in all cases this is because it is not possible to insert a relief in any part without the loss of the system properties in the case of an isolated system with two patches the relief is the region between them 4 a new experiment proposal with the view to verify or refute the results of this work it would be required a validation from literature data or construct an experiment that generates such data at the impossibility to find suitable data in the literature for the application of this model the following experiment is proposed a simple experiment to verify the crossing effect would be a single fragment similar to the realized by perry 2005 and the one proposed by kenkre and kumar 2008 but with only one fragment as illustrated in fig 3 the experiment consists for a given configuration to determine the minimum size l of a fragment mask so that bacteria in a petri dish form a stable colony to find this minimum size start from a fragment that forms a stable colony and repeat the experiment for smaller and smaller fragments until the bacteria inserted in the petri dish is completely extinguished the methodology to determine this minimum size can be modified by the experimenter who can also conveniently choose any bacteria sensitive to ultraviolet light in order to verify the crossing effect repeat the experiment of the previous paragraph for two different configurations of the fragments in the configutarion 1 the fragment is illuminated in the left side with a low intensity light la and in the right side by a high intensity light lb in this configuration is obtained the minimum size l 1 the same procedure is repeated but with a configuration 2 in which both lights la and lb are set to the same median intensity in configuration 2 a new minimum size l 2 is obtained the intensity of the lights la and lb in both configurations can be adjusted by the experimenter in suitable units as a reference it is suggested the follow relation strong light 10 medium light 100 low light for its intensities the greater the ratio between the intensities of strong light and weak light the easier to find the crossing effect the intensity of middle light must be between strong light and weak light intensities which may initially be the geometric mean of them and adjusted as convenience assuming that there is a direct relation between growth rate and food availability the food availability at the petri dish will be used to represent the growth rate thus for a low food availability small a 0 l 1 l 2 is expected for a high supply of food in the petri dish large a 0 the new minimum sizes l 1 and l 2 are expected to be smaller than their respective values found in the configuration 1 i e l 1 l 1 and l 2 l 2 but obey the opposite condition of each other l 1 l 2 if this behavior is verified the crossing effect will be validated experimentally otherwise it will be refuted there are no reference values for the availability of food but reference relations of it can be obtained in fig 2 5 conclusion this paper confirms the break down pamplona da silva et al 2017 of the paradigm kenkre and kumar 2008 ludwig et al 1979 pamplona da silva and kraenkel 2012 that isolated systems are always worst to life than non isolated systems it also introduces a new conception for the analysis of minimal size of fragments namely a fragment can be bigger or smaller than other one for a specific set of external conditions of fragments depending only on the internal condition of the fragments that is the same for both in other words take a patch 1 or system of patches with a set 1 of parameters to external conditions and internal condition a 0 that needs size l 1 to enable stable life inside it take a patch 2 or system of patches with a set 2 of different parameters and the same internal condition of patch 1 a 0 that needs size l 2 to enable stable life inside it choosing conveniently the sets of parameters set 1 and set 2 it is obtained l 1 bigger than l 2 for small values of a 0 and l 1 smaller than l 2 for high values of a 0 the crossing effect was found in a previous paper pamplona da silva et al 2017 for isolated system of two fragments with a relief in life difficulty the region between the patches here this result is expanded for fragments semi isolated or totally non isolated of the external region leading to the conclusion that this phenomenon is not an effect of isolation although the effect is linked to the disparity of the external conditions this extension is possible due to eq 14 the central analytic result of this paper which generalizes a system of two identical fragments and presents the minimal size for one non symmetric fragment as a particular case eq 15 the existence of the crossing effect in systems of finite external conditions introduces a bigger applicability and facility of verification in the phenomenon once it is easier to find or construct real systems with finite and quantifiable conditions as proposed in section 4 the high dependence of the minimum fragment size on its internal condition brings up concern on this condition in the context of extinction stable life in a patch or other effects linked to criticality context the realization of the experiment proposed in section 4 can validate the crossing effect which would be a totally unexpected phenomenon from the phenomenological point of view for the population dynamics on the other hand if the experiment refutes the crossing effect it brings the reflection about other faults that can exist in the predictions of minimum sizes for population fragments from models with fkpp in the literature acknowledgments the author is grateful to pet programa de educa√ß√£o tutorial for financial support rodrigo rocha cuzinatto for text revision and

crossing of l sh and l sph in fig 2 shows this clearly in other words for this effect to happen it is required that the fragment l sph has one side with a relief p 1 small life difficulty and the other side with a strong life difficulty h 100 while the other fragment has to have the both sides with middle life difficulty h 15 in the last case both sides do not need to have the same life difficulty condition for example crossing effect exists between two l sph curves one with h 100 and p 1 and the other one with h 20 and p 10 the curve l sph with h 20 and p 10 was not plotted in fig 2 because it would be very close to the l sh curve with h 15 the case of only one isolated fragment is yet the worst to life existence once it needs the largest fragment size in all cases this is because it is not possible to insert a relief in any part without the loss of the system properties in the case of an isolated system with two patches the relief is the region between them 4 a new experiment proposal with the view to verify or refute the results of this work it would be required a validation from literature data or construct an experiment that generates such data at the impossibility to find suitable data in the literature for the application of this model the following experiment is proposed a simple experiment to verify the crossing effect would be a single fragment similar to the realized by perry 2005 and the one proposed by kenkre and kumar 2008 but with only one fragment as illustrated in fig 3 the experiment consists for a given configuration to determine the minimum size l of a fragment mask so that bacteria in a petri dish form a stable colony to find this minimum size start from a fragment that forms a stable colony and repeat the experiment for smaller and smaller fragments until the bacteria inserted in the petri dish is completely extinguished the methodology to determine this minimum size can be modified by the experimenter who can also conveniently choose any bacteria sensitive to ultraviolet light in order to verify the crossing effect repeat the experiment of the previous paragraph for two different configurations of the fragments in the configutarion 1 the fragment is illuminated in the left side with a low intensity light la and in the right side by a high intensity light lb in this configuration is obtained the minimum size l 1 the same procedure is repeated but with a configuration 2 in which both lights la and lb are set to the same median intensity in configuration 2 a new minimum size l 2 is obtained the intensity of the lights la and lb in both configurations can be adjusted by the experimenter in suitable units as a reference it is suggested the follow relation strong light 10 medium light 100 low light for its intensities the greater the ratio between the intensities of strong light and weak light the easier to find the crossing effect the intensity of middle light must be between strong light and weak light intensities which may initially be the geometric mean of them and adjusted as convenience assuming that there is a direct relation between growth rate and food availability the food availability at the petri dish will be used to represent the growth rate thus for a low food availability small a 0 l 1 l 2 is expected for a high supply of food in the petri dish large a 0 the new minimum sizes l 1 and l 2 are expected to be smaller than their respective values found in the configuration 1 i e l 1 l 1 and l 2 l 2 but obey the opposite condition of each other l 1 l 2 if this behavior is verified the crossing effect will be validated experimentally otherwise it will be refuted there are no reference values for the availability of food but reference relations of it can be obtained in fig 2 5 conclusion this paper confirms the break down pamplona da silva et al 2017 of the paradigm kenkre and kumar 2008 ludwig et al 1979 pamplona da silva and kraenkel 2012 that isolated systems are always worst to life than non isolated systems it also introduces a new conception for the analysis of minimal size of fragments namely a fragment can be bigger or smaller than other one for a specific set of external conditions of fragments depending only on the internal condition of the fragments that is the same for both in other words take a patch 1 or system of patches with a set 1 of parameters to external conditions and internal condition a 0 that needs size l 1 to enable stable life inside it take a patch 2 or system of patches with a set 2 of different parameters and the same internal condition of patch 1 a 0 that needs size l 2 to enable stable life inside it choosing conveniently the sets of parameters set 1 and set 2 it is obtained l 1 bigger than l 2 for small values of a 0 and l 1 smaller than l 2 for high values of a 0 the crossing effect was found in a previous paper pamplona da silva et al 2017 for isolated system of two fragments with a relief in life difficulty the region between the patches here this result is expanded for fragments semi isolated or totally non isolated of the external region leading to the conclusion that this phenomenon is not an effect of isolation although the effect is linked to the disparity of the external conditions this extension is possible due to eq 14 the central analytic result of this paper which generalizes a system of two identical fragments and presents the minimal size for one non symmetric fragment as a particular case eq 15 the existence of the crossing effect in systems of finite external conditions introduces a bigger applicability and facility of verification in the phenomenon once it is easier to find or construct real systems with finite and quantifiable conditions as proposed in section 4 the high dependence of the minimum fragment size on its internal condition brings up concern on this condition in the context of extinction stable life in a patch or other effects linked to criticality context the realization of the experiment proposed in section 4 can validate the crossing effect which would be a totally unexpected phenomenon from the phenomenological point of view for the population dynamics on the other hand if the experiment refutes the crossing effect it brings the reflection about other faults that can exist in the predictions of minimum sizes for population fragments from models with fkpp in the literature acknowledgments the author is grateful to pet programa de educa√ß√£o tutorial for financial support rodrigo rocha cuzinatto for text revision and

25244,recent interest in crassulacean acid metabolism cam photosynthesis has resulted in new physiologically based cam models these models show promise yet typically are not developed with a basis that is compatible with widely used models of c3 and c4 photosynthesis indeed most efforts to assess the potential of cam still rely on empirically based environmental productivity indices which makes uniform comparisons between cam and non cam species difficult in order to represent c3 c4 and cam photosynthesis in a consistent physiologically based manner we introduce the photo3 model photo3 unites a common photosynthetic and hydraulic core with components depicting the circadian rhythm of cam photosynthesis and the carbon concentrating mechanism of c4 photosynthesis this work allows consistent comparisons of the three photosynthetic types for the first time it also allows the representation of intermediate c3 cam behavior through the adjustment of a single model parameter model simulations of opuntia ficus indica cam sorghum bicolor c4 and triticum aestivum c3 capture the diurnal behavior of each species as well as the cumulative effects of long term water limitation these results show the model s potential for evaluating the tradeoffs between c3 c4 and cam photosynthesis and for better understanding cam productivity ecology and climate feedbacks keywords c3 photosynthesis c4 photosynthesis crassulacean acid metabolism cam plant water storage soil plant atmosphere continuum 1 introduction crassulacean acid metabolism cam and c4 photosynthesis are thought to have evolved as add ons to the classical c3 photosynthetic pathway around 20 30 million years ago keeley and rundel 2003 both photosynthetic processes achieve increased water use efficiency by concentrating co2 at the site of the dark reactions of photosynthesis today c4 and cam plants fill important ecological niches in grasslands rainforests and arid ecosystems c4 plants dominate in grasslands where they account for almost 25 of terrestrial primary production still et al 2003 whereas cam plants make up almost 50 of plant biomass in certain arid and semi arid regions of the world syvertsen et al 1976 c4 crops such as corn zea mays sugarcane saccharum officinarum and sorghum sorghum bicolor comprise 22 of the eighteen most common crops leff et al 2004 cam crops such as prickly pear opuntia ficus indica agave agave tequilana and pineapple ananas comosus are also economically significant particularly in arid and semi arid regions of the world due to their extremely high water use efficiency and heat tolerance the potential of cam plants for food fodder and biofuel production will only become more significant as climate uncertainty and tensions over food scarcity increase nobel 1991 garc√≠a de cort√°zar 1992 borland et al 2009 owen and griffiths 2014 mason et al 2015 despite the prevalence and importance of cam plants physiological modeling of cam photosynthesis is well behind that of c3 and c4 photosynthesis farquhar et al 1980 von caemmerer and furbank 1999 indeed physiological models of cam have only recently been introduced see e g owen and griffiths 2013 bartlett et al 2014 and have not been widely adopted instead nobel s environmental productivity index epi introduced in 1984 is the standard method of predicting net carbon uptake and yield for cam plants nobel 1988 nair et al 2012 this index based on multiplicative indices for water temperature and photosynthetically active radiation par is entirely empirical and does not include a physiological representation of the cam process furthermore the index is designed to be calculated at a timescale of one month nobel 1988 owen and griffiths 2014 thus failing to take into account environmental variability at daily and weekly timescales which has been shown to be an important factor in cam functioning bartlett et al 2014 hartzell et al 2015 this hampers the assessment of the potential impacts of cam plants on climate agriculture and bioenergy production most climate modeling efforts include land surface models with a physiologically based representation of c3 rogers et al 2017 and often c4 photosynthesis cox 2001 cowling et al 2007 milly et al 2014 but none currently include cam photosynthesis an important component of dryland and tropical ecosystems the recent push for physiologically based crop modeling has also failed to take cam crops into account multiple existing crop models including 2dleaf and mcwla are based on physiological models of c3 photosynthesis and stomatal conductance pachepsky and acock 1996 tao et al 2009 and the gecros model supports both c3 and c4 photosynthesis based on modifications to the farqhuar model yin 2005 despite these advances no crop models currently exist that are capable of coherently representing the three photosynthetic types this discrepancy propagates into the analysis of bioenergy potential while detailed biophysical models of c3 and c4 crops enable analyses of their potential for bioenergy production miguez et al 2012 nair et al 2012 lack of detailed cam modeling poses a problem in better understanding its potential in this area yan et al 2011 nair et al 2012 owen and griffiths 2014 davis et al 2015 the photo3 model addresses this need by providing a consistent physiologically based description of cam c3 and c4 photosynthesis coupled to environmental conditions the model seeks to balance the complexity required to faithfully represent each process with simplicity and clarity to achieve this the model leverages the commonalities between the three photosynthetic types the core of the model is based on the rubisco mediated carbon assimilation achieved by the light reactions and calvin cycle of c3 photosynthesis when representing cam and c4 plants this core is combined with a model for carbon fixation via phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase pepc the method for representing cam plants is based on bartlett et al 2014 and adds a component for malic acid storage and release which is governed by an endogenous circadian rhythm when representing c4 plants a carbon concentrating mechanism based on collatz et al collatz et al 1992 von caemmerer and furbank 1999 vico and porporato 2008 is added to the model core the resulting integrated model allows plants of all three photosynthetic types to be simulated on a consistent basis and in a wide variety of soil and atmospheric conditions in this work the model is parameterized for one representative species from each photosynthetic type o ficus indica cam triticum aestivum c3 and s bicolor c4 stomatal conductance carbon assimilation and water use of the three species are compared at the daily and monthly scale finally intermediate c3 cam behavior is explored through the adjustment of cam model parameters the photo3 model accurately captures a wide range of photosynthetic behaviors and shows promise for applications in ecological climate and crop modeling written in python the model is open source and publicly available on github it employs a modular structure which allows it to be easily integrated with other routines for use in a variety of applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the photo3 model the core of the photo3 model given in section 2 2 includes the farquhar et al 1980 model for photosynthetic carbon demand an optimal control model for stomatal conductance and a model of the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac in the case of c4 and cam photosynthesis this core is coupled with a model for carbon fixation via pepc which is either spatially c4 or temporally cam separated from the rubisco mediated calvin cycle the spac model is a simple resistor capacitor type model of the soil plant atmosphere continuum e g jones 1992 and has an option to include plant water storage which is an important feature in many succulent cam species nobel 1988 given solar radiation specific humidity and temperature the model estimates carbon assimilation and transpiration as well as other variables of interest see fig 1 the cam model formulated in section 2 3 includes all of the features of the core model and adds a representation of the carbon concentrating mechanism based on bartlett et al 2014 the diurnal rhythm of malic acid production and release is modeled through the addition of a cell vacuole characterized by m the malic acid content and z the circadian order variable which represents the overall effect of gene expression enzyme activity and or the vacuole tonoplast in controlling the circadian rhythm depending on the values of m and z co2 may either be fixed as malic acid by pepc and later decarboxylated and released to the calvin cycle or it may be directly passed to the calvin cycle and fixed via rubisco to account for the cam idling process dark respiration stays internal to the cell and is either passed to the cell vacuole or to the calvin cycle depending on the light level these differences described in fig 2 allow the model to capture the unique diurnal rhythm of cam carbon fluxes bartlett et al 2014 hartzell et al 2015 like the cam model the c4 model presented in section 2 4 also builds on the core farquhar model after the initial fixation of co2 into c4 acids via pepc which occurs in the mesophyll cell the c4 acids are decarboxylated and the co2 is passed to the bundle sheath cell where it is concentrated within the bundle sheath cells the rubsico mediated calvin cycle fixes carbon into sugar this process is represented using the farquhar et al 1980 model with the new elevated co2 concentration c bs a graphical description of these carbon fluxes is given in fig 2 2 2 general photosynthetic relations the net carbon uptake is modelled as a steady state fickian diffusion through the stomata i e 1 a n g s co 2 c s c m where g s co 2 is the stomatal conductance to co2 c s is the concentration of co2 at the leaf surface and c m is the concentration of co2 inside the mesophyll cytosol the stomatal conductance is assumed to scale with the square root of the vapor pressure deficit following stomatal optimization theory an approach which agrees well with accepted empirical models oren et al 1999 hari et al 2000 katul et al 2009 medlyn et al 2011 and can be represented as 2 g s co 2 a 1 a n c s d where a 1 is an empirical constant which is adjusted to account for observed differences in the c m c a ratio among photosynthetic types as described in jones 1992 and d is the vapor pressure deficit the net photosynthetic demand for co2 a d is modelled according to farquhar et al 1980 with an adjustment to account for plant water stress i e 3 a d a œï c x t l œï c x t l f œà l œà l due to the lack of temporal separation of co2 uptake and assimilation in c3 and c4 photosynthesis the net carbon uptake a n is equal to the net photosynthetic demand a d for these photosynthetic types the relationship between a n and a d for cam includes a temporal separation and is described in section 2 3 the carbon demand a œï c x t l œï c x t l is given by 4 a œï c x t l œï c x t l min a c c x t l a q œï c x t l where a c c x t l is the rubisco limited photosynthetic rate a q œï c x t l is the light limited photosynthetic rate t l is the leaf temperature c x is the co2 concentration at the site of the calvin cycle and œï is the incoming solar radiation see appendix a for details the relevant co2 concentration c x varies based on the photosynthetic type for c3 plants c x is the mesophyll concentration c m for c4 plants it is the bundle sheath concentration c bs and for cam plants it is either c m or the corrected mesophyll co2 concentration c c when malic acid is being decarboxylated the mesophyll co2 concentration is corrected to account for the elevated co2 concentration as c c c m c a d c o f c z m following bartlett et al 2014 the effects of water stress reduce the photosynthetic demand according to a vulnerability function of the leaf water potential f œà l œà l here represented for simplicity as a piecewise linear function which decreases between the point of onset of water stress œà la1 and the point of stomatal closure œà la0 i e 5 f œà l œà l 0 œà l œà la 0 œà l œà la 0 œà la 1 œà la 0 œà la 0 œà l œà la 1 1 œà l œà la 1 where the leaf water potentials œà la1 and œà la0 are species dependent see table 1 this piecewise function also used in daly et al 2004 provides results similar to other response functions commonly used in describing plant response to water stress such as sigmoidal curves sperry et al 2002 vico and porporato 2008 but has the advantage of providing increased numerical stability in the algorithm presented here which involves solving relatively complex equations for the leaf water potential since the dark respiration r d is typically a small fraction of the carbon assimilation its inclusion is optional except in the case of cam where it is an important component of cam idling behavior during periods of extended stomatal closure here it is represented as a temperature dependent process according to a modified arrhenius equation see appendix a 2 3 cam specific relations in the cam model a carbon pool is added to represent malic acid uptake and release from the cell vacuole see fig 2 the net flux of carbon through the stomata a n is comprised of a flux from the stomata to the calvin cycle a sc and one to the cell vacuole a sv i e 6 a n a sc œï c m t l œà l z m a sv t l œà l z m where z and m are the circadian rhythm order variable and the malic acid concentration respectively described below and the fluxes a sc and a sv are related to the carbon demand a d through the circadian state as described in appendix c the dark respiration flux r d is likewise divided into a flux to the vacuole r dv and one to the calvin cycle r dc carbon is stored in the cell vacuole as malic acid and is released from the vacuole as the flux a vc the diurnal cycle of uptake and release from the vacuole which governs the fluxes to and from the vacuole is represented by a pair of balance equations for m the malic acid concentration and z the circadian rhythm order the balance equation for the malic acid concentration is given by 7 l m dm dt a sv t l œà l z m r dv œï t l a vc œï c c t l z m where l m is the ratio of malic acid storage volume to the carbon flux surface area while the circadian rhythm order is given by 8 t r dz dt m m e z t l m max where t r is the relaxation time m e is the equilibrium concentration of malic acid and m max is the maximum malic acid concentration the malic acid equilibrium concentration is given by 9 m e z t l m max t h t l t h t l 1 c 1 Œ≤ z Œº 3 t h t l t h t l Œ≤ z Œº c 2 1 f 0 z œï 0 m max t h t l t h t l 1 c 1 Œ≤ z Œº 3 t h t l t h t l Œ≤ z Œº c 2 œï 0 where t h and t l are the high and low temperature values for the circadian oscillation and c 1 c 2 Œº and Œ≤ are circadian oscillator constants included in table 2 this formulation follows bartlett et al 2014 with the addition of the term 1 f 0 z which synchronizes the circadian rhythm with the prevailing light cycle this new term increases m e at high z values during the night ensuring that the uptake of malic acid continues at night even if the previous day s cycle has not completely depleted the store of malic acid the formulations of the model fluxes are given in appendix c these adjustments to the functions given in bartlett et al 2014 improve model robustness to highly variable environmental inputs 2 4 c4 specific relations in the c4 plant the influx of co2 to the bundle sheath cell is driven by the c4 pump and is modeled by a michaelis menten type dependence on the mesophyll cytosol co2 concentration c m as in von caemmerer von caemmerer 2000 vico and porporato 2008 see fig 2 the pep regeneration rate v p is bounded by the upper limit v pr i e 10 v p c m min c m v p max c m k p v pr where v p max is the maximum pep carboxylation rate and k p is the michaelis menten coefficient leakage of co2 from the bundle sheath cell is modelled as a diffusion flux from the bundle sheath to the mesophyll cell i e 11 l bs c bs c m g bs c bs c m where g bs is the conductance between the bundle sheath and mesophyll cells and c bs is the co2 concentration in the bundle sheath cells finally we introduce a balance equation for the co2 fluxes into and out of the bundle sheath cell i e 12 v p c m a d œï c bs t l œà l l bs c bs c m and solve for the co2 concentration in the bundle sheath cell c bs by combining eq 12 with eqs 10 and 11 the carbon assimilation is then calculated according to eq 3 parameters for the c4 model are included in table 3 2 5 plant hydraulics and capacitance the transpiration flux e is driven by the difference between the specific humidity internal to the leaf and that of the atmosphere i e 13 e g sa œÅ œÅ w q i t l œà l q a where g sa is the series of the atmospheric conductance and the combined stomatal cuticular conductance see appendix b œÅ is the density of air œÅ w is the density of water q i is the specific humidity internal to the leaf and q a is the specific humidity of the atmosphere at the same time the transpiration flux must be equal to the flux of water through the plant i e 14 e g srp œà s œà l where g srp is the series of the soil root and plant conductances see appendix b œà s is the soil water potential and œà l is the leaf water potential these relations are joined by the equation for energy balance which equates the incoming heat flux to the outgoing sensible and latent heat fluxes i e 15 œï g a œÅ c p t l t a Œª w œÅ w e where œï is the incoming solar radiation g a is the atmospheric conductance c p is the specific heat of air t a is the atmospheric temperature and Œª w is the latent heat of vaporization eqs 13 15 are solved simultaneously for the three unknowns the transpiration e the leaf temperature t l and the leaf water potential œà l plant water storage is included as an option in the model while it is generally negligible for most c3 and c4 crops plant water storage significantly affects water stress and carbon assimilation for plants with a substantial water storage capacity including most cam plants therefore we include plant water storage when modeling cam plants in this study but not when modeling c3 and c4 plants plant water storage is represented in this model as a simple capacitor located at a height which is a fraction f of the total plant height as in hartzell et al 2017 see fig 3 and appendix b using this scheme the change in the plant relative water content w is given by the balance equation 16 lai z w dw dt q s s w e where z w is the total available water storage depth of the plant on a leaf area basis lai is the leaf area index and s is the soil moisture the transpiration flux e is now given by the sum of the fluxes from the soil q s and the plant water storage q w such that 17 e q s q w g srpf œà s œà x g w lai œà w œà x where œà x is the water potential at the storage connection node g srfp is the conductance between the soil and storage connection node g w is the conductance between the site of water storage and the storage connection node and œà w is the water potential of the water storage tissue see appendix b and table 4 for details the addition of plant water storage adds a fourth unknown œà x to the water balance which may now be formulated as described in appendix b the soil moisture may either be provided as a model input or determined through the balance equation 18 nz r ds dt q s s w l s e v s r t where n is the soil porosity z r is the rooting depth and s is the volumetric soil moisture averaged over the rooting depth total losses from the soil are due to plant water uptake q s s w leakage loss l s and evaporation e v s see rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 for details in eq 18 the rainfall r t may be specified either as a model input or may be generated within the model as a stochastic process which requires the mean rainfall depth and frequency as input parameters currently a range of soil types are represented by the four soil options included in the model loamy sand sandy loam loam and clay soil parameters are included in table 5 2 6 model implementation environmental inputs for the model are solar radiation air temperature specific humidity soil moisture and soil type because of the strong dependence of cam photosynthesis on variability in environmental conditions at the sub daily scale the model operates with a 30 minute timestep solar radiation specific humidity and air temperature data with an hourly timescale may be interpolated to give values at each model timestep alternatively values for these variables may be generated internally to the model using a built in boundary layer simulation following the approach presented in daly et al 2004 values for soil moisture may be provided at each model timestep may be generated by the model from user provided rainfall data or may be generated internally by the model given certain assumptions i e constant soil moisture drydown conditions or stochastic rainfall generation the model is currently parameterized with hydraulic and photosynthetic properties for three representative species t aestivum c3 s bicolor c4 and o ficus indica cam see tables 1 4 these species were selected because they are among the most well studied and economically important species of each photosynthetic group leff et al 2004 paterson et al 2008 these properties are meant to represent plants at the mature stage in the growing season and are assumed to be approximately constant over the model duration 2 7 model validation and testing 2 7 1 model validation the model was validated using data collected under both well watered and droughted conditions for the three representative crops see section 3 1 model results under well watered conditions for o ficus indica were compared to results from a 24 h laboratory experiment undertaken by nobel and hartsock 1983 with 12 h of light and 12 h of darkness in this simulation the day period was characterized by a solar radiation of 244 w m2 a temperature of 25 c and a relative humidity of 40 while the night period was characterized by a temperature of 15 c and a relative humidity of 60 according to the conditions present in the laboratory experiment to facilitate comparisons of model performance with experimental data for s bicolor and t aestivum the model was forced with typical non limiting laboratory conditions of 12 h light 12 h darkness with a solar radiation of 391 w m2 during the light period a constant temperature of 26 c constant relative humidity of 80 and 0 7 volumetric soil moisture in loam soil to enable comparison of model results with data for o ficus indica the model was run for a 40 day drydown in loamy sand with solar radiation temperature and relative humidity obtained from the national solar radiation database nsrdb national renewable energy laboratory 2017 on march 17 2015 at a weather station nearby the study location in til til chile results were compared with data from acevedo et al 1983 describing carbon assimilation and stomatal conductance of under water stressed conditions 2 7 2 diurnal dynamics the diurnal dynamics of the three photosynthetic types were compared under typical well watered growing conditions see section 3 2 the model was run using meteorological data from temple tx on april 1 2015 imposing a soil moisture of 0 5 and a soil type of sandy loam the solar radiation air temperature and specific humidity for the site were obtained from the nsrdb data viewer national renewable energy laboratory 2017 2 7 3 long term performance under drought we evaluated the relative long term performance of the three crops during a drought section 3 3 by simulating a drydown of 40 days was simulated beginning with a volumetric soil moisture of 0 5 and using temperature relative humidity and solar radiation data from temple tx from april 1 2015 until may 10 2015 national renewable energy laboratory 2017 during the drydown the soil moisture was calculated according to eq 18 2 7 4 representation of c3 cam intermediates to test the ability of the model to capture c3 cam intermediate photosynthetic types the model was executed with various levels of maximum malic acid storage capacity m max see section 3 4 values tested were m max 190 mol m3 default model setting 95 mol m3 50 of the default setting and 1 9 mol m3 1 of the default setting results from these simulations were compared to a simulation run with all the photosynthetic parameters of o ficus indica but with the photosynthetic type set equal to c3 rather than cam for consistency plant water storage and respiration were not included in any of these simulations simulations were run for sandy loam soil with a constant soil moisture of 0 5 and weather conditions found in temple tx on april 3 2015 national renewable energy laboratory 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation for o ficus indica the magnitude and diurnal dynamics of both carbon assimilation see fig 4 a and stomatal conductance data not shown closely match those observed in controlled laboratory experiments carbon assimilation reaches a maximal value of 10 Œºmol m2 s in agreement with the data and stomatal conductance reaches a maximal value of 3 0 mm s as compared with the observed maximal value of 2 8 mm s the diurnal dynamics show a relatively good fit with a slight underestimate of carbon assimilation in the middle of the night hours 21 1 and a slight overestimate of carbon assimilation at dawn hour 6 at dusk the timing of the onset of cam carbon assimilation matches very well with the data while the decrease in carbon assimilation and stomatal conductance at dawn is slightly slower than that observed for s bicolor the carbon assimilation rate under optimal conditions is 48 Œºmol m2 s which lies within the range of published experimental ranges of 34 48 Œºmol m2 s peng 1990 and 40 Œºmol m2 s resende et al 2012 see fig 4c for t aestivum the maximal simulated carbon assimilation rate is 28 Œºmol m2 s which agrees well with experimental values of 24 29 Œºmol m2 s evans 1983 and 32 Œºmol m2 s martin and ruiz torres na 1992 see fig 4e model responses to water limitations also compare well with data for the three representative species fig 4b shows daily maximal stomatal conductance for o ficus indica at various levels of soil water potential simulated during a drydown the daily maximal stomatal conductance decreases from a maximum under well watered conditions to 50 of its original value at a soil water potential of approximately 0 7 mpa this behavior is a good fit with field measurements of stomatal conductance taken during a progressive drydown acevedo et al 1983 finally the model response to water limitation f œà l œà l given by eq 5 is compared with experimental data for carbon assimilation at a range of leaf water potentials for both s bicolor and t aestivum data shown include two cultivars of s bicolor icsv 1063 and migsor data from contour ansel et al 1996 and several cultivars of t aestivum kanchan sonalika kalyansona and c306 data from siddique et al 2000 tam w 101 data from johnson et al 1987 and tam w 101 and sturdy data from martin and ruiz torres na 1992 see fig 4d f the response of the model to moisture limitations generally agrees with published data for these species and provides a fit similar to that obtained through a sigmoidal function of leaf water potential 3 2 diurnal dynamics due to its detailed representation of cam dynamics the photo3 model is able to compare cam c3 and c4 functioning at a half hourly timescale fig 5 a shows the solar radiation air temperature and specific humidity for a typical april day in temple tx model responses of carbon assimilation transpiration and stomatal conductance for each of the photosynthetic types are shown in fig 5b d the characteristic stomatal behavior of cam is clearly shown with stomata opening primarily at night a combination of a low stomatal conductance and a low nocturnal driving force for transpiration during this period result in a very low transpiration with a moderate nocturnal carbon assimilation the carbon concentrating behavior of c4 results in a high maximum carbon assimilation while the stomatal conductance and transpiration are slightly lower than that of c3 under these conditions the c4 plant shows a high productivity and a high water use efficiency while the cam plant shows a relatively low productivity but a very high water use efficiency 3 3 long term performance under drought model simulations of cumulative carbon assimilation and water use during a drought period are shown in fig 6 for the three photosynthetic types while the c3 and c4 crops initially have high productivity assimilating carbon at a rate two to three times that of the cam crop the productivity of the c3 and c4 crops undergoes a large decrease after about 8 10 days as the soil dries to below 0 3 volumetric soil moisture fig 6a meanwhile the cam crop exhibits a slower but more persistent rate of carbon gain by day 22 the total carbon assimilation of o ficus indica surpasses that of t aestivum and by day 29 it surpasses that of s bicolor the cam crop also shows a much lower cumulative transpiration by a factor of nearly five during the early stages of the drought while the overall water use of the c3 and c4 crops are similar during this period see fig 6b this means that the soil in the cam simulation remains at a much higher moslevel for the first 20 days of the simulation see fig 6c while the cam species exhibits a lower productivity under non water limited conditions it exhibits a much higher water use efficiency and its productivity persists longer under water limited conditions after a 40 day drydown the cam crop ultimately assimilates twice as much carbon as the c3 species and 50 more than the c4 species at the same time its total transpiration is less than half that of the c3 species and about 70 that of the c4 species depending on the specific environmental conditions the photosynthetic water use efficiency of cam is two to six times higher than c3 and one to five times higher than c4 fig 6d this consistent basis of comparison which incorporates the effects of environmental variability at both long and short timescales allows the model user to quantify the costs and benefits of crops with different photosynthetic types in water limited ecosystems 3 4 representation of c3 cam intermediates cam photosynthesis is generally not a discrete trait rather a spectrum of c3 cam behavior exists in nature winter et al 2015 br√§utigam et al 2017 metabolite fluxes similar to cam fluxes have been shown in c3 plants to a much smaller degree winter et al 2015 br√§utigam et al 2017 and some cam plants including o ficus indica agave deserti and mesembryanthemum crystallinum show dramatic changes in the level of cam expression throughout their lifespan switching from c3 to cam photosynthesis during the process of development or in response to water stress kluge and ting 1978 winter et al 1978 2008 jordan and nobel 1979 acevedo et al 1983 winter and holtum 2011 the consistent formulations of the three different photosynthetic pathways in the photo3 model allows intermediate cam c3 behavior to be explored through the adjustment of a single model parameter this is the first time that such an analysis has been possible in a model coupled to the soil plant atmosphere continuum as cam expression becomes stronger vacuole size and maximum malic acid storage capacity increase indeed maximum malic acid content is a typical measure of the strength of cam expression kluge and ting 1978 by altering the maximum malic acid concentration m max in the cam model c3 behavior can be retrieved from the cam model framework these results are shown in fig 7 a c which shows carbon assimilation transpiration and stomatal conductance for o ficus indica with varying degrees of malic acid storage capacity full cam expression with 100 malic acid storage capacity cam intermediate with 50 malic acid storage capacity and cam intermediate with 1 malic acid storage capacity and with c3 type photosynthesis as the maximum malic acid concentration approaches zero the length of nocturnal stomatal opening becomes shorter until it approaches zero in accordance with the c3 model meanwhile the stomata begin to open for increasingly longer periods during the day for very low values of maximum malic acid concentration the stomatal conductance carbon assimilation and transpiration of the cam model match those of the c3 model the relevant cam fluxes a sv a vc and a sc are shown in fig 7d f for various levels of cam expression as m max decreases the fluxes a sv and a vc decrease while the duration of a sc increases until it is occurring for all daylight hours as m max approaches zero this behavior can be understood by referring to appendix c as m max decreases the amount of malic acid stored during the night becomes smaller and the malic acid is more quickly depleted during the day as a result the carbon function f c which depends on the malic acid concentration see eq c 3 is at a non zero value for a briefer period after the onset of light as f c approaches zero during the day a vc approaches zero and a sc approaches a n yielding c3 like behavior see eqs c 9 and c 1 likewise the flux a sv is restricted to smaller time increments at dawn and dusk and finally approaches zero according to eq c 5 4 conclusions results of the photo3 model allow the comparison of cam c3 and c4 species in a consistent framework this detailed model is streamlined user friendly and robust to a wide range of environmental conditions thus it is ready to be included as a component of earth system models crop models and bioenery models in each of these areas a more detailed representation of cam functioning can illuminate important questions the inclusion of c4 plants in earth system models has been evaluated and has been shown to have a significant effect on land cover and on local climate conditions cowling et al 2007 thus cam plants which arguably inhabit more extreme climates may also be expected to show important local effects a more detailed representation of cam in crop modeling will be a useful tool for evaluating potential productivity planting strategies and water use strategies for cam agriculture the open source modular nature of the photo3 model allows for the addition of other features that may help to explore a wide range of research questions in this stage of its development photo3 currently assumes that certain plant traits like leaf area index root area index and photosynthetic capacity are static over the course of the simulation in the future additional modules may be added to support the inclusion of more inputs such as plant nutrient status and growing stage which could influence plant traits dynamically additional modules may also be implemented to translate carbon assimilation into biomass accumulation and crop yield as pressure increases to provide food water and energy to a growing population ecohydrological modeling tools with these capabilities will be necessary to quantitatively evaluate the tradeoffs between species with different photosynthetic strategies porporato et al 2015 the photo3 model for the first time provides a physiologically based and consistent representation of the three photosynthetic types cam c3 and c4 coupled to environmental conditions this is done using a consistent model core built on the farquhar et al 1980 model for carbon assimilation a model of stomatal functioning based on stomatal optimality and a resistor capacitor model of the soil plant atmosphere continuum the model allows the user to compare expected productivity and water use efficiency of cam plants directly with that of c3 and c4 plants under a wide range of climate conditions the results produced here for simulations of o ficus indica t aestivum and s bicolor show detailed predictions of stomatal conductance carbon assimilation and transpiration at the daily level and also facilitate the comparison of long term carbon assimilation and water use of the three photosynthetic types under drought conditions through the adjustment of a single model parameter the model framework is also able to capture intermediate c3 cam behavior the open source modular nature of the model is designed for to be user friendly and easy to couple with existing modeling efforts photo3 shows promise for use in a variety of research applications where models of cam photosynthesis are currently lacking including the prediction of cam climate feedbacks productivity and biofuel

25244,recent interest in crassulacean acid metabolism cam photosynthesis has resulted in new physiologically based cam models these models show promise yet typically are not developed with a basis that is compatible with widely used models of c3 and c4 photosynthesis indeed most efforts to assess the potential of cam still rely on empirically based environmental productivity indices which makes uniform comparisons between cam and non cam species difficult in order to represent c3 c4 and cam photosynthesis in a consistent physiologically based manner we introduce the photo3 model photo3 unites a common photosynthetic and hydraulic core with components depicting the circadian rhythm of cam photosynthesis and the carbon concentrating mechanism of c4 photosynthesis this work allows consistent comparisons of the three photosynthetic types for the first time it also allows the representation of intermediate c3 cam behavior through the adjustment of a single model parameter model simulations of opuntia ficus indica cam sorghum bicolor c4 and triticum aestivum c3 capture the diurnal behavior of each species as well as the cumulative effects of long term water limitation these results show the model s potential for evaluating the tradeoffs between c3 c4 and cam photosynthesis and for better understanding cam productivity ecology and climate feedbacks keywords c3 photosynthesis c4 photosynthesis crassulacean acid metabolism cam plant water storage soil plant atmosphere continuum 1 introduction crassulacean acid metabolism cam and c4 photosynthesis are thought to have evolved as add ons to the classical c3 photosynthetic pathway around 20 30 million years ago keeley and rundel 2003 both photosynthetic processes achieve increased water use efficiency by concentrating co2 at the site of the dark reactions of photosynthesis today c4 and cam plants fill important ecological niches in grasslands rainforests and arid ecosystems c4 plants dominate in grasslands where they account for almost 25 of terrestrial primary production still et al 2003 whereas cam plants make up almost 50 of plant biomass in certain arid and semi arid regions of the world syvertsen et al 1976 c4 crops such as corn zea mays sugarcane saccharum officinarum and sorghum sorghum bicolor comprise 22 of the eighteen most common crops leff et al 2004 cam crops such as prickly pear opuntia ficus indica agave agave tequilana and pineapple ananas comosus are also economically significant particularly in arid and semi arid regions of the world due to their extremely high water use efficiency and heat tolerance the potential of cam plants for food fodder and biofuel production will only become more significant as climate uncertainty and tensions over food scarcity increase nobel 1991 garc√≠a de cort√°zar 1992 borland et al 2009 owen and griffiths 2014 mason et al 2015 despite the prevalence and importance of cam plants physiological modeling of cam photosynthesis is well behind that of c3 and c4 photosynthesis farquhar et al 1980 von caemmerer and furbank 1999 indeed physiological models of cam have only recently been introduced see e g owen and griffiths 2013 bartlett et al 2014 and have not been widely adopted instead nobel s environmental productivity index epi introduced in 1984 is the standard method of predicting net carbon uptake and yield for cam plants nobel 1988 nair et al 2012 this index based on multiplicative indices for water temperature and photosynthetically active radiation par is entirely empirical and does not include a physiological representation of the cam process furthermore the index is designed to be calculated at a timescale of one month nobel 1988 owen and griffiths 2014 thus failing to take into account environmental variability at daily and weekly timescales which has been shown to be an important factor in cam functioning bartlett et al 2014 hartzell et al 2015 this hampers the assessment of the potential impacts of cam plants on climate agriculture and bioenergy production most climate modeling efforts include land surface models with a physiologically based representation of c3 rogers et al 2017 and often c4 photosynthesis cox 2001 cowling et al 2007 milly et al 2014 but none currently include cam photosynthesis an important component of dryland and tropical ecosystems the recent push for physiologically based crop modeling has also failed to take cam crops into account multiple existing crop models including 2dleaf and mcwla are based on physiological models of c3 photosynthesis and stomatal conductance pachepsky and acock 1996 tao et al 2009 and the gecros model supports both c3 and c4 photosynthesis based on modifications to the farqhuar model yin 2005 despite these advances no crop models currently exist that are capable of coherently representing the three photosynthetic types this discrepancy propagates into the analysis of bioenergy potential while detailed biophysical models of c3 and c4 crops enable analyses of their potential for bioenergy production miguez et al 2012 nair et al 2012 lack of detailed cam modeling poses a problem in better understanding its potential in this area yan et al 2011 nair et al 2012 owen and griffiths 2014 davis et al 2015 the photo3 model addresses this need by providing a consistent physiologically based description of cam c3 and c4 photosynthesis coupled to environmental conditions the model seeks to balance the complexity required to faithfully represent each process with simplicity and clarity to achieve this the model leverages the commonalities between the three photosynthetic types the core of the model is based on the rubisco mediated carbon assimilation achieved by the light reactions and calvin cycle of c3 photosynthesis when representing cam and c4 plants this core is combined with a model for carbon fixation via phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase pepc the method for representing cam plants is based on bartlett et al 2014 and adds a component for malic acid storage and release which is governed by an endogenous circadian rhythm when representing c4 plants a carbon concentrating mechanism based on collatz et al collatz et al 1992 von caemmerer and furbank 1999 vico and porporato 2008 is added to the model core the resulting integrated model allows plants of all three photosynthetic types to be simulated on a consistent basis and in a wide variety of soil and atmospheric conditions in this work the model is parameterized for one representative species from each photosynthetic type o ficus indica cam triticum aestivum c3 and s bicolor c4 stomatal conductance carbon assimilation and water use of the three species are compared at the daily and monthly scale finally intermediate c3 cam behavior is explored through the adjustment of cam model parameters the photo3 model accurately captures a wide range of photosynthetic behaviors and shows promise for applications in ecological climate and crop modeling written in python the model is open source and publicly available on github it employs a modular structure which allows it to be easily integrated with other routines for use in a variety of applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the photo3 model the core of the photo3 model given in section 2 2 includes the farquhar et al 1980 model for photosynthetic carbon demand an optimal control model for stomatal conductance and a model of the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac in the case of c4 and cam photosynthesis this core is coupled with a model for carbon fixation via pepc which is either spatially c4 or temporally cam separated from the rubisco mediated calvin cycle the spac model is a simple resistor capacitor type model of the soil plant atmosphere continuum e g jones 1992 and has an option to include plant water storage which is an important feature in many succulent cam species nobel 1988 given solar radiation specific humidity and temperature the model estimates carbon assimilation and transpiration as well as other variables of interest see fig 1 the cam model formulated in section 2 3 includes all of the features of the core model and adds a representation of the carbon concentrating mechanism based on bartlett et al 2014 the diurnal rhythm of malic acid production and release is modeled through the addition of a cell vacuole characterized by m the malic acid content and z the circadian order variable which represents the overall effect of gene expression enzyme activity and or the vacuole tonoplast in controlling the circadian rhythm depending on the values of m and z co2 may either be fixed as malic acid by pepc and later decarboxylated and released to the calvin cycle or it may be directly passed to the calvin cycle and fixed via rubisco to account for the cam idling process dark respiration stays internal to the cell and is either passed to the cell vacuole or to the calvin cycle depending on the light level these differences described in fig 2 allow the model to capture the unique diurnal rhythm of cam carbon fluxes bartlett et al 2014 hartzell et al 2015 like the cam model the c4 model presented in section 2 4 also builds on the core farquhar model after the initial fixation of co2 into c4 acids via pepc which occurs in the mesophyll cell the c4 acids are decarboxylated and the co2 is passed to the bundle sheath cell where it is concentrated within the bundle sheath cells the rubsico mediated calvin cycle fixes carbon into sugar this process is represented using the farquhar et al 1980 model with the new elevated co2 concentration c bs a graphical description of these carbon fluxes is given in fig 2 2 2 general photosynthetic relations the net carbon uptake is modelled as a steady state fickian diffusion through the stomata i e 1 a n g s co 2 c s c m where g s co 2 is the stomatal conductance to co2 c s is the concentration of co2 at the leaf surface and c m is the concentration of co2 inside the mesophyll cytosol the stomatal conductance is assumed to scale with the square root of the vapor pressure deficit following stomatal optimization theory an approach which agrees well with accepted empirical models oren et al 1999 hari et al 2000 katul et al 2009 medlyn et al 2011 and can be represented as 2 g s co 2 a 1 a n c s d where a 1 is an empirical constant which is adjusted to account for observed differences in the c m c a ratio among photosynthetic types as described in jones 1992 and d is the vapor pressure deficit the net photosynthetic demand for co2 a d is modelled according to farquhar et al 1980 with an adjustment to account for plant water stress i e 3 a d a œï c x t l œï c x t l f œà l œà l due to the lack of temporal separation of co2 uptake and assimilation in c3 and c4 photosynthesis the net carbon uptake a n is equal to the net photosynthetic demand a d for these photosynthetic types the relationship between a n and a d for cam includes a temporal separation and is described in section 2 3 the carbon demand a œï c x t l œï c x t l is given by 4 a œï c x t l œï c x t l min a c c x t l a q œï c x t l where a c c x t l is the rubisco limited photosynthetic rate a q œï c x t l is the light limited photosynthetic rate t l is the leaf temperature c x is the co2 concentration at the site of the calvin cycle and œï is the incoming solar radiation see appendix a for details the relevant co2 concentration c x varies based on the photosynthetic type for c3 plants c x is the mesophyll concentration c m for c4 plants it is the bundle sheath concentration c bs and for cam plants it is either c m or the corrected mesophyll co2 concentration c c when malic acid is being decarboxylated the mesophyll co2 concentration is corrected to account for the elevated co2 concentration as c c c m c a d c o f c z m following bartlett et al 2014 the effects of water stress reduce the photosynthetic demand according to a vulnerability function of the leaf water potential f œà l œà l here represented for simplicity as a piecewise linear function which decreases between the point of onset of water stress œà la1 and the point of stomatal closure œà la0 i e 5 f œà l œà l 0 œà l œà la 0 œà l œà la 0 œà la 1 œà la 0 œà la 0 œà l œà la 1 1 œà l œà la 1 where the leaf water potentials œà la1 and œà la0 are species dependent see table 1 this piecewise function also used in daly et al 2004 provides results similar to other response functions commonly used in describing plant response to water stress such as sigmoidal curves sperry et al 2002 vico and porporato 2008 but has the advantage of providing increased numerical stability in the algorithm presented here which involves solving relatively complex equations for the leaf water potential since the dark respiration r d is typically a small fraction of the carbon assimilation its inclusion is optional except in the case of cam where it is an important component of cam idling behavior during periods of extended stomatal closure here it is represented as a temperature dependent process according to a modified arrhenius equation see appendix a 2 3 cam specific relations in the cam model a carbon pool is added to represent malic acid uptake and release from the cell vacuole see fig 2 the net flux of carbon through the stomata a n is comprised of a flux from the stomata to the calvin cycle a sc and one to the cell vacuole a sv i e 6 a n a sc œï c m t l œà l z m a sv t l œà l z m where z and m are the circadian rhythm order variable and the malic acid concentration respectively described below and the fluxes a sc and a sv are related to the carbon demand a d through the circadian state as described in appendix c the dark respiration flux r d is likewise divided into a flux to the vacuole r dv and one to the calvin cycle r dc carbon is stored in the cell vacuole as malic acid and is released from the vacuole as the flux a vc the diurnal cycle of uptake and release from the vacuole which governs the fluxes to and from the vacuole is represented by a pair of balance equations for m the malic acid concentration and z the circadian rhythm order the balance equation for the malic acid concentration is given by 7 l m dm dt a sv t l œà l z m r dv œï t l a vc œï c c t l z m where l m is the ratio of malic acid storage volume to the carbon flux surface area while the circadian rhythm order is given by 8 t r dz dt m m e z t l m max where t r is the relaxation time m e is the equilibrium concentration of malic acid and m max is the maximum malic acid concentration the malic acid equilibrium concentration is given by 9 m e z t l m max t h t l t h t l 1 c 1 Œ≤ z Œº 3 t h t l t h t l Œ≤

Œ≤ are circadian oscillator constants included in table 2 this formulation follows bartlett et al 2014 with the addition of the term 1 f 0 z which synchronizes the circadian rhythm with the prevailing light cycle this new term increases m e at high z values during the night ensuring that the uptake of malic acid continues at night even if the previous day s cycle has not completely depleted the store of malic acid the formulations of the model fluxes are given in appendix c these adjustments to the functions given in bartlett et al 2014 improve model robustness to highly variable environmental inputs 2 4 c4 specific relations in the c4 plant the influx of co2 to the bundle sheath cell is driven by the c4 pump and is modeled by a michaelis menten type dependence on the mesophyll cytosol co2 concentration c m as in von caemmerer von caemmerer 2000 vico and porporato 2008 see fig 2 the pep regeneration rate v p is bounded by the upper limit v pr i e 10 v p c m min c m v p max c m k p v pr where v p max is the maximum pep carboxylation rate and k p is the michaelis menten coefficient leakage of co2 from the bundle sheath cell is modelled as a diffusion flux from the bundle sheath to the mesophyll cell i e 11 l bs c bs c m g bs c bs c m where g bs is the conductance between the bundle sheath and mesophyll cells and c bs is the co2 concentration in the bundle sheath cells finally we introduce a balance equation for the co2 fluxes into and out of the bundle sheath cell i e 12 v p c m a d œï c bs t l œà l l bs c bs c m and solve for the co2 concentration in the bundle sheath cell c bs by combining eq 12 with eqs 10 and 11 the carbon assimilation is then calculated according to eq 3 parameters for the c4 model are included in table 3 2 5 plant hydraulics and capacitance the transpiration flux e is driven by the difference between the specific humidity internal to the leaf and that of the atmosphere i e 13 e g sa œÅ œÅ w q i t l œà l q a where g sa is the series of the atmospheric conductance and the combined stomatal cuticular conductance see appendix b œÅ is the density of air œÅ w is the density of water q i is the specific humidity internal to

temperature t l and the leaf water potential œà l plant water storage is included as an option in the model while it is generally negligible for most c3 and c4 crops plant water storage significantly affects water stress and carbon assimilation for plants with a substantial water storage capacity including most cam plants therefore we include plant water storage when modeling cam plants in this study but not when modeling c3 and c4 plants plant water storage is represented in this model as a simple capacitor located at a height which is a fraction f of the total plant height as in hartzell et al 2017 see fig 3 and appendix b using this scheme the change in the plant relative water content w is given by the balance equation 16 lai z w dw dt q s s w e where z w is the total available water storage depth of the plant on a leaf area basis lai is the leaf area index and s is the soil moisture the transpiration flux e is now given by the sum of the fluxes from the soil q s and the

be specified either as a model input or may be generated within the model as a stochastic process which requires the mean rainfall depth and frequency as input parameters currently a range of soil types are represented by the four soil options included in the model loamy sand sandy loam loam and clay soil parameters are included in table 5 2 6 model implementation environmental inputs for the model are solar radiation air temperature specific humidity soil moisture and soil type because of the strong dependence of cam photosynthesis on variability in environmental conditions at the sub daily scale the model operates with a 30 minute timestep solar radiation specific humidity and air temperature data with an hourly timescale may be interpolated to give values at each model timestep alternatively values for these variables may be generated internally to the model using a built in boundary layer simulation following the approach presented in daly et al 2004 values for soil moisture may be provided at each model timestep may be generated by the model from user provided rainfall data or may be generated internally by the model given certain assumptions i e constant soil moisture drydown conditions or stochastic rainfall generation the model is currently parameterized with hydraulic and photosynthetic properties for three representative species t aestivum c3 s bicolor c4 and o ficus indica cam see tables 1 4 these species were selected because they are among the most well studied and economically important species of each photosynthetic group leff et al 2004 paterson et al 2008 these properties are meant to represent plants at the mature stage in the growing season and are assumed to be approximately constant over the model duration 2 7 model validation and testing 2 7 1 model validation the model was validated using data collected under both well watered and droughted conditions for the three representative crops see section 3 1 model results under well watered conditions for o ficus indica were compared to results from a 24 h laboratory experiment undertaken by nobel and hartsock 1983 with 12 h of light and 12 h of darkness in this simulation the day period was characterized by a solar radiation of 244 w m2 a temperature of 25 c and a relative humidity of 40 while the night period was characterized by a temperature of 15 c and a relative humidity of 60 according to the conditions present in the laboratory experiment to facilitate comparisons of model performance with experimental data for s bicolor and t aestivum the model was forced with typical non limiting laboratory conditions of 12 h light 12 h darkness with a solar radiation of 391 w m2 during the light period a constant temperature of 26 c constant relative humidity of 80 and 0 7 volumetric soil moisture in loam soil to enable comparison of model results with data for o ficus indica the model was run for a 40 day drydown in loamy sand with solar radiation temperature and relative humidity obtained from the national solar radiation database nsrdb national renewable energy laboratory 2017 on march 17 2015 at a weather station nearby the study location in til til chile results were compared with data from acevedo et al 1983 describing carbon assimilation and stomatal conductance of under water stressed conditions 2 7 2 diurnal dynamics the diurnal dynamics of the three photosynthetic types were compared under typical well watered growing conditions see section 3 2 the model was run using meteorological data from temple tx on april 1 2015 imposing a soil moisture of 0 5 and a soil type of sandy loam the solar radiation air temperature and specific humidity for the site were obtained from the nsrdb data viewer national renewable energy laboratory 2017 2 7 3 long term performance under drought we evaluated the relative long term performance of the three crops during a drought section 3 3 by simulating a drydown of 40 days was simulated beginning with a volumetric soil moisture of 0 5 and using temperature relative humidity and solar radiation data from temple tx from april 1 2015 until may 10 2015 national renewable energy laboratory 2017 during the drydown the soil moisture was calculated according to eq 18 2 7 4 representation of c3 cam intermediates to test the ability of the model to capture c3 cam intermediate photosynthetic types the model was executed with various levels of maximum malic acid storage capacity m max see section 3 4 values tested were m max 190 mol m3 default model setting 95 mol m3 50 of the default setting and 1 9 mol m3 1 of the default setting results from these simulations were compared to a simulation run with all the photosynthetic parameters of o ficus indica but with the photosynthetic type set equal to c3 rather than cam for consistency plant water storage and respiration were not included in any of these simulations simulations were run for sandy loam soil with a constant soil moisture of 0 5 and weather conditions found in temple tx on april 3 2015 national renewable energy laboratory 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation for o ficus indica the magnitude and diurnal dynamics of both carbon assimilation see fig 4 a and stomatal conductance data not shown closely match those observed in controlled laboratory experiments carbon assimilation reaches a maximal value of 10 Œºmol m2 s in agreement with the data and stomatal conductance reaches a maximal value of 3 0 mm s as compared with the observed maximal value of 2 8 mm s the diurnal dynamics show a relatively good fit with a slight underestimate of carbon assimilation in the middle of the night hours 21 1 and a slight overestimate of carbon assimilation at dawn hour 6 at dusk the timing of the onset of cam carbon assimilation matches very well with the data while the decrease in carbon assimilation and stomatal conductance at dawn is slightly slower than that observed for s bicolor the carbon assimilation rate under optimal conditions is 48 Œºmol m2 s which lies within the range of published experimental ranges of 34 48 Œºmol m2 s peng 1990 and 40 Œºmol m2 s resende et al 2012 see fig 4c for t aestivum the maximal simulated carbon assimilation rate is 28 Œºmol m2 s which agrees well with experimental values of 24 29 Œºmol m2 s evans 1983 and 32 Œºmol m2 s martin and ruiz torres na 1992 see fig 4e model responses to water limitations also compare well with data for the three representative species fig 4b shows daily maximal stomatal conductance for o ficus indica at various levels of soil water potential simulated during a drydown the daily maximal stomatal conductance decreases from a maximum under well watered conditions to 50 of its original value at a soil water potential of approximately 0 7 mpa this behavior is a good fit with field measurements of stomatal conductance taken during a progressive drydown acevedo et al 1983 finally the model response to water limitation f œà l œà l given by eq 5 is compared with experimental data for carbon assimilation at a range of leaf water potentials for both s bicolor and t aestivum data shown include two cultivars of s bicolor icsv 1063 and migsor data from contour ansel et al 1996 and several cultivars of t aestivum kanchan sonalika kalyansona and c306 data from siddique et al 2000 tam w 101 data from johnson et al 1987 and tam w 101 and sturdy data from martin and ruiz torres na 1992 see fig 4d f the response of the model to moisture limitations generally agrees with published data for these species and provides a fit similar to that obtained through a sigmoidal function of leaf water potential 3 2 diurnal dynamics due to its detailed representation of cam dynamics the photo3 model is able to compare cam c3 and c4 functioning at a half hourly timescale fig 5 a shows the solar radiation air temperature and specific humidity for a typical april day in temple tx model responses of carbon assimilation transpiration and stomatal conductance for each of the photosynthetic types are shown in fig 5b d the characteristic stomatal behavior of cam is clearly shown with stomata opening primarily at night a combination of a low stomatal conductance and a low nocturnal driving force for transpiration during this period result in a very low transpiration with a moderate nocturnal carbon assimilation the carbon concentrating behavior of c4 results in a high maximum carbon assimilation while the stomatal conductance and transpiration are slightly lower than that of c3 under these conditions the c4 plant shows a high productivity and a high water use efficiency while the cam plant shows a relatively low productivity but a very high water use efficiency 3 3 long term performance under drought model simulations of cumulative carbon assimilation and water use during a drought period are shown in fig 6 for the three photosynthetic types while the c3 and c4 crops initially have high productivity assimilating carbon at a rate two to three times that of the cam crop the productivity of the c3 and c4 crops undergoes a large decrease after about 8 10 days as the soil dries to below 0 3 volumetric soil moisture fig 6a meanwhile the cam crop exhibits a slower but more persistent rate of carbon gain by day 22 the total carbon assimilation of o ficus indica surpasses that of t aestivum and by day 29 it surpasses that of s bicolor the cam crop also shows a much lower cumulative transpiration by a factor of nearly five during the early stages of the drought while the overall water use of the c3 and c4 crops are similar during this period see fig 6b this means that the soil in the cam simulation remains at a much higher moslevel for the first 20 days of the simulation see fig 6c while the cam species exhibits a lower productivity under non water limited conditions it exhibits a much higher water use efficiency and its productivity persists longer under water limited conditions after a 40 day drydown the cam crop ultimately assimilates twice as much carbon as the c3 species and 50 more than the c4 species at the same time its total transpiration is less than half that of the c3 species and about 70 that of the c4 species depending on the specific environmental conditions the photosynthetic water use efficiency of cam is two to six times higher than c3 and one to five times higher than c4 fig 6d this consistent basis of comparison which incorporates the effects of environmental variability at both long and short timescales allows the model user to quantify the costs and benefits of crops with different photosynthetic types in water limited ecosystems 3 4 representation of c3 cam intermediates cam photosynthesis is generally not a discrete trait rather a spectrum of c3 cam behavior exists in nature winter et al 2015 br√§utigam et al 2017 metabolite fluxes similar to cam fluxes have been shown in c3 plants to a much smaller degree winter et al 2015 br√§utigam et al 2017 and some cam plants including o ficus indica agave deserti and mesembryanthemum crystallinum show dramatic changes in the level of cam expression throughout their lifespan switching from c3 to cam photosynthesis during the process of development or in response to water stress kluge and ting 1978 winter et al 1978 2008 jordan and nobel 1979 acevedo et al 1983 winter and holtum 2011 the consistent formulations of the three different photosynthetic pathways in the photo3 model allows intermediate cam c3 behavior to be explored through the adjustment of a single model parameter this is the first time that such an analysis has been possible in a model coupled to the soil plant atmosphere continuum as cam expression becomes stronger vacuole size and maximum malic acid storage capacity increase indeed maximum malic acid content is a typical measure of the strength of cam expression kluge and ting 1978 by altering the maximum malic acid concentration m max in the cam model c3 behavior can be retrieved from the cam model framework these results are shown in fig 7 a c which shows carbon assimilation transpiration and stomatal conductance for o ficus indica with varying degrees of malic acid storage capacity full cam expression with 100 malic acid storage capacity cam intermediate with 50 malic acid storage capacity and cam intermediate with 1 malic acid storage capacity and with c3 type photosynthesis as the maximum malic acid concentration approaches zero the length of nocturnal stomatal opening becomes shorter until it approaches zero in accordance with the c3 model meanwhile the stomata begin to open for increasingly longer periods during the day for very low values of maximum malic acid concentration the stomatal conductance carbon assimilation and transpiration of the cam model match those of the c3 model the relevant cam fluxes a sv a vc and a sc are shown in fig 7d f for various levels of cam expression as m max decreases the fluxes a sv and a vc decrease while the duration of a sc increases until it is occurring for all daylight hours as m max approaches zero this behavior can be understood by referring to appendix c as m max decreases the amount of malic acid stored during the night becomes smaller and the malic acid is more quickly depleted during the day as a result the carbon function f c which depends on the malic acid concentration see eq c 3 is at a non zero value for a briefer period after the onset of light as f c approaches zero during the day a vc approaches zero and a sc approaches a n yielding c3 like behavior see eqs c 9 and c 1 likewise the flux a sv is restricted to smaller time increments at dawn and dusk and finally approaches zero according to eq c 5 4 conclusions results of the photo3 model allow the comparison of cam c3 and c4 species in a consistent framework this detailed model is streamlined user friendly and robust to a wide range of environmental conditions thus it is ready to be included as a component of earth system models crop models and bioenery models in each of these areas a more detailed representation of cam functioning can illuminate important questions the inclusion of c4 plants in earth system models has been evaluated and has been shown to have a significant effect on land cover and on local climate conditions cowling et al 2007 thus cam plants which arguably inhabit more extreme climates may also be expected to show important local effects a more detailed representation of cam in crop modeling will be a useful tool for evaluating potential productivity planting strategies and water use strategies for cam agriculture the open source modular nature of the photo3 model allows for the addition of other features that may help to explore a wide range of research questions in this stage of its development photo3 currently assumes that certain plant traits like leaf area index root area index and photosynthetic capacity are static over the course of the simulation in the future additional modules may be added to support the inclusion of more inputs such as plant nutrient status and growing stage which could influence plant traits dynamically additional modules may also be implemented to translate carbon assimilation into biomass accumulation and crop yield as pressure increases to provide food water and energy to a growing population ecohydrological modeling tools with these capabilities will be necessary to quantitatively evaluate the tradeoffs between species with different photosynthetic strategies porporato et al 2015 the photo3 model for the first time provides a physiologically based and consistent representation of the three photosynthetic types cam c3 and c4 coupled to environmental conditions this is done using a consistent model core built on the farquhar et al 1980 model for carbon assimilation a model of stomatal functioning based on stomatal optimality and a resistor capacitor model of the soil plant atmosphere continuum the model allows the user to compare expected productivity and water use efficiency of cam plants directly with that of c3 and c4 plants under a wide range of climate conditions the results produced here for simulations of o ficus indica t aestivum and s bicolor show detailed predictions of stomatal conductance carbon assimilation and transpiration at the daily level and also facilitate the comparison of long term carbon assimilation and water use of the three photosynthetic types under drought conditions through the adjustment of a single model parameter the model framework is also able to capture intermediate c3 cam behavior the open source modular nature of the model is designed for to be user friendly and easy to couple with existing modeling efforts photo3 shows promise for use in a variety of research applications where models of cam photosynthesis are currently lacking including the prediction of cam climate feedbacks productivity and biofuel

is the soil water potential at saturation and b is the exponent of the retention curve the specific plant water capacitance c is defined as the change in relative stored water volume per unit change in water potential c dw d œà w in this study we have chosen to approximate the plant water capacitance as constant and the stored water potential œà w as a linear function of the relative water storage volume w following hunt et al 1991 i e b 2 œà w w w 1 c this relationship neglects nonlinearities in the pressure volume relationship caused by osmotic effects at low w in order to include plant water storage with a minimum level of complexity although a simplification this linear relationship is a good approximation in the physically relevant regime for many succulent and cam species nobel and jordan 1983 hunt and nobel 1987 ogburn and edwards 2012 in o ficus indica specifically the pressure volume relationship has been shown to be approximately linear for relative water contents above 20 below this point further decreases in relative water content will lead to tissue damage and are not considered reversible goldstein et al 1991 b 3 conductances the stomatal conductance to
