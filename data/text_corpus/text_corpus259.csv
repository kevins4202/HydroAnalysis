1295,long term estimates of natural source zone depletion nszd rates for petroleum lnapl light non aqueous phase liquid sites are not available one off measurements are often thought valid over the lifetime of lnapl sites in the context of site wide lnapl mass estimates we report site specific gasoline and diesel nszd rates spanning 21 26 years using depth profiles of soil gases oxygen carbon dioxide methane volatiles above lnapl nszd rates were estimated in 1994 2006 and 2020 for diesel and 1999 2009 and 2020 for gasoline each date also had soil core mass estimates which together with nszd rates allow estimation of the longevity for lnapl presence site wide coring in 1992 2002 2007 estimated lnapl mass reductions of 12 000 t for diesel nszd the ratio of nszd rates for 2006 16 000 49 000 l ha y to those in 2020 2600 14 000 l ha y was 3 6 by 2020 the 1994 diesel nszd rates would have predicted the entire removal of measured mass 16 42 kg m2 for gasoline nszd rates in 1999 were extremely high 50 000 270 000 l ha y but 9 27 times lower 5800 10 000 l ha y a decade later the gasoline nszd rates in 1999 predicted near complete mass removal in 2 12 years but 10 11 kg m2 was measured 10 and 21 years later which is 26 of the initial mass in 1999 the outcomes substantiate the need to understand nszd rate changes over the lifetime of lnapl impacted sites graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords natural source zone depletion lnapl transient diesel gasoline petroleum 1 introduction natural source zone depletion nszd of light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl petroleum in subsurface soil and groundwater systems is gaining increasing acceptance as an lnapl impacted site management option itrc 2018 cl aire 2019 crc care 2020 the underlying processes have been well summarised in two reasonably recent reviews garg et al 2017 sookhak lari et al 2019 and expanded upon by smith et al 2022 the two reviews brought together literature and understanding spanning over 30 years combining features of lnapl movement sookhak lari et al 2016 tomlinson et al 2017 lenhard et al 2017 lnapl partitioning to groundwater and soil gas phases lang et al 2009 lekmine et al 2017 davis et al 2021 lnapl compositional changes and fingerprinting during mass loss johnston et al 2007 devaull et al 2020 rayner et al 2020 groundwater natural attenuation wiedemeier et al 1999 microbiology and biodegradation processes franzmann et al 1996 franzmann et al 1999 bruckberger et al 2021 and biodegradation of lnapl mass and vapours in the vadose zone amos et al 2005 davis et al 2005 linking a number of these features together was largely birthed at two sites that have undergone detailed investigation the bemidji minnesota crude oil release site chaplin et al 2002 amos et al 2005 molins et al 2010 and the guadalupe oil field site in california lundegard and johnson 2006 johnson et al 2006 both reported significant biodegradation in the vadose zone at these lnapl impacted sites compared to groundwater natural attenuation rates here we report novel outcomes from the kwinana site western australia which also has a long history of investigation some contend that nszd of lnapl as a management option is applicable only after significant efforts have been undertaken at sites to maximise the removal of lnapl mass the so called endpoint of active lnapl remedial efforts sookhak lari et al 2018 sookhak lari et al 2020 while others argue that nszd occurs from the time of an lnapl release into a subsurface environment and as such may be applicable as a management option at any stage deciding the applicability of nszd as an lnapl site management option is outlined in guidance by itrc 2018 and crc care 2020 such guidance is supported by technical measurement guidance itrc 2009 api 2017 crc care 2018 and case studies providing current measures of nszd rates rayner et al 2020 despite this significant uncertainty remains regarding the best nszd measurement methods to use at sites the cost effectiveness and practicability of nszd methods the sustainability of nszd and long term nszd rates at sites and the role of nszd in reducing site risks sites can have a range of geologies and stratigraphy product types subsurface biogeochemistry and infrastructure that may induce or impede nszd smith et al 2021 assessing such variability in six australian case studies rayner et al 2020 reported a wide range of nszd rates with broad nszd estimates across measurement techniques at the same location on some sites kulkarni et al 2020 and eichert et al 2017 also conducted intercomparisons of nszd estimation techniques at single sites with both studies finding that nszd rates varied spatially and seasonally despite the body of knowledge most investigations do not have access to estimates of nszd rates over the period of lnapl weathering or regulatory concern typically multiple decades sihota et al 2016 investigated seasonal trends in nszd rates and showed that summer rates were about 60 above annual averages liu 2004 outlined laboratory based studies to accelerate weathering and aging in the laboratory to estimate the longevity of nszd rates these have been adopted in itrc 2009 also compositional changes and fingerprinting during mass loss johnston et al 2007 devaull et al 2020 rayner et al 2020 show that variations in composition occur leading to nszd rate changes despite this direct field estimates of nszd over decades are lacking here we investigate temporal trends in lnapl mass for an entire site and nszd rates for individual diesel d 1 and d 2 and gasoline g 1and g 2 locations within the kwinana site fig 1 these investigations spanned 26 years to avoid uncertainties associated with using different nszd rate measurement methodologies at different times kulkarni et al 2020 the same method was employed at each of the measurement periods the method used was soil gas depth profiling through the vadose zone from installed multilevel soil gas samplers this allows nszd rates to be determined from oxygen carbon dioxide methane or other volatile organic compound voc depth profiles in soil gas in the vadose zone nszd rates have been determined somewhat standardly from such gas profiles as described in a number of technical guidance documents and other literature itrc 2009 api 2017 crc care 2018 verginelli and baciocchi 2021 and for petroleum vapour biodegradation studies lahvis et al 1999 davis et al 2009 coring at the sites of the soil gas profiling measurements allowed nszd estimates to be evaluated against lnapl distribution and soil profile properties over the same period as these soil gas profiling measurements three site wide coring campaigns were undertaken fig 1 to further allow estimation of depth alignment and lnapl mass longevity 2 site description the kwinana site is a 343 ha coastal petroleum handling site located 50 km south of perth western australia it has had multiple historic lnapl petroleum releases of crude diesel gasoline aviation gasoline and other petroleum product types over nearly 70 years the site has a mediterranean climate with cool wet winters and hot dry summers the annual average rainfall 1991 2020 is 716 5 mm australian bureau of meteorology station no 9194 predominately falling between may and october the notional stratigraphy to 14 m below ground is shown in fig 2a along with particle size distributions over the depth interval 2 4 m below ground typical of the near water table zone in fig 2b the water table across the site is typically 2 5 5 0 m below ground with an annual fluctuation due to seasonal rainfall of up to 0 9 m predominantly groundwater flow is towards the north west the soil profile and surficial aquifer consists of a sequence of aeolian and littoral calcareous sands sometimes thin carbonate cemented layers are encountered in the vadose zone creamy tan coloured sands typically extend to 2 to 3 m below ground where a change to grey coloured sand occurs down to the depth of the bottom of the sand sequence a basal clay aquitard between the overlying sands and the tamala limestone aquifer beneath is absent in parts of the site the sands typically have low organic matter content i e fraction of organic carbon 0 03 particle sizes fig 2b show layering in the safety bay sands in the vicinity of the water table johnston et al 1998 provide a more detailed description the relatively permeable surficial sands allow for relatively rapid downward infiltration of water subsurface migration of hydrocarbons as well as the exchange of soil and atmospheric gases locally the shallow soil profile at site d 1 fig 1 was noted to consist of fine medium calcareous sand with a water table 3 7 4 2 m below ground in 2005 2007 johnston et al 2008 and 3 7 4 2 m below ground in 2020 the g 1 site was noted to consist of leached aeolian calcareous sand with variably cemented layers and a pronounced shallow cemented limestone layer at some locations davis et al 2005 the water table was 2 5 3 3 m below ground in 1999 and 2 3 3 0 m below ground in 2020 in well lnapl thicknesses can be strongly influenced by water table elevation steffy et al 1998 which rises in response to strongly winter dominant rainfall on site fig 3 shows a particularly sharp contrast in lnapl thicknesses from well measurements between april and may 2005 due to a rainfall totalling over 200 mm in may more than twice the long term average leading to a significant rise in the water table over this short period peak lnapl thicknesses in wells decreased from 800 to 900 mm to 400 500 mm in 2005 2007 diesel lnapl at d 1 showed thicknesses in wells up to 0 6 m seasonally and 0 17 m on 4th june 2020 gasoline lnapl showed thicknesses in wells up to 0 4 m seasonally in 1995 steffy et al 1995 at site g 3 and effectively zero in 2020 3 approach and methodology two primary scales of investigation are outlined here 1 three site wide coring campaigns are described for 1992 2002 and 2007 whereby lnapl masses are estimated to provide context for nszd rates 2 nszd rate estimates at individual locations specific to diesel and gasoline lnapl petroleum types comparing nszd rate estimates spanning a period of up to 26 years noting that no new lnapl releases occurred locally to these sites in the intervening periods specific investigations at each of the diesel d 1 and d 2 and gasoline g 1 and g 2 locations at each time included soil coring to determine lnapl concentration mass and its vertical distribution and soil gas depth profile data to calculate nszd rates fig 4 shows the timeline of investigations and whether investigations primarily yielded site wide lnapl mass estimates or a local nszd rate for diesel or gasoline on sites at each of the local sites lnapl mass from soil coring was also determined at the time diesel nszd rates are estimated from 1994 2006 and 2020 data with those from 2006 and 2020 at the same location d 1 fig 1 gasoline nszd rates are estimated from 1999 april december 2009 and 2020 data with those from 1999 and 2020 at the same location g 1 fig 1 and those from 2009 located 40 m to the east g 2 fig 1 note that the 1994 95 diesel 2005 06 diesel and the 2008 09 gasoline nszd rates were not affected by the bioventing biosparging processes referenced in fig 4 all estimates were based on measurements taken prior to active bioventing biosparging occurring 3 1 site wide coring and lnapl sampling campaigns site wide coring campaigns spanning 15 years were undertaken in 1992 2002 and 2007 the aim of which was to estimate the total mass of lnapl at the site coring locations for a portion of the site are shown in fig 1 additionally in 2005 lnapl samples were recovered from 100 wells across the site and analysis was undertaken to determine the spatial distribution of different product types in combination with the coring survey masses product distributions for diesel and gasoline were used to obtain specific mass estimate ranges for gasoline and diesel and an indication of their total masses at the site the core locations from each sampling campaign are shown in fig 1 polygons were placed across the site relative to cores with non zero lnapl mass and the area of the polygons were used to estimate the area represented by the lnapl core mass 100 ha and those for diesel 30 ha and gasoline 14 ha these were then summed to give a total lnapl mass and a diesel and gasoline mass for each of the dates 1992 2002 and 2007 3 2 diesel site investigations the location of the two diesel sites d 1 and d 2 are noted on fig 1 an initial investigation was conducted at d 1 in 2005 2007 to evaluate biosparging periodic air injection below the water table and lnapl impacted zone as a technique to biodegrade diesel lnapl in situ johnston et al 2008 nszd investigations were undertaken at the same site in 2020 to enable the comparison of nszd rates over a 14 year period at diesel site d 2 in situ bioventing aeration above the water table was investigated in 1994 as a remedial strategy for highly weathered diesel rao et al 1996 davis et al 1998b 2013 this site provides a historic reference point 26 years prior to the 2020 investigations for measurement of nszd rates for weathered diesel lnapl although in the same geological and topographical setting d 2 is 400 m distant from d 1 and had a different history of diesel release as such although relevant to diesel rates on site it was not deemed directly comparable to the diesel nszd rates at d 1 for the d 2 site cores were recovered and analysed and eight sets of multilevel samplers y7 y12 y14 y15 were installed within a 300 m2 area in 1994 davis et al 2013 each multilevel sampler had 7 sampling ports from 0 5 m to 4 1 m below ground surface the bottom few sampling ports were at the top or within the zone where lnapl was measured in the soil profile gas samples presented herein were recovered from prior to instigation of air injection to commence bioventing activities at the d 1 site three soil cores were recovered in 2005 and multilevel soil gas samplers were installed each with sampling ports at approximately 0 5 m depth intervals gases were sampled in 2006 from the multilevel samplers to determine depth profiles prior to any aeration occurring in 2019 2020 at the same d 1 diesel site cores were recovered and new multilevel gas samplers were installed at 0 25 m and then at 0 5 m depth intervals from 0 5 m to 4 5 m below ground gas samples collected from the vadose zone sampling ports were analysed for methane ch4 volatile organic compounds vocs and the major gases nitrogen n2 oxygen o2 carbon dioxide co2 3 3 gasoline site investigations at the gasoline g 1 site fig 1 investigations commenced in 1997 to quantify the behaviour of vapours in a variable soil profile davis et al 1998a 2001 2005 additional gasoline biosparging investigations were also conducted in 2009 approximately 40 m east of this location at site g 2 johnston et al 2011 and in close proximity to field investigations of steffy et al 1995 denoted g 3 on fig 1 soil gas and lnapl profile data from 1997 are presented in davis et al 1998a and those for 1999 are in davis et al 2005 for these earlier studies and in 2019 2020 soil cores were recovered and multilevel gas samplers with sampling ports at approximately 0 25 to 0 5 m depth intervals were installed to sample soil gases and vapours for the 2019 2020 study data from two primary multilevel samplers are reported 3 4 multilevel samplers typically multilevel samplers consisted of 3 25 mm diameter nylon tubing id 2 0 mm with a 3 2 mm to 6 35 mm nylon swagelok reducer fitting installed as a screen area 31 7 mm2 a stainless steel mesh was inserted in the opening to prevent soil from entering the tubing multilevel samplers at set depth intervals were bundled together on a central pvc support and subsequent to hand auguring or drilling to the deepest required depth were inserted into the soil profile drill spoils were backfilled into the hole no sealants such as bentonite were used to ensure gas exchange with the atmosphere the multilevel samplers have been shown to provide reliable and discrete interval depth profile data across numerous studies davis et al 2005 and compared to in situ sensors patterson and davis 2008 a similar soil gas sampling methodology was deployed over all sites and studies soil gases were sampled from multilevel samplers located above the water table and capillary fringe at the time of sampling air tight syringes 50 ml plastic were used to initially purge three volumes of the multilevel sample line before collecting a sample for major gas methane analysis sampled using in line 3 way taps and plastic syringes and vocs sampled using in line 3 way taps and glass barrelled syringes major gas methane samples were sealed with in line 3 way taps and either analysed on site or transported back to the laboratory for analysis the following day samples for voc analyses had an internal standard fluorobenzene added and were either analysed directly or transferred to glass vials and sealed for analysis using an autosampler sample integrity was evaluated using a range of approaches including internal standard abundance for voc samples duplicate field samples comparison of field and laboratory measurements blank samples and control samples 3 5 coring coring to determine lnapl mass for the site wide coring programs was undertaken using two methods i the use of hydraulically driven coring equipment and ii the use of a hand auger and aluminium push tube driven into the subsurface with a manually powered slide hammer coring was undertaken near continuously from 0 to 5 m below ground level in the 1992 2002 and 2007 campaigns 162 156 and 132 cores were recovered respectively from each core approximately 13 subsamples were taken for analysis at shallower depths where lnapl was deemed not to be present or at low concentrations subsamples consisted of composites across 1 m intervals through the zone of lnapl contamination more detailed subsampling was undertaken with depth intervals of 0 10 or 0 15 m soil subsamples 10 g wet weight were placed in capped 40 ml vials kept cool and delivered to a commercial laboratory for hydrocarbon analysis prior to 2020 site specific soil cores were recovered in two or three continuous sections over the soil profile by pushing an aluminium tube into the soil to a depth below the extent of contamination typically 1 0 to 1 5 m below the water table davis et al 2005 cores collected in august 2020 were sampled using a direct push drill rig geoprobe 7822dt cores taken using the drill rig were collected in 1 5 m long 48 mm diameter plastic core liners during drilling a low suction was applied to the top of the coring tube to avoid losses or slumping of cores materials prior to recovery at ground surface core subsamples 5 cm long were taken in the field to minimise the loss of volatiles and also to avoid redistribution of fluids in the core i e lnapl water air typically all fluid volumes we measured in subsamples of cores and validated with depth against the elevation of the water table at the time of coring this provided additional surety that cored material was not unduly displaced during recovery most subsamples were taken across the lnapl impacted zone with samples taken above and below to confirm the absence of lnapl subsamples were sealed in pre weighed tins chilled and transported back to the laboratory within 24 h of core collection a subsample 3 5 g for total petroleum hydrocarbon tph analysis was collected in a sealable screwcap vial from each core depth interval using a stainless steel corer with the extraction solvent being added immediately 3 6 site specific analytical methods all site specific analyses were performed in house at csiro perth laboratories for major gases and methane gas chromatography gc with a thermal conductivity detector tcd and a flame ionisation detector fid methane only were used volatile organic compounds c4 to c15 including benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes btex were analysed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms operating in full scan mode concentrations were calculated based on external and internal standards added at the time of collection prepared in the same manner as the samples soil core sub samples were extracted using a solvent containing deuterated internal standards the samples were extracted using tumbling and the solvent extract removed after tumbling using a pipette providing a sample for gc fid and gc ms analyses quantitation of tph was performed by gc fid and quantitation of selected components was carried out using gc ms using external and internal standards prepared in the same manner as the samples 3 7 nszd calculation method oxygen and carbon dioxide soil gas depth profile concentrations relative to those at ground surface approximately 21 o2 in air and 0 co2 in air were used to estimate concentration gradients as input to oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production rate estimates nszd rates were estimated from oxygen consumption rates using relevant diffusion coefficients and stoichiometry e g crc care 2018 as the nszd rates are used for within site comparisons they are not corrected for natural soil respiration a background site also showed effectively zero oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production effective diffusion coefficients def were calculated using the millington and quirk 1961 approximation d ef d a θ a 3 3 θ t 2 using estimates of soil total porosity θ t and air filled porosity θ a from the site and oxygen and carbon dioxide diffusion coefficients in air d a taken as 0 175 cm2 s and 0 16 cm2 s respectively from soil cores at the diesel d 2 site davis et al 2013 reported θ t of 0 4 0 5 m3 m3 and θ a of 0 25 0 4 m3 m3 d ef is then calculated to be in the range 1 1 3 3 10 6 m2 s for oxygen and 1 0 3 0 10 6 m2 s for carbon dioxide similarly from soil core information at the gasoline g 1 site reported in davis et al 2005 total θ t were 0 47 0 48 m3 m3 and θ a were 0 35 0 41 m3 m3 for the bulk of the soil profile giving d ef in the range 2 3 4 1 10 6 m2 s for oxygen and 2 1 3 7 10 6 m2 s for carbon dioxide whilst soil moisture will change seasonally e g davis et al 2005 these values are taken as representative of conditions on site for comparative purposes primarily oxygen diffusion coefficients will be used in the paper 4 results and discussion 4 1 site wide lnapl mass across the three site wide coring events the mean and maximum specific masses were between 36 kg m2 and 42 kg m2 and 160 kg m2 and 360 mg m2 respectively table 1 cores with zero mass represented between 34 and 40 of the number of cores collected overall the total lnapl mass was estimated to reduce from 40 000 t in 1992 to 31 000 t in 2002 and to 28 000 t in 2007 a 12 000 t decrease over 15 y table 1 the product with the largest mass was degraded diesel 12 000 17 000 t with gasoline being 1700 3000 t interestingly total diesel and gasoline product types showed mass decreases of 30 over the decade between 1992 and 2002 but did not show significant change for the following 5 year period mean specific masses for diesel decreased from 68 kg m2 in 1992 to 51 kg m2 in 2007 table 1 higher than the site wide mean values across all product types 36 42 kg m2 mean specific masses for gasoline decreased from 24 kg m2 for 1992 to 15 19 kg m2 for 2002 2007 all lower than the site wide mean specific mass values across all product types there have been lnapl recovery efforts at the site since before 1992 but estimates of recovery are uncertain due to water entrainment in liquid recovery systems and other confounding factors lnapl recovery has been estimated to be 5000 t since 1992 4 2 diesel site d 1 comparison over 14 years prior to a 14 month biosparging field trial in 2006 2007 johnston et al 2008 measured the data shown in fig 5a b data for the same site in 2020 are shown in fig 5c d 4 2 1 lnapl distribution in 2005 the diesel lnapl fig 5a had a vertical distribution of approximately 1 3 m across the water table with peak mass up to 75 g kg and a saturation up to 0 35 and specific mass in the profile of 64 kg m2 in 2020 the diesel lnapl fig 5c had a similar vertical depth distribution to that in 2005 of approximately 1 5 m across the water table but with a higher peak concentration of approximately 200 g kg and specific mass in the profile of 51 kg m2 the specific mass of cores recently recovered from this site ranged from 81 kg m2 in september 2016 to 45 and 71 kg m2 for two cores recovered in november 2017 from the earlier site wide coring surveys diesel cores in the vicinity of d 1 showed specific masses of 1 29 kg m2 in 1992 0 141 kg m2 in 2002 and 0 53 kg m2 in 2007 4 2 2 soil gas depth profiles in 2006 fig 5b oxygen concentrations decreased and carbon dioxide concentrations increased with increasing depth notably a high methane concentration 36 was measured at a depth of 3 75 m below ground near to the depth of the zone of lnapl impact from fig 5b the oxygen and carbon dioxide concentration gradients were approximately 8 8 m and 6 2 m respectively at that time in 2020 fig 5d marginal decreases in oxygen concentrations are observed over the depth profile with no methane observed in these depth profiles we note however the occurrence of 5 methane in a soil gas sample at 3 5 m depth from a nearby sampling location in 2020 carbon dioxide concentration increases even at the deepest depths were much less than in 2006 being approximately 4 8 maximum oxygen and carbon dioxide concentration gradients were estimated to be 2 6 m and 2 2 m respectively in october 2020 table 2 4 2 3 nszd rates if diffusion coefficients are deemed similar at these two sampling times soil depth profile gradients would imply 3 6 based on carbon dioxide and oxygen times higher nszd rates in 2006 compared to 2020 i e 14 years later the absence of significant methane after 14 years is also notable oxygen gradients are converted to nszd rates in table 2 based on previously calculated diffusion coefficients in section 3 4 and that hydrocarbon degradation stoichiometry is equivalent to octane at d 1 nszd rates in 2006 16 000 49 000 l ha y were estimated as 3 5 6 2 times higher than that recently in 2020 2600 14 000 l ha y notably in 2020 the maximum of the range of rates was still lower than the minimum nzsd rate in 2006 4 3 diesel site d 2 data from 1994 at the d 2 site in 1994 diesel lnapl mass in cores ranged from 18 to 42 kg m2 with a peak concentration of 170 g kg johnston and patterson 1994 two depth profiles shown in fig 6 have peak concentrations up to 100 g kg with the peak concentrations occurring at or immediately above the water table at the time the lnapl depth distribution in these cores had a vertical thickness of 0 7 0 9 m oxygen and carbon dioxide profiles from two of the multilevel samplers y8 y15 at the site prior to instigation of bioventing activities are shown in fig 6 no methane was detected in gas samples decreasing oxygen concentrations with depth were observed at all eight multilevel sampler y locations the oxygen concentration at the deepest sampling port 4 1 m below ground varied spatially across the site with 1 3 at y8 10 and y14 6 at y11 12 and about 10 in y7 and y15 as such locations y8 and y15 fig 6b span the range of gas profiles observed carbon dioxide concentrations at the deepest ports were up to 17 6 approximate oxygen gradients were in the range 2 5 4 9 m and carbon dioxide had a range of 1 8 4 4 m these are lower than the gradients observed in 2006 at d 1 but higher than those observed in 2020 at d 1 these are mirrored in nszd rates table 2 which show that rates at site d 2 in 1994 were 7800 23 000 l ha y which are about half those estimated for 2006 at d 1 but still higher than those in 2020 4 4 gasoline site g 1 comparison over 21 years fig 7a b show soil core and soil gas depth profiles from 1999 and those for 2020 are in fig 7c d 4 4 1 lnapl distribution the gasoline lnapl at g 1 in 1999 had a vertical distribution of approximately 1 05 m across the water table 2 2 3 25 m below ground with a maximum concentration around 90 g kg and specific mass in the profile of 43 kg m2 fig 7c shows a soil core profile from 2020 the gasoline lnapl at g 1 in 2020 had a vertical distribution of approximately 0 75 m across the water table 2 0 2 75 m below ground with a maximum concentration around 40 g kg and specific mass in the profile of 11 kg m2 the specific masses determined for recent soil cores from the site ranged from 5 4 to 9 4 kg m2 in november 2016 to 7 1 and 9 6 kg m2 in november 2017 from the earlier site wide coring surveys gasoline cores in the vicinity of g 1 showed specific masses of 12 56 kg m2 in 1992 0 26 kg m2 in 2002 and 0 18 kg m2 in 2007 4 4 2 soil gas depth profiles in 1999 fig 7b two sets of soil gas depth profile data are shown to depict seasonal changes between april end of dry season and december end of wet season see davis et al 2005 in both cases oxygen concentrations decreased and carbon dioxide concentrations increased with increasing depth fig 7b significant volatile organic compound voc gas concentrations were seen in the soil gas emanating from the gasoline lnapl in december 1999 the vocs had moved upward to a very shallow depth of about 0 5 m below ground while in april the vocs only moved upward to a depth of about 1 25 m below ground in each case this was also the depth at which oxygen concentrations largely decreased to a zero concentration in the gas phase from fig 7b the oxygen concentration gradients were approximately 13 m in april 1999 and 40 m in december 1999 the carbon dioxide concentration gradients were similar to those for oxygen for the two dates as discussed in davis et al 2005 the difference in gradients is likely to be seasonal wetting of a shallow cemented zone in the soil profile in october 2020 fig 7d at the two multilevel locations sampled vz01 and vz03 different gradients were observed in vz01 the lowest oxygen concentrations of about 3 were measured at the deepest sampling port corresponding to the maximum carbon dioxide concentration of about 17 and a total voc concentration of 1 2 mg l at vz01 these provide gradient estimates of about 17 m however at vz03 effectively zero oxygen and carbon dioxide gradients are observed fig 7d and no vocs were measured 4 4 3 nszd rates using diffusion coefficients estimated in section 3 7 oxygen gradients and hydrocarbon degradation stoichiometry equivalent to octane table 3 summarises nszd rate estimates across these dates nszd rates were comparable or very much higher in 1999 50 000 270 000 l ha y compared to 2020 zero and 120 000 l ha y i e 21 years later the reason for the difference in gradients and hence rates at the two locations vz01 and vz03 is not clear and is undergoing further investigated 4 5 gasoline site g 2 40 m east of g 1 at the g 2 site cores recovered in 2008 9 showed residual lnapl gasoline with peak masses of about 40 g kg saturations up to 0 13 and distributed over a 0 6 m depth interval from the top of the capillary fringe to below the water table fig 8a the water table was approximately 2 1 2 6 m below ground over the period the specific mass was 10 11 kg m2 this is a narrower vertical lnapl distribution and a lower peak lnapl concentration than the 1999 cores from the g 1 site but similar to the 2020 core data see fig 7a c gas profiles from multilevel samplers in august 2009 prior to biosparging commencing showed marginal oxygen concentration depletion and carbon dioxide production over the 2 m depth profile fig 8b gradients are approximately 1 m and no methane was observed the gradients and nszd rates table 3 are much lower than those a decade earlier 4 6 synthesis and discussion for diesel nszd rates in 1994 and 2006 were both high compared to 2020 with those in 2006 twice those of 1994 in 2020 maximum and minimum diesel nszd rates were notably lower by 50 70 than rates in 1994 the 2006 d 1 nszd rates if applied over the 14 y to 2020 would estimate specific mass reductions of 15 48 kg m2 the specific mass measured in 2020 was only 13 kg m2 less than that measured in 2005 implying a lower rate of nszd on average over the period the d 2 1994 nszd rates if applied over the 26 y to 2020 would estimate specific mass reductions of 13 42 kg m2 which is comparable to the range of specific mass observed in 1994 table 2 implying that at that rate at that location the entire mass would likely be depleted for gasoline nszd rates in 1999 were consistently high with nszd rates more than an order of magnitude lower a decade later in 2009 nszd rates in 2020 were variable at the two locations with an extreme range of zero depletion at one location and 8 2 kg m2 y at the other if the lowest 1999 nszd rate of 3 5 kg m2 y table 3 was assumed to apply over the 21 y to 2020 it estimates a specific mass reduction of 74 kg m2 this is much greater than the specific mass estimates in table 3 and the mean specific masses estimated for gasoline from the site wide coring 15 24 kg m2 and even the maximum specific masses for each site wide coring event 37 62 kg m2 the implication is that at the 1999 nszd rate all gasoline mass would have been removed some time ago regardless we continue to observe 11 kg m2 in 2020 about 26 of the mass measured in 1999 there are a number of caveats on the assessment here the soil gas depth profile method adopted relies on soil gas concentrations being largely at steady state and also that advective gas movement is not significant over the vadose zone depth profile its is know that barometric pressure changes can affect soil gases however this is typically the case for deep vadose zones young et al 2013 here the vadose zones thicknesses are around 5 m and less measurements shown in fig 5 of davis et al 2005 taken at g 1 in 1999 2000 depicted continuous soil oxygen and volatile organic compound voc concentrations measured using online probes patterson and davis 2008 patterson et al 2000 at ground surface and buried at 0 5 m 1 0 m and 2 25 m depths below ground over a 2 month period the online data showed no evidence of sharp soil gas concentrations changes due to barometric or other effects similarly limited variability of vocs at the 2 25 m depth online probe immediately above the lnapl showed no evidence of methane ebullition which would have caused spikes in the concentration in that part of the vadose zone as such advective influences on soil gas depth profiles seemed small soil moisture will change seasonally leading to some variations in diffusion coefficients and hence nszd rates however we have accommodated a range here section 3 7 and the sandy vadose zone across the site limits the occurrence of extremely high soil moisture contents seasonal water level changes will yield more or less exposure of the top of the lnapl profile to gases in the vadose zone and to enable release of produced gases from the lnapl zone the low oxygen and carbon dioxide gradients in 2006 at g 2 may have been due to lack of access to the lnapl or volatiles from the lnapl especially at the maximum water table that seemed to largely cover most of the depth profile of the lnapl at the time fig 8a however regardless of the soil moisture status or the water table height davis et al 2005 saw very high oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production from degradation of gasoline at this site in 1999 fig 7b when considering seasonal changes sihota et al 2016 found a 60 higher rate in summer than the annual average but this appears more related to temperature changes long term regardless of seasonal and shorter term transients e g fig 2 both the lnapl saturation and composition will change johnston et al 2007 devaull et al 2020 reduction in lnapl saturation and mass leads to reduced lnapl mobility and its reduced visibility as a product thickness in wells fig 9 shows lnapl thickness in a well near the gasoline site area over an 18 year period thicknesses fluctuate seasonally as expected over the 1998 2008 period but the thicknesses decrease to zero beyond 2008 showing reduced overall saturation and mobility of the lnapl at this location consistent with reducing lnapl mass over this period it also confirms the observation of negligible ongoing releases or additions of lnapl mass to the subsurface near g 1 g 2 or g 3 note that in the same area steffy et al 2005 saw sharp transitions between 0 mm and 300 mm in wells this is consistent with the observations in fig 9 despite such fluctuations and changes even entrapped or residual lnapl can have substantial mass and be available for biodegradation if compositionally it has degradable fractions at the d 1 site after 12 months of periodic biosparging in july 2006 aug 2007 after the time of the june 2006 data reported here the diesel composition was shown to change with substantial removal of n alkanes pristane and total aromatics johnston et al 2008 this might be expected of an aggressive aerobic biosparging strategy as was also found at the d 2 site after active bioventing for 14 months davis et al 1999 in that case diesel saturations were dramatically reduced at selected locations within the d 2 site where both nutrients and periodic aeration above the water table was undertaken davis et al 1999 for the d 1 site lnapl showed variable relative abundances of dimethylnaphthalenes and other biodegradable hydrocarbons in 2020 indicating that the region of the d 1 diesel site had not been entirely depleted of otherwise biodegradable compounds this does not in itself explain the relatively low 2020 diesel nszd rates we also note the relative absence of methane in soil gas in 2020 compared to 36 in 2005 again a strong indicator of diminishing nszd rates in 2020 and for the gasoline site the relatively low concentrations of vocs in 2020 compared to 1999 5 conclusions for a shallow sandy aquifer nszd rates are presented at three individual times across 26 years for diesel 1994 2006 2020 and 21 years for gasoline 1999 2009 2020 the measurements are couched in the context of lnapl mass coring surveys in 1992 2002 and 2007 across a 100 ha area of the site to maintain consistency over the extended period nszd rates are calculated using a single nszd measurement methodology that is oxygen and carbon dioxide soil gas depth profiles obtained in each of the years at the diesel location nszd rates from gas depth profiles are shown to be significantly lower in 2020 compared to earlier measurements for the gasoline site recent estimates from two installations span the ranges of high rates seen 21 years ago and very low rates observed more recently if the maximum rates observed 21 26 years ago were assumed to be constant over that time to 2020 little gasoline would be currently present on site and diesel mass would be more significantly depleted than observed most recently in 2020 core data in reality lnapl nszd rates will vary due to many factors and may at times be zero order constant over time first order be proportional to the lnapl or oxygen concentration follow monod kinetics allowing multiple reactions and inhibiting effects or some other trends lnapl compositional changes variable soil moisture and other features will alter rates the relative effects of such influencing factors need greater investigation despite some variability the data provide validation of the notion that nszd degradation rates alter over time and point to the need to be able to reliably estimate nszd rates in future years perhaps over decades an nszd modelling platform recently validated against data from the bemidji site sookhak lari et al 2022 promises to provide that predictive capacity to reduce uncertainties several aspects warrant future investigation i systematic side by side evaluation of different nszd estimation methods beyond those of the soil gas gradient method including use of pre existing wells and infrastructure at sites versus specially installed and buried infrastructure ii further investigation of transient variations using online sensors and probes oxygen carbon dioxide methane temperature soil moisture to compare and validate manual measurements iii evaluation of nszd during remedial activities to better define relative mass loss estimates during such activities iv progress lnapl compositional changes as a holistic and direct measure of lnapl mass losses v documented nszd estimates and trends for a range of hydrocarbon types e g crude vs gasoline vs diesel vs aviation gasoline credit authorship contribution

1295,long term estimates of natural source zone depletion nszd rates for petroleum lnapl light non aqueous phase liquid sites are not available one off measurements are often thought valid over the lifetime of lnapl sites in the context of site wide lnapl mass estimates we report site specific gasoline and diesel nszd rates spanning 21 26 years using depth profiles of soil gases oxygen carbon dioxide methane volatiles above lnapl nszd rates were estimated in 1994 2006 and 2020 for diesel and 1999 2009 and 2020 for gasoline each date also had soil core mass estimates which together with nszd rates allow estimation of the longevity for lnapl presence site wide coring in 1992 2002 2007 estimated lnapl mass reductions of 12 000 t for diesel nszd the ratio of nszd rates for 2006 16 000 49 000 l ha y to those in 2020 2600 14 000 l ha y was 3 6 by 2020 the 1994 diesel nszd rates would have predicted the entire removal of measured mass 16 42 kg m2 for gasoline nszd rates in 1999 were extremely high 50 000 270 000 l ha y but 9 27 times lower 5800 10 000 l ha y a decade later the gasoline nszd rates in 1999 predicted near complete mass removal in 2 12 years but 10 11 kg m2 was measured 10 and 21 years later which is 26 of the initial mass in 1999 the outcomes substantiate the need to understand nszd rate changes over the lifetime of lnapl impacted sites graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords natural source zone depletion lnapl transient diesel gasoline petroleum 1 introduction natural source zone depletion nszd of light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl petroleum in subsurface soil and groundwater systems is gaining increasing acceptance as an lnapl impacted site management option itrc 2018 cl aire 2019 crc care 2020 the underlying processes have been well summarised in two reasonably recent reviews garg et al 2017 sookhak lari et al 2019 and expanded upon by smith et al 2022 the two reviews brought together literature and understanding spanning over 30 years combining features of lnapl movement sookhak lari et al 2016 tomlinson et al 2017 lenhard et al 2017 lnapl partitioning to groundwater and soil gas phases lang et al 2009 lekmine et al 2017

2005 linking a number of these features together was largely birthed at two sites that have undergone detailed investigation the bemidji minnesota crude oil release site chaplin et al 2002 amos et al 2005 molins et al 2010 and the guadalupe oil field site in california lundegard and johnson 2006 johnson et al 2006 both reported significant biodegradation in the vadose zone at these lnapl impacted sites compared to groundwater natural attenuation rates here we report novel outcomes from the kwinana site western australia which also has a long history of investigation some contend that nszd of lnapl as a management option is applicable only after significant efforts have been undertaken at sites to maximise the removal of lnapl mass the so called endpoint of active lnapl remedial efforts sookhak lari et al 2018 sookhak lari et al 2020 while others argue that nszd occurs from the time of an lnapl release into a subsurface environment and as such may be applicable as a management option at any stage deciding the applicability of nszd as an lnapl site management option is outlined in guidance by itrc 2018 and crc care 2020 such guidance is supported by technical measurement guidance itrc 2009 api 2017 crc care 2018 and case studies providing current measures of nszd rates rayner et al 2020 despite this significant uncertainty remains regarding the best nszd measurement methods to use at sites the cost effectiveness and practicability of nszd methods the sustainability of nszd and long term nszd rates at sites and the role of nszd in reducing site risks sites can have a range of geologies and stratigraphy product types subsurface biogeochemistry and infrastructure that may induce or impede nszd smith et al 2021 assessing such variability in six australian case studies rayner et al 2020 reported a wide range of nszd rates with broad nszd estimates across measurement techniques at the same location on some sites kulkarni et al 2020 and eichert et al 2017 also conducted intercomparisons of nszd estimation techniques at single sites with both studies finding that nszd rates varied spatially and seasonally despite the body of knowledge most investigations do not have access to estimates of nszd rates over the period of lnapl weathering or regulatory concern typically multiple decades sihota et al 2016 investigated seasonal trends in nszd rates and showed that summer rates were about 60 above annual averages liu 2004 outlined laboratory based studies to accelerate weathering and aging in the laboratory to estimate the longevity of nszd rates these have been adopted in itrc 2009 also compositional changes and fingerprinting during mass loss johnston et al 2007 devaull et al 2020 rayner et al 2020 show that variations in composition occur leading to nszd rate changes despite this direct field estimates of nszd over decades are lacking here we investigate temporal trends in lnapl mass for an entire site and nszd rates for individual diesel d 1 and d 2 and gasoline g 1and g 2 locations within the kwinana site fig 1 these investigations spanned 26 years to avoid uncertainties associated with using different nszd rate measurement methodologies at different times kulkarni et al 2020 the same method was employed at each of the measurement periods the method used was soil gas depth profiling through the vadose zone from installed multilevel soil gas samplers this allows nszd rates to be determined from oxygen carbon dioxide methane or other volatile organic compound voc depth profiles in soil gas in the vadose zone nszd rates have been determined somewhat standardly from such gas profiles as described in a number of technical guidance documents and other literature itrc 2009 api 2017 crc care 2018 verginelli and baciocchi 2021 and for petroleum vapour biodegradation studies lahvis et al 1999 davis et al 2009 coring at the sites of the soil gas profiling measurements allowed nszd estimates to be evaluated against lnapl distribution and soil profile properties over the same period as these soil gas profiling measurements three site wide coring campaigns were undertaken fig 1 to further allow estimation of depth alignment and lnapl mass longevity 2 site description the kwinana site is a 343 ha coastal petroleum handling site located 50 km south of perth western australia it has had multiple historic lnapl petroleum releases of crude diesel gasoline aviation gasoline and other petroleum product types over nearly 70 years the site has a mediterranean climate with cool wet winters and hot dry summers the annual average rainfall 1991 2020 is 716 5 mm australian bureau of meteorology station no 9194 predominately falling between may and october the notional stratigraphy to 14 m below ground is shown in fig 2a along with particle size distributions over the depth interval 2 4 m below ground typical of the near water table zone in fig 2b the water table across the site is typically 2 5 5 0 m below ground with an annual fluctuation due to seasonal rainfall of up to 0 9 m predominantly groundwater flow is towards the north west the soil profile and surficial aquifer consists of a sequence of aeolian and littoral calcareous sands sometimes thin carbonate cemented layers are encountered in the vadose zone creamy tan coloured sands typically extend to 2 to 3 m below ground where a change to grey coloured sand occurs down to the depth of the bottom of the sand sequence a basal clay aquitard between the overlying sands and the tamala limestone aquifer beneath is absent in parts of the site the sands typically have low organic matter content i e fraction of organic carbon 0 03 particle sizes fig 2b show layering in the safety bay sands in the vicinity of the water table johnston et al 1998 provide a more detailed description the relatively permeable surficial sands allow for relatively rapid downward infiltration of water subsurface migration of hydrocarbons as well as the exchange of soil and atmospheric gases locally the shallow soil profile at site d 1 fig 1 was noted to consist of fine medium calcareous sand with a water table 3 7 4 2 m below ground in 2005 2007 johnston et al 2008 and 3 7 4 2 m below ground in 2020 the g 1 site was noted to consist of leached aeolian calcareous sand with variably cemented layers and a pronounced shallow cemented limestone layer at some locations davis et al 2005 the water table was 2 5 3 3 m below ground in 1999 and 2 3 3 0 m below ground in 2020 in well lnapl thicknesses can be strongly influenced by water table elevation steffy et al 1998 which rises in response to strongly winter dominant rainfall on site fig 3 shows a particularly sharp contrast in lnapl thicknesses from well measurements between april and may 2005 due to a rainfall totalling over 200 mm in may more than twice the long term average leading to a significant rise in the water table over this short period peak lnapl thicknesses in wells decreased from 800 to 900 mm to 400 500 mm in 2005 2007 diesel lnapl at d 1 showed thicknesses in wells up to 0 6 m seasonally and 0 17 m on 4th june 2020 gasoline lnapl showed thicknesses in wells up to 0 4 m seasonally in 1995 steffy et al 1995 at site g 3 and effectively zero in 2020 3 approach and methodology two primary scales of investigation are outlined here 1 three site wide coring campaigns are described for 1992 2002 and 2007 whereby lnapl masses are estimated to provide context for nszd rates 2 nszd rate estimates at individual locations specific to diesel and gasoline lnapl petroleum types comparing nszd rate estimates spanning a period of up to 26 years noting that no new lnapl releases occurred locally to these sites in the intervening periods specific investigations at each of the diesel d 1 and d 2 and gasoline g 1 and g 2 locations at each time included soil coring to determine lnapl concentration mass and its vertical distribution and soil gas depth profile data to calculate nszd rates fig 4 shows the timeline of investigations and whether investigations primarily yielded site wide lnapl mass estimates or a local nszd rate for diesel or gasoline on sites at each of the local sites lnapl mass from soil coring was also determined at the time diesel nszd rates are estimated from 1994 2006 and 2020 data with those from 2006 and 2020 at the same location d 1 fig 1 gasoline nszd rates are estimated from 1999 april december 2009 and 2020 data with those from 1999 and 2020 at the same location g 1 fig 1 and those from 2009 located 40 m to the east g 2 fig 1 note that the 1994 95 diesel 2005 06 diesel and the 2008 09 gasoline nszd rates were not affected by the bioventing biosparging processes referenced in fig 4 all estimates were based on measurements taken prior to active bioventing biosparging occurring 3 1 site wide coring and lnapl sampling campaigns site wide coring campaigns spanning 15 years were undertaken in 1992 2002 and 2007 the aim of which was to estimate the total mass of lnapl at the site coring locations for a portion of the site are shown in fig 1 additionally in 2005 lnapl samples were recovered from 100 wells across the site and analysis was undertaken to determine the spatial distribution of different product types in combination with the coring survey masses product distributions for diesel and gasoline were used to obtain specific mass estimate ranges for gasoline and diesel and an indication of their total masses at the site the core locations from each sampling campaign are shown in fig 1 polygons were placed across the site relative to cores with non zero lnapl mass and the area of the polygons were used to estimate the area represented by the lnapl core mass 100 ha and those for diesel 30 ha and gasoline 14 ha these were then summed to give a total lnapl mass and a diesel and gasoline mass for each of the dates 1992 2002 and 2007 3 2 diesel site investigations the location of the two diesel sites d 1 and d 2 are noted on fig 1 an initial investigation was conducted at d 1 in 2005 2007 to evaluate biosparging periodic air injection below the water table and lnapl impacted zone as a technique to biodegrade diesel lnapl in situ johnston et al 2008 nszd investigations were undertaken at the same site in 2020 to enable the comparison of nszd rates over a 14 year period at diesel site d 2 in situ bioventing aeration above the water table was investigated in 1994 as a remedial strategy for highly weathered diesel rao et al 1996 davis et al 1998b 2013 this site provides a historic reference point 26 years prior to the 2020 investigations for measurement of nszd rates for weathered diesel lnapl although in the same geological and topographical setting d 2 is 400 m distant from d 1 and had a different history of diesel release as such although relevant to diesel rates on site it was not deemed directly comparable to the diesel nszd rates at d 1 for the d 2 site cores were recovered and analysed and eight sets of multilevel samplers y7 y12 y14 y15 were installed within a 300 m2 area in 1994 davis et al 2013 each multilevel sampler had 7 sampling ports from 0 5 m to 4 1 m below ground surface the bottom few sampling ports were at the top or within the zone where lnapl was measured in the soil profile gas samples presented herein were recovered from prior to instigation of air injection to commence bioventing activities at the d 1 site three soil cores were recovered in 2005 and multilevel soil gas samplers were installed each with sampling ports at approximately 0 5 m depth intervals gases were sampled in 2006 from the multilevel samplers to determine depth profiles prior to any aeration occurring in 2019 2020 at the same d 1 diesel site cores were recovered and new multilevel gas samplers were installed at 0 25 m and then at 0 5 m depth intervals from 0 5 m to 4 5 m below ground gas samples collected from the vadose zone sampling ports were analysed for methane ch4 volatile organic compounds vocs and the major gases nitrogen n2 oxygen o2 carbon dioxide co2 3 3 gasoline site investigations at the gasoline g 1 site fig 1 investigations commenced in 1997 to quantify the behaviour of vapours in a variable soil profile davis et al 1998a 2001 2005 additional gasoline biosparging investigations were also conducted in 2009 approximately 40 m east of this location at site g 2 johnston et al 2011 and in close proximity to field investigations of steffy et al 1995 denoted g 3 on fig 1 soil gas and lnapl profile data from 1997 are presented in davis et al 1998a and those for 1999 are in davis et al 2005 for these earlier studies and in 2019 2020 soil cores were recovered and multilevel gas samplers with sampling ports at approximately 0 25 to 0 5 m depth intervals were installed to sample soil gases and vapours for the 2019 2020 study data from two primary multilevel samplers are reported 3 4 multilevel samplers typically multilevel samplers consisted of 3 25 mm diameter nylon tubing id 2 0 mm with a 3 2 mm to 6 35 mm nylon swagelok reducer fitting installed as a screen area 31 7 mm2 a stainless steel mesh was inserted in the opening to prevent soil from entering the tubing multilevel samplers at set depth intervals were bundled together on a central pvc support and subsequent to hand auguring or drilling to the deepest required depth were inserted into the soil profile drill spoils were backfilled into the hole no sealants such as bentonite were used to ensure gas exchange with the atmosphere the multilevel samplers have been shown to provide reliable and discrete interval depth profile data across numerous studies davis et al 2005 and compared to in situ sensors patterson and davis 2008 a similar soil gas sampling methodology was deployed over all sites and studies soil gases were sampled from multilevel samplers located above the water table and capillary fringe at the time of sampling air tight syringes 50 ml plastic were used to initially purge three volumes of the multilevel sample line before collecting a sample for major gas methane analysis sampled using in line 3 way taps and plastic syringes and vocs sampled using in line 3 way taps and glass barrelled syringes major gas methane samples were sealed with in line 3 way taps and either analysed on site or transported back to the laboratory for analysis the following day samples for voc analyses had an internal standard fluorobenzene added and were either analysed directly or transferred to glass vials and sealed for analysis using an autosampler sample integrity was evaluated using a range of approaches including internal standard abundance for voc samples duplicate field samples comparison of field and laboratory measurements blank samples and control samples 3 5 coring coring to determine lnapl mass for the site wide coring programs was undertaken using two methods i the use of hydraulically driven coring equipment and ii the use of a hand auger and aluminium push tube driven into the subsurface with a manually powered slide hammer coring was undertaken near continuously from 0 to 5 m below ground level in the 1992 2002 and 2007 campaigns 162 156 and 132 cores were recovered respectively from each core approximately 13 subsamples were taken for analysis at shallower depths where lnapl was deemed not to be present or at low concentrations subsamples consisted of composites across 1 m intervals through the zone of lnapl contamination more detailed subsampling was undertaken with depth intervals of 0 10 or 0 15 m soil subsamples 10 g wet weight were placed in capped 40 ml vials kept cool and delivered to a commercial laboratory for hydrocarbon analysis prior to 2020 site specific soil cores were recovered in two or three continuous sections over the soil profile by pushing an aluminium tube into the soil to a depth below the extent of contamination typically 1 0 to 1 5 m below the water table davis et al 2005 cores collected in august 2020 were sampled using a direct push drill rig geoprobe 7822dt cores taken using the drill rig were collected in 1 5 m long 48 mm diameter plastic core liners during drilling a low suction was applied to the top of the coring tube to avoid losses or slumping of cores materials prior to recovery at ground surface core subsamples 5 cm long were taken in the field to minimise the loss of volatiles and also to avoid redistribution of fluids in the core i e lnapl water air typically all fluid volumes we measured in subsamples of cores and validated with depth against the elevation of the water table at the time of coring this provided additional surety that cored material was not unduly displaced during recovery most subsamples were taken across the lnapl impacted zone with samples taken above and below to confirm the absence of lnapl subsamples were sealed in pre weighed tins chilled and transported back to the laboratory within 24 h of core collection a subsample 3 5 g for total petroleum hydrocarbon tph analysis was collected in a sealable screwcap vial from each core depth interval using a stainless steel corer with the extraction solvent being added immediately 3 6 site specific analytical methods all site specific analyses were performed in house at csiro perth laboratories for major gases and methane gas chromatography gc with a thermal conductivity detector tcd and a flame ionisation detector fid methane only were used volatile organic compounds c4 to c15 including benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes btex were analysed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms operating in full scan mode concentrations were calculated based on external and internal standards added at the time of collection prepared in the same manner as the samples soil core sub samples were extracted using a solvent containing deuterated internal standards the samples were extracted using tumbling and the solvent extract removed after tumbling using a pipette providing a sample for gc fid and gc ms analyses quantitation of tph was performed by gc fid and quantitation of selected components was carried out using gc ms using external and internal standards prepared in the same manner as the samples 3 7 nszd calculation method oxygen and carbon dioxide soil gas depth profile concentrations relative to those at ground surface approximately 21 o2 in air and 0 co2 in air were used to estimate concentration gradients as input to oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production rate estimates nszd rates were estimated from oxygen consumption rates using relevant diffusion coefficients and stoichiometry e g crc care 2018 as the nszd rates are used for within site comparisons they are not corrected for natural soil respiration a background site also showed effectively zero oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production effective diffusion coefficients def were calculated using the millington and quirk 1961 approximation d ef d a θ a 3 3 θ t 2 using estimates of soil total porosity θ t and air filled porosity θ a from the site and oxygen and carbon dioxide diffusion coefficients in air d a taken as 0 175 cm2 s and 0 16 cm2 s respectively from soil cores at the diesel d 2 site davis et al 2013 reported θ t of 0 4 0 5 m3 m3 and θ a of 0 25 0 4 m3 m3 d ef is then calculated to be in the range 1 1 3 3 10 6 m2 s for oxygen and 1 0 3 0 10 6 m2 s for carbon dioxide similarly from soil core information at the gasoline g 1 site reported in davis et al 2005 total θ t were 0 47 0 48 m3 m3 and θ a were 0 35 0 41 m3 m3 for the bulk of the soil profile giving d ef in the range 2 3 4 1 10 6 m2 s for oxygen and 2 1 3 7 10 6 m2 s for carbon dioxide whilst soil moisture will change seasonally e g davis et al 2005 these values are taken as representative of conditions on site for comparative purposes primarily oxygen diffusion coefficients will be used in the paper 4 results and discussion 4 1 site wide lnapl mass across the three site wide coring events the mean and maximum specific masses were between 36 kg m2 and 42 kg m2 and 160 kg m2 and 360 mg m2 respectively table 1 cores with zero mass represented between 34 and 40 of the number of cores collected overall the total lnapl mass was estimated to reduce from 40 000 t in 1992 to 31 000 t in 2002 and to 28 000 t in 2007 a 12 000 t decrease over 15 y table 1 the product with the largest mass was degraded diesel 12 000 17 000 t with gasoline being 1700 3000 t interestingly total diesel and gasoline product types showed mass decreases of 30 over the decade between 1992 and 2002 but did not show significant change for the following 5 year period mean specific masses for diesel decreased from 68 kg m2 in 1992 to 51 kg m2 in 2007 table 1 higher than the site wide mean values across all product types 36 42 kg m2 mean specific masses for gasoline decreased from 24 kg m2 for 1992 to 15 19 kg m2 for 2002 2007 all lower than the site wide mean specific mass values across all product types there have been lnapl recovery efforts at the site since before 1992 but estimates of recovery are uncertain due to water entrainment in liquid recovery systems and other confounding factors lnapl recovery has been estimated to be 5000 t since 1992 4 2 diesel site d 1 comparison over 14 years prior to a 14 month biosparging field trial in 2006 2007 johnston et al 2008 measured the data shown in fig 5a b data for the same site in 2020 are shown in fig 5c d 4 2 1 lnapl distribution in 2005 the diesel lnapl fig 5a had a vertical distribution of approximately 1 3 m across the water table with peak mass up to 75 g kg and a saturation up to 0 35 and specific mass in the profile of 64 kg m2 in 2020 the diesel lnapl fig 5c had a similar vertical depth distribution to that in 2005 of approximately 1 5 m across the water table but with a higher peak concentration of approximately 200 g kg and specific mass in the profile of 51 kg m2 the specific mass of cores recently recovered from this site ranged from 81 kg m2 in september 2016 to 45 and 71 kg m2 for two cores recovered in november 2017 from the earlier site wide coring surveys diesel cores in the vicinity of d 1 showed specific masses of 1 29 kg m2 in 1992 0 141 kg m2 in 2002 and 0 53 kg m2 in 2007 4 2 2 soil gas depth profiles in 2006 fig 5b oxygen concentrations decreased and carbon dioxide concentrations increased with increasing depth notably a high methane concentration 36 was measured at a depth of 3 75 m below ground near to the depth of the zone of lnapl impact from fig 5b the oxygen and carbon dioxide concentration gradients were approximately 8 8 m and 6 2 m respectively at that time in 2020 fig 5d marginal decreases in oxygen concentrations are observed over the depth profile with no methane observed in these depth profiles we note however the occurrence of 5 methane in a soil gas sample at 3 5 m depth from a nearby sampling location in 2020 carbon dioxide concentration increases even at the deepest depths were much less than in 2006 being approximately 4 8 maximum oxygen and carbon dioxide concentration gradients were estimated to be 2 6 m and 2 2 m respectively in october 2020 table 2 4 2 3 nszd rates if diffusion coefficients are deemed similar at these two sampling times soil depth profile gradients would imply 3 6 based on carbon dioxide and oxygen times higher nszd rates in 2006 compared to 2020 i e 14 years later the absence of significant methane after 14 years is also notable oxygen gradients are converted to nszd rates in table 2 based on previously calculated diffusion coefficients in section 3 4 and that hydrocarbon degradation stoichiometry is equivalent to octane at d 1 nszd rates in 2006 16 000 49 000 l ha y were estimated as 3 5 6 2 times higher than that recently in 2020 2600 14 000 l ha y notably in 2020 the maximum of the range of rates was still lower than the minimum nzsd rate in 2006 4 3 diesel site d 2 data from 1994 at the d 2 site in 1994 diesel lnapl mass in cores ranged from 18 to 42 kg m2 with a peak concentration of 170 g kg johnston and patterson 1994 two depth profiles shown in fig 6 have peak concentrations up to 100 g kg with the peak concentrations occurring at or immediately above the water table at the time the lnapl depth distribution in these cores had a vertical thickness of 0 7 0 9 m oxygen and carbon dioxide profiles from two of the multilevel samplers y8 y15 at the site prior to instigation of bioventing activities are shown in fig 6 no methane was detected in gas samples decreasing oxygen concentrations with depth were observed at all eight multilevel sampler y locations the oxygen concentration at the deepest sampling port 4 1 m below ground varied spatially across the site with 1 3 at y8 10 and y14 6 at y11 12 and about 10 in y7 and y15 as such locations y8 and y15 fig 6b span the range of gas profiles observed carbon dioxide concentrations at the deepest ports were up to 17 6 approximate oxygen gradients were in the range 2 5 4 9 m and carbon dioxide had a range of 1 8 4 4 m these are lower than the gradients observed in 2006 at d 1 but higher than those observed in 2020 at d 1 these are mirrored in nszd rates table 2 which show that rates at site d 2 in 1994 were 7800 23 000 l ha y which are about half those estimated for 2006 at d 1 but still higher than those in 2020 4 4 gasoline site g 1 comparison over 21 years fig 7a b show soil core and soil gas depth profiles from 1999 and those for 2020 are in fig 7c d 4 4 1 lnapl distribution the gasoline lnapl at g 1 in 1999 had a vertical distribution of approximately 1 05 m across the water table 2 2 3 25 m below ground with a maximum concentration around 90 g kg and specific mass in the profile of 43 kg m2 fig 7c shows a soil core profile from 2020 the gasoline lnapl at g 1 in 2020 had a vertical distribution of approximately 0 75 m across the water table 2 0 2 75 m below ground with a maximum concentration around 40 g kg and specific mass in the profile of 11 kg m2 the specific masses determined for recent soil cores from the site ranged from 5 4 to 9 4 kg m2 in november 2016 to 7 1 and 9 6 kg m2 in november 2017 from the earlier site wide coring surveys gasoline cores in the vicinity of g 1 showed specific masses of 12 56 kg m2 in 1992 0 26 kg m2 in 2002 and 0 18 kg m2 in 2007 4 4 2 soil gas depth profiles in 1999 fig 7b two sets of soil gas depth profile data are shown to depict seasonal changes between april end of dry season and december end of wet season see davis et al 2005 in both cases oxygen concentrations decreased and carbon dioxide concentrations increased with increasing depth fig 7b significant volatile organic compound voc gas concentrations were seen in the soil gas emanating from the gasoline lnapl in december 1999 the vocs had moved upward to a very shallow depth of about 0 5 m below ground while in april the vocs only moved upward to a depth of about 1 25 m below ground in each case this was also the depth at which oxygen concentrations largely decreased to a zero concentration in the gas phase from fig 7b the oxygen concentration gradients were approximately 13 m in april 1999 and 40 m in december 1999 the carbon dioxide concentration gradients were similar to those for oxygen for the two dates as discussed in davis et al 2005 the difference in gradients is likely to be seasonal wetting of a shallow cemented zone in the soil profile in october 2020 fig 7d at the two multilevel locations sampled vz01 and vz03 different gradients were observed in vz01 the lowest oxygen concentrations of about 3 were measured at the deepest sampling port corresponding to the maximum carbon dioxide concentration of about 17 and a total voc concentration of 1 2 mg l at vz01 these provide gradient estimates of about 17 m however at vz03 effectively zero oxygen and carbon dioxide gradients are observed fig 7d and no vocs were measured 4 4 3 nszd rates using diffusion coefficients estimated in section 3 7 oxygen gradients and hydrocarbon degradation stoichiometry equivalent to octane table 3 summarises nszd rate estimates across these dates nszd rates were comparable or very much higher in 1999 50 000 270 000 l ha y compared to 2020 zero and 120 000 l ha y i e 21 years later the reason for the difference in gradients and hence rates at the two locations vz01 and vz03 is not clear and is undergoing further investigated 4 5 gasoline site g 2 40 m east of g 1 at the g 2 site cores recovered in 2008 9 showed residual lnapl gasoline with peak masses of about 40 g kg saturations up to 0 13 and distributed over a 0 6 m depth interval from the top of the capillary fringe to below the water table fig 8a the water table was approximately 2 1 2 6 m below ground over the period the specific mass was 10 11 kg m2 this is a narrower vertical lnapl distribution and a lower peak lnapl concentration than the 1999 cores from the g 1 site but similar to the 2020 core data see fig 7a c gas profiles from multilevel samplers in august 2009 prior to biosparging commencing showed marginal oxygen concentration depletion and carbon dioxide production over the 2 m depth profile fig 8b gradients are approximately 1 m and no methane was observed the gradients and nszd rates table 3 are much lower than those a decade earlier 4 6 synthesis and discussion for diesel nszd rates in 1994 and 2006 were both high compared to 2020 with those in 2006 twice those of 1994 in 2020 maximum and minimum diesel nszd rates were notably lower by 50 70 than rates in 1994 the 2006 d 1 nszd rates if applied over the 14 y to 2020 would estimate specific mass reductions of 15 48 kg m2 the specific mass measured in 2020 was only 13 kg m2 less than that measured in 2005 implying a lower rate of nszd on average over the period the d 2 1994 nszd rates if applied over the 26 y to 2020 would estimate specific mass reductions of 13 42 kg m2 which is comparable to the range of specific mass observed in 1994 table 2 implying that at that rate at that location the entire mass would likely be depleted for gasoline nszd rates in 1999 were consistently high with nszd rates more than an order of magnitude lower a decade later in 2009 nszd rates in 2020 were variable at the two locations with an extreme range of zero depletion at one location and 8 2 kg m2 y at the other if the lowest 1999 nszd rate of 3 5 kg m2 y table 3 was assumed to apply over the 21 y to 2020 it estimates a specific mass reduction of 74 kg m2 this is much greater than the specific mass estimates in table 3 and the mean specific masses estimated for gasoline from the site wide coring 15 24 kg m2 and even the maximum specific masses for each site wide coring event 37 62 kg m2 the implication is that at the 1999 nszd rate all gasoline mass would have been removed some time ago regardless we continue to observe 11 kg m2 in 2020 about 26 of the mass measured in 1999 there are a number of caveats on the assessment here the soil gas depth profile method adopted relies on soil gas concentrations being largely at steady state and also that advective gas movement is not significant over the vadose zone depth profile its is know that barometric pressure changes can affect soil gases however this is typically the case for deep vadose zones young et al 2013 here the vadose zones thicknesses are around 5 m and less measurements shown in fig 5 of davis et al 2005 taken at g 1 in 1999 2000 depicted continuous soil oxygen and volatile organic compound voc concentrations measured using online probes patterson and davis 2008 patterson et al 2000 at ground surface and buried at 0 5 m 1 0 m and 2 25 m depths below ground over a 2 month period the online data showed no evidence of sharp soil gas concentrations changes due to barometric or other effects similarly limited variability of vocs at the 2 25 m depth online probe immediately above the lnapl showed no evidence of methane ebullition which would have caused spikes in the concentration in that part of the vadose zone as such advective influences on soil gas depth profiles seemed small soil moisture will change seasonally leading to some variations in diffusion coefficients and hence nszd rates however we have accommodated a range here section 3 7 and the sandy vadose zone across the site limits the occurrence of extremely high soil moisture contents seasonal water level changes will yield more or less exposure of the top of the lnapl profile to gases in the vadose zone and to enable release of produced gases from the lnapl zone the low oxygen and carbon dioxide gradients in 2006 at g 2 may have been due to lack of access to the lnapl or volatiles from the lnapl especially at the maximum water table that seemed to largely cover most of the depth profile of the lnapl at the time fig 8a however regardless of the soil moisture status or the water table height davis et al 2005 saw very high oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production from degradation of gasoline at this site in 1999 fig 7b when considering seasonal changes sihota et al 2016 found a 60 higher rate in summer than the annual average but this appears more related to temperature changes long term regardless of seasonal and shorter term transients e g fig 2 both the lnapl saturation and composition will change johnston et al 2007 devaull et al 2020 reduction in lnapl saturation and mass leads to reduced lnapl mobility and its reduced visibility as a product thickness in wells fig 9 shows lnapl thickness in a well near the gasoline site area over an 18 year period thicknesses fluctuate seasonally as expected over the 1998 2008 period but the thicknesses decrease to zero beyond 2008 showing reduced overall saturation and mobility of the lnapl at this location consistent with reducing lnapl mass over this period it also confirms the observation of negligible ongoing releases or additions of lnapl mass to the subsurface near g 1 g 2 or g 3 note that in the same area steffy et al 2005 saw sharp transitions between 0 mm and 300 mm in wells this is consistent with the observations in fig 9 despite such fluctuations and changes even entrapped or residual lnapl can have substantial mass and be available for biodegradation if compositionally it has degradable fractions at the d 1 site after 12 months of periodic biosparging in july 2006 aug 2007 after the time of the june 2006 data reported here the diesel composition was shown to change with substantial removal of n alkanes pristane and total aromatics johnston et al 2008 this might be expected of an aggressive aerobic biosparging strategy as was also found at the d 2 site after active bioventing for 14 months davis et al 1999 in that case diesel saturations were dramatically reduced at selected locations within the d 2 site where both nutrients and periodic aeration above the water table was undertaken davis et al 1999 for the d 1 site lnapl showed variable relative abundances of dimethylnaphthalenes and other biodegradable hydrocarbons in 2020 indicating that the region of the d 1 diesel site had not been entirely depleted of otherwise biodegradable compounds this does not in itself explain the relatively low 2020 diesel nszd rates we also note the relative absence of methane in soil gas in 2020 compared to 36 in 2005 again a strong indicator of diminishing nszd rates in 2020 and for the gasoline site the relatively low concentrations of vocs in 2020 compared to 1999 5 conclusions for a shallow sandy aquifer nszd rates are presented at three individual times across 26 years for diesel 1994 2006 2020 and 21 years for gasoline 1999 2009 2020 the measurements are couched in the context of lnapl mass coring surveys in 1992 2002 and 2007 across a 100 ha area of the site to maintain consistency over the extended period nszd rates are calculated using a single nszd measurement methodology that is oxygen and carbon dioxide soil gas depth profiles obtained in each of the years at the diesel location nszd rates from gas depth profiles are shown to be significantly lower in 2020 compared to earlier measurements for the gasoline site recent estimates from two installations span the ranges of high rates seen 21 years ago and very low rates observed more recently if the maximum rates observed 21 26 years ago were assumed to be constant over that time to 2020 little gasoline would be currently present on site and diesel mass would be more significantly depleted than observed most recently in 2020 core data in reality lnapl nszd rates will vary due to many factors and may at times be zero order constant over time first order be proportional to the lnapl or oxygen concentration follow monod kinetics allowing multiple reactions and inhibiting effects or some other trends lnapl compositional changes variable soil moisture and other features will alter rates the relative effects of such influencing factors need greater investigation despite some variability the data provide validation of the notion that nszd degradation rates alter over time and point to the need to be able to reliably estimate nszd rates in future years perhaps over decades an nszd modelling platform recently validated against data from the bemidji site sookhak lari et al 2022 promises to provide that predictive capacity to reduce uncertainties several aspects warrant future investigation i systematic side by side evaluation of different nszd estimation methods beyond those of the soil gas gradient method including use of pre existing wells and infrastructure at sites versus specially installed and buried infrastructure ii further investigation of transient variations using online sensors and probes oxygen carbon dioxide methane temperature soil moisture to compare and validate manual measurements iii evaluation of nszd during remedial activities to better define relative mass loss estimates during such activities iv progress lnapl compositional changes as a holistic and direct measure of lnapl mass losses v documented nszd estimates and trends for a range of hydrocarbon types e g crude vs gasoline vs diesel vs aviation gasoline credit authorship contribution

1296,this study aimed to evaluate the degree of groundwater pollution and to assess the contribution of specific ionic sources to groundwater thereby helping to identify the changes in groundwater chemistry and also in groundwater quality from a rural part of telangana india using the comprehensive understanding of geochemical ratios gr pollution index of groundwater pig unmix model um and land use land cover groundwater samples collected 22 from the study area were analysed for ph ec tds ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f the hydrogeochemical diagram showed the dominant groundwater type

chemical composts etc as the secondary anthropogenic sources on the aquifer system changes in groundwater quality from the recharge area to the discharge area and the correlation coefficient of chemical variables further supported the sources of geogenic and anthropogenic origins according to pig s calculations the present study area was classified as the insignificant pollution zone 5 89

which exhibit the tds mg2 na k hco3 cl no3 so4 2 and f contents above the drinking water quality standards this indicates the gradual increase in the intensity of pollution activity um also classified

irrigation return flows and chemical fertilizers gypsum and nitrate and source iii f and hco3 represents the dissolution of fluoride minerals as a major contributor to groundwater chemistry furthermore the land use land cover observations had also supported the assessment of groundwater pollution levels and the contribution of specific ionic sources made by pig and um as a result the present study clearly indicated that groundwater quality of a geogenic origin is primarily overcome the impact of anthropogenic sources therefore the present study suggested strategic measures to control groundwater pollution and improve groundwater quality graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords groundwater geochemical processes anthropogenic sources groundwater pollution index unmix model land use land cover 1 introduction water plays a vital role in the survival of living beings as well as in the economic development of any country however the severe stress on groundwater resources is ever increasing due to the high amount of consumption for the present rapid construction development activities other than drinking agricultural and industrial needs consequently declining groundwater levels and deteriorating groundwater quality have become a serious problem especially in the hard rock aquifers deeapali et al 2012 sonkamble et al 2012 thomas et al 2015 sethy et al 2016 kadam et al 2021 thus groundwater in many parts of the world is detrimental to anthropogenic activities subba rao 2012 ahada and suthar 2019 egbueri 2020 wagh et al 2020 ahmad et al 2021 lack of strict environmental control management measures makes such vulnerable problems which are common in developing countries such as india subba rao 2012 2020 manikandana et al 2020 mukate et al 2020 people in many parts of india are facing groundwater pollution problems especially due to the uncontrolled anthropogenic activity brindha et al 2017 karunanidhi et al 2019 balamurugan et al 2020 gaikwad et al 2020 sakram et al 2022a hence it is necessary to know the specific ionic sources which change the chemistry of groundwater and thereby cause groundwater pollution such information will help to implement suitable methods to improve groundwater quality therefore sustainable development and management of groundwater resources and their protection from pollution activity play a vital role in the indian economy in recent times many research studies have focused on mechanisms that determine the factors for groundwater pollution as a result of geogenic natural and non geogenic artificial sources depending on the climatic conditions topographical features geological setup water flow paths recharge and discharge areas etc singh et al 2017 jalili et al 2018 azhdarpoor et al 2019 soleimani et al 2018 badeenezhad et al 2020 manikandana et al 2020 which provides a tool for distinguishing groundwater chemistry ionic concentrations in groundwater have been described to distinguish the sources of geogenic and anthropogenic sources that change groundwater quality tian et al 2015 brindha et al 2017 nageswara rao et al 2017 wagh et al 2018 li et al 2019 differences in ionic concentrations have been identified for use in many sectors to estimate the chemical composition of groundwater ledesma ruiz et al 2016 panneerselvam et al 2020 the geochemistry of groundwater due to the impact of landfills and rainwater flow from the agricultural fields is vulnerable to non geogenic inputs wagh et al 2017 balamurugan et al 2020 mukate et al 2020 subba rao 2020 geochemical ratios can be used to understand the chemical processes that take place between the water and soils rocks as well as the water and anthropogenic activities that alter the chemical composition of groundwater subba rao et al 2019 2020a 2020c haji et al 2021 sakram et al 2022b in general most of the groundwater chemistry is geogenic processes water soil rock contact resident time of groundwater dissolution ion exchange and evaporation and non geogenic sources household waste septic tank leakage agricultural fertilizers irrigation return flows etc that can change the chemical composition of groundwater ledesma ruiz et al 2016 nageswara rao et al 2017 gaikwad et al 2020 on the other hand statistical methods can explain the relationship between chemical variables such as weathering and dissolution of the minerals ion exchange evaporation etc and provide evidence on the variation of concentrations caused by drainage wastewaters irrigation return flows chemical fertilizers etc hussin et al 2016 singh et al 2017 deepali et al 2021 the pollution index of groundwater pig not only helps to estimate pollution activity on the groundwater system through specific ionic sources but also to quantify the vulnerable zones to make a healthy society by taking effective preventive measures subba rao et al 2018 subba rao and chaudhary 2019 egbueri 2020 wagh et al 2020 kadam et al 2021 the unmix model um classifies the chemical variables into different sources based on natural processes and artificial activities which explain the contribution of specific ions to the aquifer system and the consequent results being more helpful in understanding groundwater contamination issues nagaraju et al 2018 gulgundi and shetty 2019 subba rao et al 2020a furthermore land use landcover dynamics especially household wastewater discharge septic tank leaks irrigation return flows chemical fertilizers animal wastes industrial wastes etc can damage the natural chemical composition of groundwater and consequently degrade groundwater quality groundwater resources are undesirable for any purpose patra et al 2018 manikandana et al 2020 badeenezhad et al 2020 2021 ahmad et al 2021 therefore studies on the geochemistry of groundwater needs to identify the sources of geogenic and non geogenic sources that change the groundwater quality everywhere previous studies from the current research area telangana india have focused on a general groundwater chemistry describing the factors governing groundwater chemistry b assessment of groundwater quality suitability for drinking agricultural and industrial water purposes and c possible health risk problems due to the consumption of nitrate and fluoride contaminated groundwater subba rao et al 2021a 2021b 2021c however these studies did not explain groundwater chemistry using the hydrogeochemical types geochemical ratios ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 cl hco3 ca2 na na cl na cl vs sec f na f hco3 f ca2 f no3 cl no3 cl so4 2 so4 2 no3 k cl and k so4 2 chloro alkaline indices and saturation indices and did not quantify groundwater pollution levels using the pig and also these studies did not estimate contribution of specific ionic sources to the groundwater body performing the um and did not assess groundwater quality in relation to land use land cover this is the major lacuna in the present study area to fill this gap the present study was taken up with the following objectives a evaluation of possible control processes of groundwater chemistry using the hydrogeochemical types geochemical ratios chloro alkaline indices and saturation indices b quantification of groundwater contamination levels using the pig c estimation of the contribution of specific ionic sources to the aquifer system using the um and d assessment of land use land cover impact on groundwater quality therefore the results of a comprehensive understanding of this study will help to take effective management plans for the sustainable development of groundwater resources not only in telangana and india but also in other parts of the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 location rainfall and geology the present study area is located in the nalgonda district of telangana india fig 1a it experiences a semi arid climate the annual average temperature ranges from 17 c in winter december to february to 40 c in summer march to may the annual average rainfall is about 750 mm southwest monsoons june to september contribute 70 northeast monsoons october to november 19 and the rest of non monsoon december to may 11 of the total rainfall the streams that originate from the northeast side flow to the southeast and eventually form a surface water body pond locally known as a cheruvu on the southeast side the drainage pattern is a sub dendritic type which is a characteristic of granite terrain topographically the present study area shows a gentle slope running from northwest to southeast fig 2 clay soils form the dominant type in many places concretions containing calcium carbonate are formed as intercalations in soils subba rao et al 2021a the study area is covered by hard rock formations of the precambrian age they include granite rocks with dolerite and quartzite of medium to coarse grained as younger intrusive bodies the rocks contain the mineral assemblages of quartz feldspar biotite hornblende fluorite and apatite subba rao et al 2021b 2 1 2 hydrogeology rainfall is the primary source and the irrigation return flow is the secondary source for recharging groundwater the occurrence of rocks has a limited primary porosity however the weathered and fractured rock portions are developed by geological activities as important aquifer formations subba rao et al 2021c the thickness of the weathered rock portion is between 4 and 27 m while that of the fractured rock portion is from 13 to 87 m from the ground level groundwater is present in the water table conditions as well as in the semi confined conditions the depth of the wells is 21 to 61 m below ground level bgl depth to groundwater level ranges from 3 63 to 13 50 m bgl higher depth to groundwater level is on the northwest side and lower depth on the southeast side following topographical features fig 1a as shown in the cross section of the hydrogeological conditions drawn from northwest to southeast figs 1a and 2 the depth of topsoil is 1 to 1 5 m from the ground surface this reduces the permeability to some extent as a result of the weathering process in the upper part of the host rocks the topsoil follows the weathering zone with depths ranging from 1 5 to 15 8 m showing low permeability due to limited pore spaces to allow water movement the weathered zone is followed by the fractured rock zone and its depth ranges from 12 6 to 51 5 m showing high permeability due to the development of a continuous connection of pore spaces within to allow water to flow freely from one pore space to another finally the unfractured rock portion follows the fractured zone the depth to groundwater level is 2 to 5 m bgl being deeper on the upstream northwest side which is a recharge area and lower on the downstream southeast side which is a discharge area following the topographical features 2 1 3 groundwater quality and health implications groundwater quality has been observed to be poor in many locations due to the poor drainage conditions septic tank spills irrigation return flows animal waste and excessive use of agrochemicals for high crop yields health problems discoloration of teeth fluorosis etc have been observed in some locations during fieldwork 2 2 groundwater sampling and chemical analysis a groundwater survey was conducted using the survey of india topographic sheet 56 0 4 on a scale of 1 50 000 to identify wells available for sampling twenty two wells were inventoried during fieldwork 2015 fig 1a and groundwater samples were collected in duplicate from them after pumping two to three times to contain freshwater from the aquifer soak them in 1 1 hcl for 24 h rinse with distilled water and then rinse with deionized water then groundwater samples were stored in the laboratory for chemical analysis ph and specific electrical conductivity sec were measured on site using their meters hanna hi 9811 5 sec was used to compute the total dissolved solids tds using the standard formula of sec x

magnesium mg2 by taking the difference between th and ca2 bicarbonate and cl ions were determined by titration of the standard solution methods of h2so4 and agno3 respectively for the estimation of sodium na and potassium k a flame photometer systronics 130 was used sulfate so4 2 was measured using a uv visible spectrophotometer systronics 135 nitrate no3 was determined using a colorimeter systronics 112 fluoride f was measured using a specific ion analyzer orion all chemical variables except ph no units and sec μs cm at 25o c are expressed in milligrams per litre mg l and also in milliequivalent per litre me l the error of ionic balance eib was calculated to check the accuracy of the chemical composition expressed in meq l of cations cc and anions ca for each groundwater

ion exchange processes in the groundwater system chloro alkaline indices ca1 and ca2 were used schoeller 1977 and calculated using eqs 2 and 3 according to these indices if the ions ca2 and mg2 in groundwater are replaced by the ions na and k in the aquifer materials it is called a cation exchange process when the na and k ions in groundwater are replaced by the ca2 and mg2 ions in the aquifer materials it is called a reverse ion exchange process 2 ca 1 cl na k cl 3 ca 2 cl na k hco 3 co 3 2 so 4 2 no 3 2 4 calculation of saturation indices the equilibrium state of water with respect to a particular mineral phase can be determined by calculating the saturation index si using chemical data to distinguish the hydrogeochemical evolution as well as by identifying the geochemical reactions that control the water chemistry li et al 2019 using the geochemical software phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 si was computed the ion activity product iap which was compared to the solubility product ksp eq 4 4 si k iap k sp if si is greater than zero it indicates an oversaturation precipitation of a particular mineral if it is less than zero it reveals an unsaturation dissolution of a concerned mineral if it is equal to zero it indicates the saturation equilibrium of a particular mineral 2 5 calculation procedure for a rating of total groundwater pollution levels the level rating of groundwater pollution is based on the relative health significance of chemical variables for drinking purpose the pollution index of groundwater pig established by subba rao 2012 was adopted here calculating pig involves five steps in the first step the relative weight rw of 1 to 5 was assigned to each chemical variable based on its relative impact on human health caused by the pollution activity table 1 in the second step the weight parameter wp for each chemical variable was determined eq 5 based on its relative contribution to aquifer chemistry in the third step the status of the concentration sc was assessed by dividing the concentration c of each water sample by its corresponding standard water quality limit sd eq 6 in the fourth step the overall water quality ow was computed by multiplying wp by sc eq 7 finally the pig was calculated by summing all values of ow σow eq 8 5 wp rw rw 6 sc c sd 7 ow wp x sc 8 pig ow when pig is less than 1 0 it is classified as insignificant pollution when it is from 1 0 to 1 5 it is called low pollution when it is between 1 5 and 2 0 it is considered moderate pollution when it varies from 2 0 to 2 5 it is categorized as high pollution when it is more than 2 5 it is called very high pollution subba rao 2012 2 6 estimation of specific ionic sources of groundwater quality chemical data of groundwater samples are also required to distinguish and evaluate specific ionic sources from the chemical quality of groundwater samples and for sample wise contribution of ionic sources ai et al 2014 sun and gui 2015 sun et al 2016 nagaraju et al 2018 subba rao et al 2020a for this purpose the chemical composition of the groundwater samples from the present study area was used utilizing the united states environmental protection agency usepa 2007 unmix model version 6 2 7 procedure for dividing sample locations with respect to land use land cover about 73 15 6 and 6 of the present study area is agricultural land wasteland built up land and surface water body fig 1b the main livelihood of the locals is agriculture unlimited use of chemical composts for high crop yields is common the main crops grown are rice cotton and pulses sanitary facilities are poor although the present study area mainly belongs to agricultural land it has been observed that some locations are almost free from sources of pollution caused by the impact of agricultural activities during fieldwork since the irrigation practices in these locations are limited compared to other locations locals are taking some extra precautions to avoid contaminating the land as a result the residents of these locations are using this water for their own needs therefore these specific sample locations are classified as lithological terrain to assess the impact of the land use land cover on groundwater quality for the current research purpose similarly locations observed from built up land affected by household wastewaters septic tank leakages etc are considered to be land of poor sewage conditions locations that are directly affected by irrigation return flows chemical fertilizers animal wastes etc are considered agricultural activity land accordingly the locations of groundwater samples examined from the study area to assess the effect of groundwater quality are divided into three parts four locations 1 6 18 and 22 come under the land of lithological terrain eight locations 7 11 12 14 15 17 19 and 21 come under the land of poor sewage conditions and ten locations 2 to 5 8 to 10 13 16 and 20 come under the land of agricultural activity 2 8 geographic information system gis the geographic information system gis is a software based technology to determine the spatial distribution of groundwater chemical quality karunanidhi et al 2020 arcgis software 10 7 was used for the spatial distribution of pollution index of groundwater pig zones using the inverse distance weighted interpolation technique kadam et al 2021 3 results and discussions 3 1 general groundwater quality description groundwater quality is essential for understanding the chemistry of groundwater and its suitability for drinking needs shabbir and ahmad 2015 badeenezhad et al 2020 table 2 presented a statistical summary of the physicochemical composition of groundwater ph value no units was from 6 74 to 9 25 sec from 320 to 5689 μs cm tds from 208 and 3698 mg l ca2 from 26 to 281 mg l mg2 from 5 to 248 mg l na from 22 to 700 mg l k from 1 to 30 mg l hco3 from 159 to 1129 mg l cl from 21 to 766 mg l so4 2 from 3 to 376 mg l no3 from 2 to 700 mg l and f from 0 27 to 4 73 mg l the average values of the corresponding chemical variables mg l were 7 62 no units 1938 32 μs cm 1318 134 66 223 7 3 535 256 93 200 and 1 72 accordingly the ionic dominant pattern was in the order of na ca2 mg2 k and hco3 cl no3 so4 2 f for cations and anions respectively furthermore na and hco3 ions were shown in high concentrations among cations and anions respectively which indicate the prevailing conditions of the rock weathering and dissolution processes wagh et al 2019 subba rao et al 2020a sakram et al 2022a concentrations of ph tds ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f were above drinking water quality limits of 6 5 to 8 5 500 mg l 75 mg l 30 mg l 200 mg l 12 mg l 300 mg l 250 mg l 200 mg l 45 mg l and 1 5 mg l in 4 55 sample 12 81 82

1a causing the gastrointestinal irritation salty taste laxative effect sour taste blue baby disease skeletal fluorosis etc bis 2012 who 2017 the wide variation in standard deviation sd of chemical variables indicates high spatial variability in groundwater chemistry subba rao et al 2020c in the present study sd varied from 0 53 to 832 which measures the occurrence of much greater spatial variation in groundwater chemistry furthermore the normal distribution of probability p was less than 0 05 in all chemical variables 0 01 to 0 04 except ca2 0 15 it also indicates the involvement of multi factors and or chemical processes in groundwater as reported in other areas by sun et al 2016 and subba rao et al 2020a 3 2 geochemical processes governing the chemistry of groundwater 3 2 1 hydrogeochemical types to understand the hydrogeochemical types and processes brindha et al 2017 manikandana et al 2020 deepali et al 2021 the chemical data of groundwater samples of the present study area were plotted in fig 3 in 50 of the total groundwater samples the ions ca2 mg2 and hco3 co2 3 exceed the ions na k and cl so4 2 in zone 5 indicating the carbonate hardness water or recharge water type ca2 mg2 hco3 this is a clear indication of the contribution of weathering of calcium feldspars and ferromagnesium minerals present in the country rocks subba rao et al 2019 kadam et al 2021 some groundwater samples 36 36 were observed in zone 6 representing the non carbonate hardness water or reverse ion exchange water type ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 due to the high ca2 mg2 and cl so4 2 ions than na k and hco3 co2 3 ions since no known geological sources of the cl and so4 2 ions in the groundwater of present study area higher concentrations of these ions than the hco3 ion clearly reflect the surface water contamination caused by the impact of drainage waste irrigation return flows gypsum etc on the chemical composition of groundwater deepali et al 2015 badeenezhad et al 2020 sakram et al 2022b some groundwater samples 9 09 were found in zone 7 which is characterized by non carbonate alkali water or saline water type na cl it shows higher concentrations of na k and cl so4 2 ions than ca2 mg2 and hco3 co2 3 ions causing saline water due to the man made pollution balamurugan et al 2020 gaikwad et al 2020 very few groundwater samples 4 55 were observed from zone 8 indicating an excess alkalinity water or cation exchange water type na hco3 it refers to the na k and hco3 co2 3 contents in excess of ca2 mg2 and cl so4 2 contents resulting in soil co2 contribution to groundwater subba rao 2017a therefore the diagram obviously indicated the groundwater quality which is mainly dominated by the ca2 mg2 hco3 type and changed to other water quality types due to the involvement of anthropogenic sources in the aquifer system 3 2 2 changes in groundwater quality from recharge area to discharge area progressive ionic enrichment during the stay of groundwater depends on the residence time of water in the subsurface under natural environmental conditions according to the anionic concept of schoeller 1967 ophori and toth 1989 and subba rao 2007 the recharge area indicates lower concentrations of so4 2 and cl ions and higher concentration of hco3 ions while the discharge area indicates higher concentrations of cl and so4 2 ions and lower concentration of hco3 ions in groundwater if anthropogenic sources contaminate surface water infiltrating into the groundwater the ionic enrichment pattern in the groundwater can change subba rao 2012 table 3 illustrated the change in groundwater quality from the recharge area to the discharge area in the present study area the ph tds ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f values varied from 6 8 to 7 5 no units 208 to 2229 32 to 200 12 to 175 22 to 260 4 to 12 159 to 519 21 to 496 18 to 194 2 2 to 574 and 0 27 to 0 60 mg l from the recharge area to discharge area the contributions of ca2 and hco3 ions decrease according to the contribution of the ionic concentration to the total ions while the mg2 na cl so4 2 and no3 ions increase to reflect the involvement of wastewater septic tank spills irrigation return flows chemical fertilizers etc in groundwater therefore groundwater is characterized by ca2 na mg2 k and hco3 cl so4 2 no3 f facies in the recharge area the mg2 na ca2 k and hco3 cl no3 so4 2 f facies in the middle area and the mg2 na ca2 k and cl no3 hco3 so4 2 f facies in the discharge area in particular gradual changes in the concentration of cl 21 to 496 mg l so4 2 18 to 194 mg l and no3 2 2 to 574 mg l from the recharge area to the discharge area table 3 reflected the infiltration of surface water contamination caused by irrigation return flows chemical fertilizers manures domestic sewage etc that reach the groundwater as also observed in other regions subba rao 2007 manikandana et al 2020 badeenezhad et al 2020 2021 egbueri 2020 3 2 3 mineral weathering process groundwater chemistry is governed by various processes in the aquifer system brindha et al 2017 to describe these processes geochemical ratios are widely used nagaraju et al 2018 panneerselvam et al 2020 the ratio ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 is used to estimate the role of mineral weathering and cation exchange processes deepali et al 2015 gaikwad et al 2020 in the present study area 22 73 of groundwater samples were found along the equiline of ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 in fig 4a it clearly reflected the chemistry of groundwater which is mainly controlled by the dissolution of carbonate and sulfate minerals most groundwater sampling points 45 45 were observed below the uniline of this ratio indicating cation exchange caused by removing ca2 and mg2 ions from water or adding high hco3 to groundwater by weathering and dissolution of sodium feldspars eq 9 however 31 82 of groundwater samples were found above the theoretical line which measures the reverse ion exchange process by the release of ca2 and mg2 ions from the aquifer material therefore the silicate weathering cation exchange reactions appear to be the major process regulating groundwater chemistry 9 2 naalsi 3 o 8 2 co 2 11 h 2 o sodium feldspar al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 4 h 4 sio 4 2 na 2 hco 3 in fig 4b the concentration of hco3 was higher than cl in 77 27 of the groundwater samples in the present study area this refers to the flushing of recharged water containing soil co2 and weathered materials saha et al 2019 however the abundance of na content over the ca2 content in 77 27 of the groundwater sampling points indicates the silicate weathering and or cation exchange processes subba rao 2017a 2017b that appear to be the chief source of na in groundwater chemistry fig 4c to distinguish the dissolution and ion exchange processes of minerals in the groundwater the ratio na cl is used as another tool wagh et al 2019 if this ratio is equal to one it represents halite dissolution hussin et al 2016 a high ratio of na cl 1 or a lower ratio 1 indicates silicate weathering cation exchange and reverse ion exchange processes respectively deepali et al 2021 according to fig 4d 22 73 of the chemical data of groundwater samples were observed along with the na cl line indicating halite dissolution however the release of na may be the result of weathering and dissolution of the plagioclase feldspars in the present study area some groundwater samples 4 55 showed a less than one of na cl ratio which reveals the groundwater chemistry affected by the reverse ion exchange reaction most groundwater samples 72 72 were found to have a higher na cl ratio this may be due to the effect of silicate weathering cation exchange process on groundwater which may release high amounts of na subba rao et al 2017a in general the high concentrations of f ions are a result of the high concentrations of na and hco3 ions and the low concentrations of ca2 ions in the groundwater it has also been reported in other regions due to f eqs 10 to 13 released by the dissolution of the fluoride minerals ahada and suthar 2019 deepali et al 2019 subba rao et al 2013 2017a 2020b accordingly the f should have a positive relationship with na and hco3 and a negative relationship with ca2 however the f showed a less positive correlation with na fig 5a and hco3 fig 5b and a negative correlation with ca2 fig 5c in the present study area this variation may be a consequence of a simultaneous increase or decrease in the ions depending on dissolution precipitation concentration effects etc admas et al 2001 subba rao 2017b furthermore there is a negative correlation between f and no3 fig 5d this refers to the weathering and dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals present in host rocks that cause f content in groundwater rather than an anthropogenic source 10 ca 5 f po 4 3 2 oh apatite ca 5 po 4 3 oh 2 2 f 11 k mg fe 3 alsio 3 o 10 f 2 2 oh biotite k mg fe 3 alsio 3 o 10 oh 2 2 f 12 ca 5 mg 5 si 6 al 2 o 22 f 2 2 oh hornblende ca 5

exchange processes brindha et al 2017 manikandana et al 2020 deepali et al 2015 chloro alkaline indices ca1 and ca2 were calculated using eqs 2 and 3 to further verify these phenomena and to predict which ion exchange process could primarily control the hydrogeochemistry in the present study area the computed values of these two indices changed from 0 04 to 0 28 averaging 0 69 and 0 14 respectively table 4 as exemplified in fig 6a 86 36 and 13 64 of the total groundwater samples showed the negative and positive values of these indices for cation exchange and reverse ion exchange processes respectively furthermore as observed in the na cl ratio fig 4d cation exchange was also found to be the dominant process compared to the reverse ion exchange that regulates groundwater chemistry in the present study area 3 2 3 2 evaporation process as the present study area experiences a semi arid climate and about 73 of the area is occupied by irrigation practices this leads to easier circulation of groundwater and consequently a higher evaporation rate such natural conditions usually enrich the dissolved salts in the groundwater system by recharge water to confirm this phenomenon the chemical data of groundwater sampling points were plotted in the na cl vs sec diagram fig 6b which explains the existing activity of the evaporation process with the increase in salinity sec most of the groundwater sampling points 90 01 spread horizontally this indicates that the na cl ratio remains constant with increasing sec thus it infers that evaporation occurs as the increase of na and cl contents in the groundwater the formation of carbonate concretions in the soils further supports the evaporation action due to the prolonged dry climatic conditions in the present study area subba rao et al 2021a 3 2 3 3 saturation indices in the present study area groundwater samples were undersaturated with respect to calcite 3 97 to 1 10 with an average of 2 26 dolomite 7 87 to 1 54 with an average of 4 41 gypsum 6 41 to 3 52 with an average of 4 54 and halite 10 75 to 7 80 with an average of 8 25 table 4 which were calculated eq 4 using phreeqc software parkhurst and appelo 1999 and demonstrated in fig 7 these conditions revealed the dissolved state of the corresponding mineral phases in the groundwater system however these mineral phases may not be the main sources in the present study area as these findings are excluded in collaboration with geology processes badana et al 2018 therefore high concentrations of ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 ions mentioned above in groundwater can also occur due to the infiltration of contaminated surface water due to the impact of household waste septic tank spillage irrigation return flow chemical compost etc wagh et al 2019 deepali et al 2021 3 2 3 4 anthropogenic sources basically groundwater chemistry is influenced by natural geological processes hem 1991 todd and mays 2011 however land use pattern plays an important role in significantly changing the chemical composition of groundwater subba rao 2017a 2017b patra et al 2018 manikandana et al 2020 ahmad et al 2021 the lack of geological sources of cl so4 2 and no3 ions indicate the contribution of these ions to groundwater through surface water contamination due to the impact of anthropogenic sources such as household waste septic tanks spills irrigation return flows chemical fertilizers animal waste etc rahmati et al 2015 badeenezhad et al 2020 2021 deepali et al 2021 to illustrate this phenomenon the ions cl so4 2 and no3 are considered indicators of surface water contamination in the present study area there is no geogenic source of so4 2 in groundwater therefore so4 2 must be the source of anthropogenic origin i e the application of gypsum as an amendment to change soil permeability eq 14 14 caso 4 2 h 2 o gypsum ca 2 so 4 2 2 h 2 o in the present study area concentrations of cl 326 to 496 mg l so4 2 374 to 376 mg l and no3 75 to 700 mg l with an average of 475 43 375 and 303 68 mg l were exceeded the drinking water quality standards of 250 200 and 45 mg l in 31 82 samples 2 to 4 8 9 16 and 20 9 09 samples 9 and 20 and 59 09 samples 2 to 5 8 to 10 12 13 16 17 20 and 21 of the total groundwater samples respectively these sample locations are shown in fig 1a corresponding ions are 1 30 to 1 98 1 87 to 1 88 and 1 67 to 15 56 times higher than the recommended limits of 250 200 and 45 mg l for drinking water bis 2012 however the standard deviation of these ions 193 107 and 227 table 2 indicated the multiple sources deepali et al 2021 furthermore cl showed a strong positive relationship with so4 2 fig 8a and no3 8b while so4 2 had a positive relationship with no3 8c they support multiple sources of surface water contamination which reaches groundwater through recharge water this may be caused by the impact of domestic waste septic tank leaks chemical composts irrigation return flows etc on groundwater chemistry furthermore the k had a significantly similar positive relationship with cl fig 9a and no3 fig 9b this reveals that the effect of irrigation return flows of water contaminated with the potassium compost is also a source of these ions 3 2 3 5 correlation between different chemical variable the correlation between different chemical variables helps to understand the possible causes of groundwater contamination badana et al 2018 deepali et al 2021 table 5 presented the results of pearson s correlation coefficient analysis strong positive relationship of tds with ca2 r 0 68 mg2 r 0 73 na2 r 0 93 hco3 r 0 72 cl r 0 98 so4 2 r 0 79 and no3 r 0 91 referred to the salinity tds controlled by these ions which are derived from weathering and dissolution of minerals and sources of anthropogenic activity deepali et al 2021 similarly it had a strong positive relationship of ca2 with cl r 0 75 and no3 r 71 and a moderately positive relationship with na2 r 56 and so4 2 r 49 indicating the dissolution of plagioclase feldspars calcium and sodium and sulfate minerals application of gypsum in the agricultural field which reaches the groundwater through surface water contamination subba rao et al 2013 rahmati et al 2015 magnesium showed good positive correlation table 5 with hco3 r 0 64 cl r 0 68 so4 2 r 0 65 and no3 r 0 64 and moderately positive correlation with na2 r 0 54 sodium had strong positive correlation with hco3 r 0 78 cl r 0 90 so4 2 r 0 71 and no3 r 0 79 these relationships can be the result of the effects of mineral dissolution drainage wastes septic tank leakage irrigation return flows chemical fertilizers etc brindha et al 2017 subba rao et al 2017a kadam et al 2021 bicarbonate expressed good positive relation with cl r 0 66 and moderately positive correlation with so4 2 r 0 45 and no3 r 0 47 it referred to the mixing of freshwater with surface contaminated water badana et al 2018 chloride exhibited strong positive relation so4 2 r 0 76 and no3 r 0 89 while so4 2 showed good correlation coefficient with no3 r 0 62 the variation in these relationships is a result of a concurrent increase or decrease in chemical variables based on dissolution precipitation ion exchange and ionic concentration subba rao et al 2017b however these correlations have clearly supported the impact of surface water pollution on the aquifer system rahmati et al 2015 wagh et al 2019 therefore these observations suggest that groundwater is strongly influenced by surface contamination sources and mineral weathering reactions 3 3 degree of groundwater pollution pollution of groundwater poses a serious threat to the water supply its potential evolution will have an impact on health therefore the assessment of groundwater pollution is an effective way to protect the safety of groundwater resources as mentioned groundwater pollution zones using the pig subba rao 2012 have the lowest pollution zone pig 1 0 low pollution zone pig 1 0 to 1 5 medium pollution zone pig 1 5 to 2 0 high pollution zone pig 2 0 to 2 5 and very high pollution zone pig 2 5 3 3 1 insignificant pollution zone to estimate the level of groundwater pollution the results of computed pig were presented in table 6 the pig values ranged from 0 31 to 4 70 with an average of 1 64 and their spatial distribution was illustrated in fig 10 an insignificant pollution zone covered by 5 89 of the study area the average value of this zone 0 68 was less than 1 0 the average ow value of ca2 0 07 mg2 0 02 na 0 04 k 0 01 hco3 0 08 cl 0 04 so4 2 0 03 no3 0 06 and f 0 08 was below 1 0 however the ph 0 12 and tds 0 14 showed an ow value above 0 1 because ph determines the solubility of salts and tds is the result of all chemical ions dissolved in water hem 1991 todd and mays 2011 groundwater samples in the insignificant pollution zone are generally observed from the area of the lithological terrain that is not affected by any anthropogenic sources the average values of ph and tds were found to be 7 79 and 555 43 mg l respectively table 6 with ph ranging from its safe limit of 6 5 to 8 5 but slightly above the tds desirable limit of 500 mg l allowed for drinking water purpose bis 2012 it is also important to note the remaining chemical variables such as ca2 80 29 mg l mg2 23 20 mg l na 82 43 mg l k 4 43 mg l hco3 352 29 mg l cl 78 43 mg l so4 2 35 54 no3 31 60 mg l and f 0 97 mg l showed their concentrations within the safe limits of 75 mg l 30 mg l 200 mg l 12 mg l 300 mg l 250 mg l 200 mg l 45 mg l and 1 5 mg l respectively recommended for drinking purpose table 6 bis 2012 these ions can be released from source materials under natural environmental hydrogeological conditions subba rao et al 2002 for instance the occurrence of co2 in the soil zone released from the decay of organic and root respiration is a major source of hco3 in groundwater eqs 15 and 16 ions ca2 mg2 na and k along with hco3 are derived from minerals due to the weathering and dissolution processes eqs 9 17 and 18 household waste irrigation return flows and potassium compost are also the main sources of mg2 na and k ions deepali et al 2015 human made activities such as domestic waste septic tank spills irrigation return flows and nitrogen compost are the chief sources of cl and no3 ions in groundwater badeenezhad et al 2020 wagh et al 2020 kadam et al 2021 the application of gypsum eq 14 and the occurrence of fluoride bearing minerals present in the rocks eqs 10 to 13 of the present study area are the prime sources of so4 2 and f ions respectively in addition to the effect of sulfate and phosphate fertilizers in the groundwater subba rao 2012 subba rao et al 2017b deepali et al 2019 since almost all chemical variables are within the drinking water quality limits the groundwater quality observed from the insignificant pollution zone can be considered as a natural occurrence of the groundwater quality type subba rao et al 2002 this will help to estimate the sources of the next higher pollution zones 15 co 2 h 2 o carbon dioxide h 2 co 3 16 h 2 co 3 carbonic acid h hco 3 17 caal 2 si 2 o 8 h 2 co 3 ½ o 2 al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4

f 0 22 table 6 here the ow value of ph tds hco3 no3 and f was greater than 0 1 which indicates the probability of a pollution activity furthermore the average values of tds 966 29 mg l hco3 577 71 mg l no3 60 57 mg l and f 2 68 mg l were 1 93 1 93 1 35 and 1 79 times higher than the desirable limits of 500 300 45 and 1 5 mg l recommended for drinking water purposes respectively table 6 furthermore the ion no3 in this zone was 1 92 times higher than the concentration of no3 31 60 mg l in the insignificant zone indicating the onset of surface water contamination activity in the groundwater body mukate et al 2020 the concentration of no3 in groundwater is regulated by nitrification and denitrification processes the formation of ammonium nh4 and nitrate no3 is usually done by nitrogen fertilizers for instance the hydrolysis of urea eq 19 produces nh4 which undergoes oxidation and leads to no3 in groundwater in the aerobic state eq 20 similarly the decomposition of organic matter also causes no3 to form in groundwater eq 21 19 co nh 2 2 3 h 2 o 2 nh 4 2 oh co 2 urea 20 nh 4 2 o 2 no 3 2 h h 2 o ammonium 21 c 106 h 263 o 110 n 16 p 138 o 2 106 co 2 16 no 3 hpo 4 2 122 h 2 o 18 h organic matter on the other hand the combination of hco3 and f is an evolution of the chemical weathering and dissolution of fluoride rich minerals example eq 13 and the occurrence of no3 above the allowable limit of 45 mg l for drinking purposes is a result of the leaking of wastewaters from household waste septic tank spillages uncontrolled nitrogen fertilizers etc similar results have been reported from other regions subba rao et al 2012 2017a 2017b 2020a 2020c karunanidhi et al 2019 wagh et al 2019 therefore these observations obviously support the impact of groundwater pollution activity starting from a low pollution zone compared to the insignificant pollution zone in the present study area 3 3 3 medium pollution zone the medium pollution zone expanding 27 48 of the total investigated area fig 10 showed a pig ranging from 1 5 to 2 0 average 1 77 with an ow average of ph 0 12 tds 0 34 ca2 0 09 mg2 0 13 na 0 11 k 0 01 hco3 0 14 cl 0 11 so4 2 0 09 no3 0 56 and f 0 08 table 6 in this zone the ow value was higher than 0 1 in ph tds mg2 na hco3 cl and no3 values and the average concentrations of tds 1409 50 mg l mg2 77 mg l na 225 mg l hco3 558 mg l cl 269 50 mg l and no3 204 50 mg l were 2 82 2 57 1 13 1 86 1 08 and 4 54 times higher than the prescribed safe limits for drinking purposes table 6 however the value of no3 in this zone was 3 38 times higher than in the low pollution zone indicating human intervention on the groundwater system badeenezhad et al 2020 2021 kadam et al 2021 combinations of mg2 na and hco3 ions exhibited the effect of chemical weathering and dissolution of sodium plagioclase feldspars eq 9 and ferromagnesium minerals hornblende and biotite occurring in host rocks eqs 11 and 12 supplementation of tds mg2 na cl and no3 in groundwater represented the influence of surface water pollution caused by household waste septic tank leakages irrigation return flows and nitrogen composts rahmati et al 2015 subba rao et al 2017a 2017b balamurugan et al 2020 since tds is a total dissolved salt content the relationship between tds and other ions can be considered to a hypothetical assessment of anthropogenic sources on the aquifer body subba rao et al 2017a thus the increase of tds 966 29 to 1409 50 mg l with an increase in mg2 54 43 to 77 mg l na 167 14 to 225 mg l cl 179 86 to 269 50 mg l and no3 60 57 to 204 50 mg l from the low to medium pollution zone further supports this hypothesis table 6 as a result the observed chemical variables showed a higher content and consequently a higher value of ow representing the relatively high amount of groundwater contamination activity taking place in the low pollution zone to the medium pollution zone 3 3 4 high pollution zone the average values of ow of ph 0 12 tds 0 32 ca2 0 14 mg2 0 09 na 0 15 k 0 05 hco3 0 12 cl 0 15 so4 2 0 12 no3 0 87 and f 0 20 were observed in the high pollution zone covering 17 34 of the total present study area table 6 fig 10 the pig in this zone ranged from 2 0 to 2 5 average 2 33 in this zone the average ow value of ph ca2 na and hco3 were greater than 0 1 which reflects the weathering and dissolution of calcium and sodium feldspars eqs 9 and 17 while tds na cl so4 2 no3 and f may be the result of increased anthropogenic activities poor sewage conditions irrigation return flows utilization of gypsum and nitrogen compost on the aquifer system subba rao et al 2017a 2017b badeenezhad et al 2020 2021 deepali et al 2021 furthermore the average concentrations of tds 1813 50 mg l ca2 210 mg l mg2 54 50 mg l na 306 mg l hco3 500 mg l cl 311 50 mg l so4 2 202 mg l no3 321 mg l and f 2 44 mg l were 3 63 2 80 1 82 1 53 1 67 1 25 1 01 7 13 and 1 63 times higher than the recommended safe limits of potable water table 6 comparatively the no3 content in this zone was 1 57 times higher than in the medium pollution zone therefore these values clearly demonstrate the potential for groundwater pollution which is a higher amount compared to the medium pollution zone 3 3 5 very high pollution zone a pig greater than 2 5 average 3 62 was present in a much higher pollution zone 5 95 of the present study area fig 10 the average values of this zone ow were ph 0 12 tds 0 65 ca2 0 14 mg2 0 22 na 0 23 k 0 02 hco3 0 18 cl 0 22 so4 2 0 13 and no3 1 62 which are higher than 0 1 with the exception of f ion 0 10 table 6 the combination of ca2 mg2 na and hco3 ions may be the result of weathering and dissolution of calcium and sodium plagioclase feldspars eqs 9 and 17 and ferromagnesium minerals eqs 11 and 12 while that of tds na cl so4 2 and no3 clearly indicated the pollution activity caused by poor sewage conditions and agricultural activities in the groundwater subba rao et al 2017a 2017b badeenezhad et al 2020 2021 mukate et al 2020 subba rao 2020 deepali et al 2021 average values of tds 2655 mg l ca2 211 50 mg l mg2 132 mg l na 480 mg l hco3 732 25 mg l cl 554 75 mg l so4 2 219 mg l and no3 598 50 mg l were 5 31 2 82 4 40 2 40 2 44 2 22 1 10 and 13 30 times higher than the prescribed drinking water quality limits table 6 here also the no3 content was 1 87 times higher than in the high pollution zone these concentrations are further supportive of the high amount of pollution activity taking place in the groundwater system compared to the high pollution zone 3 4 estimation of the contribution of specific ionic sources the unmix model um of the united states environmental protection agency 2007 is another technique for the evaluation of specific ionic sources of chemical quality of groundwater according to um estimates three sources namely source i source ii and source iii were identified table 7 the computed minimum requirement min rsq in this model was 0 83 which contributes to 83 of the total variation exceeding the min rsq value of 0 80 ai et al 2014 it demonstrated the reliable informative modelling ability to estimate the contributions of pollution sources subba rao et al 2020a furthermore the relationship between predicted and observed concentrations of individual ions was greater than 0 60 r 0 67 to 0 97 fig 11 which also supports the acceptable efficiency of modelling sun et al 2016 in order to evaluate the specific ionic sources in the groundwater system the contributions of more than 50 of the ionic sources in the current research have been taken into consideration as suggested by subba rao et al 2020a 3 4 1 source i as presented in table 7 and fig 12 the source i was characterized by a high contribution of k 75 9 followed by ca2 19 no3 15 7 cl 8 7 hco3 7 2 mg2 5 6 na 0 so4 2 0 and f 0 ions the contribution of this source was 14 7 of the total ionic sources while the ionic source was 31 5 of the groundwater samples relatively the contribution of k was more than 50 under natural conditions it occurs in low concentrations because potassium minerals are more resistant to chemical weathering and can absorb k through clay products hem 1991 subba rao et al 2017a therefore the high contribution of k can be considered as the effect of man made activities poor sewage conditions and potash compost rather than the impact of lithological origin in the groundwater body karunanidhi et al 2019 subba rao 2020 therefore an average value of k was observed in high pollution zones compared to other zones at 20 mg l table 6 3 4 2 source ii in source ii so4 2 88 mg2 86 6 no3 84 3 na 74 6 and ca2 55 5 were high contributors compared to hco3 38 7 k 0 and f 0 with 56 5 of the total source of ions table 7 and fig 12 the contribution of this source to groundwater samples was 31 4 due to the high contributions of so4 2 mg2 no3 na and ca2 50 to groundwater sample locations groundwater in source ii is highly contaminated by anthropogenic sources due to the poor sewage conditions domestic waste septic tank spillages etc and agricultural related activities utilization of gypsum and nitrate composts compared to groundwater in source i this hypothesis is further confirmed by correlation coefficient r of so4 2 with mg2 0 65 no3 0 62 na 0 71 and ca2 0 49 mg2 with no3 0 64 na 0 54 and ca2 0 22 no3 with na 0 79 and ca2 0 71 and na with ca2 0 56 table 5 for these reasons ions including so4 2 46 86 to 219 mg l mg2 54 43 to 132 mg l no3 60 57 to 598 50 mg l na 167 14 to 480 mg l and ca2 112 to 211 50 mg l showed the high concentrations than their highest desirable limits prescribed for drinking purposes in low medium high and very high pollution zones table 6 3 4 3 source iii source iii showed the higher contributions of f 100 and hco3 54 1 followed by ca2 25 5 na 25 4 k 24 1 so4 2 12 cl 10 3 mg2 7 8 and no3 0 table 7 and fig 12 the total contribution of ionic sources was 28 8 while that of groundwater sample wise was 37 2 since the high contributions of f and hco3 ions in groundwater samples was more than 50 it may be the result of the weathering and dissolution of fluoride rich minerals eqs 10 to 13 under alkaline conditions as a major contributor of source iii to the aquifer system and also the effect of phosphate fertilizers deepali et al 2019 subba rao et al 2020b haji et al 2021 this further supports the average concentration of f 2 68 and 2 44 mg l in the low pollution zone as well as in the high pollution zone table 6 however the correlation coefficient between f and hco3 showed a low positive value r 0 28 table 5 this can be expected by masking the natural lithological source through a non lithological source deepali et al 2019 subba rao et al 2017b 3 5 impact of land use land cover on groundwater quality to further verify the ground reality of the various sources on the aquifer system depending on land use land cover the ions analysed from the groundwater of the present study area were arranged according to the classification of lithology weathering and dissolution of silicate and fluoride bearing minerals poor sewage conditions household wastes septic tank leakages etc and agricultural activities irrigation return flows agricultural composts etc the ions cl so4 2 and no3 have no geological origin in the present study area but the concentrations of these ions are higher compared to the drinking water quality criteria table 2 in 31 82 9 09 and 59 09 of the groundwater sampling locations thus these ions are considered good indicators of anthropogenic influences on groundwater chemistry badeenezhad et al 2020 2021 manikandana et al 2020 furthermore the contamination of no3 is the most critical and sensible environmental indicator that supports the design enforcement and monitoring of regulatory policies wick et al 2012 therefore ion no3 is considered here to assess the impact of pollution input on the aquifer system 3 5 1 effect of lithology on groundwater quality the average values mg l of ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f examined from the lithological zone were 113 33 34 13 124 5 476 165 33 59 33 3 73 and 1 89 respectively table 8 among cations na is the most abundant ion while among anions hco3 is the dominant ion which indicates the weathering and dissolution processes of rock minerals eq 9 it refers to the freshwater quality environment sonkamble et al 2012 subba rao 2012 sethy et al 2016 furthermore the concentration no3 3 73 mg l was found to be below its safe limit of 45 mg l allowed for drinking water quality purposes bis 2012 which obviously indicates that no impact of anthropogenic sources poor sewage conditions and or agricultural activities is on groundwater badeenezhad et al 2020 2021 subba rao 2012 however the f content 1 89 mg l exceeds the recommended highest desirable limit of 1 5 mg l for drinking water which is mainly due to the occurrence of fluoride rich minerals present in the host rocks but not caused by anthropogenic sources deepali et al 2019 subba rao et al 2020b therefore the observed value of the no3 in the lithological zone can be considered as a natural phenomenon of groundwater quality 3 5 2 impact of poor sewage conditions on groundwater quality average values mg l of ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f were 92 25 34 56 135 13 5 50 461 38 119 63 36 54 47 13 and 2 07 respectively where the locations of groundwater samples were affected by poor sewage conditions table 8 the ions ca2 mg2 na hco3 and f are derived mainly from the calcium and sodium feldspars ferromagnesium and fluoride bearing minerals present in the basement rocks eqs 9 to 13 17 and 18 on the other hand the cl 119 63 mg l and so4 2 36 54 mg l values were lower than the drinking water quality standards bis 2012 however the ion no3 47 13 mg l was 1 05 times higher than the safe limit 45 mg l while the f 2 07 mg l was 1 38 times greater than the recommended limit of 1 5 mg l for drinking purposes bis 2012 furthermore the ionic concentration of no3 was 12 64 times higher than that in the lithological zone indicating that it masks the influence of the lithological source on groundwater by anthropogenic sources subba rao 2012 subba rao et al 2002 2012 badeenezhad et al 2020 2021 wagh et al 2020 gaikwad et al 2020 therefore it is clear evidence of contamination activity on groundwater due to the household wastewaters septic tank leakages etc compared to groundwater quality values in the lithological zone 3 5 3 impact of agricultural activities on groundwater quality locations of the groundwater samples affected primarily by agricultural activity were showed the ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f in the respective concentrations of 178 50 90 80 120 20 8 30 603 90 383 20 167 20 369 80 and 1 35 mg l table 8 in particular the values of ca2 mg2 na and hco3 ions reflected the processes of weathering and dissolution of calcium and sodium feldspars eqs 9 and 17 and ferromagnesium minerals present in the host rocks eqs 11 and 12 however the cl so4 2 and no3 ions specified the influence of irrigation return flows application of gypsum eq 14 and nitrogen composts on groundwater subba rao et al 2017a 2017b mukate et al 2020 egbueri 2020 subba rao 2020 on the other hand the ions cl 383 20 mg l and no3 369 80 mg l were 1 53 and 8 22 times higher than the recommended limits of 250 and 45 mg l respectively for drinking water bis 2012 the so4 2 content was 2 82 to 4 57 times higher than in the lands of lithology and poor sewage conditions furthermore the concentration of no3 was 7 85 times higher than in groundwater influenced by poor sewage conditions while it was 99 14 times higher than in the lithological zone this is a significant indication of the impact of anthropogenic origin on the groundwater quality of a lithological origin as a major source of surface water pollution activity as also reported in other regions by deeapali et al 2012 badeenezhad et al 2020 and balamurugan et al 2020 3 6 conceptual model the conceptual model provides simplified information to understand the controlling processes of aquifer chemistry groundwater chemistry is generally based on natural hydrogeological environmental conditions subba rao et al 2002 subba rao 2007 the chemical quality of groundwater is mostly characterized by the ca2 mg2 hco3 type as a result of the water soil rock interactions associated with the weathering and dissolution of silicate minerals cation exchange and evaporation processes however improper disposal of household wastewater and septic tank spills from the residential areas and unrestricted use of irrigation return flows chemical composts etc from the agricultural areas have damaged the quality of natural groundwater furthermore changes in groundwater quality from the recharge area to the discharge area and the high correlations among cl so4 2 and no3 ions clearly support this hypothetical phenomenon as a result the pig um and land use land cover observations also indicate poor chemical quality caused by surface water pollution due to the impact of anthropogenic sources the intensity of anthropogenic pollution sources has been observed to obscure the impact of geogenic sources on the groundwater system therefore a proper management plan is needed to protect the aquifer system 3 7 groundwater quality protection and management measures according to the observations made from the technologies of gr pig um and land use land cover the present study shows that the chemical quality of groundwater is contaminated in some places by geogenic water soil rock interactions sources and in other places it is mainly caused by non geogenic household waste septic tank leakages irrigation returns flows chemical fertilizers etc sources therefore to create a healthy environment for groundwater resources the following protection and management measures are suggested a wells near household waste septic tank spills etc should not be used for drinking until groundwater is treated b limit the use of irrigation return flows pesticides and other chemical fertilizers especially potash sulfate and nitrate is necessary to prevent groundwater contamination from them according to the soil characteristics c regular monitoring of groundwater quality should be carried out to identify the sources of pollution and their flow directions to prevent pollution activities accordingly d groundwater recharge systems roof top rainwater structures percolation tanks and recharge pits should be implemented on a war footing to raise groundwater levels and thereby improve groundwater quality through a simple dilution process which is an easier method than the more expensive methods and e local people need education on various aspects of the environment to successfully implement preventive and effective management measures in a timely manner 4 conclusions geochemical ratios gr pollution index of groundwater pig unmix model um and land use land cover conditions were used in the present study area to classify the degree of groundwater pollution as well as to assess the sources of specific ions in groundwater it is an important comprehensive approach to identify changes in groundwater chemistry and consequently groundwater quality the results of the present study were summarized with the following conclusions according to the hydrogeochemical types groundwater quality showed the ca2 mg2 hco3 ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 na cl and na hco3 types in 50 36 36 9 09 and 4 55 of the groundwater samples respectively geogenic origin water soil rock interactions appeared to be the main source and anthropogenic activity as the secondary source on the aquifer system gr such as ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 cl hco3 ca2 na na cl na cl vs sec f na f hco3 f ca2 f no3 cl no3 cl so4 2 so4 2 no3 k cl and k so4 2 chloro alkaline indices and saturation indices clearly defined the groundwater chemistry that is regulated by the mineral weathering and dissolution ion exchange and evaporation processes as the main geogenic sources while surface water contamination caused by household waste septic tank spills irrigation return flows agricultural fertilizers etc as the secondary anthropogenic sources the relationships of chemical variables also further supported the origins of sources gradual increase in the contents of cl 21 to 496 mg l so4 2 18 to 194 mg l and no3 2 2 to 574 mg l from the recharge area to the discharge area indicated the infiltration of contaminated surface water caused by irrigation return flows chemical fertilizers manures domestic sewage etc that enters the groundwater the pig results classified the study area as the insignificant pollution zone 5 89 describing the drinking water quality within limits of all chemical parameters while the low pollution zone 43 34 medium pollution zone 27 48 high pollution zone 17 34 and very high pollution zone 5 95 representing the high tds mg2 na k hco3 cl no3 so4 2 and f values above the standard drinking water quality limits indicating the gradual increase in pollution activity three specific ionic sources using the um were classified based on their contribution to groundwater greater than 50 source i k explains the effect of the poor sewage conditions and potash composts source ii so4 2 mg2 no3 na and ca2 measures the impact of poor sewage conditions irrigation return flows and agrochemicals gypsum and nitrate and source iii f and hco refers to the dissolution of the fluoride rich minerals land use land cover conditions were established more substantially as per the facts observed from pig and um the intensity of anthropogenic pollution sources has been found to overcome the impact of geogenic sources on the groundwater the present study suggested preventive and effective management measures required under land use land cover conditions to improve groundwater quality from pollution activity and the results of this comprehensive study to find out the sources of groundwater contamination to take remedial measures for the sustainable development of groundwater resources has immediate

1296,this study aimed to evaluate the degree of groundwater pollution and to assess the contribution of specific ionic sources to groundwater thereby helping to identify the changes in groundwater chemistry and also in groundwater quality from a rural part of telangana india using the comprehensive understanding of geochemical ratios gr pollution index of groundwater pig unmix model um and land use land cover groundwater samples collected 22 from the study area were analysed for ph ec tds ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f the hydrogeochemical diagram showed the dominant groundwater type of ca2 mg2 hco3 due to the water soil rock interactions gr chloro alkaline indices and saturation indices revealed the groundwater chemistry that explains the mineral weathering and dissolution ion exchange and evaporation processes as the chief geogenic origin and also the contamination of surface water due to the influence of household wastewater septic tank leaks irrigation return flows chemical composts etc as the secondary anthropogenic sources on the aquifer system changes in groundwater quality from the recharge area to the discharge area and the correlation coefficient of chemical variables further supported the sources of geogenic and anthropogenic origins according to pig s calculations the present study area was classified as the insignificant pollution zone 5 89 which shows all chemical variables within their drinking water quality limits and the low pollution zone 43 34 medium pollution zone 27 48 high pollution zone 17 34 and very high pollution zone 5 95 which exhibit the tds mg2 na k hco3 cl no3 so4 2 and f contents above the drinking water quality standards this indicates the gradual increase in the intensity of pollution activity um also classified the contribution of specific ions 50 into three sources source i k measures the poor sewage conditions and potash fertilizers source ii so4 2 mg2 no3 na and ca2 specifies the poor sewage conditions irrigation return flows and chemical fertilizers gypsum and nitrate and source iii f and hco3 represents the dissolution of fluoride minerals as a major contributor to groundwater chemistry furthermore the land use land cover observations had also supported the assessment of groundwater pollution levels and the contribution of specific ionic sources made by pig and um as a result the present study clearly indicated that groundwater quality of a geogenic origin is primarily overcome the impact of anthropogenic sources therefore the present study suggested strategic measures to control groundwater pollution and improve groundwater quality graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords groundwater geochemical processes anthropogenic sources groundwater pollution index unmix model land use land cover 1 introduction water plays a vital role in the survival of living beings as well as in the economic development of any country however the severe stress on groundwater resources is ever increasing due to the high amount of consumption for the present rapid construction development activities other than drinking agricultural and industrial needs consequently declining groundwater levels and deteriorating groundwater quality have become a serious problem especially in the hard rock aquifers deeapali et al 2012 sonkamble et al 2012 thomas et al 2015 sethy et al 2016 kadam et al 2021 thus groundwater in many parts of the world is detrimental to anthropogenic activities subba rao 2012 ahada and suthar 2019 egbueri 2020 wagh et al 2020 ahmad et al 2021 lack of strict environmental control management measures makes such vulnerable problems which are common in developing countries such as india subba rao 2012 2020 manikandana et al 2020 mukate et al 2020 people in many parts of india are facing groundwater pollution problems especially due to the uncontrolled anthropogenic activity brindha et al 2017 karunanidhi et al 2019 balamurugan et al 2020 gaikwad et al 2020 sakram et al 2022a hence it is necessary to know the specific ionic sources which change the chemistry of groundwater and thereby cause groundwater pollution such information will help to implement suitable methods to improve groundwater quality therefore sustainable development and management of groundwater resources and their protection from pollution activity play a vital role in the indian economy in recent times many research studies have focused on mechanisms that determine the factors for groundwater pollution as a result of geogenic natural and non geogenic artificial sources depending on the climatic conditions topographical features geological setup water flow paths recharge and discharge areas etc singh et al 2017 jalili et al 2018 azhdarpoor et al 2019 soleimani et al 2018 badeenezhad et al 2020 manikandana et al 2020 which provides a tool for distinguishing groundwater chemistry ionic concentrations in groundwater have been described to distinguish the sources of geogenic and anthropogenic sources that change groundwater quality tian et al 2015 brindha et al 2017 nageswara rao et al 2017 wagh et al 2018 li et al 2019 differences in ionic concentrations have been identified for use in many sectors to estimate the chemical composition of groundwater ledesma ruiz et al 2016 panneerselvam et al 2020 the geochemistry of groundwater due to the impact of landfills and rainwater flow from the agricultural fields is vulnerable to non geogenic inputs wagh et al 2017 balamurugan et al 2020 mukate et al 2020 subba rao 2020 geochemical ratios can be used to understand the chemical processes that take place between the water and soils rocks as well as the water and anthropogenic activities that alter the chemical composition of groundwater subba rao et al 2019 2020a 2020c haji et al 2021 sakram et al 2022b in general most of the groundwater chemistry is geogenic processes water soil rock contact resident time of groundwater dissolution ion exchange and evaporation and non geogenic sources household waste septic tank leakage agricultural fertilizers irrigation return flows etc that can change the chemical composition of groundwater ledesma ruiz et al 2016 nageswara rao et al 2017 gaikwad et al 2020 on the other hand statistical methods can explain the relationship between chemical variables such as weathering and dissolution of the minerals ion exchange evaporation etc and provide evidence on the variation of concentrations caused by drainage wastewaters irrigation return flows chemical fertilizers etc hussin et al 2016 singh et al 2017 deepali et al 2021 the pollution index of groundwater pig not only helps to estimate pollution activity on the groundwater system through specific ionic sources but also to quantify the vulnerable zones to make a healthy society by taking effective preventive measures subba rao et al 2018 subba rao and chaudhary 2019 egbueri 2020 wagh et al 2020 kadam et al 2021 the unmix model um classifies the chemical variables into different sources based on natural processes and artificial activities which explain the contribution of specific ions to the aquifer system and the consequent results being more helpful in understanding groundwater contamination issues nagaraju et al 2018 gulgundi and shetty 2019 subba rao et al 2020a furthermore land use landcover dynamics especially household wastewater discharge septic tank leaks irrigation return flows chemical fertilizers animal wastes industrial wastes etc can damage the natural chemical composition of groundwater and consequently degrade groundwater quality groundwater resources are undesirable for any purpose patra et al 2018 manikandana et al 2020 badeenezhad et al 2020 2021 ahmad et al 2021 therefore studies on the geochemistry of groundwater needs to identify the sources of geogenic and non geogenic sources that change the groundwater quality everywhere previous studies from the current research area telangana india have focused on a general groundwater chemistry describing the factors governing groundwater chemistry b assessment of groundwater quality suitability for drinking agricultural and industrial water purposes and c possible health risk problems due to the consumption of nitrate and fluoride contaminated groundwater subba rao et al 2021a 2021b 2021c however these studies did not explain groundwater chemistry using the hydrogeochemical types geochemical ratios ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 cl hco3 ca2 na na cl na cl vs sec f na f hco3 f ca2 f no3 cl no3 cl so4 2 so4 2 no3 k cl and k so4 2 chloro alkaline indices and saturation indices and did not quantify groundwater pollution levels using the pig and also these studies did not estimate contribution of specific ionic sources to the groundwater body performing the um and did not assess groundwater quality in relation to land use land cover this is the major lacuna in the present study area to fill this gap the present study was taken up with the following objectives a evaluation of possible control processes of groundwater chemistry using the hydrogeochemical types geochemical ratios chloro alkaline indices and saturation indices b quantification of groundwater contamination levels using the pig c estimation of the contribution of specific ionic sources to the aquifer system using the um and d assessment of land use land cover impact on groundwater quality therefore the results of a comprehensive understanding of this study will help to take effective management plans for the sustainable development of groundwater resources not only in telangana and india but also in other parts of the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 location rainfall and geology the present study area is located in the nalgonda district of telangana india fig 1a it experiences a semi arid climate the annual average temperature ranges from 17 c in winter december to february to 40 c in summer march to may the annual average rainfall is about 750 mm southwest monsoons june to september contribute 70 northeast monsoons october to november 19 and the rest of non monsoon december to may 11 of the total

a sub dendritic type which is a characteristic of granite terrain topographically the present study area shows a gentle slope running from northwest to southeast fig 2 clay soils form the dominant type in many places concretions containing calcium carbonate are formed as intercalations in soils subba rao et al 2021a the study area is covered by hard rock formations of the precambrian age they include granite rocks with dolerite and quartzite of medium to coarse grained as younger intrusive bodies the rocks contain the mineral assemblages of quartz feldspar biotite hornblende fluorite and apatite subba rao et al 2021b 2 1 2 hydrogeology rainfall is the primary source and the irrigation return flow is the secondary source for recharging groundwater the occurrence of rocks has a limited primary porosity however the weathered and fractured rock portions are developed by geological activities as important aquifer formations subba rao et al 2021c the thickness of the weathered rock portion is between 4 and 27 m while that of the fractured rock portion is from 13 to 87 m from the ground level groundwater is present in the water table conditions as well as in the semi confined conditions the depth of the wells is 21 to 61 m below ground level bgl depth to groundwater level ranges from 3 63 to 13 50 m bgl higher depth to groundwater level is on the northwest side and lower depth on the southeast side following topographical features fig 1a as shown in the cross section of the hydrogeological conditions drawn from northwest to southeast figs 1a and 2 the depth of topsoil is 1 to 1 5 m from the ground surface this reduces the permeability to some extent as a result of the weathering process in the upper part of the host rocks the topsoil follows the weathering zone with depths ranging from 1 5 to 15 8 m showing low permeability due to limited pore spaces to allow water movement the weathered zone is followed by the fractured rock zone and its depth ranges from 12 6 to 51 5 m showing high permeability due to the development of a continuous connection of pore spaces within to allow water to flow freely from one pore space to another finally the unfractured rock portion follows the fractured zone the depth to groundwater level is 2 to 5 m bgl being deeper on the upstream northwest side which is a recharge area and lower on the downstream southeast side which is a discharge area following the topographical features 2 1 3 groundwater quality and health implications groundwater quality has been observed to be poor in many locations due to the poor drainage conditions septic tank spills irrigation return flows animal waste and excessive use of agrochemicals for high crop yields health problems discoloration of teeth fluorosis etc have been observed in some locations during fieldwork 2 2 groundwater sampling and chemical analysis a groundwater survey was conducted using the survey of india topographic sheet 56 0 4 on a scale of 1 50 000 to identify wells available for sampling twenty two wells were inventoried during fieldwork 2015 fig 1a and groundwater samples were collected in duplicate from them after pumping two to three times to contain freshwater from the aquifer soak them in 1 1 hcl for 24 h rinse with distilled water and then rinse with deionized water then groundwater samples were stored in the laboratory for chemical analysis ph and specific electrical conductivity sec were measured on site using their meters hanna hi 9811 5 sec was used to compute the total dissolved solids tds using the standard formula of sec x 0 65 hem 1991 subba rao 2017a according to the standard water quality procedures of apha 2012 calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na and potassium k bicarbonate hco3 chloride cl sulfate so4 2 nitrate no3 and fluoride f were estimated the titration method was applied to estimate calcium ca2 and total hardness th with the standard solution of edta the computational method was applied to calculate magnesium mg2 by taking the difference between th and ca2 bicarbonate and cl ions were determined by titration of the standard solution methods of h2so4 and agno3 respectively for the estimation of sodium na and potassium k a flame photometer systronics 130 was used sulfate so4 2 was measured using a uv visible spectrophotometer systronics 135 nitrate no3 was determined using a colorimeter systronics 112 fluoride f was measured using a specific ion analyzer orion all chemical variables except ph no units and sec μs cm at 25o c are expressed in milligrams per litre mg l and also in milliequivalent per litre me l the error of ionic balance eib was calculated to check the accuracy of the chemical composition expressed in meq l of cations cc and anions ca for each groundwater sample following eq 1 which was less than 5 reflecting reasonably good subba rao 2017a 1 e i b cc ca cc ca x 100 2 3 calculation of chloro alkaline indices to distinguish cation exchange and reverse ion exchange processes in the groundwater system chloro alkaline indices ca1 and ca2 were used schoeller 1977 and calculated using eqs 2 and 3 according to these indices if the ions ca2 and mg2 in groundwater are replaced by the ions na and k in the aquifer materials it is called a cation exchange process when the na and k ions in groundwater are replaced by the ca2 and mg2 ions in the aquifer materials it is called a reverse ion exchange process 2 ca 1 cl na k cl 3 ca 2 cl na k hco 3 co 3 2 so 4 2 no 3 2 4 calculation of saturation indices the equilibrium state of water with respect to a particular mineral phase can be determined by calculating the saturation index si using chemical data to distinguish the hydrogeochemical evolution as well as by identifying the geochemical reactions that control the water chemistry li et al 2019 using the geochemical software phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 si was computed the ion activity product iap which was compared to the solubility product ksp eq 4 4 si k iap k sp if si is greater than zero it indicates an oversaturation precipitation of a particular mineral if it is less than zero it reveals an unsaturation dissolution of a concerned mineral if it is equal to zero it indicates the saturation equilibrium of a particular mineral 2 5 calculation procedure for a rating of total groundwater pollution levels the level rating of groundwater pollution is based on the relative health significance of chemical variables for drinking purpose the pollution index of groundwater pig established by subba rao 2012 was adopted here calculating pig involves five steps in the first step the relative weight rw of 1 to 5 was assigned to each chemical variable based on its relative impact on human health caused by the pollution activity table 1 in the second step the weight parameter wp for each chemical variable was determined eq 5 based on its relative contribution to aquifer chemistry in the third step the status of the concentration sc was assessed by dividing the concentration c of each water sample by its corresponding standard water quality limit sd eq 6 in the fourth step the overall water quality ow was computed by multiplying wp by sc eq 7 finally the pig was calculated by summing all values of ow σow eq 8 5 wp rw rw 6 sc c sd 7 ow wp x sc 8 pig ow when pig is less than 1 0 it is classified as insignificant pollution when it is from 1 0 to 1 5 it is called low pollution when it is between 1 5 and 2 0 it is considered moderate pollution when it varies from 2 0 to 2 5 it is categorized as high pollution when it is more than 2 5 it is called very high pollution subba rao 2012 2 6 estimation of specific ionic sources of groundwater quality chemical data of groundwater samples are also required to distinguish and evaluate specific ionic sources from the chemical quality of groundwater samples and for sample wise contribution of ionic sources ai et al 2014 sun and gui 2015 sun et al 2016 nagaraju et al 2018 subba rao et al 2020a for this purpose the chemical composition of the groundwater samples from the present study area was used utilizing the united states environmental protection agency usepa 2007 unmix model version 6 2 7 procedure for dividing sample locations with respect to land use land cover about 73 15 6 and 6 of the present study area is agricultural land wasteland built up land and surface water body fig 1b the main livelihood of the locals is agriculture unlimited use of chemical composts for high crop yields is common the main crops grown are rice cotton and pulses sanitary facilities are poor although the present study area mainly belongs to agricultural land it has been observed that some locations are almost free from sources of pollution caused by the impact of agricultural activities during fieldwork since the irrigation practices in these locations are limited compared to other locations locals are taking some extra precautions to avoid contaminating the land as a result the residents of these locations are using this water for their own needs therefore these specific sample locations are classified as lithological terrain to assess the impact of the land use land cover on groundwater quality for the current research purpose similarly locations observed from built up land affected by household wastewaters septic tank leakages etc are considered to be land of poor sewage conditions locations that are directly affected by irrigation return flows chemical fertilizers animal wastes etc are considered agricultural activity land accordingly the locations of groundwater samples examined from the study area to assess the effect of groundwater quality are divided into three parts four locations 1 6 18 and 22 come under the land of lithological terrain eight locations 7 11 12 14 15 17 19 and 21 come under the land of poor sewage conditions and ten locations 2 to 5 8 to 10 13 16 and 20 come under the land of agricultural activity 2 8 geographic information system gis the geographic information system gis is a software based technology to determine the spatial distribution of groundwater chemical quality karunanidhi et al 2020 arcgis software 10 7 was used for the spatial distribution of pollution index of groundwater pig zones using the inverse distance weighted interpolation technique kadam et al 2021 3 results and discussions 3 1 general groundwater quality description groundwater quality is essential for understanding the chemistry of groundwater and its suitability for drinking needs shabbir and ahmad 2015 badeenezhad et al 2020 table 2 presented a statistical summary of the physicochemical composition of groundwater ph value no units was from 6 74 to 9 25 sec from 320 to 5689 μs cm tds from 208 and 3698 mg l ca2 from 26 to 281 mg l mg2 from 5 to 248 mg l na from 22 to 700 mg l k from 1 to 30 mg l hco3 from 159 to 1129 mg l cl from 21 to 766 mg l so4 2 from 3 to 376 mg l no3 from 2 to 700 mg l and f from 0 27 to 4 73 mg l the average values of the corresponding chemical variables mg l were 7 62 no units 1938 32 μs cm 1318 134 66 223 7 3 535 256 93 200 and 1 72 accordingly the ionic dominant pattern was in the order of na ca2 mg2 k and hco3 cl no3 so4 2 f for cations and anions respectively furthermore na and hco3 ions were shown in high concentrations among cations and anions respectively which indicate the prevailing conditions of the rock weathering and dissolution processes wagh et al 2019 subba rao et al 2020a sakram et al 2022a concentrations of ph tds ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f were above drinking water quality limits of 6 5 to 8 5 500 mg l 75 mg l 30 mg l 200 mg l 12 mg l 300 mg l 250 mg l 200 mg l 45 mg l and 1 5 mg l in 4 55 sample 12 81 82

1a causing the gastrointestinal irritation salty taste laxative effect sour taste blue baby disease skeletal fluorosis etc bis 2012 who 2017 the wide variation in standard deviation sd of chemical variables indicates high spatial variability in groundwater chemistry subba rao et al 2020c in the present study sd varied from 0 53 to 832 which measures the occurrence of much greater spatial variation in groundwater chemistry furthermore the normal distribution of probability p was less than 0 05 in all chemical variables 0 01 to 0 04 except ca2 0 15 it also indicates the involvement of multi factors and or chemical processes in groundwater as reported in other areas by sun et al 2016 and subba rao et al 2020a 3 2 geochemical processes governing the chemistry of groundwater 3 2 1 hydrogeochemical types to understand the hydrogeochemical types and processes brindha et al 2017 manikandana et al 2020 deepali et al 2021 the chemical data of groundwater samples of the present study area were plotted in fig 3 in 50 of the total groundwater samples the ions ca2 mg2 and hco3 co2 3 exceed the ions na k and cl so4 2 in zone 5 indicating the carbonate hardness water or recharge water type ca2 mg2 hco3 this is a clear indication of the contribution of weathering of calcium feldspars and ferromagnesium minerals present in the country rocks subba rao et al 2019 kadam et al 2021 some groundwater samples 36 36 were observed in zone 6 representing the non carbonate hardness water or reverse ion exchange water type ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 due to the high ca2 mg2 and cl so4 2 ions than na k and hco3 co2 3 ions since no known geological sources of the cl and so4 2 ions in the groundwater of present study area higher concentrations of these ions than the hco3 ion clearly reflect the surface water contamination caused by the impact of drainage waste irrigation return flows gypsum etc on the chemical composition of groundwater deepali et al 2015 badeenezhad et al 2020 sakram et al 2022b some groundwater samples 9 09 were found in zone 7 which is characterized by non carbonate alkali water or saline water type na cl it shows higher concentrations of na k and cl so4 2 ions than ca2 mg2 and hco3 co2 3 ions causing saline water due to the man made pollution balamurugan et al 2020 gaikwad et al 2020 very few groundwater samples 4 55 were observed from zone 8 indicating an excess alkalinity water or cation exchange water type na hco3 it refers to the na k and hco3 co2 3 contents in excess of ca2 mg2 and cl so4 2 contents resulting in soil co2 contribution to groundwater subba rao 2017a therefore the diagram obviously indicated the groundwater quality which is mainly dominated by the ca2 mg2 hco3 type and changed to other water quality types due to the involvement of anthropogenic sources in the aquifer system 3 2 2 changes in groundwater quality from recharge area to discharge area progressive ionic enrichment during the stay of groundwater depends on the residence time of water in the subsurface under natural environmental conditions according to the anionic concept of schoeller 1967 ophori and toth 1989 and subba rao 2007 the recharge area indicates lower concentrations of so4 2 and cl ions and higher concentration of hco3 ions while the discharge area indicates higher concentrations of cl and so4 2 ions and lower concentration of hco3 ions in groundwater if anthropogenic sources contaminate surface water infiltrating into the groundwater the ionic enrichment pattern in the groundwater can change subba rao 2012 table 3 illustrated the change in groundwater quality from the recharge area to the discharge area in the present study area the ph tds ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f values varied from 6 8 to 7 5 no units 208 to 2229 32 to 200 12 to 175 22 to 260 4 to 12 159 to 519 21 to 496 18 to 194 2 2 to 574 and 0 27 to 0 60 mg l from the recharge area to discharge area the contributions of ca2 and hco3 ions decrease according to the contribution of the ionic concentration to the total ions while the mg2 na cl so4 2 and no3 ions increase to reflect the involvement of wastewater septic tank spills irrigation return flows chemical fertilizers etc in groundwater therefore groundwater is characterized by ca2 na mg2 k and hco3 cl so4 2 no3 f facies in the recharge area the mg2 na ca2 k and hco3 cl no3 so4 2 f facies in the middle area and the mg2 na ca2 k and cl no3 hco3 so4 2 f facies in the discharge area in particular gradual changes in the concentration of cl 21 to 496 mg l so4 2 18 to 194 mg l and no3 2 2 to 574 mg l from the recharge area to the discharge area table 3 reflected the infiltration of surface water contamination caused by irrigation return flows chemical fertilizers manures domestic sewage etc that reach the groundwater as also observed in other regions subba rao 2007 manikandana et al 2020 badeenezhad et al 2020 2021 egbueri 2020 3 2 3 mineral weathering process groundwater chemistry is governed by various processes in the aquifer system brindha et al 2017 to describe these processes geochemical ratios are widely used nagaraju et al 2018 panneerselvam et al 2020 the ratio ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 is used to estimate the role of mineral weathering and cation exchange processes deepali et al 2015 gaikwad et al 2020 in the present study area 22 73 of groundwater samples were found along the equiline of ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 in fig 4a it clearly reflected the chemistry of groundwater which is mainly controlled by the dissolution of carbonate and sulfate minerals most groundwater sampling points 45 45 were observed below the uniline of this ratio indicating cation exchange caused by removing ca2 and mg2 ions from water or adding high hco3 to groundwater by weathering and dissolution of sodium feldspars eq 9 however 31 82 of groundwater samples were found above the theoretical line which measures the reverse ion exchange process by the release of ca2 and mg2 ions from the aquifer material therefore the silicate weathering cation exchange reactions appear to be the major process regulating groundwater chemistry 9 2 naalsi 3 o 8 2 co 2 11 h 2 o sodium feldspar al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 4 h 4 sio 4 2 na 2 hco 3 in fig 4b the concentration of hco3 was higher than cl in 77 27 of the groundwater samples in the present study area this refers to the flushing of recharged water containing soil co2 and weathered materials saha et al 2019 however the abundance of na content over the ca2 content in 77 27 of the groundwater sampling points indicates the silicate weathering and or cation exchange processes subba rao 2017a 2017b that appear to be the chief source of na in groundwater chemistry fig 4c to distinguish the dissolution and ion exchange processes of minerals in the groundwater the ratio na cl is used as another tool wagh et al 2019 if this ratio is equal to one it represents halite dissolution hussin et al 2016 a high ratio of na cl 1 or a lower ratio 1 indicates silicate weathering cation exchange and reverse ion exchange processes respectively deepali et al 2021 according to fig 4d 22 73 of the chemical data of groundwater samples were observed along with the na cl line indicating halite dissolution however the release of na may be the result of weathering and dissolution of the plagioclase feldspars in the present study area some groundwater samples 4 55 showed a less than one of na cl ratio which reveals the groundwater chemistry affected by the reverse ion exchange reaction most groundwater samples 72 72 were found to have a higher na cl ratio this may be due to the effect of silicate weathering cation exchange process on groundwater which may release high amounts of na subba rao et al 2017a in general the high concentrations of f ions are a result of the high concentrations of na and hco3 ions and the low concentrations of ca2 ions in the groundwater it has also been reported in other regions due to f eqs 10 to 13 released by the dissolution of the fluoride minerals ahada and suthar 2019 deepali et al 2019 subba rao et al 2013 2017a 2020b accordingly the f should have a positive relationship with na and hco3 and a negative relationship with ca2 however the f showed a less positive correlation with na fig 5a and hco3 fig 5b and a negative correlation with ca2 fig 5c in the present study area this variation may be a consequence of a simultaneous increase or decrease in the ions depending on dissolution precipitation concentration effects etc admas et al 2001 subba rao 2017b furthermore there is a negative correlation between f and no3 fig 5d this refers to the weathering and dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals present in host rocks that cause f content in groundwater rather than an anthropogenic source 10 ca 5 f po 4 3 2 oh apatite ca 5 po 4 3 oh 2 2 f 11 k mg fe 3 alsio 3 o 10 f 2 2 oh biotite k mg fe 3 alsio 3 o 10 oh 2 2 f 12 ca 5 mg 5 si 6 al 2 o 22 f 2 2 oh hornblende ca 5

exchange processes brindha et al 2017 manikandana et al 2020 deepali et al 2015 chloro alkaline indices ca1 and ca2 were calculated using eqs 2 and 3 to further verify these phenomena and to predict which ion exchange process could primarily control the hydrogeochemistry in the present study area the computed values of these two indices changed from 0 04 to 0 28 averaging 0 69 and 0 14 respectively table 4 as exemplified in fig 6a 86 36 and 13 64 of the total groundwater samples showed the negative and positive values of these indices for cation exchange and reverse ion exchange processes respectively furthermore as observed in the na cl ratio fig 4d cation exchange was also found to be the dominant process compared to the reverse ion exchange that regulates groundwater chemistry in the present study area 3 2 3 2 evaporation process as the present study area experiences a semi arid climate and about 73 of the area is occupied by irrigation practices this leads to easier circulation of groundwater and consequently a higher evaporation rate such natural conditions usually enrich the dissolved salts in the groundwater system by recharge water to confirm this phenomenon the chemical data of groundwater sampling points were plotted in the na cl vs sec diagram fig 6b which explains the existing activity of the evaporation process with the increase in salinity sec most of the groundwater sampling points 90 01 spread horizontally this indicates that the na cl ratio remains constant with increasing sec thus it infers that evaporation occurs as the increase of na and cl contents in the groundwater the formation of carbonate concretions in the soils further supports the evaporation action due to the prolonged dry climatic conditions in the present study area subba rao et al 2021a 3 2 3 3 saturation indices in the present study area groundwater samples were undersaturated with respect to calcite 3 97 to 1 10 with an average of 2 26 dolomite 7 87 to 1 54 with an average of 4 41 gypsum 6 41 to 3 52 with an average of 4 54 and halite 10 75 to 7 80 with an average of 8 25 table 4 which were calculated eq 4 using phreeqc software parkhurst and appelo 1999 and demonstrated in fig 7 these conditions revealed the dissolved state of the corresponding mineral phases in the groundwater system however these mineral phases may not be the main sources in the present study area as these findings are excluded in collaboration with geology processes badana et al 2018 therefore high concentrations of ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 ions mentioned above in groundwater can also occur due to the infiltration of contaminated surface water due to the impact of household waste septic tank spillage irrigation return flow chemical compost etc wagh et al 2019 deepali et al 2021 3 2 3 4 anthropogenic sources basically groundwater chemistry is influenced by natural geological processes hem 1991 todd and mays 2011 however land use pattern plays an important role in significantly changing the chemical composition of groundwater subba rao 2017a 2017b patra et al 2018 manikandana et al 2020 ahmad et al 2021 the lack of geological sources of cl so4 2 and no3 ions indicate the contribution of these ions to groundwater through surface water contamination due to the impact of anthropogenic sources such as household waste septic tanks spills irrigation return flows chemical fertilizers animal waste etc rahmati et al 2015 badeenezhad et al 2020 2021 deepali et al 2021 to illustrate this phenomenon the ions cl so4 2 and no3 are considered indicators of surface water contamination in the present study area there is no geogenic source of so4 2 in groundwater therefore so4 2 must be the source of anthropogenic origin i e the application of gypsum as an amendment to change soil permeability eq 14 14 caso 4 2 h 2 o gypsum ca 2 so 4 2 2 h 2 o in the present study area concentrations of cl 326 to 496 mg l so4 2 374 to 376 mg l and no3 75 to 700 mg l with an average of 475 43 375 and 303 68 mg l were exceeded the drinking water quality standards of 250 200 and 45 mg l in 31 82 samples 2 to 4 8 9 16 and 20 9 09 samples 9 and 20 and 59 09 samples 2 to 5 8 to 10 12 13 16 17 20 and 21 of the total groundwater samples respectively these sample locations are shown in fig 1a corresponding ions are 1 30 to 1 98 1 87 to 1 88 and 1 67 to 15 56 times higher than the recommended limits of 250 200 and 45 mg l for drinking water bis 2012 however the standard deviation of these ions 193 107 and 227 table 2 indicated the multiple sources deepali et al 2021 furthermore cl showed a strong positive relationship with so4 2 fig 8a and no3 8b while so4 2 had a positive relationship with no3 8c they support multiple sources of surface water contamination which reaches groundwater through recharge water this may be caused by the impact of domestic waste septic tank leaks chemical composts irrigation return flows etc on groundwater chemistry furthermore the k had a significantly similar positive relationship with cl fig 9a and no3 fig 9b this reveals that the effect of irrigation return flows of water contaminated with the potassium compost is also a source of these ions 3 2 3 5 correlation between different chemical variable the correlation between different chemical variables helps to understand the possible causes of groundwater contamination badana et al 2018 deepali et al 2021 table 5 presented the results of pearson s correlation coefficient analysis strong positive relationship of tds with ca2 r 0 68 mg2 r 0 73 na2 r 0 93 hco3 r 0 72 cl r 0 98 so4 2 r 0 79 and no3 r 0 91 referred to the salinity tds controlled by these ions which are derived from weathering and dissolution of minerals and sources of anthropogenic activity deepali et al 2021 similarly it had a strong positive relationship of ca2 with cl r 0 75 and no3 r 71 and a moderately positive relationship with na2 r 56 and so4 2 r 49 indicating the dissolution of plagioclase feldspars calcium and sodium and sulfate minerals application of gypsum in the agricultural field which reaches the groundwater through surface water contamination subba rao et al 2013 rahmati et al 2015 magnesium showed good positive correlation table 5 with hco3 r 0 64 cl r 0 68 so4 2 r 0 65 and no3 r 0 64 and moderately positive correlation with na2 r 0 54 sodium had strong positive correlation with hco3 r 0 78 cl r 0 90 so4 2 r 0 71 and no3 r 0 79 these relationships can be the result of the effects of mineral dissolution drainage wastes septic tank leakage irrigation return flows chemical fertilizers etc brindha et al 2017 subba rao et al 2017a kadam et al 2021 bicarbonate expressed good positive relation with cl r 0 66 and moderately positive correlation with so4 2 r 0 45 and no3 r 0 47 it referred to the mixing of freshwater with surface contaminated water badana et al 2018 chloride exhibited strong positive relation so4 2 r 0 76 and no3 r 0 89 while so4 2 showed good correlation coefficient with no3 r 0 62 the variation in these relationships is a result of a concurrent increase or decrease in chemical variables based on dissolution precipitation ion exchange and ionic concentration subba rao et al 2017b however these correlations have clearly supported the impact of surface water pollution on the aquifer system rahmati et al 2015 wagh et al 2019 therefore these observations suggest that groundwater is strongly influenced by surface contamination sources and mineral weathering reactions 3 3 degree of groundwater pollution pollution of groundwater poses a serious threat to the water supply its potential evolution will have an impact on health therefore the assessment of groundwater pollution is an effective way to protect the safety of groundwater resources as mentioned groundwater pollution zones using the pig subba rao 2012 have the lowest pollution zone pig 1 0 low pollution zone pig 1 0 to 1 5 medium pollution zone pig 1 5 to 2 0 high pollution zone pig 2 0 to 2 5 and very high pollution zone pig 2 5 3 3 1 insignificant pollution zone to estimate the level of groundwater pollution the results of computed pig were presented in table 6 the pig values ranged from 0 31 to 4 70 with an average of 1 64 and their spatial distribution was illustrated in fig 10 an insignificant pollution zone covered by 5 89 of the study area the average value of this zone 0 68 was less than 1 0 the average ow value of ca2 0 07 mg2 0 02 na 0 04 k 0 01 hco3 0 08 cl 0 04 so4 2 0 03 no3 0 06 and f 0 08 was below 1 0 however the ph 0 12 and tds 0 14 showed an ow value above 0 1 because ph determines the solubility of salts and tds is the result of all chemical ions dissolved in water hem 1991 todd and mays 2011 groundwater samples in the insignificant pollution zone are generally observed from the area of the lithological terrain that is not affected by any anthropogenic sources the average values of ph and tds were found to be 7 79 and 555 43 mg l respectively table 6 with ph ranging from its safe limit of 6 5 to 8 5 but slightly above the tds desirable limit of 500 mg l allowed for drinking water purpose bis 2012 it is also important to note the remaining chemical variables such as ca2 80 29 mg l mg2 23 20 mg l na 82 43 mg l k 4 43 mg l hco3 352 29 mg l cl 78 43 mg l so4 2 35 54 no3 31 60 mg l and f 0 97 mg l showed their concentrations within the safe limits of 75 mg l 30 mg l 200 mg l 12 mg l 300 mg l 250 mg l 200 mg l 45 mg l and 1 5 mg l respectively recommended for drinking purpose table 6 bis 2012 these ions can be released from source materials under natural environmental hydrogeological conditions subba rao et al 2002 for instance the occurrence of co2 in the soil zone released from the decay of organic and root respiration is a major source of hco3 in groundwater eqs 15 and 16 ions ca2 mg2 na and k along with hco3 are derived from minerals due to the weathering and dissolution processes eqs 9 17 and 18 household waste irrigation return flows and potassium compost are also the main sources of mg2 na and k ions deepali et al 2015 human made activities such as domestic waste septic tank spills irrigation return flows and nitrogen compost are the chief sources of cl and no3 ions in groundwater badeenezhad et al 2020 wagh et al 2020 kadam et al 2021 the application of gypsum eq 14 and the occurrence of fluoride bearing minerals present in the rocks eqs 10 to 13 of the present study area are the prime sources of so4 2 and f ions respectively in addition to the effect of sulfate and phosphate fertilizers in the groundwater subba rao 2012 subba rao et al 2017b deepali et al 2019 since almost all chemical variables are within the drinking water quality limits the groundwater quality observed from the insignificant pollution zone can be considered as a natural occurrence of the groundwater quality type subba rao et al 2002 this will help to estimate the sources of the next higher pollution zones 15 co 2 h 2 o carbon dioxide h 2 co 3 16 h 2 co 3 carbonic acid h hco 3 17 caal 2 si 2 o 8 h 2 co 3 ½ o 2 al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4

study area showed the average pig value in the range of 1 0 to 1 5 average 1 24 with an average ow value of ph 0 12 tds 0 24 ca2 0 07 mg2 0 09 na 0 08 k 0 01 hco3 0 14 cl 0 07 so4 2 0 03 no3 0 16 and f 0 22 table 6 here the ow value of ph tds hco3 no3 and f was greater than 0 1 which indicates the probability of a pollution activity furthermore the average values of tds 966 29 mg l hco3 577 71 mg l no3 60 57 mg l and f 2 68 mg l were 1 93 1 93 1 35 and 1 79 times higher than the desirable limits of 500 300 45 and 1 5 mg l recommended for drinking water purposes respectively table 6 furthermore the ion no3 in this zone was 1 92 times higher than the concentration of no3 31 60 mg l in the insignificant zone indicating the onset of surface water contamination activity in the groundwater body mukate et al 2020 the concentration of no3 in groundwater is regulated by nitrification and denitrification processes the formation of ammonium nh4 and nitrate no3 is usually done by nitrogen fertilizers for instance the hydrolysis of urea eq 19 produces nh4 which undergoes oxidation and leads to no3 in groundwater in the aerobic state eq 20 similarly the decomposition of organic matter also causes no3 to form in groundwater eq 21 19 co nh 2 2 3 h 2 o 2 nh 4 2 oh co 2 urea 20 nh 4 2 o 2 no 3 2 h h 2 o ammonium 21 c 106 h 263 o 110 n 16 p 138 o 2 106 co 2 16 no 3 hpo 4 2 122 h 2 o 18 h organic matter on the other hand the combination of hco3 and f is an evolution of the chemical weathering and dissolution of fluoride rich minerals example eq 13 and the occurrence of no3 above the allowable limit of 45 mg l for drinking purposes is a result of the leaking of wastewaters from household waste septic tank spillages uncontrolled nitrogen fertilizers etc similar results have been reported from other regions subba rao et al 2012 2017a 2017b 2020a 2020c karunanidhi et al 2019 wagh et al 2019 therefore these observations obviously support the impact of groundwater pollution activity starting from a low pollution zone compared to the insignificant pollution zone in the present study area 3 3 3 medium pollution zone the medium pollution zone expanding 27 48 of the total investigated area fig 10 showed a pig ranging from 1 5 to 2 0 average 1 77 with an ow average of ph 0 12 tds 0 34 ca2 0 09 mg2 0 13 na 0 11 k 0 01 hco3 0 14 cl 0 11 so4 2 0 09 no3 0 56 and f 0 08 table 6 in this zone the ow value was higher than 0 1 in ph tds mg2 na hco3 cl and no3 values and the average concentrations of tds 1409 50 mg l mg2 77 mg l na 225 mg l hco3 558 mg l cl 269 50 mg l and no3 204 50 mg l were 2 82 2 57 1 13 1 86 1 08 and 4 54 times higher than the prescribed safe limits for drinking purposes table 6 however the value of no3 in this zone was 3 38 times higher than in the low pollution zone indicating human intervention on the groundwater system badeenezhad et al 2020 2021 kadam et al 2021 combinations of mg2 na and hco3 ions exhibited the effect of chemical weathering and dissolution of sodium plagioclase feldspars eq 9 and ferromagnesium minerals hornblende and biotite occurring in host rocks eqs 11 and 12 supplementation of tds mg2 na cl and no3 in groundwater represented the influence of surface water pollution caused by household waste septic tank leakages irrigation return flows and nitrogen composts rahmati et al 2015 subba rao et al 2017a 2017b balamurugan et al 2020 since tds is a total dissolved salt content the relationship between tds and other ions can be considered to a hypothetical assessment of anthropogenic sources on the aquifer body subba rao et al 2017a thus the increase of tds 966 29 to 1409 50 mg l with an increase in mg2 54 43 to 77 mg l na 167 14 to 225 mg l cl 179 86 to 269 50 mg l and no3 60 57 to 204 50 mg l from the low to medium pollution zone further supports this hypothesis table 6 as a result the observed chemical variables showed a higher content and consequently a higher value of ow representing the relatively high amount of groundwater contamination activity taking place in the low pollution zone to the medium pollution zone 3 3 4 high pollution zone the average values of ow of ph 0 12 tds 0 32 ca2 0 14 mg2 0 09 na 0 15 k 0 05 hco3 0 12 cl 0 15 so4 2 0 12 no3 0 87 and f 0 20 were observed in the high pollution zone covering 17 34 of the total present study area table 6 fig 10 the pig in this zone ranged from 2 0 to 2 5 average 2 33 in this zone the average ow value of ph ca2 na and hco3 were greater than 0 1 which reflects the weathering and dissolution of calcium and sodium feldspars eqs 9 and 17 while tds na cl so4 2 no3 and f may be the result of increased anthropogenic activities poor sewage conditions irrigation return flows utilization of gypsum and nitrogen compost on the aquifer system subba rao et al 2017a 2017b badeenezhad et al 2020 2021 deepali et al 2021 furthermore the average concentrations of tds 1813 50 mg l ca2 210 mg l mg2 54 50 mg l na 306 mg l hco3 500 mg l cl 311 50 mg l so4 2 202 mg l no3 321 mg l and f 2 44 mg l were 3 63 2 80 1 82 1 53 1 67 1 25 1 01 7 13 and 1 63 times higher than the recommended safe limits of potable water table 6 comparatively the no3 content in this zone was 1 57 times higher than in the medium pollution zone therefore these values clearly demonstrate the potential for groundwater pollution which is a higher amount compared to the medium pollution zone 3 3 5 very high pollution zone a pig greater than 2 5 average 3 62 was present in a much higher pollution zone 5 95 of the present study area fig 10 the average values of this zone ow were ph 0 12 tds 0 65 ca2 0 14 mg2 0 22 na 0 23 k 0 02 hco3 0 18 cl 0 22 so4 2 0 13 and no3 1 62 which are higher than 0 1 with the exception of f ion 0 10 table 6 the combination of ca2 mg2 na and hco3 ions may be the result of weathering and dissolution of calcium and sodium plagioclase feldspars eqs 9 and 17 and ferromagnesium minerals eqs 11 and 12 while that of tds na cl so4 2 and no3 clearly indicated the pollution activity caused by poor sewage conditions and agricultural activities in the groundwater subba rao et al 2017a 2017b badeenezhad et al 2020 2021 mukate et al 2020 subba rao 2020 deepali et al 2021 average values of tds 2655 mg l ca2 211 50 mg l mg2 132 mg l na 480 mg l hco3 732 25 mg l cl 554 75 mg l so4 2 219 mg l and no3 598 50 mg l were 5 31 2 82 4 40 2 40 2 44 2 22 1 10 and 13 30 times higher than the prescribed drinking water quality limits table 6 here also the no3 content was 1 87 times higher than in the high pollution zone these concentrations are further supportive of the high amount of pollution activity taking place in the groundwater system compared to the high pollution zone 3 4 estimation of the contribution of specific ionic sources the unmix model um of the united states environmental protection agency 2007 is another technique for the evaluation of specific ionic sources of chemical quality of groundwater according to um estimates three sources namely source i source ii and source iii were identified table 7 the computed minimum requirement min rsq in this model was 0 83 which contributes to 83 of the total variation exceeding the min rsq value of 0 80 ai et al 2014 it demonstrated the reliable informative modelling ability to estimate the contributions of pollution sources subba rao et al 2020a furthermore the relationship between predicted and observed concentrations of individual ions was greater than 0 60 r 0 67 to 0 97 fig 11 which also supports the acceptable efficiency of modelling sun et al 2016 in order to evaluate the specific ionic sources in the groundwater system the contributions of more than 50 of the ionic sources in the current research have been taken into consideration as suggested by subba rao et al 2020a 3 4 1 source i as presented in table 7 and fig 12 the source i was characterized by a high contribution of k 75 9 followed by ca2 19 no3 15 7 cl 8 7 hco3 7 2 mg2 5 6 na 0 so4 2 0 and f 0 ions the contribution of this source was 14 7 of the total ionic sources while the ionic source was 31 5 of the groundwater samples relatively the contribution of k was more than 50 under natural conditions it occurs in low concentrations because potassium minerals are more resistant to chemical weathering and can absorb k through clay products hem 1991 subba rao et al 2017a therefore the high contribution of k can be considered as the effect of man made activities poor sewage conditions and potash compost rather than the impact of lithological origin in the groundwater body karunanidhi et al 2019 subba rao 2020 therefore an average value of k was observed in high pollution zones compared to other zones at 20 mg l table 6 3 4 2 source ii in source ii so4 2 88 mg2 86 6 no3 84 3 na 74 6 and ca2 55 5 were high contributors compared to hco3 38 7 k 0 and f 0 with 56 5 of the total source of ions table 7 and fig 12 the contribution of this source to groundwater samples was 31 4 due to the high contributions of so4 2 mg2 no3 na and ca2 50 to groundwater sample locations groundwater in source ii is highly contaminated by anthropogenic sources due to the poor sewage conditions domestic waste septic tank spillages etc and agricultural related activities utilization of gypsum and nitrate composts compared to groundwater in source i this hypothesis is further confirmed by correlation coefficient r of so4 2 with mg2 0 65 no3 0 62 na 0 71 and ca2 0 49 mg2 with no3 0 64 na 0 54 and ca2 0 22 no3 with na 0 79 and ca2 0 71 and na with ca2 0 56 table 5 for these reasons ions including so4 2 46 86 to 219 mg l mg2 54 43 to 132 mg l no3 60 57 to 598 50 mg l na 167 14 to 480 mg l and ca2 112 to 211 50 mg l showed the high concentrations than their highest desirable limits prescribed for drinking purposes in low medium high and very high pollution zones table 6 3 4 3 source iii source iii showed the higher contributions of f 100 and hco3 54 1 followed by ca2 25 5 na 25 4 k 24 1 so4 2 12 cl 10 3 mg2 7 8 and no3 0 table 7 and fig 12 the total contribution of ionic sources was 28 8 while that of groundwater sample wise was 37 2 since the high contributions of f and hco3 ions in groundwater samples was more than 50 it may be the result of the weathering and dissolution of fluoride rich minerals eqs 10 to 13 under alkaline conditions as a major contributor of source iii to the aquifer system and also the effect of phosphate fertilizers deepali et al 2019 subba rao et al 2020b haji et al 2021 this further supports the average concentration of f 2 68 and 2 44 mg l in the low pollution zone as well as in the high pollution zone table 6 however the correlation coefficient between f and hco3 showed a low positive value r 0 28 table 5 this can be expected by masking the natural lithological source through a non lithological source deepali et al 2019 subba rao et al 2017b 3 5 impact of land use land cover on groundwater quality to further verify the ground reality of the various sources on the aquifer system depending on land use land cover the ions analysed from the groundwater of the present study area were arranged according to the classification of lithology weathering and dissolution of silicate and fluoride bearing minerals poor sewage conditions household wastes septic tank leakages etc and agricultural activities irrigation return flows agricultural composts etc the ions cl so4 2 and no3 have no geological origin in the present study area but the concentrations of these ions are higher compared to the drinking water quality criteria table 2 in 31 82 9 09 and 59 09 of the groundwater sampling locations thus these ions are considered good indicators of anthropogenic influences on groundwater chemistry badeenezhad et al 2020 2021 manikandana et al 2020 furthermore the contamination of no3 is the most critical and sensible environmental indicator that supports the design enforcement and monitoring of regulatory policies wick et al 2012 therefore ion no3 is considered here to assess the impact of pollution input on the aquifer system 3 5 1 effect of lithology on groundwater quality the average values mg l of ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f examined from the lithological zone were 113 33 34 13 124 5 476 165 33 59 33 3 73 and 1 89 respectively table 8 among cations na is the most abundant ion while among anions hco3 is the dominant ion which indicates the weathering and dissolution processes of rock minerals eq 9 it refers to the freshwater quality environment sonkamble et al 2012 subba rao 2012 sethy et al 2016 furthermore the concentration no3 3 73 mg l was found to be below its safe limit of 45 mg l allowed for drinking water quality purposes bis 2012 which obviously indicates that no impact of anthropogenic sources poor sewage conditions and or agricultural activities is on groundwater badeenezhad et al 2020 2021 subba rao 2012 however the f content 1 89 mg l exceeds the recommended highest desirable limit of 1 5 mg l for drinking water which is mainly due to the occurrence of fluoride rich minerals present in the host rocks but not caused by anthropogenic sources deepali et al 2019 subba rao et al 2020b therefore the observed value of the no3 in the lithological zone can be considered as a natural phenomenon of groundwater quality 3 5 2 impact of poor sewage conditions on groundwater quality average values mg l of ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f were 92 25 34 56 135 13 5 50 461 38 119 63 36 54 47 13 and 2 07 respectively where the locations of groundwater samples were affected by poor sewage conditions table 8 the ions ca2 mg2 na hco3 and f are derived mainly from the calcium and sodium feldspars ferromagnesium and fluoride bearing minerals present in the basement rocks eqs 9 to 13 17 and 18 on the other hand the cl 119 63 mg l and so4 2 36 54 mg l values were lower than the drinking water quality standards bis 2012 however the ion no3 47 13 mg l was 1 05 times higher than the safe limit 45 mg l while the f 2 07 mg l was 1 38 times greater than the recommended limit of 1 5 mg l for drinking purposes bis 2012 furthermore the ionic concentration of no3 was 12 64 times higher than that in the lithological zone indicating that it masks the influence of the lithological source on groundwater by anthropogenic sources subba rao 2012 subba rao et al 2002 2012 badeenezhad et al 2020 2021 wagh et al 2020 gaikwad et al 2020 therefore it is clear evidence of contamination activity on groundwater due to the household wastewaters septic tank leakages etc compared to groundwater quality values in the lithological zone 3 5 3 impact of agricultural activities on groundwater quality locations of the groundwater samples affected primarily by agricultural activity were showed the ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f in the respective concentrations of 178 50 90 80 120 20 8 30 603 90 383 20 167 20 369 80 and 1 35 mg l table 8 in particular the values of ca2 mg2 na and hco3 ions reflected the processes of weathering and dissolution of calcium and sodium feldspars eqs 9 and 17 and ferromagnesium minerals present in the host rocks eqs 11 and 12 however the cl so4 2 and no3 ions specified the influence of irrigation return flows application of gypsum eq 14 and nitrogen composts on groundwater subba rao et al 2017a 2017b mukate et al 2020 egbueri 2020 subba rao 2020 on the other hand the ions cl 383 20 mg l and no3 369 80 mg l were 1 53 and 8 22 times higher than the recommended limits of 250 and 45 mg l respectively for drinking water bis 2012 the so4 2 content was 2 82 to 4 57 times higher than in the lands of lithology and poor sewage conditions furthermore the concentration of no3 was 7 85 times higher than in groundwater influenced by poor sewage conditions while it was 99 14 times higher than in the lithological zone this is a significant indication of the impact of anthropogenic origin on the groundwater quality of a lithological origin as a major source of surface water pollution activity as also reported in other regions by deeapali et al 2012 badeenezhad et al 2020 and balamurugan et al 2020 3 6 conceptual model the conceptual model provides simplified information to understand the controlling processes of aquifer chemistry groundwater chemistry is generally based on natural hydrogeological environmental conditions subba rao et al 2002 subba rao 2007 the chemical quality of groundwater is mostly characterized by the ca2 mg2 hco3 type as a result of the water soil rock interactions associated with the weathering and dissolution of silicate minerals cation exchange and evaporation processes however improper disposal of household wastewater and septic tank spills from the residential areas and unrestricted use of irrigation return flows chemical composts etc from the agricultural areas have damaged the quality of natural groundwater furthermore changes in groundwater quality from the recharge area to the discharge area and the high correlations among cl so4 2 and no3 ions clearly support this hypothetical phenomenon as a result the pig um and land use land cover observations also indicate poor chemical quality caused by surface water pollution due to the impact of anthropogenic sources the intensity of anthropogenic pollution sources has been observed to obscure the impact of geogenic sources on the groundwater system therefore a proper management plan is needed to protect the aquifer system 3 7 groundwater quality protection and management measures according to the observations made from the technologies of gr pig um and land use land cover the present study shows that the chemical quality of groundwater is contaminated in some places by geogenic water soil rock interactions sources and in other places it is mainly caused by non geogenic household waste septic tank leakages irrigation returns flows chemical fertilizers etc sources therefore to create a healthy environment for groundwater resources the following protection and management measures are suggested a wells near household waste septic tank spills etc should not be used for drinking until groundwater is treated b limit the use of irrigation return flows pesticides and other chemical fertilizers especially potash sulfate and nitrate is necessary to prevent groundwater contamination from them according to the soil characteristics c regular monitoring of groundwater quality should be carried out to identify the sources of pollution and their flow directions to prevent pollution activities accordingly d groundwater recharge systems roof top rainwater structures percolation tanks and recharge pits should be implemented on a war footing to raise groundwater levels and thereby improve groundwater quality through a simple dilution process which is an easier method than the more expensive methods and e local people need education on various aspects of the environment to successfully implement preventive and effective management measures in a timely manner 4 conclusions geochemical ratios gr pollution index of groundwater pig unmix model um and land use land cover conditions were used in the present study area to classify the degree of groundwater pollution as well as to assess the sources of specific ions in groundwater it is an important comprehensive approach to identify changes in groundwater chemistry and consequently groundwater quality the results of the present study were summarized with the following conclusions according to the hydrogeochemical types groundwater quality showed the ca2 mg2 hco3 ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 na cl and na hco3 types in 50 36 36 9 09 and 4 55 of the groundwater samples respectively geogenic origin water soil rock interactions appeared to be the main source and anthropogenic activity as the secondary source on the aquifer system gr such as ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 cl hco3 ca2 na na cl na cl vs sec f na f hco3 f ca2 f no3 cl no3 cl so4 2 so4 2 no3 k cl and k so4 2 chloro alkaline indices and saturation indices clearly defined the groundwater chemistry that is regulated by the mineral weathering and dissolution ion exchange and evaporation processes as the main geogenic sources while surface water contamination caused by household waste septic tank spills irrigation return flows agricultural fertilizers etc as the secondary anthropogenic sources the relationships of chemical variables also further supported the origins of sources gradual increase in the contents of cl 21 to 496 mg l so4 2 18 to 194 mg l and no3 2 2 to 574 mg l from the recharge area to the discharge area indicated the infiltration of contaminated surface water caused by irrigation return flows chemical fertilizers manures domestic sewage etc that enters the groundwater the pig results classified the study area as the insignificant pollution zone 5 89 describing the drinking water quality within limits of all chemical parameters while the low pollution zone 43 34 medium pollution zone 27 48 high pollution zone 17 34 and very high pollution zone 5 95 representing the high tds mg2 na k hco3 cl no3 so4 2 and f values above the standard drinking water quality limits indicating the gradual increase in pollution activity three specific ionic sources using the um were classified based on their contribution to groundwater greater than 50 source i k explains the effect of the poor sewage conditions and potash composts source ii so4 2 mg2 no3 na and ca2 measures the impact of poor sewage conditions irrigation return flows and agrochemicals gypsum and nitrate and source iii f and hco refers to the dissolution of the fluoride rich minerals land use land cover conditions were established more substantially as per the facts observed from pig and um the intensity of anthropogenic pollution sources has been found to overcome the impact of geogenic sources on the groundwater the present study suggested preventive and effective management measures required under land use land cover conditions to improve groundwater quality from pollution activity and the results of this comprehensive study to find out the sources of groundwater contamination to take remedial measures for the sustainable development of groundwater resources has immediate

1297,in this study a fixed mix stochastic fractional programming fsfp method is developed for balancing the water allocation conflict between upstream hydropower generation and downstream agricultural irrigation fsfp has advantages in dealing with ratio objective problem under uncertainty reflecting the dynamic and stochastic characteristics over a long term planning context as well as analyzing interrelationships between system efficiency and violation risk of water allocation target then fsfp is firstly applied to tuyamuyun reservoir in the lower reach of amu darya river basin central asia where multiple scenarios based on different hydropower generation targets and inflow levels are examined for identifying the complex relationship between hydropower generation and crop irrigation major findings and managerial insights can be summarized as i with the reduction of reservoir inflow water allocation for downstream agricultural irrigation would decrease by 30 4 once the minimum demand is satisfied and hydropower generation should be higher priority for pursuing higher marginal benefit ii with the shrinking water supply and rising hydropower generation target cotton planting should be firstly restrained due to its high water demand and grape planting is encouraged iii under extreme water scarcity i e low and very low inflow levels low level hydropower generation target i e α 0 45 is desired for meeting the food requirement in the study basin iv for alleviating the water shortage during dry seasons it is recommended that water storage should be conducted in autumn and winter and water release for crop irrigation should be implemented during spring and summer these findings can help managers identify sustainable water allocation schemes for agricultural irrigation and hydropower generation against water shortage environmental destruction and energy insecurity in arid regions keywords agricultural irrigation amu darya river basin fractional programming hydropower generation stochastic programming 1 introduction water resources are pivotal for ensuring food security and stable energy supply in a reservoir system rapid population growth and economic development have brought about soaring water demands and intensified the water use conflicts between agricultural irrigation and energy generation lee and jung 2018 li et al 2020 babamiri et al 2021 for example in a river basin the upstream region often increases reservoir water storage for power generation in winter and reduces the downstream water supply which affects the downstream agricultural production in summer the release of water from the upstream region in the non growing season often leads to flooding in the downstream countries which would result in serious water and food crisis thushara de silva and hornberger 2019 according to fao 2020 3 2 billion people have been suffering water scarcity and unbalanced water allocation has resulted in an annual loss of 23 8 billion us veldkamp et al 2017 tan et al 2020 optimizing water allocation of crop irrigation and hydropower generation is desired for guaranteeing sustainable development of the region however some parameters of the reservoir system may be uncertain due to the variations of natural and socioeconomic conditions for example randomness of precipitation may lead to random inflow of reservoir which can increase the complexity of decision making process in reservoir system martinsen et al 2019 nie et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to develop an effective method to generate sustainable reservoir management schemes for agriculture irrigation and hydropower generation under uncertainty previously many stochastic programming methods were developed for tackling resources management problems with random uncertainty marchant et al 2018 kashanian et al 2020 xiao et al 2022 for example yao et al 2019 proposed a multi stage programming method for optimizing regional water resources where the uncertainty of available water was expressed as discrete variables şahin et al 2020 developed a multi stage stochastic technique for making the demand response optimization under uncertainty where upper and lower bounds of the relevant scenarios were obtained through a scenario group sub problem approach li et al 2021a proposed a multi stage stochastic programming method for planning water resource management where the uncertainty of economic and technical data expressed as distribution probabilities in general multistage stochastic programming msp can effectively conduct analysis of multiple policy scenarios with uncertain data and adequately reflect the dynamic variations of system conditions li et al 2008 however msp may encounter difficulties in tackling large scale water management problems with persistent hydrological records fixed mix stochastic programming fsp has advantage in simplifying the solution process by using a fixed probability level is advanced on the base of msp therefore fsp model can be better applied to deal with large scale practical problems over a long term planning context liu et al 2014 however traditional fsp methods often consider a maximum crop yield or a minimum water allocation as a single objective function which neglects the conflicting objectives within the reservoir system in arid regions managers usually prefer to achieve maximum system output with minimum water allocation i e marginal benefit due to limited water resources dai et al 2021 li et al 2021b fractional programming fp can optimize system efficiency i e marginal benefit through ratio functions cost volume output input or cost time and has been commonly used in water management problems tan and zhang 2018 arya and singh 2019 for instance mani et al 2016 developed a linear fractional programming method for dealing with the conjunctive use problem of reservoir water and groundwater where the objective is maximizing the ratio of total groundwater allocation to the total deficit of reservoir storages niu et al 2019 developed a multi objective linear fractional programming model for optimizing crop planting and water resource management where the coordination of agricultural production ecological protection and water saving target was achieved with an optimal system efficiency although fp is effective in handling ratio objective problems it cannot tackle the uncertainty within system wang et al 2018 however no studies were reported on coupling fsp and fp methods for planning water resources in a reservoir system therefore this study aims to develop a novel fixed mix stochastic fractional programming fsfp method for planning water resources in reservoir system under uncertainty compared with traditional multi stage stochastic method the fsfp method can address bi objective problems and reflect dynamic variations of large scale practical problems over a long term planning context in comparison with conventional fractional

revealed d ξ h ξ and t ξ are the random parameters e q x ξ is the expected value of random variable ξ meaning the economic resource when the x value not be satisfied there are two kinds of decision variables one is decided before the achievement of random variables are revealed x which means the pre formulated policy the other is decided after the random variables are calculating y which is the relevant corrective measures against any infeasibility if the pre target x cannot be satisfied it would produce economic punishment y and result in decrease of economic benefit therefore fsp can establish a connection between final decision and pre formulated policy by introduction of economic recourse e q x ξ according to this connection and the optimization result decision makers can raise or reduce target x to achieve higher economic benefit in the practical water resources management system many uncertainties and random events may appear such as random inflow and water demand in each period as well as uncertain economic data managers have made pre decisions and water resource allocation schemes that may change after the occurrence of random events therefore it is necessary to modify the previous decision to reduce economic loss and achieve the optimal allocation of water resources among different water users in order to solve such problem by linear programming the distribution of ξ must be approximated by a discrete function let random variable ξ take values of ξ h with a probability level p h where p h is the probability of occurrence for random event with p h

3 1 study area amu darya river is the largest river in central asia with the length of 2540 km and annual average flow of 65 6 km3 its runoff mainly originates from glacier and snow melting during wet seasons from april to august jalilov et al 2016 the tuyamuyun reservoir is the largest reservoir in the lower reach of amu darya river basin located on the border between turkmenistan and uzbekistan which regulates the annual runoff of the amu darya downstream with a storage capacity of 7 8 km3 olsson et al 2010 water from the tuyamuyun reservoir is mainly allocation for agriculture and hydropower generation as shown in fig 1 the reservoir possesses the installed hydropower capacity of 150 mw and provides irrigation for one million ha cropland in the districts of karakalpakstan khorezm and dashaguz the economy mainly depends on agricultural activity and hydropower generation in the lower reach of amu darya river basin agricultural production is dominated by irrigation in the region because of scarce precipitation and excessive evaporation djanibekov and finger 2018 sun et al 2019 since 1960 with the increase of crop planting area and electricity demand water inflow of the area sea basin has dramatic reduced resulting in 75 00 water surface area being disappeared bekchanov and lamers 2016a due to the limited water resources annual average electricity generation of tuyamuyun hydropower station is about 525 38 106 kwh only satisfying 57 12 of electricity demand as a result nearly one third of the population in this region face the problem of insufficient heating in winter in order to meet the power demand a large amount of water is discharged from the reservoir in autumn and winter resulting in the decrease of irrigation water in spring and summer insufficient irrigation water has led to widespread yield reduction and threatened downstream food security e g nearly 1 million people in the study area suffer from severe food insecurity fao 2020 therefore it is imperative to make effective water allocation plans for balancing the contraction of upstream hydropower generation and downstream agricultural irrigation 3 2 modeling formulation a fsfp model is formulated for managing agricultural irrigation and hydropower generation as shown in fig 1 the objective is a ratio of system benefit to water use which can achieve the maximum marginal benefit the system benefit includes net income of water use and economic punishment when water demand is not satisfied in detail the objective can be formulated as 6a max f npro agr npro hyd twa 1 net

provided in the appendix a in this study five α levels 1 0 75 0 6 0 45 and 0 3 of hydropower generation target and five inflow levels are examined for the reservoir system the range of hydropower generation value is gained based on the experience of experts and stakeholders through expert consultations and survey questionnaires jalilov et al 2018 roidt and avellán 2019 which is modified by historical records of total electricity consumption of each district from the statistical yearbooks https stat uz uz in this study α denotes the percentage of satisfying maximum hydropower generation targets higher α means a preference of water allocation for upstream hydropower generation for example α 1 represents the electricity generation of the hydropower station operating at the installed capacity α 0 3 corresponds to 30 of maximum power generation in the hydropower stations the changed inflows of tuyamuyun reservoir are considered as discrete values to approximate the stochastic inflow values in different periods including very high vh high h medium m low l and very low vl as shown in table 1 each scenario would correspond to a fixed probability level p th in each period e g l l l five main crops are considered as agricultural water users i e cotton wheat rice tomato and grape that consume the majority of water in each period specifically cotton is sown in april or may and harvested in october wheat is cultivated from october to july rice is cultivated from april to july tomato is sown in february or march and harvested in august grape is cultivated from june to august liu et al 2014 accordingly the planning horizon of this study includes five stages including october to december in 2022 january to march april to may june to july and august to september in 2023 3 3 data collection and analysis data related to socioeconomic agriculture soil salinity electricity demand water and land resources are collected from the corresponding websites statistical yearbooks site investigation and relevant literatures for example the benefit and economic punishment of crop the cost of water fertilizer and fixed operation are obtained from the statistical yearbooks of uzbekistan and turkmenistan 2010 2015 https stat uz uz as well as some related literatures thevs et al 2015 bekchanov and lamers 2016b soil salinity and leaching fraction are obtained from some field experiments and published papers about the research area devkota et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 the relevant information about the tuyamuyun reservoir including reservoir capacity annual hydropower generation water inflow and probability of each inflow level is from the website of central asia water information http www cawater info net the inflow and its probability are calculated according to the runoff of the tuyamuyun hydrological station from 1960 to 2015 table 2 presents the irrigation water targets ta ij for each crop in three regions which are pre defined according to the local management policies of water and land resources table 3 shows the net irrigation benefit and penalty of crop in each subarea which are mainly dependent on local government reports and policy investigate https stat uz uz sun et al 2019 specifically if the committed water is satisfied the net economy benefit nb ij will be obtained for unit of water allocated however if the committed water is not satisfied water need be transferred from other regions with higher costs or the demands of water resource must be decreased by reducing industrial and agricultural production 4 result and discussion fig 2 shows the marginal benefit and total water allocation under all policy scenarios α levels result shows marginal benefit would reduce with deceased α level the highest marginal benefit would occur under α 1 i e 81 84 10 3 us m3 the lowest one would occur when α 0 3 i e 73 12 10 3 us m3 high α level indicates higher hydropower generation target i e a preference of water allocation for upstream hydropower generation and lower marginal benefit low α level indicates lower hydropower generation target meaning a preference for downstream agricultural irrigation the total water allocation would decrease by 3 37 109 m3 with the reduction of α level in detail water allocation for hydropower generation would reduce and irrigation water allocation would increase with the decrease of α level for example with α level decreased from α 1 to α 0 3 the water allocation for hydropower generation decreased by 69 90 from 4 12 109 m3 to 1 24 109 m3 under medium inflow level irrigation water would increase by 1 02 109 m3 in karakalpakstan and increase by 30 36 106 m3 in dashaguz different α would reflect the manager s expectation to realize the maximized marginal benefit with different hydropower production limitations decision makers can acquire the compromise among marginal benefit agricultural irrigation and hydropower generation by varying α levels the solutions of the water allocation patterns under all scenarios are shown as fig 3 results indicate that the total water allocation would decrease by 53 35 with the reduction of reservoir inflow the highest water allocation would be 10 63 109 m3 in period 4 under very high inflow level and α 0 75 the lowest water allocation would be 450 36 106 m3 during period 1 under very low inflow level and α 0 3 with the reduction of reservoir inflow water allocation for downstream agricultural irrigation would firstly decrease once the minimum commitment target is ensured e g decreased by 30 41 from very high to very low inflow level the largest change of water allocation would occur in karakalpakstan e g decrease by 52 05 in period 4 under α 0 45 due to its lowest economic benefit water allocation of hydropower generation should be of higher priority because it brings higher economic benefit when its water requirement is satisfied therefore the promised hydropower generation targets would be totally satisfied under sufficient water inflow i e very high high and medium inflow levels fig 4 shows the proportions of water allocation for upstream hydropower generation and downstream agricultural irrigation water for hydropower generation would account for the majority of total available water in periods 1 and 2 e g 76 01 in period 1and 61 26 in period 2 under α 1 and medium inflow level with the rise of crop planning area and irrigation water demand the amount of water allocation for downstream agricultural irrigation would increase in the periods 3 and 4 for example the irrigation water would account for 82 98 and water allocation for hydropower generation would account for 17 02 in the period 5 the water allocation for hydropower generation would increase with the harvest of crop e g accounting for 32 55 under α 1 and medium inflow level this is because most crops would be sown in period 3 and harvested in period 4 corresponding to higher water demand than other periods fig 5 shows water storage of the reservoir in different periods under all scenarios results present that water storage would increase in periods 1 and 2 october march water release would arise for meeting the irrigation requirements in periods 3 and 4 april july with the crop harvest in period 5 managers should reduce the amount of water release and consider storing water in the reservoir for irrigation in next year for example water storage of 1 75 109 m3 during the wet seasons august and september under α 0 3 can be utilized to meet water demand of wheat planting in karakalpakstan 1 55 109 m3 in a year which would alleviate the pressure of water supply during the dry seasons in terms of reservoir regulation and management water storage should be conducted in autumn and winter and water should be released for crop irrigation in spring and summer table 4 shows the satisfactory degrees of water allocation targets for all users under α 1 under very high and high inflow levels water use contradiction between upstream and downstream would be alleviated the satisfactory degrees of hydropower generation and agricultural would be nearly 100 00 and 80 00 respectively when the inflow reduces from very high to very low level annual satisfactory degree of hydropower generation would decrease from 100 00 to 32 91 annual satisfactory degree of agriculture would decrease from 81 33 to 40 82 due to the low efficiency of irrigation water demand of crop cannot be fully met even under very high and high inflow levels policy and strategy should be made with the consideration of advanced irrigation water saving techniques under low and very low inflows all users in these regions would suffer from serious water shortage and the contradiction between upstream hydropower generation and downstream irrigation would be intensified in detail water demand of hydropower generation would not be fully met e g 86 32 and 32 91 under low and very low inflow levels respectively the satisfactory degrees of agriculture would be only 40 82 under very low inflow level therefore managers need to find a compromise among energy demand and crop production by varying α levels results indicate that the target of hydropower generation is better controlled at about 591 36 106 kwh i e α 0 45 under low and very low inflow levels for meeting the food requirement optimized water deficits for all users in five periods under α 0 45 are shown in fig 6 result shows the water deficit in period 1 would be lowest water deficit in period 4 would be highest because the climate of periods 1 2 and 5 autumn and winter is not suitable for crop growth leading to relatively less water requirement and shortage in these periods in detail the water shortage of wheat would be largest in period 1 which would be larger than the shortage in period 2 for example water shortage of wheat would decrease by 13 68 from period 1 to period 2 in karakalpakstan under very low inflow level and α 0 45 this is mainly because water allocation for salinity leaching would be considered for reducing soil salinity before wheat sowing in period 1 the water shortage of other crops would be the largest in period 4 the deficit of rice would be the largest e g 33 12 106 m3 under α 0 45 and very low inflow level grape would be the least one e g 3 89 106 m3 under α 0 45 and very low inflow level this is mainly because of the high yield and low water use corresponding to high system benefit of grape implying that water resources would be firstly allocated to grape with the expansion of irrigated agriculture results also present that water shortage of khorezm would be the least e g accounting for 17 73 of the total water shortage under α 0 45 due to its location upper stream and advanced water saving measures therefore water resources would be firstly delivered to khorezm and it should be of higher priority fig 7 presents the land use patterns across three regions under α 0 45 results present that wheat would account for the highest planting area in karakalpakstan and khorezm e g 39 75 and 33 41 under high inflow level respectively cotton would account for the highest proportion e g 49 43 under high inflow level in dashaguz this is mainly due to higher economic benefit of cotton planting and related governmental policy the highest planting target of cotton among all regions in addition crop planting structure would be affected by uncertain inflow levels for example the main crop of dashaguz would change from grape to cotton with the reduction of inflow level due to its poor environmental conditions i e severe soil salinization the results also show that cotton is the most sensitive crop to the change of inflow level which is mainly related to its high benefit high economic punishment and low water requirement when the water supply is insufficient the proportion of cotton and wheat can appropriately drop to pursue higher marginal benefit in order to further illustrate the applicability of fsfp model a traditional fixed mix stochastic programming fsp model was introduced into the study for comparison fleten et al 2002 xie et al 2010 wu et al 2016 the decision makers would obtain the maximum system benefit without considering the minimum water distribution from fsp model table 5 shows that marginal benefit of the fsp would range from 72 61 10 3 us m3 to 75 46 10 3 us m3 which would be lower than that of fsfp fig 8 shows the total water allocation from fsfp would be lower than fsp especially for irrigation water for example irrigation water allocation would be 15 54 109 m3 from fsfp and 16 64 109 m3 from fsp under very high inflow level and α 0 45 in general fsfp would consume less amount of water resources and result in higher marginal benefit illustrating that fsfp model is more effective in adaption to the changes of inflow level and α level than the fsp model the water saving potential of fsfp not only brings higher system benefit in current period but also can alleviate the water shortage in next period through reservoir regulation which could help managers make better use of limited water resources 5 conclusions in this study a fixed mix stochastic fractional programming fsfp method has been developed through integrating fractional programming fp and fixed mix stochastic programming fsp into a general framework fsfp can deal with bi objective problem associated with system benefit maximization and water use minimization and reflect the dynamics of decision making process over a multistage context under uncertainty moreover it can help analyze the interrelationship between system efficiency and violation risk of water allocation target under different policy scenarios the fsfp method has been applied to planning water resources allocation within a multi period context in a reservoir system of the lower reach of amu darya river basin where different scenarios of water supply and energy target have been examined the results are helpful for conducting effective allocation of water resources and balancing the conflict between hydropower generation and irrigation water under uncertainty results can be summarized as follows i the rise of hydropower generation target would result in the decrease of irrigation water and bring about the increase of marginal benefit i e increasing by 10 7 from α 0 3 to 1 ii with the reduction of reservoir inflow level water allocation for downstream agricultural irrigation would firstly decrease by 30 4 once the minimum demand is satisfied and hydropower generation should be of higher priority for pursuing higher marginal benefit iii under extreme water scarcity the scenarios of low and very low inflow levels hydropower generation target should be controlled at the low level i e α 0 45 for meeting food requirement according to the obtained results some managerial suggestions can be derived as a cotton planting should be firstly restrained due to its high water demand and grape planting is encouraged under high level hydropower target and insufficient water supply b water demand of crop cannot be fully met even under high level inflow due to the low irrigation efficiency therefore the improvement of irrigation infrastructure and water saving techniques should be considered for ensuring food security c considering the water deficit in dry seasons it is recommended that water storage should be conducted in autumn and winter and water release for crop irrigation should be implemented during spring and summer managers should adjust the reservoir regulation to realize reasonable distribution of water resources in different periods under changed water energy conditions e g inflow levels and electricity generation targets these findings can help policy makers effectively reallocate water resources and coordinate hydropower generation and agricultural irrigation towards sustainability credit authorship contribution statement

1297,in this study a fixed mix stochastic fractional programming fsfp method is developed for balancing the water allocation conflict between upstream hydropower generation and downstream agricultural irrigation fsfp has advantages in dealing with ratio objective problem under uncertainty reflecting the dynamic and stochastic characteristics over a long term planning context as well as analyzing interrelationships between system efficiency and violation risk of water allocation target then fsfp is firstly applied to tuyamuyun reservoir in the lower reach of amu darya river basin central asia where multiple scenarios based on different hydropower generation targets and inflow levels are examined for identifying the complex relationship between hydropower generation and crop irrigation major findings and managerial insights can be summarized as i with the reduction of reservoir inflow water allocation for downstream agricultural irrigation would decrease by 30 4 once the minimum demand is satisfied and hydropower generation should be higher priority for pursuing higher marginal benefit ii with the shrinking water supply and rising hydropower generation target cotton planting should be firstly restrained due to its high water demand and grape planting is encouraged iii under extreme water scarcity i e low and very low inflow levels low level hydropower generation target i e α 0 45 is desired for meeting the food requirement in the study basin iv for alleviating the water shortage during dry seasons it is recommended that water storage should be conducted in autumn and winter and water release for crop irrigation should be implemented during spring and summer these findings can help managers identify sustainable water allocation schemes for agricultural irrigation and hydropower generation against water shortage environmental destruction and energy insecurity in arid regions keywords agricultural irrigation amu darya river basin fractional programming hydropower generation stochastic programming 1 introduction water resources are pivotal for ensuring food security and stable energy supply in a reservoir system rapid population growth and economic development have brought about soaring water demands and intensified the water use conflicts between agricultural irrigation and energy generation lee and jung 2018 li et al 2020 babamiri et al 2021 for example in a river basin the upstream region often increases reservoir water storage for power generation in winter and reduces the downstream water supply which affects the downstream agricultural production in summer the release of water from the upstream region in the non growing season often leads to flooding in the downstream countries which would result in serious water and food crisis thushara de silva and hornberger 2019 according to fao 2020 3 2 billion people have been suffering water scarcity and unbalanced water allocation has resulted in an annual loss of 23 8 billion us veldkamp et al 2017 tan et al 2020 optimizing water allocation of crop irrigation and hydropower generation is desired for guaranteeing sustainable development of the region however some parameters of the reservoir system may be uncertain due to the variations of natural and socioeconomic conditions for example randomness of precipitation may lead to random inflow of reservoir which can increase the complexity of decision making process in reservoir system martinsen et al 2019 nie et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to develop an effective method to generate sustainable reservoir management schemes for agriculture irrigation and hydropower generation under uncertainty previously many stochastic programming methods were developed for tackling resources management problems with random uncertainty marchant et al 2018 kashanian et al 2020 xiao et al 2022 for example yao et al 2019 proposed a multi stage programming method for optimizing regional water resources where the uncertainty of available water was expressed as discrete variables şahin et al 2020 developed a multi stage stochastic technique for making the demand response optimization under uncertainty where upper and lower bounds of the relevant scenarios were obtained through a scenario group sub problem approach li et al 2021a proposed a multi stage stochastic programming method for planning water resource management where the uncertainty of economic and technical data expressed as distribution probabilities in general multistage stochastic programming msp can effectively conduct analysis of multiple policy scenarios with uncertain data and adequately reflect the dynamic variations of system conditions li et al 2008 however msp may encounter difficulties in tackling large scale water management problems with persistent hydrological records fixed mix stochastic programming fsp has advantage in simplifying the solution process by using a fixed probability level is advanced on the base of msp therefore fsp model can be better applied to deal with large scale practical problems over a long term planning context liu et al 2014 however traditional fsp methods often consider a maximum crop yield or a minimum water allocation as a single objective function which neglects the conflicting objectives within the reservoir system in arid regions managers usually prefer to achieve maximum system output with minimum water allocation i e marginal benefit due to limited water resources dai et al 2021 li et al 2021b fractional programming fp can optimize system efficiency i e marginal benefit through ratio functions cost volume output input or cost time and has been commonly used in water management problems tan and zhang 2018 arya and singh 2019 for instance mani et al 2016 developed a linear fractional programming method for dealing with the conjunctive use problem of reservoir water and groundwater where the objective is maximizing the ratio of total groundwater allocation to the total deficit of reservoir storages niu et al 2019 developed a multi objective linear fractional programming model for optimizing crop planting and water resource management where the coordination of agricultural production ecological protection and water saving target was achieved with an optimal system efficiency although fp is effective in handling ratio objective problems it cannot tackle the uncertainty within system wang et al 2018 however no studies were reported on coupling fsp and fp methods for planning water resources in a reservoir system therefore this study aims to develop a novel fixed mix stochastic fractional programming fsfp method for planning water resources in reservoir system under uncertainty compared with traditional multi stage stochastic method the fsfp method can address bi objective problems and reflect dynamic variations of large scale practical problems over a long term planning context in comparison with conventional fractional programming method the fsfp method can effectively tackle the dynamic interactive and uncertain characteristics of water resources management system the major novelty and contribution of this study can be listed as i this is the first attempt for integrating techniques of fp and fsp into a general framework for simultaneously dealing with conflicting objectives and stochastic uncertainty over a multistage context ii fsfp is applied to the lower reach of amu darya river basin for optimizing water resources allocation where multiple scenarios associated with different hydropower generation

can provide desired decision support for sustainable development in central asia 2 methodology based on the simple rebalancing rules i e permitting to modify the decisions at each time stage by

variables one is decided before the achievement of random variables are revealed x which means the pre formulated policy the other is decided after the random variables are calculating y which is the relevant corrective measures against any infeasibility if the pre target x cannot be satisfied it would produce economic punishment y and result in decrease of economic benefit therefore fsp can establish a connection between final decision and pre formulated policy by introduction of economic recourse e q x ξ according to this connection and the optimization result decision makers can raise or reduce target x to achieve higher economic benefit in the practical water resources management system many uncertainties and random events may appear such as random inflow and water demand in each period as well as uncertain economic data managers have made pre decisions and water resource allocation schemes that may change after the occurrence of random events therefore it is necessary to modify the previous decision to reduce economic loss and achieve the optimal allocation of water resources among different water users in order to solve such problem by linear programming the distribution of ξ must be approximated by a discrete function let random variable ξ take values of ξ h with a probability level p h where p h is the probability of occurrence for random event with p h 0 and h 1 h p h 1 fleten et al 2002 the expected value of the random variable can be expressed as 2 e q x ξ h 1 h p h q x ξ h h 1 h p h dy h then model 1 can be reformulated as follows 3a max f t 1 t

3 1 study area amu darya river is the largest river in central asia with the length of 2540 km and annual average flow of 65 6 km3 its runoff mainly originates from glacier and snow melting during wet seasons from april to august jalilov et al 2016 the tuyamuyun reservoir is the largest reservoir in the lower reach of amu darya river basin located on the border between turkmenistan and uzbekistan which regulates the annual runoff of the amu darya downstream with a storage capacity of 7 8 km3 olsson et al 2010 water from the tuyamuyun reservoir is mainly allocation for agriculture and hydropower generation as shown in fig 1 the reservoir possesses the installed hydropower capacity of 150 mw and provides irrigation for one million ha cropland in the districts of karakalpakstan khorezm and dashaguz the economy mainly depends on agricultural activity and hydropower generation in the lower reach of amu darya river basin agricultural production is dominated by irrigation in the region because of scarce precipitation and excessive evaporation djanibekov and finger 2018 sun et al 2019 since 1960 with the increase of crop planting area and electricity demand water inflow of the area sea basin has dramatic reduced resulting in 75 00 water surface area being disappeared bekchanov and lamers 2016a due to the limited water resources annual average electricity generation of tuyamuyun hydropower station is about 525 38 106 kwh only satisfying 57 12 of electricity demand as a result nearly one third of the population in this region face the problem of insufficient heating in winter in order to meet the power demand a large amount of water is discharged from the reservoir in autumn and winter resulting in the decrease of irrigation water in spring and summer insufficient irrigation water has led to widespread yield reduction and threatened downstream food security e g nearly 1 million people in the study area suffer from severe food insecurity fao 2020 therefore it is imperative to make effective water allocation plans for balancing the contraction of upstream hydropower generation and downstream agricultural irrigation 3 2 modeling formulation a fsfp model is formulated for managing agricultural irrigation and hydropower generation as shown in fig 1 the objective is a ratio of system benefit to water use which can achieve the maximum marginal benefit the system benefit includes net income of water use and economic punishment when water demand is not satisfied in detail the objective can be formulated as 6a max f npro agr npro hyd twa 1 net

provided in the appendix a in this study five α levels 1 0 75 0 6 0 45 and 0 3 of hydropower generation target and five inflow levels are examined for the reservoir system the range of hydropower generation value is gained based on the experience of experts and stakeholders through expert consultations and survey questionnaires jalilov et al 2018 roidt and avellán 2019 which is modified by historical records of total electricity consumption of each district from the statistical yearbooks https stat uz uz in this study α denotes the percentage of satisfying maximum hydropower generation targets higher α means a preference of water allocation for upstream hydropower generation for example α 1 represents the electricity generation of the hydropower station operating at the installed capacity α 0 3 corresponds to 30 of maximum power generation in the hydropower stations the changed inflows of tuyamuyun reservoir are considered as discrete values to approximate the stochastic inflow values in different periods including very high vh high h medium m low l and very low vl as shown in table 1 each scenario would correspond to a fixed probability level p th in each period e g l l l five main crops are considered as agricultural water users i e cotton wheat rice tomato and grape that consume the majority of water in each period specifically cotton is sown in april or may and harvested in october wheat is cultivated from october to july rice is cultivated from april to july tomato is sown in february or march and harvested in august grape is cultivated from june to august liu et al 2014 accordingly the planning horizon of this study includes five stages including october to december in 2022 january to march april to may june to july and august to september in 2023 3 3 data collection and analysis data related to socioeconomic agriculture soil salinity electricity demand water and land resources are collected from the corresponding websites statistical yearbooks site investigation and relevant literatures for example the benefit and economic punishment of crop the cost of water fertilizer and fixed operation are obtained from the statistical yearbooks of uzbekistan and turkmenistan 2010 2015 https stat uz uz as well as some related literatures thevs et al 2015 bekchanov and lamers 2016b soil salinity and leaching fraction are obtained from some field experiments and published papers about the research area devkota et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 the relevant information about the tuyamuyun reservoir including reservoir capacity annual hydropower generation water inflow and probability of each inflow level is from the website of central asia water information http www cawater info net the inflow and its probability are calculated according to the runoff of the tuyamuyun hydrological station from 1960 to 2015 table 2 presents the irrigation water targets ta ij for each crop in three regions which are pre defined according to the local management policies of water and land resources table 3 shows the net irrigation benefit and penalty of crop in each subarea which are mainly dependent on local government reports and policy investigate https stat uz uz sun et al 2019 specifically if the committed water is satisfied the net economy benefit nb ij will be obtained for unit of water allocated however if the committed water is not satisfied water need be transferred from other regions with higher costs or the demands of water resource must be decreased by reducing industrial and agricultural production 4 result and discussion fig 2 shows the marginal benefit and total water allocation under all policy scenarios α levels result shows marginal benefit would reduce with deceased α level the highest marginal benefit would occur under α 1 i e 81 84 10 3 us m3 the lowest one would occur when α 0 3 i e 73 12 10 3 us m3 high α level indicates higher hydropower generation target i e a preference of water allocation for upstream hydropower generation and lower marginal benefit low α level indicates lower hydropower generation target meaning a preference for downstream agricultural irrigation the total water allocation would decrease by 3 37 109 m3 with the reduction of α level in detail water allocation for hydropower generation would reduce and irrigation water allocation would increase with the decrease of α level for example with α level decreased from α 1 to α 0 3 the water allocation for hydropower generation decreased by 69 90 from 4 12 109 m3 to 1 24 109 m3 under medium inflow level irrigation water would increase by 1 02 109 m3 in karakalpakstan and increase by 30 36 106 m3 in dashaguz different α would reflect the manager s expectation to realize the maximized marginal benefit with different hydropower production limitations decision makers can acquire the compromise among marginal benefit agricultural irrigation and hydropower generation by varying α levels the solutions of the water allocation patterns under all scenarios are shown as fig 3 results indicate that the total water allocation would decrease by 53 35 with the reduction of reservoir inflow the highest water allocation would be 10 63 109 m3 in period 4 under very high inflow level and α 0 75 the lowest water allocation would be 450 36 106 m3 during period 1 under very low inflow level and α 0 3 with the reduction of reservoir inflow water allocation for downstream agricultural irrigation would firstly decrease once the minimum commitment target is ensured e g decreased by 30 41 from very high to very low inflow level the largest change of water allocation would occur in karakalpakstan e g decrease by 52 05 in period 4 under α 0 45 due to its lowest economic benefit water allocation of hydropower generation should be of higher priority because it brings higher economic benefit when its water requirement is satisfied therefore the promised hydropower generation targets would be totally satisfied under sufficient water inflow i e very high high and medium inflow levels fig 4 shows the proportions of water allocation for upstream hydropower generation and downstream agricultural irrigation water for hydropower generation would account for the majority of total available water in periods 1 and 2 e g 76 01 in period 1and 61 26 in period 2 under α 1 and medium inflow level with the rise of crop planning area and irrigation water demand the amount of water allocation for downstream agricultural irrigation would increase in the periods 3 and 4 for example the irrigation water would account for 82 98 and water allocation for hydropower generation would account for 17 02 in the period 5 the water allocation for hydropower generation would increase with the harvest of crop e g accounting for 32 55 under α 1 and medium inflow level this is because most crops would be sown in period 3 and harvested in period 4 corresponding to higher water demand than other periods fig 5 shows water storage of the reservoir in different periods under all scenarios results present that water storage would increase in periods 1 and 2 october march water release would arise for meeting the irrigation requirements in periods 3 and 4 april july with the crop harvest in period 5 managers should reduce the amount of water release and consider storing water in the reservoir for irrigation in next year for example water storage of 1 75 109 m3 during the wet seasons august and september under α 0 3 can be utilized to meet water demand of wheat planting in karakalpakstan 1 55 109 m3 in a year which would alleviate the pressure of water supply during the dry seasons in terms of reservoir regulation and management water storage should be conducted in autumn and winter and water should be released for crop irrigation in spring and summer table 4 shows the satisfactory degrees of water allocation targets for all users under α 1 under very high and high inflow levels water use contradiction between upstream and downstream would be alleviated the satisfactory degrees of hydropower generation and agricultural would be nearly 100 00 and 80 00 respectively when the inflow reduces from very high to very low level annual satisfactory degree of hydropower generation would decrease from 100 00 to 32 91 annual satisfactory degree of agriculture would decrease from 81 33 to 40 82 due to the low efficiency of irrigation water demand of crop cannot be fully met even under very high and high inflow levels policy and strategy should be made with the consideration of advanced irrigation water saving techniques under low and very low inflows all users in these regions would suffer from serious water shortage and the contradiction between upstream hydropower generation and downstream irrigation would be intensified in detail water demand of hydropower generation would not be fully met e g 86 32 and 32 91 under low and very low inflow levels respectively the satisfactory degrees of agriculture would be only 40 82 under very low inflow level therefore managers need to find a compromise among energy demand and crop production by varying α levels results indicate that the target of hydropower generation is better controlled at about 591 36 106 kwh i e α 0 45 under low and very low inflow levels for meeting the food requirement optimized water deficits for all users in five periods under α 0 45 are shown in fig 6 result shows the water deficit in period 1 would be lowest water deficit in period 4 would be highest because the climate of periods 1 2 and 5 autumn and winter is not suitable for crop growth leading to relatively less water requirement and shortage in these periods in detail the water shortage of wheat would be largest in period 1 which would be larger than the shortage in period 2 for example water shortage of wheat would decrease by 13 68 from period 1 to period 2 in karakalpakstan under very low inflow level and α 0 45 this is mainly because water allocation for salinity leaching would be considered for reducing soil salinity before wheat sowing in period 1 the water shortage of other crops would be the largest in period 4 the deficit of rice would be the largest e g 33 12 106 m3 under α 0 45 and very low inflow level grape would be the least one e g 3 89 106 m3 under α 0 45 and very low inflow level this is mainly because of the high yield and low water use corresponding to high system benefit of grape implying that water resources would be firstly allocated to grape with the expansion of irrigated agriculture results also present that water shortage of khorezm would be the least e g accounting for 17 73 of the total water shortage under α 0 45 due to its location upper stream and advanced water saving measures therefore water resources would be firstly delivered to khorezm and it should be of higher priority fig 7 presents the land use patterns across three regions under α 0 45 results present that wheat would account for the highest planting area in karakalpakstan and khorezm e g 39 75 and 33 41 under high inflow level respectively cotton would account for the highest proportion e g 49 43 under high inflow level in dashaguz this is mainly due to higher economic benefit of cotton planting and related governmental policy the highest planting target of cotton among all regions in addition crop planting structure would be affected by uncertain inflow levels for example the main crop of dashaguz would change from grape to cotton with the reduction of inflow level due to its poor environmental conditions i e severe soil salinization the results also show that cotton is the most sensitive crop to the change of inflow level which is mainly related to its high benefit high economic punishment and low water requirement when the water supply is insufficient the proportion of cotton and wheat can appropriately drop to pursue higher marginal benefit in order to further illustrate the applicability of fsfp model a traditional fixed mix stochastic programming fsp model was introduced into the study for comparison fleten et al 2002 xie et al 2010 wu et al 2016 the decision makers would obtain the maximum system benefit without considering the minimum water distribution from fsp model table 5 shows that marginal benefit of the fsp would range from 72 61 10 3 us m3 to 75 46 10 3 us m3 which would be lower than that of fsfp fig 8 shows the total water allocation from fsfp would be lower than fsp especially for irrigation water for example irrigation water allocation would be 15 54 109 m3 from fsfp and 16 64 109 m3 from fsp under very high inflow level and α 0 45 in general fsfp would consume less amount of water resources and result in higher marginal benefit illustrating that fsfp model is more effective in adaption to the changes of inflow level and α level than the fsp model the water saving potential of fsfp not only brings higher system benefit in current period but also can alleviate the water shortage in next period through reservoir regulation which could help managers make better use of limited water resources 5 conclusions in this study a fixed mix stochastic fractional programming fsfp method has been developed through integrating fractional programming fp and fixed mix stochastic programming fsp into a general framework fsfp can deal with bi objective problem associated with system benefit maximization and water use minimization and reflect the dynamics of decision making process over a multistage context under uncertainty moreover it can help analyze the interrelationship between system efficiency and violation risk of water allocation target under different policy scenarios the fsfp method has been applied to planning water resources allocation within a multi period context in a reservoir system of the lower reach of amu darya river basin where different scenarios of water supply and energy target have been examined the results are helpful for conducting effective allocation of water resources and balancing the conflict between hydropower generation and irrigation water under uncertainty results can be summarized as follows i the rise of hydropower generation target would result in the decrease of irrigation water and bring about the increase of marginal benefit i e increasing by 10 7 from α 0 3 to 1 ii with the reduction of reservoir inflow level water allocation for downstream agricultural irrigation would firstly decrease by 30 4 once the minimum demand is satisfied and hydropower generation should be of higher priority for pursuing higher marginal benefit iii under extreme water scarcity the scenarios of low and very low inflow levels hydropower generation target should be controlled at the low level i e α 0 45 for meeting food requirement according to the obtained results some managerial suggestions can be derived as a cotton planting should be firstly restrained due to its high water demand and grape planting is encouraged under high level hydropower target and insufficient water supply b water demand of crop cannot be fully met even under high level inflow due to the low irrigation efficiency therefore the improvement of irrigation infrastructure and water saving techniques should be considered for ensuring food security c considering the water deficit in dry seasons it is recommended that water storage should be conducted in autumn and winter and water release for crop irrigation should be implemented during spring and summer managers should adjust the reservoir regulation to realize reasonable distribution of water resources in different periods under changed water energy conditions e g inflow levels and electricity generation targets these findings can help policy makers effectively reallocate water resources and coordinate hydropower generation and agricultural irrigation towards sustainability credit authorship contribution statement

1298,the anaerobic degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons in a plume originating from a pintsch gas tar dnapl zone was investigated using molecular isotopic and microbial analyses benzene concentrations diminished at the relatively small meter scale dimensions of the nitrate reducing plume fringe the ratio of benzene to toluene ethylbenzene xylenes and naphthalene btexn in the fringe zone compared to the plume zone indicated relatively more loss of benzene in the fringe zone than texn this was substantiated by changes in relative concentrations of btexn and multi element compound specific isotope analysis for δ2h and δ13c this was supported by the presence of abca genes indicating the presumed benzene carboxylase enzyme in the nitrate reducing plume fringe biodegradation of most hydrocarbon contaminants at iron reducing conditions in the plume core appears to be quantitatively of greater significance due to the large volume of the plume core rather than relatively faster biodegradation under nitrate reducing conditions at the smaller volume of the plume fringe contaminant concentration reductions by biodegradation processes were shown to vary distinctively between the source plume both iron reducing and fringe nitrate reducing zones of the plume high anaerobic microbial activity was detected in the plume zone as well as in the dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl containing source zone biodegradation of most if not all other water soluble pintsch gas tar aromatic hydrocarbon contaminants occur at the relatively large dimensions of the anoxic plume core the highest diversity and concentrations of metabolites were detected in the iron reducing plume core where the sum of parent compounds of aromatic hydrocarbons was greater than 10 mg l the relatively high concentrations of metabolites suggest a hot spot for anaerobic degradation in the core of the plume downgradient but relatively close to the dnapl containing source zone graphical abstract unlabelled

hydrocarbons is a global problem mainly caused by spills and leaks related to the production and usage of petroleum products einarson and mackay 2001 kueper et al 2003 röling and van verseveld 2002 typically petroleum products are complex mixtures of hydrocarbons mcgregor et al 2012 sandercock and du pasquier 2003 sjögren et al 1995 once they invade the saturated subsurface as dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl water soluble compounds start partitioning from the dnapl into the groundwater forming contaminated groundwater plumes peters and luthy 1993 processes that mainly reduce the actual removal of the dissolved contaminants in the groundwater plume are due to retardation through adsorption to the soil matrix dilution through dispersion and biodegradation by microorganisms aronson and howard 1997 micic et al 2007 oka et al 2011 rogers et al 2002 wiedemeier et al 1999 at tar contaminated sites besides the commonly reported benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes btex in groundwater other aromatic hydrocarbon compounds such as styrene trimethylbenzenes ethyltoluenes indene indane naphthalene methylnaphthalenes and methylindenes are encountered micic et al 2007 schirmer et al 2006 zamfirescu and grathwohl 2001 for naphthalene degradation rates are generally low compared to those of btex gerritse et al 2004 while sorption dependent attenuation is a more prominent removal process due to a higher koc coefficient and relatively low water solubility rogers et al 2002 swartjes et al 2011 biodegradation of one or multiple monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons compounds has been shown to occur in laboratory and field studies under both oxic and anoxic conditions da silva and corseuil 2012 gibson et al 1968 gieg et al 2009 grbic galic and vogel 1987 biodegradation rates range widely and depend mostly on the molecular structure of the contaminant and the terminal electron accepting processes foght 2008 meckenstock et al 2016 meckenstock et al 2015 complex mixtures of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds in groundwater systems often lead to sequential attenuation of the individual components suarez and rifai 1999 biodegradation rates for some compounds might increase in different redox zones while they decrease for others suarez and rifai 1999 swartjes et al 2011 moreover in complex mixtures co metabolism can enhance biodegradation of certain recalcitrant compounds swartjes et al 2011 in contrast certain compounds can inhibit biodegradation due to toxicity swartjes et al 2011 the complex interplay between multiple contaminant compounds that are present in groundwater plumes abiotic and biotic attenuation processes sequential redox conditions and geohydrological setting makes it difficult to interpret biodegradation processes at contaminated sites while field studies have shown that under oxic conditions benzene biodegrades faster than toluene ethylbenzene or xylenes alvarez et al 1991 suarez and rifai 1999 under anoxic conditions biodegradation of benzene is generally slower than that of other aromatic compounds weelink et al 2010 biodegradation of benzene under nitrate reducing conditions has been observed atashgahi et al 2018 burland and edwards 1999 coates et al 2001 dou et al 2010 but the range of biodegradation rates is very wide in laboratory experiments often benzene is the recalcitrant compound and toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes tex show biodegradation suarez and rifai 1999 however at the field scale it was found that benzene potentially biodegrades nonetheless biodegradation of tex occurs at higher degradation rates than benzene aronson and howard 1997 it has been suggested that benzene biodegradation in shallow aquifers is actually enabled by the presence of low oxygen concentrations along the fringe of the contaminant groundwater plumes aronson and howard 1997 nonetheless to date a variety of bacteria using nitrate as electron acceptor and capable of benzene degradation have been isolated in a pure culture atashgahi et al 2018 coates et al 2001 dou et al 2010 vogt et al 2011 more recently laboratory studies showed strictly anaerobic degradation of benzene or naphthalene under iron or nitrate reducing conditions related to peptococcaceae members of the order clostridiales however naphthalene degraders were not able to degrade benzene indicating that benzene and naphthalene are biodegraded by different enzymes abca and nmsa respectively atashgahi et al 2018 cupples 2016 kleemann and meckenstock 2011 meckenstock and mouttaki 2011 musat et al 2009 toth et al 2018 van der waals et al 2017 van der zaan et al 2012 vogt et al 2011 to our knowledge no studies have been published on the relevance and presence of peptococcaceae throughout contaminated plumes at the field scale therefore this field study focuses on the biodegradation of a wide range of hydrocarbons that derive from the dissolution of pintsch gas tar in a two aquifer system dominated by denitrifying conditions in the surrounding native groundwater this was performed to assess the differences on the biodegradation of individual hydrocarbon compounds and benzene in specific in the presence of different electron acceptors 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the studied field site is located adjacent to the railway station in the city of amersfoort the netherlands on this site a manufactured gas plant mgp was active from 1910 until 1958 the hydrogeological situation consists of a two aquifer system the shallow aquifer from 2 to 12 m below ground surface mbgs consists of medium to silty fine sands and the deep aquifer from 12 to 85 mbgs of mainly coarse sands with gravel enclosures the general direction of groundwater flow in the shallow aquifer is to the southeast and to the northwest in the deep aquifer fig 1 locally at the mgp site groundwater flow shifts in the shallow aquifer due to sheet piling containment measures and absence of the confining layer fig 1 the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifers varies from k 5 m d in the shallow aquifer to k 15 m d in the deep aquifer the two aquifers are separated by a clay peat confining layer in the north fig 2 the clay peat layer thins out from more than 5 m thickness in the north to about 50 cm or less at the mgp site the aquitard fringe is situated some 50 m south of the dnapl source zone fig 2 in both aquifers liquid phase tar is detected as free flowing dnapl more background on the site partitioning behavior from the dnapl towards the plume and developed methods for detecting the dissolved contaminants and their metabolites were described earlier van leeuwen et al 2020 the contaminated mgp site was divided into different zones based on samples from groundwater sampling wells within each zone the upgradient zone represents non impacted groundwater and is used as a reference the source zone is the area where dnapl is located and the plume zone is representing the area of the groundwater dissolved contaminants the fringe zone represents the area where contaminant concentrations in groundwater are diminishing and mixing with the surrounding groundwater occurs by dispersion downgradient is the area located in the direction of flow for groundwater and contaminant concentrations below 10 μg l in table 1 the number of sampling wells in each zone is given 2 2 groundwater sampling to create a two dimensional transect of the groundwater contamination in the two aquifer system groundwater samples were obtained from 34 sampling wells the wells were selected along the groundwater flow direction fig 1 as well as along a transversal cross section of the plume fig 2 a comprehensive overview of the sampling wells is given in the supplementary information s3 to s9 to keep the groundwater samples anoxic while sampling marprene tubing rubber bv hilversum in combination with a peristaltic pump watson marlow type 604 u r ma usa was used some wells in the source zone contained dnapl to acquire clear groundwater samples these wells were pumped at a flow rate of 10 l h until groundwater breakthrough was established typically two to sixty liters of tar was pumped before groundwater break through started table 2 unaffected reference well 323 is located 145 m upgradient in the shallow aquifer 2 3 aromatic hydrocarbon analysis for the determination of concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds in the groundwater samples a gas chromatographic headspace analyses method was used analyses were performed on a shimadzu gc 2010 gas chromatograph equipped with a pal auto sampler shimadzu benelux s hertogenbosch the netherlands as previously

interface and a thermo scientific delta v advantage irms a comprehensive description of the used method is described in section s2 of the supplementary information the δ13c and δ2h data per sample for the detected hydrocarbon contaminants are given in section s8 and s9 respectively of the supplementary information 2 5 semi quantitative metabolite analysis putative metabolites of aromatic hydrocarbon degradation were analyzed by liquid chromatography using a shimadzu nexera uhplc system and a bruker maxis 4g quadrupole orthogonal accelerated time of flight mass spectrometer as described van leeuwen et al 2020 analytes were semi quantified by using a linear relation between polarity and the molar response factor where standards with known concentrations were used to define

organic carbon doc and oxygen are given in section s3 of the supplementary information physico chemical data is given in section s4 of the supplementary information 2 7 dna extraction and qpcr analysis for the extraction of dna 1 l groundwater samples were collected from monitoring wells in clean green glass bottles to prevent the introduction of oxygen the bottles were filled completely from the bottom up and let to overflow for a few minutes before sealing with a polypropylene screw cap the bottles were immediately put on ice in a cool box and transported to the laboratory the 1 l samples were vacuum filtered within 24 h for filtration 47 mm diameter 0 22 μm pore size hydrophilic filters were used millipore bv amsterdam the netherlands dna was subsequently extracted with the mobio powerlyzer kit according to the supplier s protocol mobio ca usa dna extracts were stored at 80 c until analyzed genes of general groups of micro organisms were detected that signify redox conditions such as nitrate reducers narg sulfite reducers drsa iron iii reducers 16s rrna geobacteraceae methanogens mcra and archaea 16s rrna additionally genes indicating bacteria and enzymes were targeted that are known to metabolize benzene such as peptococcaceae and benzene carboxylase abca furthermore two kinds of benzylsuccinate synthase bssa genes involved in toluene activation were analyzed those associated with sulfate iron bssa srb reducing and nitrate bssa reducing micro organisms additionally total bacteria were quantified 16s rrna an overview of all analyzed genes encoding and primers is given in the supplementary information s1 assays for qpcr analysis were performed on a cfx96 real time pcr machine bio rad as described van der waals et al 2017 detected gene copies for used essays are given per sample in section s7 of the supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 distribution of electron acceptors dissolved oxygen concentrations were below 0 5 mg l indicating anoxic conditions in all sampled groundwater wells in groundwater wells surrounding the contaminated area nitrate 24 33 mg l and sulfate 31 36 mg l were present a comprehensive list of hydrogeochemical data can be found in the supplementary information section s3 and s4 nitrate was depleted in the upgradient part of the source zone the complete oxidation of 1 mol of benzene or toluene to co2 would require reduction of 6 or 7 2 mol of nitrate to n2 respectively burland and edwards 1999 neglecting possible nitrate reduction to ammonium the influx of groundwater containing 24 33 mg l nitrate can therefore serve as an electron acceptor for the oxidation of only a relatively small fraction of the contaminant load present sulfate concentrations decreased along the groundwater path of flow and remained low 0 1 7 5 mg l throughout the plume zone along the groundwater path of flow in only 4 out of 34 sampling wells was sulfate below 1 mg l dissolved iron and manganese were not detected in the uncontaminated upstream reference well in contrast dissolved iron and manganese were detected in relatively high concentrations up to 14 6 mg l within the contaminated plume and fringe zones this is an indication of iron iii and manganese iv reduction by bacteria such as geobacteraceae which are known to use a wide range of aromatic compounds nealson 1994 dissolved iron and manganese were detected at similar concentrations which is remarkable since generally iron is five to ten times more abundant in soil systems than manganese nealson 1994 this observation may be explained by precipitation of ferrous iron with sulfide produced through sulfate reduction the solubility in water of fes is negligible whereas that of mns is 47 mg l at 18 c nealson 1994 it was reported that about 60 of the iron iii had been reduced to iron ii in the source zone and 35 of the ferric iron in the plume zone due to biodegradation of aromatic hydrocarbons from a tar contaminated site wege 2005 this suggests that at least 60 of iron iii in an aquifer was available to microorganisms for biodegradation of hydrocarbons over several decades moreover based on this outcome calculating the potential biodegraded contaminant load through iron ii reduction provides an insight in present and future groundwater plume stability stoichiometric relationships for the oxidation of naphthalene toluene and benzene are as follows 1 c 10 h 8 48 fe oh 3 10 hco 3 48 fe 2 28 h 2 o 86 oh 2 c 7 h 8 36 fe oh 3 7 hco 3 36 fe 2 22 h 2 o 65 oh 3 c 6 h 6 30 fe oh 3 6 hco 3 30 fe 2 18 h 2 o 54 oh stoichiometric relations imply that 2 7 kg of ferric iron are needed to biodegrade 1 mol 128 g of naphthalene for biodegradation of 1 mol of benzene 78 g or toluene 92 g 1 7 and 2 kg of ferric iron are needed respectively eq 2 and 3 in the netherlands generally 1 5 30 g dm3 fe oh 3 is present in sandy soils de vries 1999 this implies that for every kilogram of naphthalene a soil volume of on average 1 3 m3 is potentially sufficient as electron acceptor the total dimension of the contaminant plume zone at the investigated site is approximately 3 3 million m3 the contaminated soil volume of the plume at the former mgp site in amersfoort would potentially hold sufficient fe iii as electron acceptor for the biodegradation of 2 5 million kg naphthalene moreover acceptors such as nitrate and sulfate flow into the groundwater contaminated plume over an inflow area of 12 000 m2 300 m1 wide and down to 40mbgs the aquifer flows at a constant rate of 25 m y which implicates 300 000m3 y of water inflow into the contaminated area this amount of groundwater contained of 0 024 kg m3 and 0 035 kg m3 of nitrate and sulfate respectively in the upgradient reference well this would roughly contribute an additional 7200 kg y of nitrate and 10 500 kg y of sulfate as potential terminal electron acceptor to the contaminated area ferric iron is not replenished like nitrate and sulphate and might potentially deplete moreover various chemical reactions between iron and sulfur can occur in the fringe zone due to a relatively large iron reducing volume of the plume compared to a small nitrate reducing volume at the fringe zone reduction of ferric iron coupled to relatively slower biodegradation of most hydrocarbon contaminants within the plume zone appears quantitatively to be of greater significance than coupled to nitrate reduction in the fringe zone 3 2 distribution of aromatic hydrocarbons in the source zone the relatively light hydrocarbon compounds partition from the tar into the surrounding groundwater the liquid dnapl in the source zone is considered to be an instantaneous solute source the composition of the initial solute mixture c0 is determined by averaging the concentrations of partitioned tar compounds to water and is shown in fig 3 and described by van leeuwen et al 2020 the nine most abundant compounds that have partitioned into the groundwater are naphthalene 29 followed by toluene 22 and benzene 15 other compounds such as 2 methylnaphthalene 2 mn styrene indene xylenes and ethylbenzene were detected varying from 8 down to 2 the other 15 detected aromatic compounds at lower concentrations than ethylbenzene are not considered here not shown in fig 3 an overview of all detected contaminant compounds per sampling well is given in the supplementary information s5 propagation of the contaminant mixture by groundwater transport phenomena such as dispersion dilution and retardation have an prominent effect on the concentration profile along the groundwater path of flow composition of the aromatic hydrocarbon mix is besides dispersion affected by retardation for each compound koc values and retardation values for the nine most abundant aromatic hydrocarbons detected in the contaminant groundwater are given in table 3 abraham et al 1994 freeze and cherry 1979 the koc values used are obtained from chemical database gsi net com in the plume zone the composition of the contaminant mixture has changed compared to the source zone in the source zone naphthalene and toluene were the most abundant compounds fig 3 whereas in the plume zone the most abundant compounds were ethylbenzene and benzene with values of 0 56 and 0 71c c0 respectively fig 4 this may be attributed to the retardation effect as the koc value for ethylbenzene benzene and other aromatic hydrocarbons is lower than that of naphthalene fetter 1999 table 3 another compound from the most abundant hydrocarbon compounds 2 methylnaphthalene 2 mn has a relatively high koc and is expected to decrease less than naphthalene based on retardation however 2 mn decreased relatively the most of all compounds from the source zone to the plume zone fig 4 naphthalene is expected to decrease the most if only retardation played a role this is indicative for biodegradation of 2 mn within or relatively close 10 m1 to the source zone further downgradient 50 150 m1 from the plume zone to the fringe zone the highest relative loss was not observed for 2 mn but for styrene and toluene this suggests further down the groundwater path of flow in the contaminated groundwater plume biodegradation is different for 2 mn than close to the source zone and relatively less than for styrene and toluene further downgradient at the boundary of the groundwater plume where the plume zone transitions into the fringe and nitrate reducing conditions prevail the concentration of ethylbenzene is observed to decrease 2 5 times more than the upgradient decrease from source to plume zone remarkably the ratio of benzene to toluene changes at these downgradient nitrate reducing conditions at the boundaries of the contaminated groundwater plume upgradient from source zone to plume zone and from plume zone to fringe zone toluene concentrations are lower than benzene moreover further downgradient this is reversed and toluene concentrations are higher than benzene fig 4 overall the relative decrease of contaminant compound differences from source zone to plume zone compared to fringe zone to downgradient in other ratios than cannot be explained by retardation this suggests that biodegradation occurs for most contaminant compounds moreover decreases of individual contaminant compounds within the mix differ along the groundwater path of flow in different zones within the contaminant plume fig 4 to interpret the composition changes of compounds in the complex contaminant mixture along the path of groundwater flow two dimensional plots were produced where the concentration of 1 3 5 trimethylbenzene 1 3 5 tmb was plotted versus contaminant compounds as presented in fig 4 c1 3 5 tmb cx using all obtained groundwater samples figs 5 and 6 where c1 3 5 tmb is the concentration is of 1 3 5tmb and cx the concentration of a specific aromatic hydrocarbon from the contaminant mix naphthalene 1 2 3 trimethylbenzene 1 2 3 tmb and 1 2 4 trimethylbenzene 1 2 4 tmb show a comparative fit to linear dilution or dispersion only fig 5 benzene and toluene show the least fit to linear dilution and benzene as well as toluene concentration decrease relatively more than 1 3 5 tmb at relatively lower concentrations fig 6 although soil heterogeneity and retardation effects play a role in groundwater transport of contaminants relatively for the contaminant mix benzene shows the most deviation from dilution and naphthalene together with trimethylbenzenes the least fig 5 this indicates that naphthalene and trimethylbenzenes are the most conservative compounds in the contaminant mix tri substituted alkylbenzenes are less vulnerable to microbial degradation than monosubstituted alkylbenzenes peng et al 2021 moreover 1 3 5 tmb is recognized as the most conservative degrading aromatic hydrocarbon compound aamand et al 1989 aronson and howard 1997 baedecker et al 2011 peng et al 2021 richnow et al 2003 other contaminant compounds such as xylenes ethylbenzene styrene and 2 methylnaphthalene show however less distinct decreased relative concentrations corresponding to benzene and toluene versus 1 3 5 tmb naphthalene and benzene both non substituted cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are also known as anaerobically slow degrading compounds relative to other water soluble tar constituents aronson and howard 1997 flanagan et al 2014 wiedemeier et al 1999 the data obtained from this contaminated groundwater plume show that naphthalene is behaving in accordance however benzene is not benzene concentrations decrease in the same order as toluene concentrations when plotted to the most persistent compound in the mix 1 3 5 tmb fig 6 considering various redox conditions along the path of flow concentration ratios for benzene cb and toluene ct could be occurring at different conditions and are given in cb ct fig 7 in the source zone which is considered an instantaneous point source concentrations are relatively high for benzene 30 000 μg l and toluene 32 000 μg l the majority of samples containing dissolved iron and manganese yet no nitrate show a ratio of greater than one for benzene versus toluene fig 7 this could be explained by relatively more adsorption of toluene to the soil matrix since benzene has a lower retardation factor however some of the samples show a ratio smaller than one for benzene versus toluene fig 7 these samples relate to the fringe zone and its nitrate reducing conditions the surrounding groundwater contains nitrate which mixes in with the contaminated groundwater due to dispersion the relatively high toluene versus low benzene concentrations indicate more loss of benzene than of toluene under the nitrate reducing conditions at the fringe of the contaminant plume this composition change was also observed in sample locations above the source zone where an inflow of nitrate containing groundwater from upgradient occurs the lower ratio of benzene versus toluene in the up and downgradient locations cannot be explained by retardation effects or dilution through dispersion and therefore indicates greater biodegradation of benzene than toluene at nitrate reducing conditions in the plume fringe 3 3 multi element compound specific isotope fractionation fractionation of stable isotopes of hydrogen 2h 1h and carbon 13c 12c was determined for btex indene and naphthalene in contaminated groundwater samples to determine direct insight in the reaction mechanisms for biodegradation hydrogen δ2h and carbon δ13c enrichments were combined into two dimensional compound specific isotope analysis plots the slope of the linear regression leads to the apparent reaction mechanism and is expressed as the lambda value λ kümmel et al 2016 fig 8 lambda values indicate putative reaction mechanisms of aromatic hydrocarbon degradation pathways corresponding to carboxylation fumarate addition and hydroxylation vogt et al 2016 the λ value found for toluene λ 25 and o m xylene λ 20 both corresponded to anaerobic degradation via succinylation by fumarate addition fig 8 benzene isotope fractionation λ 19 corresponds to degradation via the putative carboxylation reaction mechanism in which benzene is carboxylated yielding benzoate abu laban et al 2010 luo et al 2014 vogt et al 2016 while the generated lambda value for ethylbenzene suggests hydroxylation this is based mainly on one datapoint representing high hydrogen fractionation the latter suggest a different reaction mechanism however no lambda values are published that represent other reaction mechanisms for ethylbenzene such as fumarate addition furthermore benzoylacetate was the only signature metabolite detected for ethylbenzene degradation which relates to the hydroxylation mechanism this metabolite was detected in 8 groundwater samples originating throughout the contaminated groundwater plume an overview of all detected metabolites per monitoring well are given in supplementary information s6 the λ value for naphthalene has a poor correlation r2 0 51 and does not correspond with a known carboxylation mechanism fig 8 this can be explained by masking of kinetic isotope fractionation because of the relatively low solubility of naphthalene resulting in diffusion controlled degradation vogt et al 2018 the λ value for indene has the least correlation of the presented 2d plots and no reference data could be acquired to compare the results with fig 8 the lowest values for fractionation of hydrogen δ2h and carbon δ13c isotopes were generally found in samples from the source zone and its proximity this indicates that a relatively large fraction of the total amount of contaminants in the source zone has not been biodegraded small fractionation values of carbon and hydrogen might not be reliably quantified and could be underestimated due to ongoing partitioning of aromatic hydrocarbons from the dnapl into the bypassing groundwater van leeuwen et al 2020 moreover the partitioning effect induced by groundwater flow could be increased by higher mass transfer rates caused by biodegradation langevoort and hassanizadeh 2009 simultaneous biodegradation and source partitioning could underestimate the biodegradation effect in the source zone vogt et al 2016 moreover ongoing partitioning of contaminant compounds from the instantaneous source to the groundwater potentially could create a double masking effect due to the fact that the partitioning takes place to an already biodegrading hydrocarbon mixture in the water phase and simultaneously is diluted by inflow of less contaminated groundwater from upgradient van leeuwen et al 2020 3 4 metabolites of aromatic hydrocarbon biodegradation the highest total concentration of metabolites in a single well 545 μg l was found at the start of the plume well a026 this well is located approximately 35 m downgradient of the source zone fig 1 fig 2 this suggests that the start of the plume governed by metal reducing conditions corresponds to a relatively high bio active zone abu laban et al 2010 beller et al 2008 jobelius et al 2011a 2011b kleemann and meckenstock 2011 nealson 1994 or metabolites accumulate due to conditions preventing complete contaminant mineralization in the source zone the second highest concentration of metabolites in a single well 321 μg l was detected in the fringe zone upgradient and downgradient highest total metabolite concentrations for a single well were measured at 40 μg l 37 μg l and 50 μg l respectively a comprehensive overview of all detected metabolites per groundwater sample is given in section s6 of the supplementary information these findings indicate that biodegradation occurs in the plume zone and in the source zone the upgradient reference sample fringe zone and downgradient samples all show some metabolite presence however at relatively low concentrations it has been reported that the highest concentrations of metabolites occurred at plume fringes abu laban et al 2010 elsner 2010 while at this mgp site in amersfoort the netherlands the highest concentrations were detected within the source zone and at the start of the plume limited electron acceptor availability at this site may have resulted in metabolite accumulation jobelius et al 2011a another explanation for relatively high concentrations of metabolite presence is that although the source zone and the start of the plume zone have redox conditions such as iron reducing or methanogenic at which biodegradation is relatively slow these conditions may be considered high bio active zones due to an abundance of both hydrocarbon compounds and their degrading bacteria absence or lower concentrations of metabolites in the fringe zone compared to the plume or source zone can be explained by the relatively fast degradation of both parent compounds and their metabolites due to nitrate availability in fringe zone over 40 of the metabolite concentration detected in the plume zone were signature metabolites related to toluene degradation the highest concentration was found for benzylsuccinic acid 211 8 μg l a signature metabolite for toluene callaghan 2013 griebler et al 2004 while in the source zone benzylsuccinic acid was absent although naphthalene showed little scatter when plotted versus o xylene and is suggested to biodegrade less than benzene and toluene approximately 25 of the metabolite concentration detected in the plume zone were related to the anaerobic naphthalene degradation the highest concentration of suspect metabolite was found for naphthaleneacetic acid 67 3 μg l a so far metabolite earlier hypothesized yet unverified in the naphthalene methylation pathway safinowski and meckenstock 2006 moreover nine specific metabolites for naphthalene carboxylation were detected in multiple samples including di methyl benzoic acid 36 8 μg l and 2 naphtoic acid 38 1 μg l callaghan 2013 naphthalene metabolite concentrations were generally the highest in the plume zone except for 2 naphtoic acid 61 μg l which was detected as the highest concentration in the source zone the other naphthalene metabolites related to carboxylation were also present in the source zone however at lower concentrations than in the plume zone this either suggests that the first step in the carboxylation pathway is more apparent in the vicinity of the dnapl than in the groundwater downgradient or biodegradation is more limited and more accumulation occurs callaghan 2013 in the source and plume zone other individual metabolites for anaerobic biodegradation were detected related to parent compounds ethylbenzene indene naphthalene acenaphthene phenanthrene and fluorene annweiler et al 2000 beller and spormann 1998 callaghan 2013 chee sanford et al 1996 cozzarelli et al 1990 gieg and suflita 2002 morasch et al 2004 safinowski 2005 tischler and kaschabek 2012 a few metabolites were found at highest concentrations within the source zone such as dimethylbenzoic acid methylbenzoic acid and benzoic acid another compound that was detected in groundwater samples 2 methylindene could possibly be a compound originating from the tar or a metabolite formed through biodegradation of indene in the aquifer similar to methylnaphthalenes callaghan 2013 furthermore 2 ethylhexanol a metabolite for anaerobic biodegradation of styrene tischler 2015 and 4 amino benzoic acid a metabolite from aniline schnell and schink 1991 degradation were detected some metabolites such as 3 o toluoylpropionic acid and benzoic acid were not only detected in the contaminated area but also up and downgradient though in relatively low concentrations these metabolites could originate from the contaminated zone upgradient however it is likely that benzoic acid is also formed during degradation of aromatic compounds in natural organic matter present in the aquifer high concentrations of metabolites in the source and plume zone instead of at the fringe zone might suggest that they were discharged from the dnapl however since they are thermally relatively unstable they would have disintegrated at the high temperatures during the pintsch gas fabrication process van leeuwen et al 2020 the presence of carboxylated and succinylated metabolites therefore indicate active anaerobic degradation in the dnapl containing source zone and the plume aitken et al 2004 bian et al 2015 callaghan 2013 elshahed et al 2001 head et al 2003 3 5 distribution of microorganisms and enzymes gene copies of generic microorganisms that use specific electron acceptors indicating redox conditions were analyzed in groundwater samples gene copies indicating geobacteraceae nitrate and sulfate reducing micro organisms and methanogenic archaea were found throughout the investigated area at concentrations from 103 per ml for methanogens up to 107 per ml for total bacteria fig 9 this suggests that these micro organisms co exist or that different microbial niches exist in a smaller domain than the one meter filter length of the groundwater sampling wells rivett et al 2008 another possibility is that archaea that perform pathways in the n cycle are present such as denitrification although much less is known in archaea than in bacteria cabello et al 2004 gene copy concentrations of sulfite reducers drsa and iron reducing geobacteraceae 16s rrna were one order of magnitude higher in the source zone than observed anywhere else in the aquifer total 16s rrna bacterial and archaea genes in the source zone were two orders of magnitude higher than in the contaminant plume area fig 9 in samples from the source zone s gene copies of nirs and narg were detected in thousands or tens of thousands per ml of sampled groundwater although no nitrate or nitrite was detected in those samples fig 9 in addition to detected genes related to use of specific electron acceptors dna was targeted for bacteria and enzymes known capable of anaerobic biodegradation of mono and bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as peptococcaceae 16s rrna genes benzene carboxylase abca genes and benzylsuccinate synthase bssa genes fig 10 the functional bssa genes for anaerobic toluene degradation via succinylation were found throughout the aquifer in relatively high concentrations suggesting toluene degradation all over the investigated area the highest gene copy numbers of bssa genes for iron and sulfate reducers were detected in the source zone while the highest concentration of bssa genes of nitrate reducers was detected in the plume zone fig 10 these results indicate presence of microorganisms capable of toluene degradation by succinylation over the whole contaminated area at iron sulfate and nitrate reducing conditions the highest concentrations of peptococcaceae 16s rrna genes were detected in the source zone but they were also present in the plume zone and at the fringe of the contaminated area fig 9 peptococcaceae 16s rrna genes were detected in relatively low concentrations from hundreds up to thousands of gene copies per ml groundwater compared to bssa genes this suggests that peptococcaceae known to be involved in anaerobic benzene and naphthalene degradation may have contributed to the anaerobic degradation of benzene and naphthalene at this site abu laban et al 2010 kleemann and meckenstock 2011 luo et al 2014 van der waals et al 2017 van der zaan et al 2012 genes encoding for the benzene carboxylase enzyme abca in nitrate reducing peptococcaceae toth et al 2021 were detected in relatively low concentrations in the source and plume zones the highest concentrations of abca genes were detected at the plume fringe fig 10 this indicates that the carboxylation reaction mechanism may be involved in benzene degradation in the vicinity of the nitrate containing groundwater at the fringes of the plume copy numbers of peptococcaceae were lowest in fringe samples and numbers of abca genes were highest considering copy numbers of peptococcaceae were highest and numbers of abca genes were lowest in the source zone samples this indicates that several peptococcaceae were not involved in benzene degradation the lowest concentration of bacterial 16s rrna gene copy numbers was found at the plume fringe and downgradient outside the contaminant plume although concentrations of gene copies for bacteria and archaea are relatively high in the upgradient reference well genes indicating aromatic hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms such as benzylsuccinate synthase by sulfate and iron reducers peptococcaceae and benzene carboxylase abca were below detection limit of the identification method the amount of biodegraded contaminants is highest in the source zone this most likely explains why the source zone is teaming with microbial life in the fringe zone biodegradation is potentially the fastest under nitrate reducing conditions however concentrations have decreased heavily before arriving that far downgradient and thus are merely a polishing step influencing the length of the contaminant plume 4 conclusions the results of this study show that benzene concentrations decrease relatively slow compared to other monoaromatic hydrocarbons at the iron reducing core of the groundwater plume but is the most decreasing component in the contaminant mix at the nitrate reducing plume fringe biodegradation of benzene was confirmed in the source zone and all along the groundwater path of flow by detection of signature and suspect metabolites relevant micro organisms and fractionation of stable isotopes changes in stable isotopic ratios for δ2h and δ13c along with carboxylated metabolites and micro organisms responsible for anaerobic degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons indicated biodegradation for benzene via the carboxylation mechanism the concentration ratio of benzene versus toluene ethylbenzene xylenes and naphthalene shifted from greater than one at iron reducing conditions to smaller than one at nitrate reducing conditions moreover benzene carboxylase abca genes were in accordance most abundant at the nitrate reducing plume fringe overall composition of the contaminant compounds changes along the groundwater path of flow in other ratios than can be explained by dispersion nor adsorption in addition metabolites of xylenes and trimethylbenzenes were detected in the source zone at their highest concentrations the highest diversity and concentrations of most metabolites were detected in the upgradient part of the plume zone near the source zone this indicates active biodegradation in the vicinity of the dnapl pool zone the highest numbers of 16s rrna gene copies for total bacteria bssa of sulfate iron reducing geobacteraceae and peptococcaceae were detected within the source zone indicating a relatively high bio active zone for biodegradation compared to the total groundwater contaminated zone most if not all water soluble aromatic hydrocarbon contaminants biodegrade at the relatively large dimensions of the anoxic plume core however relatively slow biodegradation of most hydrocarbon contaminants at iron reducing conditions within the relatively large dimensions of the plume zone appears quantitatively to be of greater significance than relatively more biodegradation in the relatively small dimensions of the nitrate reducing fringe zone declaration of competing

1298,the anaerobic degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons in a plume originating from a pintsch gas tar dnapl zone was investigated using molecular isotopic and microbial analyses benzene concentrations diminished at the relatively small meter scale dimensions of the nitrate reducing plume fringe the ratio of benzene to toluene ethylbenzene xylenes and naphthalene btexn in the fringe zone compared to the plume zone indicated relatively more loss of benzene in the fringe zone than texn this was substantiated by changes in relative concentrations of btexn and multi element compound specific isotope analysis for δ2h and δ13c this was supported by the presence of abca genes indicating the presumed benzene carboxylase enzyme in the nitrate reducing plume fringe biodegradation of most hydrocarbon contaminants at iron reducing conditions in the plume core appears to be quantitatively of greater significance due to the large volume of the plume core rather than relatively faster biodegradation under nitrate reducing conditions at the smaller volume of the plume fringe contaminant concentration reductions by biodegradation processes were shown to vary distinctively between the source plume both iron reducing and fringe nitrate reducing zones of the plume high anaerobic microbial activity was detected in the plume zone as well as in the dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl containing source zone biodegradation of most if not all other water soluble pintsch gas tar aromatic hydrocarbon contaminants occur at the relatively large dimensions of the anoxic plume core the highest diversity and concentrations of metabolites were detected in the iron reducing plume core where the sum of parent compounds of aromatic hydrocarbons was greater than 10 mg l the relatively high concentrations of metabolites suggest a hot spot for anaerobic degradation in the core of the plume downgradient but relatively close to the dnapl containing source zone graphical abstract unlabelled

hydrocarbons is a global problem mainly caused by spills and leaks related to the production and usage of petroleum products einarson and mackay 2001 kueper et al 2003 röling and van verseveld 2002 typically petroleum products are complex mixtures of hydrocarbons mcgregor et al 2012 sandercock and du pasquier 2003 sjögren et al 1995 once they invade the saturated subsurface as dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl water soluble compounds start partitioning from the dnapl into the groundwater forming contaminated groundwater plumes peters and luthy 1993 processes that mainly reduce the actual removal of the dissolved contaminants in the groundwater plume are due to retardation through adsorption to the soil matrix dilution through dispersion and biodegradation by microorganisms aronson and howard 1997 micic et al 2007 oka et al 2011 rogers et al 2002 wiedemeier et al 1999 at tar contaminated sites besides the commonly reported benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes btex in groundwater other aromatic hydrocarbon compounds such as styrene trimethylbenzenes ethyltoluenes indene indane naphthalene methylnaphthalenes and methylindenes are encountered micic et al 2007 schirmer et al 2006 zamfirescu and grathwohl 2001 for naphthalene degradation rates are generally low compared to those of btex gerritse et al 2004 while sorption dependent attenuation is a more prominent removal process due to a higher koc coefficient and relatively low water solubility rogers et al 2002 swartjes et al 2011 biodegradation of one or multiple monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons compounds has been shown to occur in laboratory and field studies under both oxic and anoxic conditions da silva and corseuil 2012 gibson et al 1968 gieg et al 2009 grbic galic and vogel 1987 biodegradation rates range widely and depend mostly on the molecular structure of the contaminant and the terminal electron accepting processes foght 2008 meckenstock et al 2016 meckenstock et al 2015 complex mixtures of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds in groundwater systems often lead to sequential attenuation of the individual components suarez and rifai 1999 biodegradation rates for some compounds might increase in different redox zones while they decrease for others suarez and rifai 1999 swartjes et al 2011 moreover in complex mixtures co metabolism can enhance biodegradation of certain recalcitrant compounds swartjes et al 2011 in contrast certain compounds can inhibit biodegradation due to toxicity swartjes et al 2011 the complex interplay between multiple contaminant compounds that are present in groundwater plumes abiotic and biotic attenuation processes sequential redox conditions and geohydrological setting makes it difficult to interpret biodegradation processes at contaminated sites while field studies have shown that under oxic conditions benzene biodegrades faster than toluene ethylbenzene or xylenes alvarez et al 1991 suarez and rifai 1999 under anoxic conditions biodegradation of benzene is generally slower than that of other aromatic compounds weelink et al 2010 biodegradation of benzene under nitrate reducing conditions has been observed atashgahi et al 2018 burland and edwards 1999 coates et al 2001 dou et al 2010 but the range of biodegradation rates is very wide in laboratory experiments often benzene is the recalcitrant compound and toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes tex show biodegradation suarez and rifai 1999 however at the field scale it was found that benzene potentially biodegrades nonetheless biodegradation of tex occurs at higher degradation rates than benzene aronson and howard 1997 it has been suggested that benzene biodegradation in shallow aquifers is actually enabled by the presence of low oxygen concentrations along the fringe of the contaminant groundwater plumes aronson and howard 1997 nonetheless to date a variety of bacteria using nitrate as electron acceptor and capable of benzene degradation have been isolated in a pure culture atashgahi et al 2018 coates et al 2001 dou et al 2010 vogt et al 2011 more recently laboratory studies showed strictly anaerobic degradation of benzene or naphthalene under iron or nitrate reducing conditions related to peptococcaceae members of the order clostridiales however naphthalene degraders were not able to degrade benzene indicating that benzene and naphthalene are biodegraded by different enzymes abca and nmsa respectively atashgahi et al 2018 cupples 2016 kleemann and meckenstock 2011 meckenstock and mouttaki 2011 musat et al 2009 toth et al 2018 van der waals et al 2017 van der zaan et al 2012 vogt et al 2011 to our knowledge no studies have been published on the relevance and presence of peptococcaceae throughout contaminated plumes at the field scale therefore this field study focuses on the biodegradation of a wide range of hydrocarbons that derive from the dissolution of pintsch gas tar in a two aquifer system dominated by denitrifying conditions in the surrounding native groundwater this was performed to assess the differences on the biodegradation of individual hydrocarbon compounds and benzene in specific in the presence of different electron acceptors 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the studied field site is located adjacent to the railway station in the city of amersfoort the netherlands on this site a manufactured gas plant mgp was active from 1910 until 1958 the hydrogeological situation consists of a two aquifer system the shallow aquifer from 2 to 12 m below ground surface mbgs consists of medium to silty fine sands and the deep aquifer from 12 to 85 mbgs of mainly coarse sands with gravel enclosures the general direction of groundwater flow in the shallow aquifer is to the southeast and to the northwest in the deep aquifer fig 1 locally at the mgp site groundwater flow shifts in the shallow aquifer due to sheet piling containment measures and absence of the confining layer fig 1 the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifers varies from k 5 m d in the shallow aquifer to k 15 m d in the deep aquifer the two aquifers are separated by a clay peat confining layer in the north fig 2 the clay peat layer thins out from more than 5 m thickness in the north to about 50 cm or less at the mgp site the aquitard fringe is situated some 50 m south of the dnapl source zone fig 2 in both aquifers liquid phase tar is detected as free flowing dnapl more background on the site partitioning behavior from the dnapl towards the plume and developed methods for detecting the dissolved contaminants and their metabolites were described earlier van leeuwen et al 2020 the contaminated mgp site was divided into different zones based on samples from groundwater sampling wells within each zone the upgradient zone represents non impacted groundwater and is used as a reference the source zone is the area where dnapl is located and the plume zone is representing the area of the groundwater dissolved contaminants the fringe zone represents the area where contaminant concentrations in groundwater are diminishing and mixing with the surrounding groundwater occurs by dispersion downgradient is the area located in the direction of flow for groundwater and contaminant concentrations below 10 μg l in table 1 the number of sampling wells in each zone is given 2 2 groundwater sampling to create a two dimensional transect of the groundwater contamination in the two aquifer system groundwater samples were obtained from 34 sampling wells the wells were selected along the groundwater flow direction fig 1 as well as along a transversal cross section of the plume fig 2 a comprehensive overview of the sampling wells is given in the supplementary information s3 to s9 to keep the groundwater samples anoxic while sampling marprene tubing rubber bv hilversum in combination with a peristaltic pump watson marlow type 604 u r ma usa was used some wells in the source zone contained dnapl to acquire clear groundwater samples these wells were pumped at a flow rate of 10 l h until groundwater breakthrough was established typically two to sixty liters of tar was pumped before groundwater break through started table 2 unaffected reference well 323 is located 145 m upgradient in the shallow aquifer 2 3 aromatic hydrocarbon analysis for the determination of concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds in the groundwater samples a gas chromatographic headspace analyses method was used analyses were performed on a shimadzu gc 2010 gas chromatograph equipped with a pal auto sampler shimadzu benelux s hertogenbosch the netherlands as previously described van leeuwen et al 2020 the detected hydrocarbon contaminant concentrations per sample are given in section s5 of the supplementary information 2 4 compound specific stable isotope analysis to identify anaerobic biodegradation and the occurring biotransformation reactions csia δ13c and δ2h was performed samples from the contaminated groundwater plume were measured in duplicate for benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylenes indene and naphthalene on a gc ms irms system consisting of a thermo scientific trace gc ultra gc a thermo scientific isq qms a thermo scientific gc isolink interface and a thermo scientific delta v advantage irms a comprehensive description of the used method is described in section s2 of the supplementary information the δ13c and δ2h data per sample for the detected hydrocarbon contaminants are given in section s8 and s9 respectively of the supplementary information 2 5 semi quantitative metabolite analysis putative metabolites of aromatic hydrocarbon degradation were analyzed by liquid chromatography using a shimadzu nexera uhplc system and a bruker maxis 4g quadrupole orthogonal accelerated time of flight mass spectrometer as described van leeuwen et al 2020 analytes were semi quantified by using a linear relation between polarity and the molar response factor where standards with known concentrations were used to define the unknown ones through correlation wang et al 2010 the metabolite data per sample are given in section s6 of the supplementary information 2 6 analysis of anions manganese and iron groundwater samples were analyzed for concentrations of anions so4 2 no3 and no2 by liquid chromatography lc on a dionex ics 1500 equipped with an ionpac as14 anion exchange column and an a srss ultra 14 mm suppressor dionex corporation sunnyvale ca usa concentrations of dissolved manganese and iron in the groundwater samples were measured by a perkin elmer avio 500 inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes for both lc and icp oes analysis groundwater was sampled in 1 5 ml vials with screw caps and silicon ptfe lined septa grace the samples were sterilized in the field by addition of 0 6 ml of a 68 solution of nitric acid sigma aldrich chemie n v zwijndrecht the netherlands an overview of environmental conditions such as ph redox electric conductivity ec dissolved organic carbon doc and oxygen are given in section s3 of the supplementary information physico chemical data is given in section s4 of the supplementary information 2 7 dna extraction and qpcr analysis for the extraction of dna 1 l groundwater samples were collected from monitoring wells in clean green glass bottles to prevent the introduction of oxygen the bottles were filled completely from the bottom up and let to overflow for a few minutes before sealing with a polypropylene screw cap the bottles were immediately put on ice in a cool box and transported to the laboratory the 1 l samples were vacuum filtered within 24 h for filtration 47 mm diameter 0 22 μm pore size hydrophilic filters were used millipore bv amsterdam the netherlands dna was subsequently extracted with the mobio powerlyzer kit according to the supplier s protocol mobio ca usa dna extracts were stored at 80 c until analyzed genes of general groups of micro organisms were detected that signify redox conditions such as nitrate reducers narg sulfite reducers drsa iron iii reducers 16s rrna geobacteraceae methanogens mcra and archaea 16s rrna additionally genes indicating bacteria and enzymes were targeted that are known to metabolize benzene such as peptococcaceae and benzene carboxylase abca furthermore two kinds of benzylsuccinate synthase bssa genes involved in toluene activation were analyzed those associated with sulfate iron bssa srb reducing and nitrate bssa reducing micro organisms additionally total bacteria were quantified 16s rrna an overview of all analyzed genes encoding and primers is given in the supplementary information s1 assays for qpcr analysis were performed on a cfx96 real time pcr machine bio rad as described van der waals et al 2017 detected gene copies for used essays are given per sample in section s7 of the supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 distribution of electron acceptors dissolved oxygen concentrations were below 0 5 mg l indicating anoxic conditions in all sampled groundwater wells in groundwater wells surrounding the contaminated area nitrate 24 33 mg l and sulfate 31 36 mg l were present a comprehensive list of hydrogeochemical data can be found in the supplementary information section s3 and s4 nitrate was depleted in the upgradient part of the source zone the complete oxidation of 1 mol of benzene or toluene to co2 would require reduction of 6 or 7 2 mol of nitrate to n2 respectively burland and edwards 1999 neglecting possible nitrate reduction to ammonium the influx of groundwater containing 24 33 mg l nitrate can therefore serve as an electron acceptor for the oxidation of only a relatively small fraction of the contaminant load present sulfate concentrations decreased along the groundwater path of flow and remained low 0 1 7 5 mg l throughout the plume zone along the groundwater path of flow in only 4 out of 34 sampling wells was sulfate below 1 mg l dissolved iron and manganese were not detected in the uncontaminated upstream reference well in contrast dissolved iron and manganese were detected in relatively high concentrations up to 14 6 mg l within the contaminated plume and fringe zones this is an indication of iron iii and manganese iv reduction by bacteria such as geobacteraceae which are known to use a wide range of aromatic compounds nealson 1994 dissolved iron and manganese were detected at similar concentrations which is remarkable since generally iron is five to ten times more abundant in soil systems than manganese nealson 1994 this observation may be explained by precipitation of ferrous iron with sulfide produced through sulfate reduction the solubility in water of fes is negligible whereas that of mns is 47 mg l at 18 c nealson 1994 it was reported that about 60 of the iron iii had been reduced to iron ii in the source zone and 35 of the ferric iron in the plume zone due to biodegradation of aromatic hydrocarbons from a tar contaminated site wege 2005 this suggests that at least 60 of iron iii in an aquifer was available to microorganisms for biodegradation of hydrocarbons over several decades moreover based on this outcome calculating the potential biodegraded contaminant load through iron ii reduction provides an insight in present and future groundwater plume stability stoichiometric relationships for the oxidation of naphthalene toluene and benzene are as follows 1 c 10 h 8 48 fe oh 3 10 hco 3 48 fe 2 28 h 2 o 86 oh 2 c 7 h 8 36 fe oh 3 7 hco 3 36 fe 2 22 h 2 o 65 oh 3 c 6 h 6 30 fe oh 3 6 hco 3 30 fe 2 18 h 2 o 54 oh stoichiometric relations imply that 2 7 kg of ferric iron are needed to biodegrade 1 mol 128 g of naphthalene for biodegradation of 1 mol of benzene 78 g or toluene 92 g 1 7 and 2 kg of ferric iron are needed respectively eq 2 and 3 in the netherlands generally 1 5 30 g dm3 fe oh 3 is present in sandy soils de vries 1999 this implies that for every kilogram of naphthalene a soil volume of on average 1 3 m3 is potentially sufficient as electron acceptor the total dimension of the contaminant plume zone at the investigated site is approximately 3 3 million m3 the contaminated soil volume of the plume at the former mgp site in amersfoort would potentially hold sufficient fe iii as electron acceptor for the biodegradation of 2 5 million kg naphthalene moreover acceptors such as nitrate and sulfate flow into the groundwater contaminated plume over an inflow area of 12 000 m2 300 m1 wide and down to 40mbgs the aquifer flows at a constant rate of 25 m y which implicates 300 000m3 y of water inflow into the contaminated area this amount of groundwater contained of 0 024 kg m3 and 0 035 kg m3 of nitrate and sulfate respectively in the upgradient reference well this would roughly contribute an additional 7200 kg y of nitrate and 10 500 kg y of sulfate as potential terminal electron acceptor to the contaminated area ferric iron is not replenished like nitrate and sulphate and might potentially deplete moreover various chemical reactions between iron and sulfur can occur in the fringe zone due to a relatively large iron reducing volume of the plume compared to a small nitrate reducing volume at the fringe zone reduction of ferric iron coupled to relatively slower biodegradation of most hydrocarbon contaminants within the plume zone appears quantitatively to be of greater significance than coupled to nitrate reduction in the fringe zone 3 2 distribution of aromatic hydrocarbons in the source zone the relatively light hydrocarbon compounds partition from the tar into the surrounding groundwater the liquid dnapl in the source zone is considered to be an instantaneous solute source the composition of the initial solute mixture c0 is determined by averaging the concentrations of partitioned tar compounds to water and is shown in fig 3 and described by van leeuwen et al 2020 the nine most abundant compounds that have partitioned into the groundwater are naphthalene 29 followed by toluene 22 and benzene 15 other compounds such as 2 methylnaphthalene 2 mn styrene indene xylenes and ethylbenzene were detected varying from 8 down to 2 the other 15 detected aromatic compounds at lower concentrations than ethylbenzene are not considered here not shown in fig 3 an overview of all detected contaminant compounds per sampling well is given in the supplementary information s5 propagation of the contaminant mixture by groundwater transport phenomena such as dispersion dilution and retardation have an prominent effect on the concentration profile along the groundwater path of flow composition of the aromatic hydrocarbon mix is besides dispersion affected by retardation for each compound koc values and retardation values for the nine most abundant aromatic hydrocarbons detected in the contaminant groundwater are given in table 3 abraham et al 1994 freeze and cherry 1979 the koc values used are obtained from chemical database gsi net com in the plume zone the composition of the contaminant mixture has changed compared to the source zone in the source zone naphthalene and toluene were the most abundant compounds fig 3 whereas in the plume zone the most abundant compounds were ethylbenzene and benzene with values of 0 56 and 0 71c c0 respectively fig 4 this may be attributed to the retardation effect as the koc value for ethylbenzene benzene and other aromatic hydrocarbons is lower than that of naphthalene fetter 1999 table 3 another compound from the most abundant hydrocarbon compounds 2 methylnaphthalene 2 mn has a relatively high koc and is expected to decrease less than naphthalene based on retardation however 2 mn decreased relatively the most of all compounds from the source zone to the plume zone fig 4 naphthalene is expected to decrease the most if only retardation played a role this is indicative for biodegradation of 2 mn within or relatively close 10 m1 to the source zone further downgradient 50 150 m1 from the plume zone to the fringe zone the highest relative loss was not observed for 2 mn but for styrene and toluene this suggests further down the groundwater path of flow in the contaminated groundwater plume biodegradation is different for 2 mn than close to the source zone and relatively less than for styrene and toluene further downgradient at the boundary of the groundwater plume where the plume zone transitions into the fringe and nitrate reducing conditions prevail the concentration of ethylbenzene is observed to decrease 2 5 times more than the upgradient decrease from source to plume zone remarkably the ratio of benzene to toluene changes at these downgradient nitrate reducing conditions at the boundaries of the contaminated groundwater plume upgradient from source zone to plume zone and from plume zone to fringe zone toluene concentrations are lower than benzene moreover further downgradient this is reversed and toluene concentrations are higher than benzene fig 4 overall the relative decrease of contaminant compound differences from source zone to plume zone compared to fringe zone to downgradient in other ratios than cannot be explained by retardation this suggests that biodegradation occurs for most contaminant compounds moreover decreases of individual contaminant compounds within the mix differ along the groundwater path of flow in different zones within the contaminant plume fig 4 to interpret the composition changes of compounds in the complex contaminant mixture along the path of groundwater flow two dimensional plots were produced where the concentration of 1 3 5 trimethylbenzene 1 3 5 tmb was plotted versus contaminant compounds as presented in fig 4 c1 3 5 tmb cx using all obtained groundwater samples figs 5 and 6 where c1 3 5 tmb is the concentration is of 1 3 5tmb and cx the concentration of a specific aromatic hydrocarbon from the contaminant mix naphthalene 1 2 3 trimethylbenzene 1 2 3 tmb and 1 2 4 trimethylbenzene 1 2 4 tmb show a comparative fit to linear dilution or dispersion only fig 5 benzene and toluene show the least fit to linear dilution and benzene as well as toluene concentration decrease relatively more than 1 3 5 tmb at relatively lower concentrations fig 6 although soil heterogeneity and retardation effects play a role in groundwater transport of contaminants relatively for the contaminant mix benzene shows the most deviation from dilution and naphthalene together with trimethylbenzenes the least fig 5 this indicates that naphthalene and trimethylbenzenes are the most conservative compounds in the contaminant mix tri substituted alkylbenzenes are less vulnerable to microbial degradation than monosubstituted alkylbenzenes peng et al 2021 moreover 1 3 5 tmb is recognized as the most conservative degrading aromatic hydrocarbon compound aamand et al 1989 aronson and howard 1997 baedecker et al 2011 peng et al 2021 richnow et al 2003 other contaminant compounds such as xylenes ethylbenzene styrene and 2 methylnaphthalene show however less distinct decreased relative concentrations corresponding to benzene and toluene versus 1 3 5 tmb naphthalene and benzene both non substituted cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are also known as anaerobically slow degrading compounds relative to other water soluble tar constituents aronson and howard 1997 flanagan et al 2014 wiedemeier et al 1999 the data obtained from this contaminated groundwater plume show that naphthalene is behaving in accordance however benzene is not benzene concentrations decrease in the same order as toluene concentrations when plotted to the most persistent compound in the mix 1 3 5 tmb fig 6 considering various redox conditions along the path of flow concentration ratios for benzene cb and toluene ct could be occurring at different conditions and are given in cb ct fig 7 in the source zone which is considered an instantaneous point source concentrations are relatively high for benzene 30 000 μg l and toluene 32 000 μg l the majority of samples containing dissolved iron and manganese yet no nitrate show a ratio of greater than one for benzene versus toluene fig 7 this could be explained by relatively more adsorption of toluene to the soil matrix since benzene has a lower retardation factor however some of the samples show a ratio smaller than one for benzene versus toluene fig 7 these samples relate to the fringe zone and its nitrate reducing conditions the surrounding groundwater contains nitrate which mixes in with the contaminated groundwater due to dispersion the relatively high toluene versus low benzene concentrations indicate more loss of benzene than of toluene under the nitrate reducing conditions at the fringe of the contaminant plume this composition change was also observed in sample locations above the source zone where an inflow of nitrate containing groundwater from upgradient occurs the lower ratio of benzene versus toluene in the up and downgradient locations cannot be explained by retardation effects or dilution through dispersion and therefore indicates greater biodegradation of benzene than toluene at nitrate reducing conditions in the plume fringe 3 3 multi element compound specific isotope fractionation fractionation of stable isotopes of hydrogen 2h 1h and carbon 13c 12c was determined for btex indene and naphthalene in contaminated groundwater samples to determine direct insight in the reaction mechanisms for biodegradation hydrogen δ2h and carbon δ13c enrichments were combined into two dimensional compound specific isotope analysis plots the slope of the linear regression leads to the apparent reaction mechanism and is expressed as the lambda value λ kümmel et al 2016 fig 8 lambda values indicate putative reaction mechanisms of aromatic hydrocarbon degradation pathways corresponding to carboxylation fumarate addition and hydroxylation vogt et al 2016 the λ value found for toluene λ 25 and o m xylene λ 20 both corresponded to anaerobic degradation via succinylation by fumarate addition fig 8 benzene isotope fractionation λ 19 corresponds to degradation via the putative carboxylation reaction mechanism in which benzene is carboxylated yielding benzoate abu laban et al 2010 luo et al 2014 vogt et al 2016 while the generated lambda value for ethylbenzene suggests hydroxylation this is based mainly on one datapoint representing high hydrogen fractionation the latter suggest a different reaction mechanism however no lambda values are published that represent other reaction mechanisms for ethylbenzene such as fumarate addition furthermore benzoylacetate was the only signature metabolite detected for ethylbenzene degradation which relates to the hydroxylation mechanism this metabolite was detected in 8 groundwater samples originating throughout the contaminated groundwater plume an overview of all detected metabolites per monitoring well are given in supplementary information s6 the λ value for naphthalene has a poor correlation r2 0 51 and does not correspond with a known carboxylation mechanism fig 8 this can be explained by masking of kinetic isotope fractionation because of the relatively low solubility of naphthalene resulting in diffusion controlled degradation vogt et al 2018 the λ value for indene has the least correlation of the presented 2d plots and no reference data could be acquired to compare the results with fig 8 the lowest values for fractionation of hydrogen δ2h and carbon δ13c isotopes were generally found in samples from the source zone and its proximity this indicates that a relatively large fraction of the total amount of contaminants in the source zone has not been biodegraded small fractionation values of carbon and hydrogen might not be reliably quantified and could be underestimated due to ongoing partitioning of aromatic hydrocarbons from the dnapl into the bypassing groundwater van leeuwen et al 2020 moreover the partitioning effect induced by groundwater flow could be increased by higher mass transfer rates caused by biodegradation langevoort and hassanizadeh 2009 simultaneous biodegradation and source partitioning could underestimate the biodegradation effect in the source zone vogt et al 2016 moreover ongoing partitioning of contaminant compounds from the instantaneous source to the groundwater potentially could create a double masking effect due to the fact that the partitioning takes place to an already biodegrading hydrocarbon mixture in the water phase and simultaneously is diluted by inflow of less contaminated groundwater from upgradient van leeuwen et al 2020 3 4 metabolites of aromatic hydrocarbon biodegradation the highest total concentration of metabolites in a single well 545 μg l was found at the start of the plume well a026 this well is located approximately 35 m downgradient of the source zone fig 1 fig 2 this suggests that the start of the plume governed by metal reducing conditions corresponds to a relatively high bio active zone abu laban et al 2010 beller et al 2008 jobelius et al 2011a 2011b kleemann and meckenstock 2011 nealson 1994 or metabolites accumulate due to conditions preventing complete contaminant mineralization in the source zone the second highest concentration of metabolites in a single well 321 μg l was detected in the fringe zone upgradient and downgradient highest total metabolite concentrations for a single well were measured at 40 μg l 37 μg l and 50 μg l respectively a comprehensive overview of all detected metabolites per groundwater sample is given in section s6 of the supplementary information these findings indicate that biodegradation occurs in the plume zone and in the source zone the upgradient reference sample fringe zone and downgradient samples all show some metabolite presence however at relatively low concentrations it has been reported that the highest concentrations of metabolites occurred at plume fringes abu laban et al 2010 elsner 2010 while at this mgp site in amersfoort the netherlands the highest concentrations were detected within the source zone and at the start of the plume limited electron acceptor availability at this site may have resulted in metabolite accumulation jobelius et al 2011a another explanation for relatively high concentrations of metabolite presence is that although the source zone and the start of the plume zone have redox conditions such as iron reducing or methanogenic at which biodegradation is relatively slow these conditions may be considered high bio active zones due to an abundance of both hydrocarbon compounds and their degrading bacteria absence or lower concentrations of metabolites in the fringe zone compared to the plume or source zone can be explained by the relatively fast degradation of both parent compounds and their metabolites due to nitrate availability in fringe zone over 40 of the metabolite concentration detected in the plume zone were signature metabolites related to toluene degradation the highest concentration was found for benzylsuccinic acid 211 8 μg l a signature metabolite for toluene callaghan 2013 griebler et al 2004 while in the source zone benzylsuccinic acid was absent although naphthalene showed little scatter when plotted versus o xylene and is suggested to biodegrade less than benzene and toluene approximately 25 of the metabolite concentration detected in the plume zone were related to the anaerobic naphthalene degradation the highest concentration of suspect metabolite was found for naphthaleneacetic acid 67 3 μg l a so far metabolite earlier hypothesized yet unverified in the naphthalene methylation pathway safinowski and meckenstock 2006 moreover nine specific metabolites for naphthalene carboxylation were detected in multiple samples including di methyl benzoic acid 36 8 μg l and 2 naphtoic acid 38 1 μg l callaghan 2013 naphthalene metabolite concentrations were generally the highest in the plume zone except for 2 naphtoic acid 61 μg l which was detected as the highest concentration in the source zone the other naphthalene metabolites related to carboxylation were also present in the source zone however at lower concentrations than in the plume zone this either suggests that the first step in the carboxylation pathway is more apparent in the vicinity of the dnapl than in the groundwater downgradient or biodegradation is more limited and more accumulation occurs callaghan 2013 in the source and plume zone other individual metabolites for anaerobic biodegradation were detected related to parent compounds ethylbenzene indene naphthalene acenaphthene phenanthrene and fluorene annweiler et al 2000 beller and spormann 1998 callaghan 2013 chee sanford et al 1996 cozzarelli et al 1990 gieg and suflita 2002 morasch et al 2004 safinowski 2005 tischler and kaschabek 2012 a few metabolites were found at highest concentrations within the source zone such as dimethylbenzoic acid methylbenzoic acid and benzoic acid another compound that was detected in groundwater samples 2 methylindene could possibly be a compound originating from the tar or a metabolite formed through biodegradation of indene in the aquifer similar to methylnaphthalenes callaghan 2013 furthermore 2 ethylhexanol a metabolite for anaerobic biodegradation of styrene tischler 2015 and 4 amino benzoic acid a metabolite from aniline schnell and schink 1991 degradation were detected some metabolites such as 3 o toluoylpropionic acid and benzoic acid were not only detected in the contaminated area but also up and downgradient though in relatively low concentrations these metabolites could originate from the contaminated zone upgradient however it is likely that benzoic acid is also formed during degradation of aromatic compounds in natural organic matter present in the aquifer high concentrations of metabolites in the source and plume zone instead of at the fringe zone might suggest that they were discharged from the dnapl however since they are thermally relatively unstable they would have disintegrated at the high temperatures during the pintsch gas fabrication process van leeuwen et al 2020 the presence of carboxylated and succinylated metabolites therefore indicate active anaerobic degradation in the dnapl containing source zone and the plume aitken et al 2004 bian et al 2015 callaghan 2013 elshahed et al 2001 head et al 2003 3 5 distribution of microorganisms and enzymes gene copies of generic microorganisms that use specific electron acceptors indicating redox conditions were analyzed in groundwater samples gene copies indicating geobacteraceae nitrate and sulfate reducing micro organisms and methanogenic archaea were found throughout the investigated area at concentrations from 103 per ml for methanogens up to 107 per ml for total bacteria fig 9 this suggests that these micro organisms co exist or that different microbial niches exist in a smaller domain than the one meter filter length of the groundwater sampling wells rivett et al 2008 another possibility is that archaea that perform pathways in the n cycle are present such as denitrification although much less is known in archaea than in bacteria cabello et al 2004 gene copy concentrations of sulfite reducers drsa and iron reducing geobacteraceae 16s rrna were one order of magnitude higher in the source zone than observed anywhere else in the aquifer total 16s rrna bacterial and archaea genes in the source zone were two orders of magnitude higher than in the contaminant plume area fig 9 in samples from the source zone s gene copies of nirs and narg were detected in thousands or tens of thousands per ml of sampled groundwater although no nitrate or nitrite was detected in those samples fig 9 in addition to detected genes related to use of specific electron acceptors dna was targeted for bacteria and enzymes known capable of anaerobic biodegradation of mono and bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as peptococcaceae 16s rrna genes benzene carboxylase abca genes and benzylsuccinate synthase bssa genes fig 10 the functional bssa genes for anaerobic toluene degradation via succinylation were found throughout the aquifer in relatively high concentrations suggesting toluene degradation all over the investigated area the highest gene copy numbers of bssa genes for iron and sulfate reducers were detected in the source zone while the highest concentration of bssa genes of nitrate reducers was detected in the plume zone fig 10 these results indicate presence of microorganisms capable of toluene degradation by succinylation over the whole contaminated area at iron sulfate and nitrate reducing conditions the highest concentrations of peptococcaceae 16s rrna genes were detected in the source zone but they were also present in the plume zone and at the fringe of the contaminated area fig 9 peptococcaceae 16s rrna genes were detected in relatively low concentrations from hundreds up to thousands of gene copies per ml groundwater compared to bssa genes this suggests that peptococcaceae known to be involved in anaerobic benzene and naphthalene degradation may have contributed to the anaerobic degradation of benzene and naphthalene at this site abu laban et al 2010 kleemann and meckenstock 2011 luo et al 2014 van der waals et al 2017 van der zaan et al 2012 genes encoding for the benzene carboxylase enzyme abca in nitrate reducing peptococcaceae toth et al 2021 were detected in relatively low concentrations in the source and plume zones the highest concentrations of abca genes were detected at the plume fringe fig 10 this indicates that the carboxylation reaction mechanism may be involved in benzene degradation in the vicinity of the nitrate containing groundwater at the fringes of the plume copy numbers of peptococcaceae were lowest in fringe samples and numbers of abca genes were highest considering copy numbers of peptococcaceae were highest and numbers of abca genes were lowest in the source zone samples this indicates that several peptococcaceae were not involved in benzene degradation the lowest concentration of bacterial 16s rrna gene copy numbers was found at the plume fringe and downgradient outside the contaminant plume although concentrations of gene copies for bacteria and archaea are relatively high in the upgradient reference well genes indicating aromatic hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms such as benzylsuccinate synthase by sulfate and iron reducers peptococcaceae and benzene carboxylase abca were below detection limit of the identification method the amount of biodegraded contaminants is highest in the source zone this most likely explains why the source zone is teaming with microbial life in the fringe zone biodegradation is potentially the fastest under nitrate reducing conditions however concentrations have decreased heavily before arriving that far downgradient and thus are merely a polishing step influencing the length of the contaminant plume 4 conclusions the results of this study show that benzene concentrations decrease relatively slow compared to other monoaromatic hydrocarbons at the iron reducing core of the groundwater plume but is the most decreasing component in the contaminant mix at the nitrate reducing plume fringe biodegradation of benzene was confirmed in the source zone and all along the groundwater path of flow by detection of signature and suspect metabolites relevant micro organisms and fractionation of stable isotopes changes in stable isotopic ratios for δ2h and δ13c along with carboxylated metabolites and micro organisms responsible for anaerobic degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons indicated biodegradation for benzene via the carboxylation mechanism the concentration ratio of benzene versus toluene ethylbenzene xylenes and naphthalene shifted from greater than one at iron reducing conditions to smaller than one at nitrate reducing conditions moreover benzene carboxylase abca genes were in accordance most abundant at the nitrate reducing plume fringe overall composition of the contaminant compounds changes along the groundwater path of flow in other ratios than can be explained by dispersion nor adsorption in addition metabolites of xylenes and trimethylbenzenes were detected in the source zone at their highest concentrations the highest diversity and concentrations of most metabolites were detected in the upgradient part of the plume zone near the source zone this indicates active biodegradation in the vicinity of the dnapl pool zone the highest numbers of 16s rrna gene copies for total bacteria bssa of sulfate iron reducing geobacteraceae and peptococcaceae were detected within the source zone indicating a relatively high bio active zone for biodegradation compared to the total groundwater contaminated zone most if not all water soluble aromatic hydrocarbon contaminants biodegrade at the relatively large dimensions of the anoxic plume core however relatively slow biodegradation of most hydrocarbon contaminants at iron reducing conditions within the relatively large dimensions of the plume zone appears quantitatively to be of greater significance than relatively more biodegradation in the relatively small dimensions of the nitrate reducing fringe zone declaration of competing

as a result higher go retention than bc at lower is 0 1 and 1 0 mm bc nzvi had a relatively lower ka 0 349 min 1 at 10 mm is however it outperformed bc when go retention capacities are compared over a

surface interactions between bc and go high porosity and surface roughness has been reported to enhance go aggregation and retention in bc particularly at higher ionic strength is bradford and

attractive or repulsive forms which can be explained well by the van der waals force and electrostatic double layer interactions sun et al 2015 tang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 once released into the environment go is exposed to physicochemical environments which affect its transport and retention behavior for example an increase in hydrodynamic diameter aggregation and a decrease in electrophoretic mobility epm of go has been reported with increasing is such alterations will directly influence its transport and retention behavior french et al 2009 lanphere et al 2013 the go transport and retention behavior also depends upon the media properties e g porosity roughness and the presence of other materials prior studies revealed that the temperature does not affect the go transport through sand however a considerably increase in go attachment has been reported at higher is and lower ph conditions sotirelis and chrysikopoulos 2015 despite the unfavorable attachment conditions enhanced go interactions have been reported in the presence of kaolinite and montmorillonite commonly found minerals in the subsurface in the sand due to heteroaggregation of go with the

studies based on colloid filtration theory cft with a clean bed porous media configuration assumed a constant attachment rate ka and infinite retention capacity smith et al 2008 tian et al 2010 yao et

nanomaterials leij et al 2015 prior models have merged time and depth dependent retention blocking and aggregation mechanisms with the transport equations to describe the nm transport in porous media babakhani et al 2017 wang et al 2018 numerical modeling of go transport in the geomedia e g bc or bc nzvi needs special consideration compared to sand when numerical approaches are implemented to investigate their transport and retention behaviors torkzaban and bradford 2016 this is particularly true because such geomedia display diverse porosity surface roughness surface functional groups and surface chemical properties recent models that coupled nm aggregation with transport equations have been reported to offer improved predictive ability babakhani et al 2019 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2021 models based on cft have been successful in fitting experimental data relatively well dong et al 2017 kasel et al 2013 sun et al 2015 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2017 despite lack of exclusive consideration to relevant processes such as aggregation in the classical convection dispersion equation cde based attachment detachment model physical retention mechanisms such as site blocking straining and ripening are lumped into an attachment rate parameter known as ka šimůnek et al 2012 however only few models have been proposed to account for the blocking function that in turn accounts for the reduction in attachment rate ka as deposition occurs for instance the langmuirian dynamics model considers ka to decrease linearly with increasing retained mass adamczyk et al 1994 and that ripening occurs at smax a nonlinear decrease in ka is used in the random sequential adsorption model implemented by johnson et al johnson and elimelech 1995 to account for the influence of physical straining depth dependent retention blocking function for colloid transport was introduced by bradford bradford et al 2003 moreover filtration theory logan et al 1995 is often used in computing attachment rates ka as a function of the grain diameter often termed as collector diameter pore water velocity and collector collision sticking efficiency for the colloid retention due to diffusion interception and sedimentation logan et al 1995 rajagopalan and tien 1976 different modeling approaches displayed varying levels of success in predicting colloid transport demonstrating the importance of physicochemical media properties on the transport and retention of colloids kasel et al 2013 wang et al 2018 the attachment detachment and mass transfer between liquid and solid phase described as a function of physicochemical interactions have been incorporated into the convection dispersion models to describe the go transport in porous media dong et al 2017 liang et al 2019 go transport and retention were found sensitive to the physicochemical conditions qi et al 2014a qi et al 2014b which would produce complex retention and blocking behavior due to the variability of these conditions in addition intrinsic media properties e g pore structure porosity surface roughness and surface chemical properties play a crucial role in colloid transport through porous media torkzaban and bradford 2016 which is anticipated to be reflected in the ka and smax values via numerical simulations this research is aimed at investigating the transport and retention behavior of go in bc and bc nzvi under subsurface conditions and under environmentally relevant is ranges using mathematical models breakthrough data from a series of fixed bed column studies under different is values 0 1 1 0 and 10 mm the most influential factor for go transport and retention in porous media was utilized in a numerical framework the investigation focusses on colloid transport and retention under environmentally relevant conditions using 2d nanomaterial go with abundant oxygen surface functional groups and porous media bc and bc nzvi with high porosity surface roughness and exceptional chemical surface respectively an inverse modeling approach was implemented to predict attachment rates ka and maximum solid phase concentrations smax using observations of go concentrations langmuirian dynamics and depth dependent blocking functions combined with attachment rate were used to describe the go transport and retention mechanisms and kinetics go transport and retention with infinite retention rate with no blocking were compared with models with blocking functions the study highlighted the importance of the classical convection dispersion equation cde including the langmuirian dynamics with a blocking function to predict the go transport and retention in biochar media in addition the model fitted ka and smax were employed in the forward modeling approach to predict the transport and retention for an extended go application and under different treatment depths to predict the serviceability of bc and bc nzvi previous studies focused on experimental and modeling investigation of go retention in sand and limestone which failed to retain go after few pore volumes pvs of solution beryani et al 2020 lanphere et al 2013 especially at lower ionic strength is here we apply a numerical model to explore the feasibility of using emerging treatment media bc and surface modified bc for retaining go from the subsurface environment under variable is we evaluate multiple model types corresponding to unlimited and limited attachment capacities and highlight the strength and weakness of each model type on predicting observed breakthrough curves and estimating transport and retention parameters parameter sensitivities breakthrough times and hydraulic and transport parameter were estimated via inverse modeling using experimental data bc is amenable to surface modification techniques for example with bc nzvi xiong et al 2019 we further asses how model parameter values breakthrough times and sensitivity results change for biochar surface

bc and bc nzvi in three configurations in borosilicate glass columns with a length of 20 cm and an inner diameter of 2 5 cm the three column configurations were homogeneous sand bc 5 w w layer on top of the sand and bc nzvi 5 w w layer on top of the sand the column configurations were labeled as sand bc sand and bc nzvi sand respectively an influent go concentration of 20 mg l 1 was applied through the columns at a flow rate of 2 0 ml min 1 using a peristaltic pump ten to thirty pore volumes pv of go solution with known is were introduced to the columns column effluents were periodically collected to measure go concentrations all the column configurations were duplicated and run under three environmentally relevant is values of 0 1 1 and 10 mm chowdhury et al 2013 effluent go

vis inverse modeling sand bc and bc nzvi media used during the experiments were characterized details about the experimental procedure and characterization results were briefly summarized elsewhere hasan et al 2021a 2 2 modeling approach to imitate the experimental data of the go transport through sand bc sand and bc nzvi sand columns we applied the hydrus 2d software package version 2 06 šimůnek et al 2012 to estimate media transport parameters and predict go transport behavior hydrus 2d can simultaneously simulate the water flow and go transport using a colloid transport module hydrus 2d was successfully used in previous studies to predict go and other contaminant transport and retention in porous media specially sand geza et al 2013 liang et al 2019 in this study we implemented the model to understand go transport processes in bc and bc nzvi with unique material properties the model has inverse modeling capabilities that allows for calibration of colloid transport parameters based on observed go btcs the calibrated model was used to analyze different scenarios including the effect of effluent go concentrations and media depth condition that may occur under field conditions but not feasible to investigate using field or lab experiments governing equations for water flow and colloid transport are briefly described here details are available elsewhere šimůnek et al 2012 2 2 1 water flow the one dimensional unsaturated water flow can be modeled by a modified form of richards equation eq 1 1 θ h t x i k h k ij a h x j k iz a s h where θ is the volumetric water content l3 l 3 h is the soil water pressure head l xi and xj i or j 1 2 3 are spatial coordinates l t is time t k h is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function l t 1 kij a and kiz a are components of a dimensionless anisotropy hydraulic conductivity tensor ka and s h is the sink term t 1 the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k h is a non linear function of the pressure head h which makes this partial differential equation nonlinear and difficult to solve analytically hydrus 2d can numerically solve eq 1 with a predefined analytical model e g van genuchten model eq 2 to explicitly characterize the relationship between pressure head and soil moisture content θ h šimůnek et al 2012 this relationship often called soil water retention curve can be developed in the laboratory in the van genuchten equation the hydraulic parameters can either be estimated by hydrus 2d itself by specifying known soil texture or be input manually for unknown materials such as bc and bc nzvi in this study an experiment was set up to estimate the hydraulic parameters for bc and bc nzvi in which a series of paired moisture and suction were measured from saturation to a significantly low 3 moisture content level media suction and moisture content were measured using t5 tensiometer meter group inc usa and sm 100 moisture sensor spectrum technologies inc usa these data were fitted using the van genuchten equation eq 2 van genuchten 1980 to predict the unsaturated hydraulic parameters α and n shown in table 1 details of the fitting parameters are given in section s1 and fig s1 supplementary material 2 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 αh n m h 0 θ s h 0 3 m 1 1 n where θs and θr are the saturated and residual water contents α and n empirical coefficients affecting the shape of the hydraulic functions additionally porosity bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity of sand bc and bc nzvi were measured in the laboratory shown in table 1 measurement techniques are described in the supplementary material section s2 fig s2 and table s1 2 2 2 colloid transport the hydrus 2d code numerically solves the convection dispersion equation for solute colloids nms transport the breakthrough curves btcs of go in sand bc sand and bc nzvi sand columns under different experimental conditions were simulated using cde equation with one site attachment kinetic retention given by eq 4 and 5 as 4 θc t ρ b s t z θd c z qc z 5 ρ b s t θ k a ψc where θ is the volumetric water content c is the go concentration in liquid phase t is time ρb is the bulk density of porous media s is the go concentration on solid phase z is the spatial coordinate d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient q is flow rate ka is the first order attachment rate coefficient and ψ is a dimensionless blocking function considering both langmuirian dynamics and depth dependent retention three different models m1 m2 and m3 supplementary material table s2 were employed m1 to m3 vary based on whether a blocking function is used and the type of blocking function implemented blocking function restricts retention rate depending on the amount of colloid deposited on the media with complete blocking occurring when the amount deposited reaches the maximum attachment capacity of the media m1 with ψ 1 represents a model with no blocking effect m2 and m3 consider blocking effect which reduces retention rate as the amount deposited approaches the maximum attachment capacity of the media m2 represents a langmuirian dynamics site blocking and m3 represents a depth dependent retention straining with β 0 432 bradford et al 2003 blocking functions for m2 and m3 are given by eq 6 and 7 respectively where ψ define as 6 ψ 1 s s max 7 ψ d c x d c β where smax is the maximum solid phase retention capacity dc is the average diameter of media and β is an empirical parameter each model m1 m2 and m3 were calibrated based on go btc data using hydus inverse modeling algorithm 2 2 3 model development the mathematical models were developed using hydrus 2d to represent all experimental columns and media properties as closely as possible to experimental conditions as shown in fig 1 laboratory measured soil bc and bc nzvi hydraulic parameter values were used as described in section 2 2 1 observation nodes in hydrus 2d were placed at the bottom of the domain corresponding to experimental effluent sampling location where the go concentration was measured the initial pressure head distribution was set such that the soil profile was hydrostatic with a pressure head of 100 cm at the bottom boundary hydrus 2d allows different boundary conditions for the flow and solute transport the top boundary condition was set to a constant flux of 2 0 ml min 1 0 407 cm min 1 which was maintained using a peristaltic pump the bottom boundary condition was considered as free drainage i e a unit hydraulic gradient as water was allowed to drain freely at the bottom of the columns a third type cauchy boundary condition was used along the top and bottom boundary of the model domain this type of boundary for solute flux is physically more realistic and mass conservative geza et al 2021 2 2 4 model calibration inverse modeling hydrus implements a marquardt levenberg type scheme for inverse parameter estimation and the governing transport equations are solved numerically using galerkin type linear finite element scheme prior to calibration we run the parameter sensitivity analysis under ranges of parameter values to identify parameters that influence the transport and retention of go the sensitivity results were normalized to allow comparison between parameters the results are shown in the supplementary material fig s3 the analysis revealed that θs ka and smax are sensitive to the go transport in bc bc nzvi sand layered media as these parameters are directly associated with the transport equations eqs 4 5 and 6 the analysis revealed that several other hydraulic parameters ksat θr α and n did not influence the go concentrations these parameters are related to water flux a constant boundary flux was used in the experiments the columns reached steady state in a short time and thus the hydraulic parameters did not affect flow or transport we used the inverse estimation procedure in hydrus 2d to estimate ka and smax using measured data breakthrough curves first transport parameters ka and smax of sand were inversely fitted for the sand column using btc data from the sand columns bc sand and bc nzvi sand columns had a layer of bc and bc nzvi on top of sand thus while determining ka and smax parameter values for bc and bc nzvi in those columns parameter values for sand layers were set to the previously estimated values using inverse modeling fitted model parameters each media sand bc and bc nzvi under models m1 to m3 are shown in table 2 r2 values represent the goodness of fit between observed and model predicted data which indicates the appropriateness of the model s ability to describe the go transport calibrated parameters for sand bc and bc nzvi determined using the procedure described above were employed to run other scenarios described in scenario analysis in section 3 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of is on go transport the effect of is on the transport processes was investigated using models m1 to m3 model fitted transport parameters are shown in table 2 the model fitted parameter values obtained from the inverse model illustrate whether the mechanisms included in the model sufficiently describe go transport and retention behavior we evaluated each modeling approach for each column configuration sand bc sand and bc nzvi sand and under three is values 0 1 1 0 and 10 mm estimated parameter values listed in table 2 indicate that ka and smax for sand were very low compared to the values in bc or bc nzvi therefore higher go retention in bc sand and bc nzvi sand columns is attributable to the bc and bc nzvi layers 3 1 1 no blocking m1 model m1 predicted btcs for all columns at 0 1 1 0 and 10 mm is values are shown in fig s4 numerical simulation showed that m1 model was able to predict go transport with r2 values in the range of 0 86 0 99 in sand columns experimental results showed that go retention in sand columns were negligible for all is ranges thus the m1 model with no blocking effect and a lower attachment rate ka of 0 004 to 1e 9 min 1 could readily describe go transport and retention blocking function is important when there is significant retention because the retention sites are used up and the blocking function would result in no deposition after reaching maximum retention capacity a lower attachment rate means that it would take a very long time to fill up all retention sites or for blocking to occur thus m1 model with no blocking was sufficient to describe retention in sand under a range of is values the breakthrough occurs faster in sand m1 also predicted go transport and retention very well r2 0 88 0 97 in bc sand columns for lower is values for a similar reason as the retention rates in bc were very low 0 049 and 0 086 min 1 respectively for is values of 0 1 and 1 mm the retention rate 0 379 min 1 in bc was 5 to 8 folds higher at 10 mm is when compared to the retention rate at 0 1 and 1 0 mm thus the m1 with no blocking failed r2 0 30 to describe go transport in bc sand columns for is value of 10 mm because the sorption sites are used up faster and ignoring the blocking and the assumption of an infinite retention rate often described by the clean bed theory under a higher attachment rate led to poor prediction attachment rates were 0 25 0 44 and 0 49 min 1 for bc nzvi under the is values of 0 1 1 and 10 mm respectively thus m1 model with no blocking failed to describe go transport in bc nzvi sand columns for the same reason the r2 for those column models were 0 01 0 07 and 0 59 for is values of 0 1 1 0 and 10 mm respectively bc nzvi had a relatively low attachment rate at higher is 10 mm thus m1 model was able to describe go transport and retention relatively better at 10 mm compared to other is values 3 1 2 langmuirian dynamics on blocking function m2 inversely fitted btcs using m2 model for all columns under different is values are depicted in fig 2 m2 model with langmuirian blocking function predicted go transport and retention well r2 0 70 0 99 for all media types under all conditions the langmuirian dynamics assumes finite retention capacity which activates site blocking when the available retention sites are filled up very low ka 1e 9 0 004 min 1 and relatively low smax 1e 6 0 473 were predicted in sand columns at all is values in model m2 due to a lower ka and smax no significant discrepancy was observed in the go transport in the sand between m1 and m2 models even with low smax values blocking may not occur or may take longer to occur in sand columns because of the lower attachment rates therefore m2 model will behave like m1 model and go transport in sand is likely to be well described using m2 model as well however the transport and retention behavior in bc and bc nzvi columns were different from sand columns bc and bc nzvi have physical properties such as high porosity surface roughness and chemical properties surface functional groups and the presence of nzvi for bc nzvi creating favorable conditions for retention of go particles this leads to relatively faster exhaustion of retention sites and activation of site blocking compared to sand columns thus for bc and bc nzvi models m2 model would be more appropriate depending on the is of the solution 3 1 2 1 estimation of ka and smax in bc parameter values estimated via inverse modeling provided in table 2 show an increasing attachment rate ka 0 065 0 104 and 0 615 min 1 in bc with increasing is 0 1 1 0 and 10 mm the ka in bc was 10 times higher at is of 10 mm compared to the attachment rate at 0 1 mm increasing attachment rate is attributable to reduced repulsive forces at higher is solution property which controls a deposition rates tufenkji and elimelech 2005 go and bc have negative surface charges and the repulsive forces are reduced with increasing is which introduces faster go attachment to bc at 10 mm compared to lower is values in addition the reduction of repulsive forces with increasing solution is likely increases the go go attachment enhancing go aggregation at higher is lanphere et al 2013 strong go aggregation was evident with a 2 5 fold increase in hydrodynamic diameter from 600 to 1500 nm in 100 min at 10 mm is hasan et al 2021a thus it is anticipated that go retention will increase at 10 mm is due to high aggregation rates in bc sand columns compared to relatively low aggregation rates at 0 1 and 1 0 mm is it was demonstrated that hydrodynamic diameters of go at 0 1 and 1 0 mm is ranged from 500 to 600 nm hasan et al 2021a the enhanced aggregation at higher is increased retention capacity of bc via straining model m2 predicted higher smax values for bc at higher is smax values estimated via inverse modeling varied from 0 83 to 6 17 in bc for is values of 0 1 to 10 mm is respectively the highest smax 6 17 occurred at 10 mm leading to the highest go retention on bc at highest is hydrus 2d does not include aggregation mechanisms the differences in the ka and smax estimated via inverse modeling were the result of the differences in outflow go concentration for the lower outflow concentrations the model predicted relatively higher ka and smax values and the vice versa for the higher go concentrations 3 1 2 2 estimation of ka and smax in bc nzvi transport parameters ka and smax were estimated using an inverse modeling approach for bc nzvi at different is values the ka values decreased with increasing is values opposite to the trends observed for bc the ka values obtained were 2 26 1 29 and 0 349 min 1 for is value of 0 1 1 0 and 10 mm respectively high attachment rates of 2 26 and 1 29 min 1 in bc nzvi indicated faster go attachments to bc nzvi at lower is values 0 1 and 1 0 mm is respectively the higher rate of attachment is attributable to the attachment of go to nzvi at lower is values 0 1 and 1 0 mm via electrostatic attraction and physical adsorption hasan et al 2021a the btc in fig 2 shows that little or no go was released for up to 14 pv of go application after 14 pv there was a sharp increase in effluent go concentration especially at 0 1 and 1 0 mm is indicating exhaustion of the retention sites this is attributable to the high attachment rates leading to faster filling of the retention sites and subsequent increase in go concentration leaving the media unlike bc model estimated go attachment rate was low in bc nzvi 0 349 min 1 at the higher is 10 mm in contrast to attachment rate of 0 615 min 1 for bc this is attributed to the partial dissolution of oxidized nzvi particles on bc nzvi by chloride ions which is more likely to happen at higher is 10 mm than lower is values of 0 1 and 1 0 mm as a result of increased concentration and interaction of nzvi with chloride ions which was also suggested by the previous studies ma 2012 sleiman et al 2017 dissolution of nzvi evident from effluent characterizations hasan et al 2021a reduced the go attachment rate ka in bc nzvi at 10 mm the impact of lower ka was also reflected in go btc fig 2 with an early breakthrough of 4 mg l 1 observed with only 2 pv of go application at 10 mm is while ka decreased with increasing is the model estimated smax values increased with increasing is similar to what was observed in bc the smax values were 2 73 3 53 and 6 47 for is value of 0 1 1 0 and 10 mm respectively this is attributable to the go aggregation and straining effect at 10 mm despite the lower ka at higher is bc nzvi had sufficient retention sites because of residual nzvi after partial dissolution of nzvi and accessible bc surface with high go retention capabilities at 10 mm as presented earlier in section 3 1 2 1 therefore the model estimated higher smax 6 47 value in bc nzvi at 10 mm compared to the value 6 17 obtained for bc because of lower ka at 10 mm is there was an early go release as shown in breakthrough curves fig 2 however the increase was not as sharp as what was observed at lower is 0 1 and 1 0 mm the gradual increase in go effluent concentration was due to higher smax the higher smax 6 47 for bc nzvi led to similar performance as bc at 10 mm is when the simulation is run for a longer time but for a shorter simulation time the bc showed slightly better performance fig 2 than bc nzvi because of the higher attachment rate under the same condition model m2 in hydrus 2d does not account for chemical interaction or aggregation mechanisms however the ka and smax values estimated via inverse modeling based on observations of effluent go concentrations were reasonable indicating that parameter estimation based on inverse model approach can provide important insight about physicochemical processes responsible for transport and retention behavior in go and other nanomaterials 3 1 3 depth dependent retention on blocking function m3 measured and model predicted go btcs for all columns using m3 under all is values are represented in fig s5 transport parameters estimated using inverse modeling are shown in table 2 m3 model performance varied depending on solution is compared to experimental results m3 model performance was good r2 0 86 0 99 for media types and solution is with low go retention rates e g sand columns and bc sand columns with lower is 0 1 and 1 0 mm values the m3 model performed well simply because estimated ka values were low that the depth dependent ψ values did not matter since the product ψka at any depth in eq 5 and the deposition rate s t were low regardless of ψ values on the contrary model prediction was relatively poor for media types that were effective in retaining go the r2 values were 0 01 0 07 and 0 59 for bc nzvi columns at 0 1 1 0 and 10 mm respectively the reason for poor performance was that model over estimated attachments rates the attachment rates predicted using inverse modeling were very high for m3 model for all is compared to m1 and m2 estimated attachment rates ka were 14 to 54 folds higher for bc and bc nzvi for m3 compared to the m1 and m2 retention is a function of both the dimensionless blocking function ψ and attachment rate ka as given by eq 5 the depth dependent function in eq 7 suggests high deposition rate s t near the surface where ψ 1 at z 0 and deposition rate declining exponentially with depth z thus the m3 model tends to overestimate ka to compensate for the sharp drop or near zero deposition rate s t below the surface the m3 model performed well for some conditions e g in sand columns or bc sand columns with lower is however it cannot be generalized that m3 is a good model as it may perform poorly particularly for media types and solution is values with high attachment rates overall the better performance of m2 describing the go transport and retention in bc or bc nzvi over m3 indicates the adsorption physical or chemical process dominates the go transport and retention than straining filtration 3 2 scenarios evaluation the scenario analysis was used to evaluate the time required for retention rate to cease due to blocking effect for different transport treatment depths under different influent go influent concentration two depths 5 and 20 cm were evaluated based on the recommended thickness of a mulch layer in stormwater bioretention 5 20 cm for nutrients metals and hydrocarbons removal minnesota et al 2021 the scenario analysis will provide an insight about the thickness of a bc bc nzvi layer that may need to remove a 2d nm e g go in stormwater best management practices bmps shojaeizadeh et al 2021 shojaeizadeh et al 2019 and wastewater treatment in the scenario analysis influent concentration varied from 0 1 to 10 mg l 1 at a flowrate of 2 0 ml min 1 the go concentration used is significantly higher compared to the graphene family nanomaterials gfn concentrations estimated in surface water or wastewater 10 8 to 10 5 mg l 1 goodwin jr et al 2018 gottschalk et al 2013 a high more conservative concentration was as a higher concentration of go may be released at a point source industrial waste contamination site simulation results show that the m2 model predicted experimental results better than m1 and m3 models parameter values ka and smax estimated using m2 model and measured hydraulic parameters for sand bc and bc nzvi were used to run scenarios to answer what if questions we evaluated effect of treatment depth and influent go concentration we run the simulation for longer time until the retention capacity is completely used up no considerable retention afterwards and go breakthrough occurred with c c0 0 98 we estimated the breakthrough time for various scenarios and the results are shown in fig 3a and b it was demonstrated fig 3a through scenario analysis that complete breakthrough occurred after 220 days for a 5 cm long bc for an influent go concentration of 0 1 mg l 1 and 0 1 mm is the required time for the complete breakthrough increased to 350 days for the same concentration for solution 10 mm is for a similar condition bc nzvi took 231 days and 465 days for is values of 0 1 and 10 mm respectively the breakthrough occurred faster when the influent go concentration was increased simulation results fig 3b showed that a 20 cm sand layer with an input go concentration of 0 1 mg l 1 under the relatively higher solution is of 10 mm required near to an hour for a complete breakthrough note that at the higher is value of 10 mm corresponds to better go aggregation and higher retention for lower is values with little or no aggregation it took less than an hour in sand columns for complete breakthrough to occur similarly if the input concentrations were high breakthrough would occur even faster for the identical condition as in the sand columns 20 cm treatment depth influent go concentration of 0 1 mg l 1 and 10 mm is it took significantly longer 1095 and 1270 days for bc and bc nzvi respectively for the same depth and is required breakthrough times were reduced to 120 and 150 days for bc and bc nzvi respectively when the influent go concentration increased 10 times 0 1 to 1 0 mg l 1 the longer complete breakthrough times in bc and bc nzvi with increasing is attributable to higher go aggregation at higher is leading to increased straining and retention hasan et al 2021a lanphere et al 2013 a shorter breakthrough time was observed for higher influent concentrations as more go input quickly fills up available retention sites simulated data indicated that the time required for the complete breakthrough for bc or bc nzvi is not a linear function of the treatment depth the time required for complete breakthrough in both bc and bc nzvi increased by about 200 for an increase in treatment depth of 300 5 to 20 cm for all is values this was also supported by the media characterization results hasan et al 2021a lanphere et al 2013 which indicated that most of the go was retained in the top layers and thus increasing the treatment depth further did not improve retention especially for low influent concentration the treatment depth becomes more important with increasing influent concentration values of model estimated transport and retention parameters e g ka and smax via inverse modeling were influenced by the solution is other factors influencing transport and retention behavior and fraction of go released c c0 are influent concentration and treatment depth thus scenario analysis results showed that complete breakthrough time was also influenced by the is and influent concentration and treatment depths for bc columns lower is of 0 1 mm resulted in a lower ka 0 065 min 1 which introduced an early go release the breakthrough was delayed significantly at higher is with ka of 0 615 min 1 fig 2 however bc nzvi was relatively more effective than bc at lower is 0 1 and 1 0 mm go release in bc nzvi was negligible up to 15 pv at 0 1 and 1 mm is fig 2 due to the high ka 2 26 and 1 29 min 1 respectively at 10 mm bc sand and bc nzvi sand column breakthrough curves showed a similar retention behavior similar c c0 although bc nzvi demonstrated better retention and delayed breakthrough compared to bc this agrees with relatively higher model estimated smax values for bc nzvi 4 conclusion this study investigated go transport through pristine biochar bc and modified biochar where biochar surface was coated with nanoscale zero valent iron bc nzvi under different solution ionic strengths is go breakthrough curves btcs from a series of lab scale sand bc sand and bc nzvi sand columns were fitted using hydrus 2d three different modeling approaches were evaluated corresponding to no blocking m1 site blocking langmuirian dynamics m2 and depth dependent straining blocking functions m3 on the retention coefficients transport parameter values were estimated via inverse modeling using experimental btcs the m2 model demonstrated a better fit with an r2 of 0 60 0 99 than the m1 and m3 models the model suggests the adsorption was more prominent in go retention than filtration model predicted ka and smax values for bc and bc nzvi were significantly higher than sand bc exhibited high ka and smax at 10 mm due to go bc attractions and strong go aggregations at higher is in contrast faster go attachment to nzvi at lower is 0 1 and 1 0 mm resulted in high ka values 2 26 and 1 29 for bc nzvi bc nzvi had a higher smax 6 47 close to bc 6 17 at is of 10 mm despite a lower ka 0 349 min 1 compared to ka of 0 615 min 1 for bc due to the interaction of nzvi with chloride ions modeled parameters ka and smax were utilized to evaluate the effect of treatment depth and go influent concentration on breakthrough time there was a considerable delay in go breakthrough time with increasing is and decreasing influent concentration for all media types the time required for complete breakthrough for a 5 cm bc and bc nzvi layer for an is of 0 1 mm and influent concentration of 0 1 mg l 1 was 220 and 231 days respectively for the same depth and influent concentration the breakthrough time was extended to 350 and 465 days for 10 mm is breakthrough time varied non linearly with the treatment depth especially at low go influent concentrations owing to a higher ka and smax bc nzvi outperformed bc at lower is values 0 1 and 1 0 mm model outputs also revealed that despite a lower ka at higher 10 mm is bc nzvi had delayed breakthrough times compared to bc due to a higher smax therefore the bc nzvi can potentially serve as the efficient media for go treatment under subsurface environments in stormwater wastewater treatment systems and point source industrial sites the current study evaluated multiple models that are based on cft future studies should compare cft based models with those that couple aggregation and transport models to assess improvements in

langmuirian attachment model with site blocking function effectively described experimental go breakthrough curves r2 0 70 0 99 compared to other models indicating the importance of introducing a limit on the attachment capacity of the media the ka values for bc and bc nzvi were significantly higher than sand attributable to high porosity roughness and surface chemical properties the models predicted an increasing trend in ka 0 065 to 0 615 min 1 in bc with increasing is 0 1 to 10 mm while ka values decreased 2 26 to 0 349 min 1 for bc nzvi a consistent increase in smax was observed for both bc and bc nzvi with increasing is scenario analysis was conducted to further understand the effect of influent is go concentration and treatment depth bc nzvi exhibited a higher ka and smax and as a result higher go retention than bc at lower is 0 1 and 1 0 mm bc nzvi had a relatively lower ka 0 349 min 1 at 10 mm is however it outperformed bc when go retention capacities are compared over a longer period attributable to a higher smax 6 47 complete go breakthrough occurred in a 5 cm media after 350 and 465 days for bc and bc nzvi respectively at 10 mm is and influent concentration of 0 1

surface interactions between bc and go high porosity and surface roughness has been reported to enhance go aggregation and retention in bc particularly at higher ionic strength is bradford and torkzaban 2008 hasan et al 2021a torkzaban and bradford 2016 interaction kinetics and retention behavior of go particles is influenced by both the physical e g size chemical composition and surface

attractive or repulsive forms which can be explained well by the van der waals force and electrostatic double layer interactions sun et al 2015 tang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 once released into the environment go is exposed to physicochemical environments which affect its transport and retention behavior for example an increase in hydrodynamic diameter aggregation and a decrease in electrophoretic mobility epm of go has been reported with increasing is such alterations will directly influence its transport and retention behavior french et al 2009 lanphere et al 2013 the go transport and retention behavior also depends upon the media properties e g porosity roughness and the presence of other materials prior studies revealed that the temperature does not affect the go transport through sand however a considerably increase in go attachment has been reported at higher is and lower ph conditions sotirelis and chrysikopoulos 2015 despite the unfavorable attachment conditions enhanced go interactions have been reported in the presence of kaolinite and montmorillonite commonly found minerals in the subsurface in the sand due to heteroaggregation of go with the colloids chrysikopoulos et al 2017 sotirelis and chrysikopoulos 2017 syngouna et al 2020 co transportation with go increased the mobility of heavy metals cd2 and pb2 in porous media jiang et al 2018

studies based on colloid filtration theory cft with a clean bed porous media configuration assumed a constant attachment rate ka and infinite retention capacity smith et al 2008 tian et al 2010 yao et al 1971 realistically media displays an allowable retention capacity beyond which retention ceases to cause blocking and subsequent decrease in attachment rates with an increase in the mobility of nanomaterials leij et al 2015 prior models have merged time and depth dependent retention blocking and aggregation mechanisms with the transport equations to describe the nm transport in porous media babakhani et al 2017 wang et al 2018 numerical modeling of go transport in the geomedia e g bc or bc nzvi needs special consideration compared to sand when numerical approaches are implemented to investigate their transport and retention behaviors torkzaban and bradford 2016 this is particularly true because such geomedia display diverse porosity surface roughness surface functional groups and surface chemical properties recent models that coupled nm aggregation with transport equations have been reported to offer improved predictive ability babakhani et al 2019 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2021 models based on cft have been successful in fitting experimental data relatively well dong et al 2017 kasel et al 2013 sun et al 2015 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2017 despite lack of exclusive consideration to relevant processes such as aggregation in the classical convection dispersion equation cde based attachment detachment model physical retention mechanisms such as site blocking straining and ripening are lumped into an attachment rate parameter known as ka šimůnek et al 2012 however only few models have been proposed to account for the blocking function that in turn accounts for the reduction in attachment rate ka as deposition occurs for instance the langmuirian dynamics model considers ka to decrease linearly with increasing retained mass adamczyk et al 1994 and that ripening occurs at smax a nonlinear decrease in ka is used in the random sequential adsorption model implemented by johnson et al johnson and elimelech 1995 to account for the influence of physical straining depth dependent retention blocking function for colloid transport was introduced by bradford bradford et al 2003 moreover filtration theory logan et al 1995 is often used in computing attachment rates ka as a function of the grain diameter often termed as collector diameter pore water velocity and collector collision sticking efficiency for the colloid retention due to diffusion interception and sedimentation logan et al 1995 rajagopalan and tien 1976 different modeling approaches displayed varying levels of success in predicting colloid transport demonstrating the importance of physicochemical media properties on the transport and retention of colloids kasel et al 2013 wang et al 2018 the attachment detachment and mass transfer between liquid and solid phase described as a function of physicochemical interactions have been incorporated into the convection dispersion models to describe the go transport in porous media dong et al 2017 liang et al 2019 go transport and retention were found sensitive to the physicochemical conditions qi et al 2014a qi et al 2014b which would produce complex retention and blocking behavior due to the variability of these conditions in addition intrinsic media properties e g pore structure porosity surface roughness and surface chemical properties play a crucial role in colloid transport through porous media torkzaban and bradford 2016 which is anticipated to be reflected in the ka and smax values via numerical simulations this research is aimed at investigating the transport and retention behavior of go in bc and bc nzvi under subsurface conditions and under environmentally relevant is ranges using mathematical models breakthrough data from a series of fixed bed column studies under different is values 0 1 1 0 and 10 mm the most influential factor for go transport and retention in porous media was utilized in a numerical framework the investigation focusses on colloid transport and retention under environmentally relevant conditions using 2d nanomaterial go with abundant oxygen surface functional groups and porous media bc and bc nzvi with high porosity surface roughness and exceptional chemical surface respectively an inverse modeling approach was implemented to predict attachment rates ka and maximum solid phase concentrations smax using observations of go concentrations langmuirian dynamics and depth dependent blocking functions combined with attachment rate were used to describe the go transport and retention mechanisms and kinetics go transport and retention with infinite retention rate with no blocking were compared with models with blocking functions the study highlighted the importance of the classical convection dispersion equation cde including the langmuirian dynamics with a blocking function to predict the go transport and retention in biochar media in addition the model fitted ka and smax were employed in the forward modeling approach to predict the transport and retention for an extended go application and under different treatment depths to predict the serviceability of bc and bc nzvi previous studies focused on experimental and modeling investigation of go retention in sand and limestone which failed to retain go after few pore volumes pvs of solution beryani et al 2020 lanphere et al 2013 especially at lower ionic strength is here we apply a numerical model to explore the feasibility of using emerging treatment media bc and surface modified bc for retaining go from the subsurface environment under variable is we evaluate multiple model types corresponding to unlimited and limited attachment capacities and highlight the strength and weakness of each model type on predicting observed breakthrough curves and estimating transport and retention parameters parameter sensitivities breakthrough times and hydraulic and transport parameter were estimated via inverse modeling using experimental data bc is amenable to surface modification techniques for example with bc nzvi xiong et al 2019 we further asses how model parameter values breakthrough times and sensitivity results change for biochar surface coated bc nzvi under different solution ionic strengths is 2 materials and methods 2 1 column experiments experimental data were collected from a series of column studies performed using quartz sand bc and bc nzvi in three configurations in borosilicate glass columns with a length of 20 cm and an inner diameter of 2 5 cm the three column configurations were homogeneous sand bc 5 w w layer on top of the sand and bc nzvi 5 w w layer on top of the sand the column configurations were labeled as sand bc sand and bc nzvi sand respectively an influent go concentration of 20 mg l 1 was applied through the columns at a flow rate of 2 0 ml min 1 using a peristaltic pump ten to thirty pore volumes pv of go solution with known is were introduced to the columns column effluents were periodically collected to measure go concentrations all the column configurations were duplicated and run under three environmentally relevant is values of 0 1 1 and 10 mm chowdhury et al 2013 effluent go

vis inverse modeling sand bc and bc nzvi media used during the experiments were characterized details about the experimental procedure and characterization results were briefly summarized elsewhere hasan et al 2021a 2 2 modeling approach to imitate the experimental data of the go transport through sand bc sand and bc nzvi sand columns we applied the hydrus 2d software package version 2 06 šimůnek et al 2012 to estimate media transport parameters and predict go transport behavior hydrus 2d can simultaneously simulate the water flow and go transport using a colloid transport module hydrus 2d was successfully used in previous studies to predict go and other contaminant transport and retention in porous media specially sand geza et al 2013 liang et al 2019 in this study we implemented the model to understand go transport processes in bc and bc nzvi with unique material properties the model has inverse modeling capabilities that allows for calibration of colloid transport parameters based on observed go btcs the calibrated model was used to analyze different scenarios including the effect of effluent go concentrations and media depth condition that may occur under field conditions but not feasible to investigate using field or lab experiments governing equations for water flow and colloid transport are briefly described here details are available elsewhere šimůnek et al 2012 2 2 1 water flow the one dimensional unsaturated water flow can be modeled by a modified form of richards equation eq 1 1 θ h t x i k h k ij a h x j k iz a s h where θ is the volumetric water content l3 l 3 h is the soil water pressure head l xi and xj i or j 1 2 3 are spatial coordinates l t is time t k h is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function l t 1 kij a and kiz a are components of a dimensionless anisotropy hydraulic conductivity tensor ka and s h is the sink term t 1 the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k h is a non linear function of the pressure head h which makes this partial differential equation nonlinear and difficult to solve analytically hydrus 2d can numerically solve eq 1 with a predefined analytical model e g van genuchten model eq 2 to explicitly characterize the relationship between pressure head and soil moisture content θ h šimůnek et al 2012 this relationship often called soil water retention curve can be developed in the laboratory in the van genuchten equation the hydraulic parameters can either be estimated by hydrus 2d itself by specifying known soil texture or be input manually for unknown materials such as bc and bc nzvi in this study an experiment was set up to estimate the hydraulic parameters for bc and bc nzvi in which a series of paired moisture and suction were measured from saturation to a significantly low 3 moisture content level media suction and moisture content were measured using t5 tensiometer meter group inc usa and sm 100 moisture sensor spectrum technologies inc usa these data were fitted using the van genuchten equation eq 2 van genuchten 1980 to predict the unsaturated hydraulic parameters α and n shown in table 1 details of the fitting parameters are given in section s1 and fig s1 supplementary material 2 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 αh n m h 0 θ s h 0 3 m 1 1 n where θs and θr are the saturated and residual water contents α and n empirical coefficients affecting the shape of the hydraulic functions additionally porosity bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity of sand bc and bc nzvi were measured in the laboratory shown in table 1 measurement techniques are described in the supplementary material section s2 fig s2 and table s1 2 2 2 colloid transport the hydrus 2d code numerically solves the convection dispersion equation for solute colloids nms transport the breakthrough curves btcs of go in sand bc sand and bc nzvi sand columns under different experimental conditions were simulated using cde equation with one site attachment kinetic retention given by eq 4 and 5 as 4 θc t ρ b s t z θd c z qc z 5 ρ b s t θ k a ψc where θ is the volumetric water content c is the go concentration in liquid phase t is time ρb is the bulk density of porous media s is the go concentration on solid phase z is the spatial coordinate d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient q is flow rate ka is the first order attachment rate coefficient and ψ is a dimensionless blocking function considering both langmuirian dynamics and depth dependent retention three different models m1 m2 and m3 supplementary material table s2 were employed m1 to m3 vary based on whether a blocking function is used and the type of blocking function implemented blocking function restricts retention rate depending on the amount of colloid deposited on the media with complete blocking occurring when the amount deposited reaches the maximum attachment capacity of the media m1 with ψ 1 represents a model with no blocking effect m2 and m3 consider blocking effect which reduces retention rate as the amount deposited approaches the maximum attachment capacity of the media m2 represents a langmuirian dynamics site blocking and m3 represents a depth dependent retention straining with β 0 432 bradford et al 2003 blocking functions for m2 and m3 are given by eq 6 and 7 respectively where ψ define as 6 ψ 1 s s max 7 ψ d c x d c β where smax is the maximum solid phase retention capacity dc is the average diameter of media and β is an empirical parameter each model m1 m2 and m3 were calibrated based on go btc data using hydus inverse modeling algorithm 2 2 3 model development the mathematical models were developed using hydrus 2d to represent all experimental columns and media properties as closely as possible to experimental conditions as shown in fig 1 laboratory measured soil bc and bc nzvi hydraulic parameter values were used as described in section 2 2 1 observation nodes in hydrus 2d were placed at the bottom of the domain corresponding to experimental effluent sampling location where the go concentration was measured the initial pressure head distribution was set such that the soil profile was hydrostatic with a pressure head of 100 cm at the bottom boundary hydrus 2d allows different boundary conditions for the flow and solute transport the top boundary condition was set to a constant flux of 2 0 ml min 1 0 407 cm min 1 which was maintained using a peristaltic pump the bottom boundary condition was considered as free drainage i e a unit hydraulic gradient as water was allowed to drain freely at the bottom of the columns a third type cauchy boundary condition was used along the top and bottom boundary of the model domain this type of boundary for solute flux is physically more realistic and mass conservative geza et al 2021 2 2 4 model calibration inverse modeling hydrus implements a marquardt levenberg type scheme for inverse parameter estimation and the governing transport equations are solved numerically using galerkin type linear finite element scheme prior to calibration we run the parameter sensitivity analysis under ranges of parameter values to identify parameters that influence the transport and retention of go the sensitivity results were normalized to allow comparison between parameters the results are shown in the supplementary material fig s3 the analysis revealed that θs ka and smax are sensitive to the go transport in bc bc nzvi sand layered media as these parameters are directly associated with the transport equations eqs 4 5 and 6 the analysis revealed that several other hydraulic parameters ksat θr α and n did not influence the go concentrations these parameters are related to water flux a constant boundary flux was used in the experiments the columns reached steady state in a short time and thus the hydraulic parameters did not affect flow or transport we used the inverse estimation procedure in hydrus 2d to estimate ka and smax using measured data breakthrough curves first transport parameters ka and smax of sand were inversely fitted for the sand column using btc data from the sand columns bc sand and bc nzvi sand columns had a layer of bc and bc nzvi on top of sand thus while determining ka and smax parameter values for bc and bc nzvi in those columns parameter values for sand layers were set to the previously estimated values using inverse modeling fitted model parameters each media sand bc and bc nzvi under models m1 to m3 are shown in table 2 r2 values represent the goodness of fit between observed and model predicted data which indicates the appropriateness of the model s ability to describe the go transport calibrated parameters for sand bc and bc nzvi determined using the procedure described above were employed to run other scenarios described in scenario analysis in section 3 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of is on go transport the effect of is on the transport processes was investigated using models m1 to m3 model fitted transport parameters are shown in table 2 the model fitted parameter values obtained from the inverse model illustrate whether the mechanisms included in the model sufficiently describe go transport and retention behavior we evaluated each modeling approach for each column configuration sand bc sand and bc nzvi sand and under three is values 0 1 1 0 and 10 mm estimated parameter values listed in table 2 indicate that ka and smax for sand were very low compared to the values in bc or bc nzvi therefore higher go retention in bc sand and bc nzvi sand columns is attributable to the bc and bc nzvi layers 3 1 1 no blocking m1 model m1 predicted btcs for all columns at 0 1 1 0 and 10 mm is values are shown in fig s4 numerical simulation showed that m1 model was able to predict go transport with r2 values in the range of 0 86 0 99 in sand columns experimental results showed that go retention in sand columns were negligible for all is ranges thus the m1 model with no blocking effect and a lower attachment rate ka of 0 004 to 1e 9 min 1 could readily describe go transport and retention blocking function is important when there is significant retention because the retention sites are used up and the blocking function would result in no deposition after reaching maximum retention capacity a lower attachment rate means that it would take a very long time to fill up all retention sites or for blocking to occur thus m1 model with no blocking was sufficient to describe retention in sand under a range of is values the breakthrough occurs faster in sand m1 also predicted go transport and retention very well r2 0 88 0 97 in bc sand columns for lower is values for a similar reason as the retention rates in bc were very low 0 049 and 0 086 min 1 respectively for is values of 0 1 and 1 mm the retention rate 0 379 min 1 in bc was 5 to 8 folds higher at 10 mm is when compared to the retention rate at 0 1 and 1 0 mm thus the m1 with no blocking failed r2 0 30 to describe go transport in bc sand columns for is value of 10 mm because the sorption sites are used up faster and ignoring the blocking and the assumption of an infinite retention rate often described by the clean bed theory under a higher attachment rate led to poor prediction attachment rates were 0 25 0 44 and 0 49 min 1 for bc nzvi under the is values of 0 1 1 and 10 mm respectively thus m1 model with no blocking failed to describe go transport in bc nzvi sand columns for the same reason the r2 for those column models were 0 01 0 07 and 0 59 for is values of 0 1 1 0 and 10 mm respectively bc nzvi had a relatively low attachment rate at higher is 10 mm thus m1 model was able to describe go transport and retention relatively better at 10 mm compared to other is values 3 1 2 langmuirian dynamics on blocking function m2 inversely fitted btcs using m2 model for all columns under different is values are depicted in fig 2 m2 model with langmuirian blocking function predicted go transport and retention well r2 0 70 0 99 for all media types under all conditions the langmuirian dynamics assumes finite retention capacity which activates site blocking when the available retention sites are filled up very low ka 1e 9 0 004 min 1 and relatively low smax 1e 6 0 473 were predicted in sand columns at all is values in model m2 due to a lower ka and smax no significant discrepancy was observed in the go transport in the sand between m1 and m2 models even with low smax values blocking may not occur or may take longer to occur in sand columns because of the lower attachment rates therefore m2 model will behave like m1 model and go transport in sand is likely to be well described using m2 model as well however the transport and retention behavior in bc and bc nzvi columns were different from sand columns bc and bc nzvi have physical properties such as high porosity surface roughness and chemical properties surface functional groups and the presence of nzvi for bc nzvi creating favorable conditions for retention of go particles this leads to relatively faster exhaustion of retention sites and activation of site blocking compared to sand columns thus for bc and bc nzvi models m2 model would be more appropriate depending on the is of the solution 3 1 2 1 estimation of ka and smax in bc parameter values estimated via inverse modeling provided in table 2 show an increasing attachment rate ka 0 065 0 104 and 0 615 min 1 in bc with increasing is 0 1 1 0 and 10 mm the ka in bc was 10 times higher at is of 10 mm compared to the attachment rate at 0 1 mm increasing attachment rate is attributable to reduced repulsive forces at higher is solution property which controls a deposition rates tufenkji and elimelech 2005 go and bc have negative surface charges and the repulsive forces are reduced with increasing is which introduces faster go attachment to bc at 10 mm compared to lower is values in addition the reduction of repulsive forces with increasing solution is likely increases the go go attachment enhancing go aggregation at higher is lanphere et al 2013 strong go aggregation was evident with a 2 5 fold increase in hydrodynamic diameter from 600 to 1500 nm in 100 min at 10 mm is hasan et al 2021a thus it is anticipated that go retention will increase at 10 mm is due to high aggregation rates in bc sand columns compared to relatively low aggregation rates at 0 1 and 1 0 mm is it was demonstrated that hydrodynamic diameters of go at 0 1 and 1 0 mm is ranged from 500 to 600 nm hasan et al 2021a the enhanced aggregation at higher is increased retention capacity of bc via straining model m2 predicted higher smax values for bc at higher is smax values estimated via inverse modeling varied from 0 83 to 6 17 in bc for is values of 0 1 to 10 mm is respectively the highest smax 6 17 occurred at 10 mm leading to the highest go retention on bc at highest is hydrus 2d does not include aggregation mechanisms the differences in the ka and smax estimated via inverse modeling were the result of the differences in outflow go concentration for the lower outflow concentrations the model predicted relatively higher ka and smax values and the vice versa for the higher go concentrations 3 1 2 2 estimation of ka and smax in bc nzvi transport parameters ka and smax were estimated using an inverse modeling approach for bc nzvi at different is values the ka values decreased with increasing is values opposite to the trends observed for bc the ka values obtained were 2 26 1 29 and 0 349 min 1 for is value of 0 1 1 0 and 10 mm respectively high attachment rates of 2 26 and 1 29 min 1 in bc nzvi indicated faster go attachments to bc nzvi at lower is values 0 1 and 1 0 mm is respectively the higher rate of attachment is attributable to the attachment of go to nzvi at lower is values 0 1 and 1 0 mm via electrostatic attraction and physical adsorption hasan et al 2021a the btc in fig 2 shows that little or no go was released for up to 14 pv of go application after 14 pv there was a sharp increase in effluent go concentration especially at 0 1 and 1 0 mm is indicating exhaustion of the retention sites this is attributable to the high attachment rates leading to faster filling of the retention sites and subsequent increase in go concentration leaving the media unlike bc model estimated go attachment rate was low in bc nzvi 0 349 min 1 at the higher is 10 mm in contrast to attachment rate of 0 615 min 1 for bc this is attributed to the partial dissolution of oxidized nzvi particles on bc nzvi by chloride ions which is more likely to happen at higher is 10 mm than lower is values of 0 1 and 1 0 mm as a result of increased concentration and interaction of nzvi with chloride ions which was also suggested by the previous studies ma 2012 sleiman et al 2017 dissolution of nzvi evident from effluent characterizations hasan et al 2021a reduced the go attachment rate ka in bc nzvi at 10 mm the impact of lower ka was also reflected in go btc fig 2 with an early breakthrough of 4 mg l 1 observed with only 2 pv of go application at 10 mm is while ka decreased with increasing is the model estimated smax values increased with increasing is similar to what was observed in bc the smax values were 2 73 3 53 and 6 47 for is value of 0 1 1 0 and 10 mm respectively this is attributable to the go aggregation and straining effect at 10 mm despite the lower ka at higher is bc nzvi had sufficient retention sites because of residual nzvi after partial dissolution of nzvi and accessible bc surface with high go retention capabilities at 10 mm as presented earlier in section 3 1 2 1 therefore the model estimated higher smax 6 47 value in bc nzvi at 10 mm compared to the value 6 17 obtained for bc because of lower ka at 10 mm is there was an early go release as shown in breakthrough curves fig 2 however the increase was not as sharp as what was observed at lower is 0 1 and 1 0 mm the gradual increase in go effluent concentration was due to higher smax the higher smax 6 47 for bc nzvi led to similar performance as bc at 10 mm is when the simulation is run for a longer time but for a shorter simulation time the bc showed slightly better performance fig 2 than bc nzvi because of the higher attachment rate under the same condition model m2 in hydrus 2d does not account for chemical interaction or aggregation mechanisms however the ka and smax values estimated via inverse modeling based on observations of effluent go concentrations were reasonable indicating that parameter estimation based on inverse model approach can provide important insight about physicochemical processes responsible for transport and retention behavior in go and other nanomaterials 3 1 3 depth dependent retention on blocking function m3 measured and model predicted go btcs for all columns using m3 under all is values are represented in fig s5 transport parameters estimated using inverse modeling are shown in table 2 m3 model performance varied depending on solution is compared to experimental results m3 model performance was good r2 0 86 0 99 for media types and solution is with low go retention rates e g sand columns and bc sand columns with lower is 0 1 and 1 0 mm values the m3 model performed well simply because estimated ka values were low that the depth dependent ψ values did not matter since the product ψka at any depth in eq 5 and the deposition rate s t were low regardless of ψ values on the contrary model prediction was relatively poor for media types that were effective in retaining go the r2 values were 0 01 0 07 and 0 59 for bc nzvi columns at 0 1 1 0 and 10 mm respectively the reason for poor performance was that model over estimated attachments rates the attachment rates predicted using inverse modeling were very high for m3 model for all is compared to m1 and m2 estimated attachment rates ka were 14 to 54 folds higher for bc and bc nzvi for m3 compared to the m1 and m2 retention is a function of both the dimensionless blocking function ψ and attachment rate ka as given by eq 5 the depth dependent function in eq 7 suggests high deposition rate s t near the surface where ψ 1 at z 0 and deposition rate declining exponentially with depth z thus the m3 model tends to overestimate ka to compensate for the sharp drop or near zero deposition rate s t below the surface the m3 model performed well for some conditions e g in sand columns or bc sand columns with lower is however it cannot be generalized that m3 is a good model as it may perform poorly particularly for media types and solution is values with high attachment rates overall the better performance of m2 describing the go transport and retention in bc or bc nzvi over m3 indicates the adsorption physical or chemical process dominates the go transport and retention than straining filtration 3 2 scenarios evaluation the scenario analysis was used to evaluate the time required for retention rate to cease due to blocking effect for different transport treatment depths under different influent go influent concentration two depths 5 and 20 cm were evaluated based on the recommended thickness of a mulch layer in stormwater bioretention 5 20 cm for nutrients metals and hydrocarbons removal minnesota et al 2021 the scenario analysis will provide an insight about the thickness of a bc bc nzvi layer that may need to remove a 2d nm e g go in stormwater best management practices bmps shojaeizadeh et al 2021 shojaeizadeh et al 2019 and wastewater treatment in the scenario analysis influent concentration varied from 0 1 to 10 mg l 1 at a flowrate of 2 0 ml min 1 the go concentration used is significantly higher compared to the graphene family nanomaterials gfn concentrations estimated in surface water or wastewater 10 8 to 10 5 mg l 1 goodwin jr et al 2018 gottschalk et al 2013 a high more conservative concentration was as a higher concentration of go may be released at a point source industrial waste contamination site simulation results show that the m2 model predicted experimental results better than m1 and m3 models parameter values ka and smax estimated using m2 model and measured hydraulic parameters for sand bc and bc nzvi were used to run scenarios to answer what if questions we evaluated effect of treatment depth and influent go concentration we run the simulation for longer time until the retention capacity is completely used up no considerable retention afterwards and go breakthrough occurred with c c0 0 98 we estimated the breakthrough time for various scenarios and the results are shown in fig 3a and b it was demonstrated fig 3a through scenario analysis that complete breakthrough occurred after 220 days for a 5 cm long bc for an influent go concentration of 0 1 mg l 1 and 0 1 mm is the required time for the complete breakthrough increased to 350 days for the same concentration for solution 10 mm is for a similar condition bc nzvi took 231 days and 465 days for is values of 0 1 and 10 mm respectively the breakthrough occurred faster when the influent go concentration was increased simulation results fig 3b showed that a 20 cm sand layer with an input go concentration of 0 1 mg l 1 under the relatively higher solution is of 10 mm required near to an hour for a complete breakthrough note that at the higher is value of 10 mm corresponds to better go aggregation and higher retention for lower is values with little or no aggregation it took less than an hour in sand columns for complete breakthrough to occur similarly if the input concentrations were high breakthrough would occur even faster for the identical condition as in the sand columns 20 cm treatment depth influent go concentration of 0 1 mg l 1 and 10 mm is it took significantly longer 1095 and 1270 days for bc and bc nzvi respectively for the same depth and is required breakthrough times were reduced to 120 and 150 days for bc and bc nzvi respectively when the influent go concentration increased 10 times 0 1 to 1 0 mg l 1 the longer complete breakthrough times in bc and bc nzvi with increasing is attributable to higher go aggregation at higher is leading to increased straining and retention hasan et al 2021a lanphere et al 2013 a shorter breakthrough time was observed for higher influent concentrations as more go input quickly fills up available retention sites simulated data indicated that the time required for the complete breakthrough for bc or bc nzvi is not a linear function of the treatment depth the time required for complete breakthrough in both bc and bc nzvi increased by about 200 for an increase in treatment depth of 300 5 to 20 cm for all is values this was also supported by the media characterization results hasan et al 2021a lanphere et al 2013 which indicated that most of the go was retained in the top layers and thus increasing the treatment depth further did not improve retention especially for low influent concentration the treatment depth becomes more important with increasing influent concentration values of model estimated transport and retention parameters e g ka and smax via inverse modeling were influenced by the solution is other factors influencing transport and retention behavior and fraction of go released c c0 are influent concentration and treatment depth thus scenario analysis results showed that complete breakthrough time was also influenced by the is and influent concentration and treatment depths for bc columns lower is of 0 1 mm resulted in a lower ka 0 065 min 1 which introduced an early go release the breakthrough was delayed significantly at higher is with ka of 0 615 min 1 fig 2 however bc nzvi was relatively more effective than bc at lower is 0 1 and 1 0 mm go release in bc nzvi was negligible up to 15 pv at 0 1 and 1 mm is fig 2 due to the high ka 2 26 and 1 29 min 1 respectively at 10 mm bc sand and bc nzvi sand column breakthrough curves showed a similar retention behavior similar c c0 although bc nzvi demonstrated better retention and delayed breakthrough compared to bc this agrees with relatively higher model estimated smax values for bc nzvi 4 conclusion this study investigated go transport through pristine biochar bc and modified biochar where biochar surface was coated with nanoscale zero valent iron bc nzvi under different solution ionic strengths is go breakthrough curves btcs from a series of lab scale sand bc sand and bc nzvi sand columns were fitted using hydrus 2d three different modeling approaches were evaluated corresponding to no blocking m1 site blocking langmuirian dynamics m2 and depth dependent straining blocking functions m3 on the retention coefficients transport parameter values were estimated via inverse modeling using experimental btcs the m2 model demonstrated a better fit with an r2 of 0 60 0 99 than the m1 and m3 models the model suggests the adsorption was more prominent in go retention than filtration model predicted ka and smax values for bc and bc nzvi were significantly higher than sand bc exhibited high ka and smax at 10 mm due to go bc attractions and strong go aggregations at higher is in contrast faster go attachment to nzvi at lower is 0 1 and 1 0 mm resulted in high ka values 2 26 and 1 29 for bc nzvi bc nzvi had a higher smax 6 47 close to bc 6 17 at is of 10 mm despite a lower ka 0 349 min 1 compared to ka of 0 615 min 1 for bc due to the interaction of nzvi with chloride ions modeled parameters ka and smax were utilized to evaluate the effect of treatment depth and go influent concentration on breakthrough time there was a considerable delay in go breakthrough time with increasing is and decreasing influent concentration for all media types the time required for complete breakthrough for a 5 cm bc and bc nzvi layer for an is of 0 1 mm and influent concentration of 0 1 mg l 1 was 220 and 231 days respectively for the same depth and influent concentration the breakthrough time was extended to 350 and 465 days for 10 mm is breakthrough time varied non linearly with the treatment depth especially at low go influent concentrations owing to a higher ka and smax bc nzvi outperformed bc at lower is values 0 1 and 1 0 mm model outputs also revealed that despite a lower ka at higher 10 mm is bc nzvi had delayed breakthrough times compared to bc due to a higher smax therefore the bc nzvi can potentially serve as the efficient media for go treatment under subsurface environments in stormwater wastewater treatment systems and point source industrial sites the current study evaluated multiple models that are based on cft future studies should compare cft based models with those that couple aggregation and transport models to assess improvements in
