1820,governing equations of soil water flow are traditionally derived from the conservation of mass and the buckingham darcy law however due to uncertainties in many aspects such as physical processes and constitutive relationships a thorough understanding of soil water flow in a theory driven way often poses many challenges with the fast improvement of data acquisition ability data driven approaches have gained considerable scientific interest in discovering the governing equations of physical problems however most existing studies focused on linear or weakly nonlinear problems with constant coefficients in their partial differential equations this study attempted to propose a modified two step data driven method to identify the strongly nonlinear equation of unsaturated flow the richardson richards equation and coefficients were jointly identified by hybridizing sparse regression and iterative smoother the automatic differentiation scheme was introduced to reduce the risk of performance collapse from data noise common in sparse regression methods we demonstrated the ability and the challenge as well of identifying the soil water flow governing equations in a data driven way with the aid of a series of synthetic cases our results showed that the modified method was capable of accurately identifying the governing equation of unsaturated flow whose performance was almost independent of prior knowledge of the equation form and constitutive relationships if the underlying physical processes are poorly understood then a more relaxed equation form was recommended the reduction in the spatiotemporal resolution of sampling may cause higher order terms to be difficult to derive accurately or some terms that were not originally present to appear in the identified equation although not completely eliminated the detrimental effect of data noise on the identification of the governing equations can be greatly mitigated by introducing the automatic differentiation scheme keywords soil water flow equation identification nonlinearity data noise data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurately describing soil water flow in the vadose zone is of vital importance in many aspects of hydrology including evaporation groundwater recharge soil moisture storage and soil erosion feddes and raats 2004 lazarovitch et al 2018 penman 1948 smerdon 2017 mathematically the dynamics of soil water flow are described by a nonlinear partial differential equation pde commonly referred to as the richardson richards equation rre richards 1931 richardson 1922 the ree is theoretically derived from the conservation of mass and the buckingham darcy law buckingham 1907 in addition to these first principle derivations constitutive relationships between conductivity water content and hydraulic head are also required whose functions are usually expressed in a nonlinear form with a shared set of parameters assouline 2006 brooks and corey 1964 peters 2013 van genuchten 1980 a thorough understanding of soil water flow in a traditional theory driven way can be summarized into two tasks determining the governing equation which includes identifying the occurred or dominated processes and selecting the proper constitutive relationship model s and estimating the uncertain model parameters in the governing equation bandai and ghezzehei 2021 in most practical problems however essential caveats and limitations have hampered their wider adoption and impact for example preferential flow is inclined to be ignored in unsaturated flow modeling due to our poor knowledge although typically acknowledged to be an important hydrological flux at all scales beven and germann 2013 nimmo 2021 the suitability of the buckingham darcy law in unsaturated flow is still subject to many controversies narasimhan 2004 sposito 1980 on the other hand the emergence of various constitutive relationship models with different accuracies or complexities leads to a dilemma in the selection of suitable models assouline 2006 brooks and corey 1964 durner 1994 kosugi 1996 peters 2013 peters 2014 van genuchten 1980 which may be further complicated by the prevalence of hysteresis effects huang et al 2005 jaynes 1984 furthermore the determination of soil hydraulic properties in these empirical models is time consuming laborious and costly bitterlich et al 2004 the scale mismatch as well as sampling and measurement artifacts may even further impede the implementation of governing equations hopmans et al 2002 in this case the fixed form of the soil water flow governing equation may instead run the risk of weakening the model s applicability which cannot be well resolved by adjusting model parameters using experimental data with the advent of modern data collection and storage technologies data driven approaches have been providing a viable option for discovering the governing equations of physical problems remesan and mathew 2016 different from theory driven methods such methods have strong data adaptability and flexibility while having a weaker reliance on the underlying physics raissi and karniadakis 2018 and raissi et al 2019 first proposed physics informed gaussian processes or neural networks to transform the governing equations parameters into hyperparameters of such machine learning methods to learn the pdes it is worth noting however that the success of such methods is premised on the available model structure which renders the discovery process of the governing equation essentially equivalent to parameter inversion or optimization several recent works have bloomed in extracting governing equations without resorting to the specified model structure berg and nystr√∂m 2019 tartakovsky et al 2020 tipireddy et al 2019 such data driven approaches can be classified into two categories the first category uses black box functions e g neural networks to approximate the full or specific parts of governing equations as a typical representative evolutionary algorithms can obtain candidate equations by symbolic regression searson et al 2010 udrescu and tegmark 2020 or genetic algorithms nawaz et al 2015 xu et al 2020 without assuming operators and computational laws and are highly flexible the second category seeks to recover the underlying governing equations usually in the form of ordinary and partial differential equations odes and pdes the typical algorithms are sparse regression based approaches which seek the terms in the pde from a candidate library by using certain sparse approximation techniques for example chang and zhang 2019a attempted to discover subsurface flow equations from data via the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso unfortunately such methods tend to be very demanding on the completeness and diversity of the candidate library considering the potential of evolutionary algorithms in mining new operators to address missing terms atkinson et al 2019 maslyaev et al 2019 hybrid versions of the above categories of algorithms have been gradually proposed xu et al 2020 further combined deep learning neural network method and a genetic algorithm to discover pdes with an incomplete candidate called dlga pde it should be emphasized that most data driven pde discovery approaches mentioned above can only be applicable to pdes with constant coefficients however the pde of our unsaturated flow is non constant and state dependent due to the complex constitutive relationships among hydraulic conductivity water content and pressure head fortunately some substantial contributions for dealing with these non constant pdes have appeared song et al 2022 wang et al 2022 rudy et al 2019 presented a data driven method that allowed the discovery of pdes with coefficients that were time or space dependent chang and zhang 2019b proposed a two step data driven method that can simultaneously identify physical processes and infer model parameters that cannot be included in the constant coefficients of a weakly nonlinear system inspired by this one contribution of this study is the first attempt to use a two step data driven approach to derive the governing equation of unsaturated flow the innovations of this work are as follows first unlike previous studies focusing only on linear saturated flow chang and zhang 2019a chang and zhang 2019b or linearized unsaturated flow ghorbani et al 2021 a general form of the strongly nonlinear pde is identified from discrete spatiotemporal data of volumetric soil water content second instead of defaulting to a known or completely unknown equation structure this study delves into the impact of the level of prior knowledge of the target equation on the performance of data driven methods we explore which of the given relaxed or rigorous equation forms are more conducive to the accurate identification of rre third the joint identification of rre and equation coefficients is implemented by hybridizing sparse regression and iterative smoother it should be noted nevertheless that such sparse regression based methods are usually very sensitive to data quality small data noise may incur a tremendous error in the calculation of spatial and temporal derivatives with the finite difference scheme which ultimately triggers a risk of failure in identifying the governing equations although chang and zhang 2019b has proposed using the polynomial technique to smooth noisy data its effectiveness in mitigating the adverse effects of noise on the identification of the governing equations as well as coefficients are still fairly limited more importantly such smoothing is apt to cause instability of higher order derivatives under smoothing or loss of nonlinear information over smoothing in highly nonlinear soil water problems chow 2019 roberts et al 2022 recently automatic differentiation has emerged as a promising method due to its powerful ability to deal with data noise both et al 2021 chen et al 2021 xu et al 2021 for example xu et al 2019 developed a deep learning based data driven method by combining neural networks and sparse regression to address the challenges of learning the pde with noisy data and limited discrete data therefore another contribution of this paper is the introduction of automatic differentiation from neural networks into our two step data driven approach to alleviate the potential deterioration from data noise and sparse observations it is hoped that this study will expand our knowledge of the vadose zone system from the perspective of data 2 models and methods 2 1 governing equation of soil water flow in this paper the vertical one dimensional movement of soil water is considered the flow is described by the rre richards 1931 richardson 1922 whose primitive form is as follows 1 Œ∏ t z k h z 1 s where Œ∏ is the volumetric soil water content l3 l3 h is the soil water pressure head l t is the time t z is the spatial coordinate oriented positively downward l k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity l t and s is the sink term t 1 usually representing root water uptake which is neglected thereafter for the sake of simplicity in this study in eq 1 pressure head h serves as the driving force variable while soil moisture Œ∏ is the accumulation variable krabbenh√∏ft 2007 to solve eq 1 either Œ∏ or h is preferentially transformed by resorting to the soil water retention curve so that the resultant governing equation has only one unknown variable in this study we take Œ∏ as the primary variable mostly because spatiotemporal soil moisture data are usually believed to be more accessible than pressure head data robinson et al 2008 this facilitates data assurance for the proposed data driven approach here the water content based rre is given as follows 2 Œ∏ t z d Œ∏ Œ∏ z k Œ∏ z 3 d Œ∏ k Œ∏ h Œ∏ where d Œ∏ is the soil hydraulic diffusivity l2 t a more general form of the nonlinear pde can be obtained by further expanding eq 2 4 Œ∏ t d Œ∏ 2 Œ∏ z 2 d Œ∏ Œ∏ Œ∏ z 2 k Œ∏ Œ∏ Œ∏ z it should be emphasized in advance that the rre in eq 4 is regarded as the true governing equation for soil moisture flow in this study thus an appropriate constitutive relationship model should be adopted considering its relatively simple parametric form the brooks corey model is chosen to describe the constitutive relationship among Œ∏ h and k Œ∏ brooks and corey 1964 5 s e Œ∏ Œ∏ r Œ∏ s Œ∏ r Œ± h n 6 k Œ∏ k s s e 2 n 3 where Œ∏ s is the saturated volumetric water content l3 l3 Œ∏ r is the residual volumetric water content l3 l3 s e is the effective saturation and is also called the normalized volumetric water content k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t Œ± is the inverse of the air entry value 1 l and n is a pore size distribution parameter dimensionless then the soil hydraulic diffusivity d Œ∏ can be expressed as 7 d Œ∏ k Œ∏ h Œ∏ k s 1 Œ± n 1 Œ∏ s Œ∏ r s e 1 n 2 substituting eqs 5 7 into eq 4 the water content based rre can be rewritten as 8 Œ∏ t k s 2 n 3 1 Œ∏ s Œ∏ r s e 2 n 2 Œ∏ z k s 1 Œ± n 1 Œ∏ s Œ∏ r s e 1 n 2 2 Œ∏ z 2 Œ∏ t k s 1 Œ± n 1 Œ∏ s Œ∏ r 2 1 n 2 s e 1 n 1 Œ∏ z 2 2 2 two step data driven method identifying the rre in eq 8 can be generalized as learning the pde with the following form 9 u t œÜ u m a where u is the solution of the equation i e soil water content Œ∏ in this work œÜ u m is the library of candidates a is the constant coefficient and m is the model parameter that cannot be included in a for the soil water flow equation in eq 8 the candidate library can be expressed as 10 œÜ Œ∏ m s e 2 n 2 Œ∏ z s e 1 n 2 2 Œ∏ z 2 s e 1 n 1 Œ∏ z 2 11 m Œ∏ s Œ∏ r n 12 a k s 2 n 3 1 Œ∏ s Œ∏ r k s 1 Œ± n 1 Œ∏ s Œ∏ r k s 1 Œ± n 1 Œ∏ s Œ∏ r 2 1 n 2 note here that soil hydraulic parameters i e Œ∏ s Œ∏ r and n associated with the nonlinear terms cannot be included in a but rather as components of the candidate terms in eq 10 while others i e Œ± and k s are directly included this distinguishes soil water problems from other physical problems e g the steady state groundwater flow whose candidate library usually only comprises partial derivatives of some variables with respect to time or space similar non constant and state dependent pdes are prevalent in several fields such as the heat equation with variable thermal conductivity navier stokes equations for fluid dynamics the allen cahn equation in materials science and reaction diffusion equation in biology since s e is state dependent the entries of the candidate library œÜ in eq 10 are actually unknown as well thus the traditional data driven approaches that utilize least squares regression to find the coefficients of the candidate terms are no longer applicable to learning the eq 9 to address this issue chang and zhang 2019b introduced a two step data driven method in their method spatiotemporal measurement data are divided into a training dataset of size n 1 and a testing dataset of size n 2 the training dataset is first used to identify the constant coefficient a of the pde under a given m and the testing dataset is used to evaluate the identified pde and further update m using the iterative smoother for the training dataset eq 9 can be rewritten as follows 13 Œ∏ t œÜ Œ∏ m a which is 14 Œ∏ 1 t Œ∏ i t Œ∏ n 1 t s e 1 2 n 2 Œ∏ 1 z s e 1 1 n 2 2 Œ∏ 1 z 2 s e 1 1 n 1 Œ∏ 1 z 2 s e i 2 n 2 Œ∏ i z s e i 1 n 2 2 Œ∏ i z 2 s e i 1 n 1 Œ∏ i z 2 s e n 1 2 n 2 Œ∏ n 1 z s e n 1 1 n 2 2 Œ∏ n 1 z 2 s e n 1 1 n 1 Œ∏ n 1 z 2 k s 2 n 3 1 Œ∏ s Œ∏ r k s 1 Œ± n 1 Œ∏ s Œ∏ r k s 1 Œ± n 1 Œ∏ s Œ∏ r 2 1 n 2 where Œ∏ i is the i th training data of soil moisture i 1 2 n 1 and s e i Œ∏ i Œ∏ r Œ∏ s Œ∏ r is the corresponding effective saturation of Œ∏ i for a given m the corresponding coefficient a can be estimated by least squares regression as 15 a a m œÜ Œ∏ m t œÜ Œ∏ m t œÜ Œ∏ m t Œ∏ t if the initially given m is far from the true value then the performance of the estimated governing equation is also bound to be poor to quantify this learning accuracy a prediction error Œµ is introduced which is calculated using the testing dataset 16 Œµ Œµ m n 1 n 2 Œ∏ n t œÜ Œ∏ n m a m 2 to update m an objective function is then defined as 17 o m 1 2 Œµ m Œµ obs t c Œµ 1 Œµ m Œµ obs 1 2 m m pr t c m 1 m m pr where Œµ obs is the observed prediction error m pr is the initial sample of m c Œµ is the covariance of the prediction error and c m is the covariance of m it is generally recognized that the true pde will have no prediction error i e Œµ obs 0 if there is no error in calculating the partial derivatives in eq 16 for strongly nonlinear soil water flow equations however the numerical approximation in resolving the pde may incur some error more details about this issue are discussed in the following section the gauss newton method is utilized to minimize the objective function in eq 17 in this study and m is updated using the following iterative formula m l 1 m l 1 1 Œª l c m c m g l t 1 Œª l c Œµ g l c m g l t 1 g l c m c m 1 m l m pr 18 c m g l t 1 Œª l c Œµ g l c m g l t 1 Œµ m l Œµ obs where l is the iteration index Œª is the multiplier to mitigate the influence of the large data mismatch in early iterations and g l is the gradient taking value at m l which can be calculated by the following finite difference 19 g l i Œµ m l Œ¥ m l i Œµ m l Œ¥ m l i 2 Œ¥ m l i where g l i and m l i are the ith entry of g l and m l respectively and Œ¥ m l i is the perturbation of m l i here Œ¥ m l i is set to 1 of m l i notably when calculating g l i only the ith entry of m l is perturbed while other entries remain unchanged in essence eq 18 is a typical class of data assimilation method which is usually called the iterative smoother unlike sequential data assimilation methods such as the ensemble kalman filter all data are assimilated simultaneously in eq 18 2 3 a modified two step data driven method combined with neural networks in section 2 2 derivative calculations of training and testing data are required for building Œ∏ t and œÜ Œ∏ m in eq 13 and for calculating Œµ m in eq 16 respectively considering its superiority over the finite difference in handling noise automatic differentiation from the neural network is introduced into the two step data driven method to enhance its robustness in identifying the soil water governing equations from noisy data 2 3 1 automatic differentiation from the neural network in this study a feed forward fully connected neural network is utilized to approximate the soil water flow problem solution and obtain the required derivatives in eq 13 and eq 16 as depicted in fig 1 the neural network consists of one input layer one output layer and several hidden layers between them each hidden layer is composed of multiple neurons and each neuron is connected to all neurons in its adjacent layer any two adjacent layers are connected by first linear superposition and then nonlinear activation as follows 20 y d œÉ w d y d 1 b d where d 1 2 d 1 is the layer index w is the weight matrix œÉ is the activation function and b is the bias vector ultimately the relationship between input y 0 and output y d can be obtained through the connection of adjacent layers of the neural network 21 y d n n y 0 œÅ œÉ w d œÉ œÉ w 2 œÉ w 1 y 0 b 1 b 2 b d where œÅ is the collection of all learnable coefficients 22 œÅ w 1 b 1 w d b d when using neural networks to approximate the spatiotemporal distribution of soil water content in this study the input vector is y 0 z t while the output is y d Œ∏ z t to train the neural network using n training data points a loss function is then defined as follows 23 loss œÅ i 1 n Œ∏ z i t i n n z i t i œÅ 2 the adam optimizer kingma and ba 2014 is utilized to minimize the loss function in this study when the training process has been completed the trained neural network will be employed to generate meta data and calculate derivatives in eq 13 and eq 16 by applying automatic differentiation baydin et al 2018 2 3 2 the implementation of a modified two step data driven method following the framework of chang and zhang 2019b a modified two step data driven method combined with the abovementioned neural networks is employed in this paper its flowchart is illustrated in fig 2 and the narrative description is summarized as follows step 1 all available spatiotemporal data are divided into the training dataset Œ∏ Œ∏ 1 Œ∏ 2 Œ∏ n 1 and testing dataset Œ∏ Œ∏ 1 Œ∏ 2 Œ∏ n 2 then two neural networks are trained via eqs 20 23 based on these two datasets denoted as nn 1 and nn 2 respectively step 2 for m l l 0 1 l the learned nn 1 is employed to calculate Œ∏ t and œÜ Œ∏ m l in eq 13 by the automatic differentiation scheme which are subsequently normalized with zero mean and unit standard deviation then the corresponding coefficient a can be identified via eq 15 it should be emphasized that in the initial iteration m 0 is artificially specified step 3 the identified nn 2 is utilized to calculate the required derivatives Œ∏ t and œÜ Œ∏ m l of the testing data in eq 16 taking into account a m l obtained in step 2 Œµ m l in eq 16 can be yielded step 4 an update of m l at the current iterative step is implemented by combining Œµ m and Œµ obs via eqs 17 19 then the updated m l here called m l 1 is utilized to recalculate Œµ m l 1 if Œµ m l 1 Œµ m l then this update will be accepted and Œª will be reduced by a factor Œ≥ otherwise the update will be rejected and Œª will be increased by a factor Œ≥ to repeat the current iteration step 5 the accepted update of m l 1 in step 4 is again utilized to repeat steps 2 4 this process will continue until a convergence criterion is met the convergence criterion in this work is in line with that in chang and zhang 2019b which was given as follows 1 Œµ m l 1 Œµ m l œÑ Œµ m l œÑ 0 001 2 iteration exceeds the pregiven number i max 25 3 description of synthetic examples 3 1 generation of synthetic data to develop and assess the proposed modified two step data driven approach for the soil water flow governing equation synthetic soil moisture data are generated by the ross model ross 2003 which is a noniterative numerical scheme to obtain a fast solution of one dimensional rre the specific advantages of the ross method can be found in zha et al 2013 here soil moisture dynamics for 15 d in a homogeneous soil column of 200 cm is simulated the soil column is uniformly discretized at 2 cm intervals the initial soil moisture is set as 0 1 cm3 cm3 for all depths the top and bottom boundaries are set as a flux boundary and a free drainage boundary respectively the required model parameters in the ross model are set as Œ∏ s 0 43 Œ∏ r 0 05 k s 0 3 Œ± 3 6 and n 1 respectively the soil water content was measured from the 2nd day to the 15th day at 101 evenly distributed spatial locations the measurement interval is 0 01 d 3 2 scenario design of synthetic examples traditional theory driven approaches often require explicit expressions of the governing equation in contrast data driven methods are very flexible and compatible with varying degrees of prior knowledge however little attention has been paid to the question of how much a priori physical knowledge is sufficient to identify the governing equations in other words if available prior physical knowledge is extremely limited then is the two step data driven approach still capable of accurately identifying the rre therefore three scenarios with varying degrees of prior knowledge are designed in this paper scenario s1 the structure of the governing equation is known which means that the derivative terms on the right hand side of eq 8 and the constitutive relationships are available only the parameters are deduced from the data the candidate library œÜ and constant coefficients a can be represented as eq 10 and eq 12 respectively note that for all cases Œ∏ s and Œ∏ r are treated as knowns due to their easy to measure nature thus the parameters associated with the state dependent s e are expressed as m n scenario s2 it is seen in eq 8 that the derived governing equation is quite complicated even with the simplest possible constitutive relation function i e brooks corey function for soil water flow modeling a number of constitutive functions have been suggested for water retention curves and hydraulic conductivity the selection among which usually depends on the subjective preference of the modeler or the purpose for analytical derivations or numerical simulations to circumvent this uncertainty from constitutive relation functions scenario s2 further relaxes prior physical constraints on the governing equations by assuming that the constitutive relation function is also unknown thus a more general form of the soil water flow governing equation in s2 can be expressed as 24 Œ∏ t a 1 s e m 1 Œ∏ z a 2 s e m 2 2 Œ∏ z 2 a 3 s e m 3 Œ∏ z 2 the corresponding candidate library œÜ exponents m of the state dependent s e and constant coefficients a are changed to 25 œÜ s e m 1 Œ∏ z s e m 2 2 Œ∏ z 2 s e m 3 Œ∏ z 2 26 m m 1 m 2 m 3 27 a a 1 a 2 a 3 compared with s1 in which the concrete expression form of the pde is available s2 only assumes that the coefficients of any derivative term are equal to the product of a constant and the power function of s e scenario s3 in both s1 and s2 all temporal and spatial derivative terms are assumed to be known i e the products of the corresponding coefficients and Œ∏ z 2 Œ∏ z 2 and Œ∏ z 2 in practical problems nevertheless the underlying physical processes are most likely unclear which results in uncertainty about the terms to be included in the candidate library on the basis of s1 and s2 one more provocative scenario denoted as s3 is considered whose candidate library is further augmented as follows 28 œÜ s e m 1 Œ∏ z s e m 2 2 Œ∏ z 2 s e m 3 Œ∏ z 2 s e m 4 3 Œ∏ z 3 s e m 5 Œ∏ then the form of the equation to be learned and the corresponding coefficients are expressed as 29 Œ∏ t a 1 s e m 1 Œ∏ z a 2 s e m 2 2 Œ∏ z 2 a 3 s e m 3 Œ∏ z 2 a 4 s e m 4 3 Œ∏ z 3 a 5 s e m 5 Œ∏ 30 m m 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 m 5 31 a a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 a 5 3 3 parameter settings of synthetic cases the above generated observations in section 3 1 are divided into two categories in chronological order the first 60 are used as the training dataset and the remaining 40 of the data are regarded as the testing dataset to avoid falling into a local optimum when using the gradient based method to estimate m n 100 implementations with different initial samples of m are recommended thus 100 groups of identified m and a are obtained independently to investigate the capability of the modified two step data driven method to deal with data noise the neural networks are also trained in light of synthetic soil moisture data generated by the ross model in section 3 1 subsequently the derivatives i e Œ∏ t and œÜ Œ∏ m l of training data are yielded by automatic differentiation scheme the input of the neural network is the spatial and temporal coordinates i e y 0 z t and the output is the corresponding soil water content i e y d Œ∏ z t based on some preliminary tests a 5 layer neural network with 20 neurons per hidden layer is specified here to approximate the soil water content for the abovementioned scenario s1 the specified initial values of parameter n are assumed to follow a uniform distribution on 0 5 1 5 for s2 and s3 all elements in m are assumed to follow uniform distributions on 2 4 the covariance of prediction error c Œµ and the covariance of parameters c m in eq 18 should be specified beforehand to determine c Œµ the prediction errors with respect to the initial samples of m are first calculated then the standard deviation of the prediction error is set to 0 1 times the minimum value of the initial prediction errors in this study the entries of m are independent thus c m is a diagonal matrix and the standard deviation of each entry of m is set to 0 1 times its initial value 4 results and discussions 4 1 identifying the soil water flow equation with varying degrees of prior knowledge table 1 shows the mean and standard deviation of the estimated a and m by n 100 independent implementations for scenarios s1 s2 and s3 respectively for the sake of comparison the corresponding values in the true pde are also presented it should be noted that the true values of m 1 m 2 and m 3 are yielded by plugging the true n into the corresponding relational expressions i e m 1 2 n 2 m 2 1 n 2 m 3 1 n 1 while a 1 a 2 and a 3 are obtained by transforming the specified Œ∏ s Œ∏ r Œ± n and k s in the ross model via eq 12 similarly the estimated hydraulic parameters Œ± n and k s in s1 are also equivalently transformed into m a n d a through these expressions it can be observed that both m and a obtained in s1 and s2 are very close to the true values this indicates that even with less prior knowledge about the constitutive relationships the two step data driven method is still able to successfully recover the governing equation of unsaturated flow moreover the first three entries of identified m or a in s3 are also in line with those in s1 and s2 while the coefficients means of the two additional entries are close to zero i e a 4 0 0000 and a 5 0 0135 meanwhile the m of the occurred terms i e m 1 m 2 and m 3 can almost converge to their true values while the identified m of the two un occurred terms i e m 4 and m 5 are nearly not updated with fairly large standard deviations this can be more clearly demonstrated by the results of updated samples of m for s3 shown in fig 3 for most sparse regression based pde discovery methods the candidate terms that have coefficients close to zero will be discarded and a new candidate library will be built song et al 2022 that is the final candidate library for s3 will be the same as that for s2 and their identified equations will be almost identical these results demonstrated that the hybrid of sparse regression and iterative smoother can successfully identify the richardson richards equation and coefficients moreover the method performance is not dependent on prior knowledge of the constitutive relationships and pdes to further evaluate the accuracy of the identified pdes fig 4 presents the final prediction errors defined by eq 16 with the testing data under scenarios s1 s2 and s3 respectively the correct prediction error yielded by the reformulated pde with the correct parameters including Œ∏ s Œ∏ r Œ± n and k s in eq 8 is also depicted as a comparison although eqs 2 and 8 are essentially identical it is seen that this pde unexpectedly has a considerable prediction error being equal to 1 257 this is attributed to numerical approximation when solving rre during the generation of training and testing data with the ross model the solution of the rre requires a spatial discretization of the hydraulic parameters d Œ∏ and k Œ∏ during the identification of ree however the original form of rre is first converted to a more general form of the pde eqs 8 24 and 29 where hydraulic parameters d Œ∏ and k Œ∏ are transformed into terms with coefficients a and parameter m that is the spatial discretization of the hydraulic parameters is no longer required when solving the target pde hence using the testing data generated by solving eq 2 the right side and left side of eq 8 exist a difference which is named as the closure error in this study fig 5 depicts the spatiotemporal patterns of soil moisture and associated closure error it can be observed that the peak of the closure error in fig 5b is in line with the wetting front in fig 5a where both soil moisture and hydraulic parameters change most dramatically this indicates that this closure error stemming from the spatial discretization of hydraulic parameters grows larger as the nonlinearity increases fig 4 also reveals that the final prediction errors Œµ m gradually decrease from s1 to s3 all of which yet are significantly smaller than that of the correct pde it seems that progressively looser constraints on the equation form and coefficients from s1 to s3 contribute to the closure error being compensated by adjusting more coefficients or adding some candidate terms these results imply that the form of target ree may have a great impact on the reasonable identification of ree furthermore it has to be admitted that the current candidate library is small even in scenario s3 this means that this work still provides too much prior knowledge about the equation form compared to the symbolic regression algorithms that do not require specifying the model structure udrescu and tegmark 2020 searson et al 2010 therefore it is necessary to further enlarge the candidate library in future studies to test the ability of the proposed method without resorting to the specified model structure as much as possible 4 2 identifying the soil water flow equation with the original form considering that the closure errors from the numerical approximation have unnecessarily complicated pde identifications in section 4 1 another test case is considered specifically instead of identifying the more general form of the rre i e eq 4 its original form i e eq 2 as well as the corresponding parameters are identified substituting constitutive functions eq 5 6 into eq 2 the following form can be obtained 32 Œ∏ t k s 1 Œ± n 1 Œ∏ s Œ∏ r z s e 1 n 2 Œ∏ z k s s e 2 n 3 z then the new candidate library and the coefficient can be expressed as follows 33 œÜ s e 2 n 3 z z s e 1 n 2 Œ∏ z 34 a k s k s 1 Œ± n 1 Œ∏ s Œ∏ r similarly three scenarios with varying degrees of prior knowledge are again designed here named s1a s2a and s3a in s1a and s2a the candidate library contains only two occurrence terms and in s3a two other terms are added 35 œÜ s e m 1 z z s e m 2 Œ∏ z s e m 3 3 Œ∏ z 3 s e m 4 Œ∏ table 2 lists the identified equations for s1a s2a and s3a notably the two augmented interference terms in s3a have been removed directly because their identified coefficients are very close to zero it can be seen that for the new candidate library the rre can still be identified with considerable accuracy in all scenarios by using the proposed two step data driven method this should undoubtedly be attributed to the correct construction of the candidate library which is often unknown in advance in practical problems for most existing sparse regression methods the candidate library usually contains the states of a system and their spatial derivatives terms of such a specific form as se 2 n 3 z or z se 1 n 2 Œ∏ z are rarely included in the candidate library therefore even though the original form of the rre can be well identified this study still prefers the identification of the more general form of the pde due to its universality 4 3 the influence of spatiotemporal sampling strategies in all the aforementioned test cases all the spatiotemporal data generated from the numerical model in section 3 1 are used to identify the equation as well as the corresponding coefficients which is called the full sampling strategy here however such intensive spatiotemporal data are almost not available in practical applications although current soil moisture sensors are capable of sampling at intervals of a few minutes their spatial sampling resolution is still far from the 2 cm set in the above numerical models therefore it is necessary to explore the effects of the spatiotemporal resolution of sampling on the identification of the soil water flow governing equation here three sampling strategies are considered in sampling strategy ss1 the spatial resolution of the observed soil moisture decreases from 2 cm to 10 cm while its temporal sampling interval remains 0 01 d in strategy ss2 the temporal sampling interval changes from 0 01 d to 0 1 d while the spatial resolution remains 2 cm and in strategy ss3 both the temporal frequency and spatial resolution are reduced being equal to 0 1 d and 10 cm respectively for each sampling strategy all three scenarios s1 s2 and s3 are executed table 3 presents a comparison between the correct and identified equations with three sampling strategies ss1 ss2 and ss3 for s1 s2 and s3 respectively on the whole the results lead to three findings 1 in combination with the results in table 2 the reduction in the spatiotemporal sampling frequency significantly deteriorates the accuracy of the identified equation as we expected 2 compared to the second order spatial derivatives the first order spatial derivatives are less sensitive to the sampling strategy for example in s1 the coefficients of the first order spatial derivatives corresponding to the three sampling strategies are always close to the true value of 0 3 while the second order spatial derivatives coefficients are equal to 0 196 0 11 and 0 15 for ss1 ss2 and ss3 respectively far less than the true value of 0 219 3 for s3 where some extra terms are included in the candidate library the reduction in data density or resolution may result in the appearance of some originally nonexistent terms in the identified equation for example the coefficient of the zero order derivative of the water content s e m 4 Œ∏ reaches approximately 0 07 in ss3 which obviously cannot be neglected this indicates that when using the data driven method to identify the governing equation of soil water flow different datasets obtained by different measurement instruments may support systems of varying degrees of complexity that is if the spatiotemporal density of soil moisture data is not intensive enough then the higher order derivatives may not be identified and the derived pde can be presented in a simpler form however it should be acknowledged that identifying the pdes in a data driven manner is rather susceptible to the data density in comparison to theory driven approaches the high spatial and temporal resolution requirements of the proposed method for discrete data may hinder its further application in modeling soil moisture movement under real world circumstances 4 4 identifying the soil water flow equation in the presence of data noise considering the advantage of the automatic differentiation technique in dealing with noise this study attempts to introduce it into our two step data driven method the robustness of this modified two step method in the presence of data noise is tested in this section for comparison as a typical data smoothing method savitzky golay filtering also known as least squares smoothing filtering press and teukolsky 1990 is also considered to preprocess noisy data due to its suitability for nonlinear problems the moving window width is set to 11 the window is symmetric with 5 data points on each side and the desired order is 3 after denoised by smoothing the derivatives of spatiotemporal data are calculated by the finite difference in these cases we add random noise with a level of 5 to the generated data i e Œ∏ z t Œ∏ z t 1 0 05 e here e denotes the uniform random variable taking values from 1 to 1 then neural networks are trained in the light of these noisy spatiotemporal data of soil moisture and subsequently the required derivatives are yielded by automatic differentiation fig 6 compares scatterplots between the true derivatives including Œ∏ t Œ∏ z and 2 Œ∏ z 2 and the corresponding values calculated in three ways to address noise i e not processing the noisy data np smoothing the noisy data sm and automatic differentiation from the neural network nn respectively a comparison of fig 6 a c reveals that data noise has a significant detrimental effect on the calculation of derivatives especially for higher order derivatives the implementation of data smoothing procedures fig 6 d f is indeed effective in improving r 2 to some extent but may entail a loss of information leading to a flat second derivative fig 6f in other words 2 Œ∏ z 2 is seriously underestimated fortunately the derivatives calculated by nn are relatively insensitive to errors resulting in a fairly high correlation with the true derivatives as depicted in fig 6 g i fig 7 further compares the actual spatiotemporal derivatives of soil moisture with the corresponding values calculated by the sm and nn respectively only the results on the 3rd day are presented here it can be seen that the derivatives calculated by the nn are in good agreement with the true ones while the method of smoothing out the noisy data i e sm fails to obtain accurate derivatives this inferiority of the sm is particularly evident for second order spatial derivatives fig 7c for instance the values of 2 Œ∏ z 2 are very fluctuant at the position that is supposed to be steady from node 1 to node 50 called the stabilization phase here but are less volatile at the wetting front where derivatives deserve to change dramatically from node 50 to node 70 called the mutation phase this superiority of nn may be due to its use of the chain rule to compute the derivatives directly from the neural network s weights and biases xu et al 2020 unlike the finite difference in sm where two adjacent points are taken to calculate derivations this means that nn is able to deal with data noise more effectively by taking into account the entire network s computation process as depicted in fig 1 rather than just two points in the dataset thus the risk of tremendous errors triggered by small data noise in the calculation of derivatives can be greatly reduced once the derivatives have been calculated the two step data driven method can be conducted to identify the governing equations table 4 lists a comparison of the correct and identified rres with two noise treatments i e sm and nn respectively only the results in s1 are presented here as we expected due to the loss of information on higher order derivatives fig 6f the utilization of sm results in 2 Œ∏ z 2 in the pde of unsaturated flow not being correctly identified and the corresponding coefficient a 2 0 008 is very close to 0 this eventually also leads to the values of m and a of the other derivative terms being far from the true values in contrast the identified equation based on the nn is more accurate due to its insensitivity to noise however it has to be admitted that there is still a gap between this equation and the true one especially for the 2 Œ∏ z 2 term further investigation demonstrates that when the noise level increases to 10 the performance of nn in identifying the pde of unsaturated flow further deteriorates significantly although still better than sm not presented here for the sake of brevity this is because the training of discrete data using nn is essentially to construct a mapping between the input temporal and spatial coordinates and the output soil water content the continuous increase in the noise level of the training data may induce accidental correlations in nn models garc√≠a et al 2016 thereby resulting in a deviation of the calculated derivatives from their true counterparts fig 8 depicts scatterplots between the true derivatives including Œ∏ t Œ∏ z and 2 Œ∏ z 2 and the corresponding values calculated by nn under 10 data noise a comparison of fig 8 and fig 6 g i reveals that as the noise level increases the values of the determination coefficient r2 between all three derivatives and their corresponding true values decrease significantly in particular the r2 value of 2 Œ∏ z 2 plummets from 0 8978 to 0 4877 eventually the identification accuracy of the governing equation deteriorates due to the complete dependence of the proposed method on the data thus although automatic differentiation within neural network architecture has provided a better solution than finite difference schemes after data smoothing how to proceed to mitigate the adverse effects of noise on the governing equation identification is still worthy of further investigation in future studies 5 conclusions in this work a modified version of the two step data driven method chang and zhang 2019b is proposed for the identification of the strongly nonlinear soil water flow equation from the perspective of data driven modeling the ability and challenge of this modified method to jointly identify the state dependent pdes and coefficients are tested in this study a series of illustrative cases are employed to explore the influence of prior knowledge of the target equation data density and data noise on the identification of the rre 1 the proposed data driven method allows effective identification of the governing equation of unsaturated flow with little dependence on the equation form and constitutive relationships if the underlying physical processes are uncertain then a more relaxed equation form is recommended due to its low requirement for prior knowledge and potential to remedy closure errors 2 the reduction in the spatiotemporal resolution of sampling may cause higher order terms to be difficult to derive accurately or some terms that are not originally present to appear in the learned equation this ultimately leads to the form of the rre being identified incorrectly implying that different observation techniques may support systems with different complexities 3 the derivatives calculated from the finite difference scheme are too sensitive to data noise while the introduction of automatic differentiation techniques can indeed facilitate the two step data driven method to successfully mitigate the adverse effects of data noise on the identification of the rre this current work is still in the early stages in the future it is hoped to investigate whether two or three dimensional soil water flow governing equations can be identified by the proposed data driven approaches under more complex conditions such as root water uptake complex boundaries and soil heterogeneity in addition how to further mitigate the adverse effects of data noise on the discovery of the rre should be investigated for nonlinear unsaturated flow

1820,governing equations of soil water flow are traditionally derived from the conservation of mass and the buckingham darcy law however due to uncertainties in many aspects such as physical processes and constitutive relationships a thorough understanding of soil water flow in a theory driven way often poses many challenges with the fast improvement of data acquisition ability data driven approaches have gained considerable scientific interest in discovering the governing equations of physical problems however most existing studies focused on linear or weakly nonlinear problems with constant coefficients in their partial differential equations this study attempted to propose a modified two step data driven method to identify the strongly nonlinear equation of unsaturated flow the richardson richards equation and coefficients were jointly identified by hybridizing sparse regression and iterative smoother the automatic differentiation scheme was introduced to reduce the risk of performance collapse from data noise common in sparse regression methods we demonstrated the ability and the challenge as well of identifying the soil water flow governing equations in a data driven way with the aid of a series of synthetic cases our results showed that the modified method was capable of accurately identifying the governing equation of unsaturated flow whose performance was almost independent of prior knowledge of the equation form and constitutive relationships if the underlying physical processes are poorly understood then a more relaxed equation form was recommended the reduction in the spatiotemporal resolution of sampling may cause higher order terms to be difficult to derive accurately or some terms that were not originally present to appear in the identified equation although not completely eliminated the detrimental effect of data noise on the identification of the governing equations can be greatly mitigated by introducing the automatic differentiation scheme keywords soil water flow equation identification nonlinearity data noise data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurately describing soil water flow in the vadose zone is of vital importance in many aspects of hydrology including evaporation groundwater recharge soil moisture storage and soil erosion feddes and raats 2004 lazarovitch et al 2018 penman 1948 smerdon 2017 mathematically the dynamics of soil water flow are described by a nonlinear partial differential equation pde commonly referred to as the richardson richards equation rre richards 1931 richardson 1922 the ree is theoretically derived from the conservation of mass and the buckingham darcy law buckingham 1907 in addition to these first principle derivations constitutive relationships between conductivity water content and hydraulic head are also required whose functions are usually expressed in a nonlinear form with a shared set of parameters assouline 2006 brooks and corey 1964 peters 2013 van genuchten 1980 a thorough understanding of soil water flow in a traditional theory driven way can be summarized into two tasks determining the governing equation which includes identifying the occurred or dominated processes and selecting the proper constitutive relationship model s and estimating the uncertain model parameters in the governing equation bandai and ghezzehei 2021 in most practical problems however essential caveats and limitations have hampered their wider adoption and impact for example preferential flow is inclined to be ignored in unsaturated flow modeling due to our poor knowledge although typically acknowledged to be an important hydrological flux at all scales beven and germann 2013 nimmo 2021 the suitability of the buckingham darcy law in unsaturated flow is still subject to many controversies narasimhan 2004 sposito 1980 on the other hand the emergence of various constitutive relationship models with different accuracies or complexities leads to a dilemma in the selection of suitable models assouline 2006 brooks and corey 1964 durner 1994 kosugi 1996 peters 2013 peters 2014 van genuchten 1980 which may be further complicated by the prevalence of hysteresis effects huang et al 2005 jaynes 1984 furthermore the determination of soil hydraulic properties in these empirical models is time consuming laborious and costly bitterlich et al 2004 the scale mismatch as well as sampling and measurement artifacts may even further impede the implementation of governing equations hopmans et al 2002 in this case the fixed form of the soil water flow governing equation may instead run the risk of weakening the model s applicability which cannot be well resolved by adjusting model parameters using experimental data with the advent of modern data collection and storage technologies data driven approaches have been providing a viable option for discovering the governing equations of physical problems remesan and mathew 2016 different from theory driven methods such methods have strong data adaptability and flexibility while having a weaker reliance on the underlying physics raissi and karniadakis 2018 and raissi et al 2019 first proposed physics informed gaussian processes or neural networks to transform the governing equations parameters into hyperparameters of such machine learning methods to learn the pdes it is worth noting however that the success of such methods is premised on the available model structure which renders the discovery process of the governing equation essentially equivalent to parameter inversion or optimization several recent works have bloomed in extracting governing equations without resorting to the specified model structure berg and nystr√∂m 2019 tartakovsky et al 2020 tipireddy et al 2019 such data driven approaches can be classified into two categories the first category uses black box functions e g neural networks to approximate the full or specific parts of governing equations as a typical representative evolutionary algorithms can obtain candidate equations by symbolic regression searson et al 2010 udrescu and tegmark 2020 or genetic algorithms nawaz et al 2015 xu et al 2020 without assuming operators and computational laws and are highly flexible the second category seeks to recover the underlying governing equations usually in the form of ordinary and partial differential equations odes and pdes the typical algorithms are sparse regression based approaches which seek the terms in the pde from a candidate library by using certain sparse approximation techniques for example chang and zhang 2019a attempted to discover subsurface flow equations from data via the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso unfortunately such methods tend to be very demanding on the completeness and diversity of the candidate library considering the potential of evolutionary algorithms in mining new operators to address missing terms atkinson et al 2019 maslyaev et al 2019 hybrid versions of the above categories of algorithms have been gradually proposed xu et al 2020 further combined deep learning neural network method and a genetic algorithm to discover pdes with an incomplete candidate called dlga pde it should be emphasized that most data driven pde discovery approaches mentioned above can only be applicable to pdes with constant coefficients however the pde of our unsaturated flow is non constant and state dependent due to the complex constitutive relationships among hydraulic conductivity water content and pressure head fortunately some substantial contributions for dealing with these non constant pdes have appeared song et al 2022 wang et al 2022 rudy et al 2019 presented a data driven method that allowed the discovery of pdes with coefficients that were time or space dependent chang and zhang 2019b proposed a two step data driven method that can simultaneously identify physical processes and infer model parameters that cannot be included in the constant coefficients of a weakly nonlinear system inspired by this one contribution of this study is the first attempt to use a two step data driven approach to derive the governing equation of unsaturated flow the innovations of this work are as follows first unlike previous studies focusing only on linear saturated flow chang and zhang 2019a chang and zhang 2019b or linearized unsaturated flow ghorbani et al 2021 a general form of the strongly nonlinear pde is identified from discrete spatiotemporal data of volumetric soil water content second instead of defaulting to a known or completely unknown equation structure this study delves into the impact of the level of prior knowledge of the target equation on the performance of data driven methods we explore which of the given relaxed or rigorous equation forms are more conducive to the accurate identification of rre third the joint identification of rre and equation coefficients is implemented by hybridizing sparse regression and iterative smoother it should be noted nevertheless that such sparse regression based methods are usually very sensitive to data quality small data noise may incur a tremendous error in the calculation of spatial and temporal derivatives with the finite difference scheme which ultimately triggers a risk of failure in identifying the governing equations although chang and zhang 2019b has proposed using the polynomial technique to smooth noisy data its effectiveness in mitigating the adverse effects of noise on the identification of the governing equations as well as coefficients are still fairly limited more importantly such smoothing is apt to cause instability of higher order derivatives under smoothing or loss of nonlinear information over smoothing in highly nonlinear soil water problems chow 2019 roberts et al 2022 recently automatic differentiation has emerged as a promising method due to its powerful ability to deal with data noise both et al 2021 chen et al 2021 xu et al 2021 for example xu et al 2019 developed a deep learning based data driven method by combining neural networks and sparse regression to address the challenges of learning the pde with noisy data and limited discrete data therefore another contribution of this paper is the introduction of automatic differentiation from neural networks into our two step data driven approach to alleviate the potential deterioration from data noise and sparse observations it is hoped that this study will expand our knowledge of the vadose zone system from the perspective of data 2 models and methods 2 1 governing equation of soil water flow in this paper the vertical one dimensional movement of soil water is considered the flow is described by the rre richards 1931 richardson 1922 whose primitive form is as follows 1 Œ∏ t z k h z 1 s where Œ∏ is the volumetric soil water content l3 l3 h is the soil water pressure head l t is the time t z is the spatial coordinate oriented positively downward l k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity l t and s is the sink term t 1 usually representing root water uptake which is neglected thereafter for the sake of simplicity in this study in eq 1 pressure head h serves as the driving force variable while soil moisture Œ∏ is the accumulation variable krabbenh√∏ft 2007 to solve eq 1 either Œ∏ or h is preferentially transformed by resorting to the soil water retention curve so that the resultant governing equation has only one unknown variable in this study we take Œ∏ as the primary variable mostly because spatiotemporal soil moisture data are usually believed to be more accessible than pressure head data robinson et al 2008 this facilitates data assurance for the proposed data driven approach here the water content based rre is given as follows 2 Œ∏ t z d Œ∏ Œ∏ z k Œ∏ z 3 d Œ∏ k Œ∏ h Œ∏ where d Œ∏ is the soil hydraulic diffusivity l2 t a more general form of the nonlinear pde can be obtained by further expanding eq 2 4 Œ∏ t d Œ∏ 2 Œ∏ z 2 d Œ∏ Œ∏ Œ∏ z 2 k Œ∏ Œ∏ Œ∏ z it should be emphasized in advance that the rre in eq 4 is regarded as the true governing equation for soil moisture flow in this study thus an appropriate constitutive relationship model should be adopted considering its relatively simple parametric form the brooks corey model is chosen to describe the constitutive relationship among Œ∏ h and k Œ∏ brooks and corey 1964 5 s e Œ∏ Œ∏ r Œ∏ s Œ∏ r Œ± h n 6 k Œ∏ k s s e 2 n 3 where Œ∏ s is the saturated volumetric water content l3 l3 Œ∏ r is the residual volumetric water content l3 l3 s e is the effective saturation and is also called the normalized volumetric water content k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t Œ± is the inverse of the air entry value 1 l and n is a pore size distribution parameter dimensionless then the soil hydraulic diffusivity d Œ∏ can be expressed as 7 d Œ∏ k Œ∏ h Œ∏ k s 1 Œ± n 1 Œ∏ s Œ∏ r s e 1 n 2 substituting eqs 5 7 into eq 4 the water content based rre can be rewritten as 8 Œ∏ t k s 2 n 3 1 Œ∏ s Œ∏ r s e 2 n 2 Œ∏ z k s 1 Œ± n 1 Œ∏ s Œ∏ r s e 1 n 2 2 Œ∏ z 2 Œ∏ t k s 1 Œ± n 1 Œ∏ s Œ∏ r 2 1 n 2 s e 1 n 1 Œ∏ z 2 2 2 two step data driven method identifying the rre in eq 8 can be generalized as learning the pde with the following form 9 u t œÜ u m a where u is the solution of the equation i e soil water content Œ∏ in this work œÜ u m is the library of candidates a is the constant coefficient and m is the model parameter that cannot be included in a for the soil water flow equation in eq 8 the candidate library can be expressed as 10 œÜ Œ∏ m s e 2 n 2 Œ∏ z s e 1 n 2 2 Œ∏ z 2 s e 1 n 1 Œ∏ z 2 11 m Œ∏ s Œ∏ r n 12 a k s 2 n 3 1 Œ∏ s Œ∏ r k s 1 Œ± n 1 Œ∏ s Œ∏ r k s 1 Œ± n 1 Œ∏ s Œ∏ r 2 1 n 2 note here that soil hydraulic parameters i e Œ∏ s Œ∏ r and n associated with the nonlinear terms cannot be included in a but rather as components of the candidate terms in eq 10 while others i e Œ± and k s are directly included this distinguishes soil water problems from other physical problems e g the steady state groundwater flow whose candidate library usually only comprises partial derivatives of some variables with respect to time or space similar non constant and state dependent pdes are prevalent in several fields such as the heat equation with variable thermal conductivity navier stokes equations for fluid dynamics the allen cahn equation in materials science and reaction diffusion equation in biology since s e is state dependent the entries of the candidate library œÜ in eq 10 are actually unknown as well thus the traditional data driven approaches that utilize least squares regression to find the coefficients of the candidate terms are no longer applicable to learning the eq 9 to address this issue chang and zhang 2019b introduced a two step data driven method in their method spatiotemporal measurement data are divided into a training dataset of size n 1 and a testing dataset of size n 2 the training dataset is first used to identify the constant coefficient a of the pde under a given m and the testing dataset is used to evaluate the identified pde and further update m using the iterative smoother for the training dataset eq 9 can be rewritten as follows 13 Œ∏ t œÜ Œ∏ m a which is 14 Œ∏ 1 t Œ∏ i t Œ∏ n 1 t s e 1 2 n 2 Œ∏ 1 z s e 1 1 n 2 2 Œ∏ 1 z 2 s e 1 1 n 1 Œ∏ 1 z 2 s e i 2 n 2 Œ∏ i z s e i 1 n 2 2 Œ∏ i z 2 s e i 1 n 1 Œ∏ i z 2 s e n 1 2 n 2 Œ∏ n 1 z s e n 1 1 n 2 2 Œ∏ n 1 z 2 s e n 1 1 n 1 Œ∏ n 1 z 2 k s 2 n 3 1 Œ∏ s Œ∏ r k s 1 Œ± n 1 Œ∏ s Œ∏ r k s 1 Œ± n 1 Œ∏ s Œ∏ r 2 1 n 2 where Œ∏ i is the i th training data of soil moisture i 1 2 n 1 and s e i Œ∏ i Œ∏ r Œ∏ s Œ∏ r is the corresponding effective saturation of Œ∏ i for a given m the corresponding coefficient a can be estimated by least squares regression as 15 a a m œÜ Œ∏ m t œÜ Œ∏ m t œÜ Œ∏ m t Œ∏ t if the initially given m is far from the true value then the performance of the estimated governing equation is also bound to be poor to quantify this learning accuracy a prediction error Œµ is introduced which is calculated using the testing dataset 16 Œµ Œµ m n 1 n 2 Œ∏ n t œÜ Œ∏ n m a m 2 to update m an objective function is then defined as 17 o m 1 2 Œµ m Œµ obs t c Œµ 1 Œµ m Œµ obs 1 2 m m pr t c m 1 m m pr where Œµ obs is the observed prediction error m pr is the initial sample of m c Œµ is the covariance of the prediction error and c m is the covariance of m it is generally recognized that the true pde will have no prediction error i e Œµ obs 0 if there is no error in calculating the partial derivatives in eq 16 for strongly nonlinear soil water flow equations however the numerical approximation in resolving the pde may incur some error more details about this issue are discussed in the following section the gauss newton method is utilized to minimize the objective function in eq 17 in this study and m is updated using the following iterative formula m l 1 m l 1 1 Œª l c m c m g l t 1 Œª l c Œµ g l c m g l t 1 g l c m c m 1 m l m pr 18 c m g l t 1 Œª l c Œµ g l c m g l t 1 Œµ m l Œµ obs where l is the iteration index Œª is the multiplier to mitigate the influence of the large data mismatch in early iterations and g l is the gradient taking value at m l which can be calculated by the following finite difference 19 g l i Œµ m l Œ¥ m l i Œµ m l Œ¥ m l i 2 Œ¥ m l i where g l i and m l i are the ith entry of g l and m l respectively and Œ¥ m l i is the perturbation of m l i here Œ¥ m l i is set to 1 of m l i notably when calculating g l i only the ith entry of m l is perturbed while other entries remain unchanged in essence eq 18 is a typical class of data assimilation method which is usually called the iterative smoother unlike sequential data assimilation methods such as the ensemble kalman filter all data are assimilated simultaneously in eq 18 2 3 a modified two step data driven method combined with neural networks in section 2 2 derivative calculations of training and testing data are required for building Œ∏ t and œÜ Œ∏ m in eq 13 and for calculating Œµ m in eq 16 respectively considering its superiority over the finite difference in handling noise automatic differentiation from the neural network is introduced into the two step data driven method to enhance its robustness in identifying the soil water governing equations from noisy data 2 3 1 automatic differentiation from the neural network in this study a feed forward fully connected neural network is utilized to approximate the soil water flow problem solution and obtain the required derivatives in eq 13 and eq 16 as depicted in fig 1 the neural network consists of one input layer one output layer and several hidden layers between them each hidden layer is composed of multiple neurons and each neuron is connected to all neurons in its adjacent layer any two adjacent layers are connected by first linear superposition and then nonlinear activation as follows 20 y d œÉ w d y d 1 b d where d 1 2 d 1 is the layer index w is the weight matrix œÉ is the activation function and b is the bias vector ultimately the relationship between input y 0 and output y d can be obtained through the connection of adjacent layers of the neural network 21 y d n n y 0 œÅ œÉ w d œÉ œÉ w 2 œÉ w 1 y 0 b 1 b 2 b d where œÅ is the collection of all learnable coefficients 22 œÅ w 1 b 1 w d b d when using neural networks to approximate the spatiotemporal distribution of soil water content in this study the input vector is y 0 z t while the output is y d Œ∏ z t to train the neural network using n training data points a loss function is then defined as follows 23 loss œÅ i 1 n Œ∏ z i t i n n z i t i œÅ 2 the adam optimizer kingma and ba 2014 is utilized to minimize the loss function in this study when the training process has been completed the trained neural network will be employed to generate meta data and calculate derivatives in eq 13 and eq 16 by applying automatic differentiation baydin et al 2018 2 3 2 the implementation of a modified two step data driven method following the framework of chang and zhang 2019b a modified two step data driven method combined with the abovementioned neural networks is employed in this paper its flowchart is illustrated in fig 2 and the narrative description is summarized as follows step 1 all available spatiotemporal data are divided into the training dataset Œ∏ Œ∏ 1 Œ∏ 2 Œ∏ n 1 and testing dataset Œ∏ Œ∏ 1 Œ∏ 2 Œ∏ n 2 then two neural networks are trained via eqs 20 23 based on these two datasets denoted as nn 1 and nn 2 respectively step 2 for m l l 0 1 l the learned nn 1 is employed to calculate Œ∏ t and œÜ Œ∏ m l in eq 13 by the automatic differentiation scheme which are subsequently normalized with zero mean and unit standard deviation then the corresponding coefficient a can be identified via eq 15 it should be emphasized that in the initial iteration m 0 is artificially specified step 3 the identified nn 2 is utilized to calculate the required derivatives Œ∏ t and œÜ Œ∏ m l of the testing data in eq 16 taking into account a m l obtained in step 2 Œµ m l in eq 16 can be yielded step 4 an update of m l at the current iterative step is implemented by combining Œµ m and Œµ obs via eqs 17 19 then the updated m l here called m l 1 is utilized to recalculate Œµ m l 1 if Œµ m l 1 Œµ m l then this update will be accepted and Œª will be reduced by a factor Œ≥ otherwise the update will be rejected and Œª will be increased by a factor Œ≥ to repeat the current iteration step 5 the accepted update of m l 1 in step 4 is again utilized to repeat steps 2 4 this process will continue until a convergence criterion is met the convergence criterion in this work is in line with that in chang and zhang 2019b which was given as follows 1 Œµ m l 1 Œµ m l œÑ Œµ m l œÑ 0 001 2 iteration exceeds the pregiven number i max 25 3 description of synthetic examples 3 1 generation of synthetic data to develop and assess the proposed modified two step data driven approach for the soil water flow governing equation synthetic soil moisture data are generated by the ross model ross 2003 which is a noniterative numerical scheme to obtain a fast solution of one dimensional rre the specific advantages of the ross method can be found in zha et al 2013 here soil moisture dynamics for 15 d in a homogeneous soil column of 200 cm is simulated the soil column is uniformly discretized at 2 cm intervals the initial soil moisture is set as 0 1 cm3 cm3 for all depths the top and bottom boundaries are set as a flux boundary and a free drainage boundary respectively the required model parameters in the ross model are set as Œ∏ s 0 43 Œ∏ r 0 05 k s 0 3 Œ± 3 6 and n 1 respectively the soil water content was measured from the 2nd day to the 15th day at 101 evenly distributed spatial locations the measurement interval is 0 01 d 3 2 scenario design of synthetic examples traditional theory driven approaches often require explicit expressions of the governing equation in contrast data driven methods are very flexible and compatible with varying degrees of prior knowledge however little attention has been paid to the question of how much a priori physical knowledge is sufficient to identify the governing equations in other words if available prior physical knowledge is extremely limited then is the two step data driven approach still capable of accurately identifying the rre therefore three scenarios with varying degrees of prior knowledge are designed in this paper scenario s1 the structure of the governing equation is known which means that the derivative terms on the right hand side of eq 8 and the constitutive relationships are available only the parameters are deduced from the data the candidate library œÜ and constant coefficients a can be represented as eq 10 and eq 12 respectively note that for all cases Œ∏ s and Œ∏ r are treated as knowns due to their easy to measure nature thus the parameters associated with the state dependent s e are expressed as m n scenario s2 it is seen in eq 8 that the derived governing equation is quite complicated even with the simplest possible constitutive relation function i e brooks corey function for soil water flow modeling a number of constitutive functions have been suggested for water retention curves and hydraulic conductivity the selection among which usually depends on the subjective preference of the modeler or the purpose for analytical derivations or numerical simulations to circumvent this uncertainty from constitutive relation functions scenario s2 further relaxes prior physical constraints on the governing equations by assuming that the constitutive relation function is also unknown thus a more general form of the soil water flow governing equation in s2 can be expressed as 24 Œ∏ t a 1 s e m 1 Œ∏ z a 2 s e m 2 2 Œ∏ z 2 a 3 s e m 3 Œ∏ z 2 the corresponding candidate library œÜ exponents m of the state dependent s e and constant coefficients a are changed to 25 œÜ s e m 1 Œ∏ z s e m 2 2 Œ∏ z 2 s e m 3 Œ∏ z 2 26 m m 1 m 2 m 3 27 a a 1 a 2 a 3 compared with s1 in which the concrete expression form of the pde is available s2 only assumes that the coefficients of any derivative term are equal to the product of a constant and the power function of s e scenario s3 in both s1 and s2 all temporal and spatial derivative terms are assumed to be known i e the products of the corresponding coefficients and Œ∏ z 2 Œ∏ z 2 and Œ∏ z 2 in practical problems nevertheless the underlying physical processes are most likely unclear which results in uncertainty about the terms to be included in the candidate library on the basis of s1 and s2 one more provocative scenario denoted as s3 is considered whose candidate library is further augmented as follows 28 œÜ s e m 1 Œ∏ z s e m 2 2 Œ∏ z 2 s e m 3 Œ∏ z 2 s e m 4 3 Œ∏ z 3 s e m 5 Œ∏ then the form of the equation to be learned and the corresponding coefficients are expressed as 29 Œ∏ t a 1 s e m 1 Œ∏ z a 2 s e m 2 2 Œ∏ z 2 a 3 s e m 3 Œ∏ z 2 a 4 s e m 4 3 Œ∏ z 3 a 5 s e m 5 Œ∏ 30 m m 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 m 5 31 a a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 a 5 3 3 parameter settings of synthetic cases the above generated observations in section 3 1 are divided into two categories in chronological order the first 60 are used as the training dataset and the remaining 40 of the data are regarded as the testing dataset to avoid falling into a local optimum when using the gradient based method to estimate m n 100 implementations with different initial samples of m are recommended thus 100 groups of identified m and a are obtained independently to investigate the capability of the modified two step data driven method to deal with data noise the neural networks are also trained in light of synthetic soil moisture data generated by the ross model in section 3 1 subsequently the derivatives i e Œ∏ t and œÜ Œ∏ m l of training data are yielded by automatic differentiation scheme the input of the neural network is the spatial and temporal coordinates i e y 0 z t and the output is the corresponding soil water content i e y d Œ∏ z t based on some preliminary tests a 5 layer neural network with 20 neurons per hidden layer is specified here to approximate the soil water content for the abovementioned scenario s1 the specified initial values of parameter n are assumed to follow a uniform distribution on 0 5 1 5 for s2 and s3 all elements in m are assumed to follow uniform distributions on 2 4 the covariance of prediction error c Œµ and the covariance of parameters c m in eq 18 should be specified beforehand to determine c Œµ the prediction errors with respect to the initial samples of m are first calculated then the standard deviation of the prediction error is set to 0 1 times the minimum value of the initial prediction errors in this study the entries of m are independent thus c m is a diagonal matrix and the standard deviation of each entry of m is set to 0 1 times its initial value 4 results and discussions 4 1 identifying the soil water flow equation with varying degrees of prior knowledge table 1 shows the mean and standard deviation of the estimated a and m by n 100 independent implementations for scenarios s1 s2 and s3 respectively for the sake of comparison the corresponding values in the true pde are also presented it should be noted that the true values of m 1 m 2 and m 3 are yielded by plugging the true n into the corresponding relational expressions i e m 1 2 n 2 m 2 1 n 2 m 3 1 n 1 while a 1 a 2 and a 3 are obtained by transforming the specified Œ∏ s Œ∏ r Œ± n and k s in the ross model via eq 12 similarly the estimated hydraulic parameters Œ± n and k s in s1 are also equivalently transformed into m a n d a through these expressions it can be observed that both m and a obtained in s1 and s2 are very close to the true values this indicates that even with less prior knowledge about the constitutive relationships the two step data driven method is still able to successfully recover the governing equation of unsaturated flow moreover the first three entries of identified m or a in s3 are also in line with those in s1 and s2 while the coefficients means of the two additional entries are close to zero i e a 4 0 0000 and a 5 0 0135 meanwhile the m of the occurred terms i e m 1 m 2 and m 3 can almost converge to their true values while the identified m of the two un occurred terms i e m 4 and m 5 are nearly not updated with fairly large standard deviations this can be more clearly demonstrated by the results of updated samples of m for s3 shown in fig 3 for most sparse regression based pde discovery methods the candidate terms that have coefficients close to zero will be discarded and a new candidate library will be built song et al 2022 that is the final candidate library for s3 will be the same as that for s2 and their identified equations will be almost identical these results demonstrated that the hybrid of sparse regression and iterative smoother can successfully identify the richardson richards equation and coefficients moreover the method performance is not dependent on prior knowledge of the constitutive relationships and pdes to further evaluate the accuracy of the identified pdes fig 4 presents the final prediction errors defined by eq 16 with the testing data under scenarios s1 s2 and s3 respectively the correct prediction error yielded by the reformulated pde with the correct parameters including Œ∏ s Œ∏ r Œ± n and k s in eq 8 is also depicted as a comparison although eqs 2 and 8 are essentially identical it is seen that this pde unexpectedly has a considerable prediction error being equal to 1 257 this is attributed to numerical approximation when solving rre during the generation of training and testing data with the ross model the solution of the rre requires a spatial discretization of the hydraulic parameters d Œ∏ and k Œ∏ during the identification of ree however the original form of rre is first converted to a more general form of the pde eqs 8 24 and 29 where hydraulic parameters d Œ∏ and k Œ∏ are transformed into terms with coefficients a and parameter m that is the spatial discretization of the hydraulic parameters is no longer required when solving the target pde hence using the testing data generated by solving eq 2 the right side and left side of eq 8 exist a difference which is named as the closure error in this study fig 5 depicts the spatiotemporal patterns of soil moisture and associated closure error it can be observed that the peak of the closure error in fig 5b is in line with the wetting front in fig 5a where both soil moisture and hydraulic parameters change most dramatically this indicates that this closure error stemming from the spatial discretization of hydraulic parameters grows larger as the nonlinearity increases fig 4 also reveals that the final prediction errors Œµ m gradually decrease from s1 to s3 all of which yet are significantly smaller than that of the correct pde it seems that progressively looser constraints on the equation form and coefficients from s1 to s3 contribute to the closure error being compensated by adjusting more coefficients or adding some candidate terms these results imply that the form of target ree may have a great impact on the reasonable identification of ree furthermore it has to be admitted that the current candidate library is small even in scenario s3 this means that this work still provides too much prior knowledge about the equation form compared to the symbolic regression algorithms that do not require specifying the model structure udrescu and tegmark 2020 searson et al 2010 therefore it is necessary to further enlarge the candidate library in future studies to test the ability of the proposed method without resorting to the specified model structure as much as possible 4 2 identifying the soil water flow equation with the original form considering that the closure errors from the numerical approximation have unnecessarily complicated pde identifications in section 4 1 another test case is considered specifically instead of identifying the more general form of the rre i e eq 4 its original form i e eq 2 as well as the corresponding parameters are identified substituting constitutive functions eq 5 6 into eq 2 the following form can be obtained 32 Œ∏ t k s 1 Œ± n 1 Œ∏ s Œ∏ r z s e 1 n 2 Œ∏ z k s s e 2 n 3 z then the new candidate library and the coefficient can be expressed as follows 33 œÜ s e 2 n 3 z z s e 1 n 2 Œ∏ z 34 a k s k s 1 Œ± n 1 Œ∏ s Œ∏ r similarly three scenarios with varying degrees of prior knowledge are again designed here named s1a s2a and s3a in s1a and s2a the candidate library contains only two occurrence terms and in s3a two other terms are added 35 œÜ s e m 1 z z s e m 2 Œ∏ z s e m 3 3 Œ∏ z 3 s e m 4 Œ∏ table 2 lists the identified equations for s1a s2a and s3a notably the two augmented interference terms in s3a have been removed directly because their identified coefficients are very close to zero it can be seen that for the new candidate library the rre can still be identified with considerable accuracy in all scenarios by using the proposed two step data driven method this should undoubtedly be attributed to the correct construction of the candidate library which is often unknown in advance in practical problems for most existing sparse regression methods the candidate library usually contains the states of a system and their spatial derivatives terms of such a specific form as se 2 n 3 z or z se 1 n 2 Œ∏ z are rarely included in the candidate library therefore even though the original form of the rre can be well identified this study still prefers the identification of the more general form of the pde due to its universality 4 3 the influence of spatiotemporal sampling strategies in all the aforementioned test cases all the spatiotemporal data generated from the numerical model in section 3 1 are used to identify the equation as well as the corresponding coefficients which is called the full sampling strategy here however such intensive spatiotemporal data are almost not available in practical applications although current soil moisture sensors are capable of sampling at intervals of a few minutes their spatial sampling resolution is still far from the 2 cm set in the above numerical models therefore it is necessary to explore the effects of the spatiotemporal resolution of sampling on the identification of the soil water flow governing equation here three sampling strategies are considered in sampling strategy ss1 the spatial resolution of the observed soil moisture decreases from 2 cm to 10 cm while its temporal sampling interval remains 0 01 d in strategy ss2 the temporal sampling interval changes from 0 01 d to 0 1 d while the spatial resolution remains 2 cm and in strategy ss3 both the temporal frequency and spatial resolution are reduced being equal to 0 1 d and 10 cm respectively for each sampling strategy all three scenarios s1 s2 and s3 are executed table 3 presents a comparison between the correct and identified equations with three sampling strategies ss1 ss2 and ss3 for s1 s2 and s3 respectively on the whole the results lead to three findings 1 in combination with the results in table 2 the reduction in the spatiotemporal sampling frequency significantly deteriorates the accuracy of the identified equation as we expected 2 compared to the second order spatial derivatives the first order spatial derivatives are less sensitive to the sampling strategy for example in s1 the coefficients of the first order spatial derivatives corresponding to the three sampling strategies are always close to the true value of 0 3 while the second order spatial derivatives coefficients are equal to 0 196 0 11 and 0 15 for ss1 ss2 and ss3 respectively far less than the true value of 0 219 3 for s3 where some extra terms are included in the candidate library the reduction in data density or resolution may result in the appearance of some originally nonexistent terms in the identified equation for example the coefficient of the zero order derivative of the water content s e m 4 Œ∏ reaches approximately 0 07 in ss3 which obviously cannot be neglected this indicates that when using the data driven method to identify the governing equation of soil water flow different datasets obtained by different measurement instruments may support systems of varying degrees of complexity that is if the spatiotemporal density of soil moisture data is not intensive enough then the higher order derivatives may not be identified and the derived pde can be presented in a simpler form however it should be acknowledged that identifying the pdes in a data driven manner is rather susceptible to the data density in comparison to theory driven approaches the high spatial and temporal resolution requirements of the proposed method for discrete data may hinder its further application in modeling soil moisture movement under real world circumstances 4 4 identifying the soil water flow equation in the presence of data noise considering the advantage of the automatic differentiation technique in dealing with noise this study attempts to introduce it into our two step data driven method the robustness of this modified two step method in the presence of data noise is tested in this section for comparison as a typical data smoothing method savitzky golay filtering also known as least squares smoothing filtering press and teukolsky 1990 is also considered to preprocess noisy data due to its suitability for nonlinear problems the moving window width is set to 11 the window is symmetric with 5 data points on each side and the desired order is 3 after denoised by smoothing the derivatives of spatiotemporal data are calculated by the finite difference in these cases we add random noise with a level of 5 to the generated data i e Œ∏ z t Œ∏ z t 1 0 05 e here e denotes the uniform random variable taking values from 1 to 1 then neural networks are trained in the light of these noisy spatiotemporal data of soil moisture and subsequently the required derivatives are yielded by automatic differentiation fig 6 compares scatterplots between the true derivatives including Œ∏ t Œ∏ z and 2 Œ∏ z 2 and the corresponding values calculated in three ways to address noise i e not processing the noisy data np smoothing the noisy data sm and automatic differentiation from the neural network nn respectively a comparison of fig 6 a c reveals that data noise has a significant detrimental effect on the calculation of derivatives especially for higher order derivatives the implementation of data smoothing procedures fig 6 d f is indeed effective in improving r 2 to some extent but may entail a loss of information leading to a flat second derivative fig 6f in other words 2 Œ∏ z 2 is seriously underestimated fortunately the derivatives calculated by nn are relatively insensitive to errors resulting in a fairly high correlation with the true derivatives as depicted in fig 6 g i fig 7 further compares the actual spatiotemporal derivatives of soil moisture with the corresponding values calculated by the sm and nn respectively only the results on the 3rd day are presented here it can be seen that the derivatives calculated by the nn are in good agreement with the true ones while the method of smoothing out the noisy data i e sm fails to obtain accurate derivatives this inferiority of the sm is particularly evident for second order spatial derivatives fig 7c for instance the values of 2 Œ∏ z 2 are very fluctuant at the position that is supposed to be steady from node 1 to node 50 called the stabilization phase here but are less volatile at the wetting front where derivatives deserve to change dramatically from node 50 to node 70 called the mutation phase this superiority of nn may be due to its use of the chain rule to compute the derivatives directly from the neural network s weights and biases xu et al 2020 unlike the finite difference in sm where two adjacent points are taken to calculate derivations this means that nn is able to deal with data noise more effectively by taking into account the entire network s computation process as depicted in fig 1 rather than just two points in the dataset thus the risk of tremendous errors triggered by small data noise in the calculation of derivatives can be greatly reduced once the derivatives have been calculated the two step data driven method can be conducted to identify the governing equations table 4 lists a comparison of the correct and identified rres with two noise treatments i e sm and nn respectively only the results in s1 are presented here as we expected due to the loss of information on higher order derivatives fig 6f the utilization of sm results in 2 Œ∏ z 2 in the pde of unsaturated flow not being correctly identified and the corresponding coefficient a 2 0 008 is very close to 0 this eventually also leads to the values of m and a of the other derivative terms being far from the true values in contrast the identified equation based on the nn is more accurate due to its insensitivity to noise however it has to be admitted that there is still a gap between this equation and the true one especially for the 2 Œ∏ z 2 term further investigation demonstrates that when the noise level increases to 10 the performance of nn in identifying the pde of unsaturated flow further deteriorates significantly although still better than sm not presented here for the sake of brevity this is because the training of discrete data using nn is essentially to construct a mapping between the input temporal and spatial coordinates and the output soil water content the continuous increase in the noise level of the training data may induce accidental correlations in nn models garc√≠a et al 2016 thereby resulting in a deviation of the calculated derivatives from their true counterparts fig 8 depicts scatterplots between the true derivatives including Œ∏ t Œ∏ z and 2 Œ∏ z 2 and the corresponding values calculated by nn under 10 data noise a comparison of fig 8 and fig 6 g i reveals that as the noise level increases the values of the determination coefficient r2 between all three derivatives and their corresponding true values decrease significantly in particular the r2 value of 2 Œ∏ z 2 plummets from 0 8978 to 0 4877 eventually the identification accuracy of the governing equation deteriorates due to the complete dependence of the proposed method on the data thus although automatic differentiation within neural network architecture has provided a better solution than finite difference schemes after data smoothing how to proceed to mitigate the adverse effects of noise on the governing equation identification is still worthy of further investigation in future studies 5 conclusions in this work a modified version of the two step data driven method chang and zhang 2019b is proposed for the identification of the strongly nonlinear soil water flow equation from the perspective of data driven modeling the ability and challenge of this modified method to jointly identify the state dependent pdes and coefficients are tested in this study a series of illustrative cases are employed to explore the influence of prior knowledge of the target equation data density and data noise on the identification of the rre 1 the proposed data driven method allows effective identification of the governing equation of unsaturated flow with little dependence on the equation form and constitutive relationships if the underlying physical processes are uncertain then a more relaxed equation form is recommended due to its low requirement for prior knowledge and potential to remedy closure errors 2 the reduction in the spatiotemporal resolution of sampling may cause higher order terms to be difficult to derive accurately or some terms that are not originally present to appear in the learned equation this ultimately leads to the form of the rre being identified incorrectly implying that different observation techniques may support systems with different complexities 3 the derivatives calculated from the finite difference scheme are too sensitive to data noise while the introduction of automatic differentiation techniques can indeed facilitate the two step data driven method to successfully mitigate the adverse effects of data noise on the identification of the rre this current work is still in the early stages in the future it is hoped to investigate whether two or three dimensional soil water flow governing equations can be identified by the proposed data driven approaches under more complex conditions such as root water uptake complex boundaries and soil heterogeneity in addition how to further mitigate the adverse effects of data noise on the discovery of the rre should be investigated for nonlinear unsaturated flow

1821,the impact of flooding on vegetation ecosystems worldwide has resulted in severe and widespread threats despite this there is a significant knowledge gap in understanding the impact of floods on vegetation to gain a comprehensive understanding of the response mechanism of the global vegetation ecosystem to flood disasters it is crucial to assess the loss of vegetation caused by flood events in this study we analyzed 3325 flood events around the world from 2001 to 2020 including the geographic distribution start and end dates duration severity and affected areas using kernel density estimation we assessed the exacerbated severity and magnitude of flood occurrences identifying spatial clustering of events through moving average was utilized to reveal the prolonged trends in areas impacted by floods additionally by spatially matching with global land cover products we comprehensively explored the magnitude range and progression of the impact of floods on vegetation the findings indicate that 1 extreme flood events have been increasing in number affected area severity and magnitude since the 21st century with the majority of events occurring between 10 s 50 n 2 strong spatial clustering of flood events was identified in the southeast of north america the southeast of south america the east of africa the south of europe and the south of asia 3 flood hazards in frequent flood affected areas pose severe threats to the terrestrial vegetation ecosystem highlighting the necessity of further detailed estimation of flood damages to vegetation at a global scale this research provides an extensive evaluation of the impact of floods on vegetation at the global national regional scale with a focus on understanding the temporal trends and spatial distribution

introduction since the 21st century climate change induced by human activities has resulted in an increasing number of extreme weather events the intergovernmental panel on climate change sixth assessment report ipcc ar6 masson delmotte et al 2021 which leads to significant losses lesk et al 2016 globally numerous studies have documented the fact that the frequency severity and duration of flood disasters are experiencing an increasing trend due to climate change land use dynamics and human activities among other factors alfieri et al 2017 bl√∂schl et al 2019 najibi and devineni 2018 tellman et al 2021 these flood hazards pose serious threats to the terrestrial vegetation ecosystem assahira et al 2017 as one of the most significant land cover types in the global ecosystem vegetation is crucial for maintaining climate stability and regulating the carbon balance in the atmosphere ge et al 2021 pan et al 2018 vegetation mitigates carbon emissions chen et al 2022 keenan et

reichstein et al 2013 current efforts have been focusing on the effects of climate change and human activity on vegetation doughty et al 2015 ge et al 2021 and have concluded that global vegetation greening is primarily caused by climatic and atmospheric changes wu et al 2015 however in contrast to the effects of human activity and global climate change the impact of flood events on vegetation is localized discrete in space and featured by the discontinuation in the temporal dimension d≈æub√°kov√° et al 2015 therefore it remains to be underexploited to reveal the impact of floods on vegetation on a global scale in a comprehensive manner lesk et al 2016 at present flood disaster monitoring can be generally divided into two categories hydrological station monitoring and remote sensing monitoring teng et al 2017 twele et al 2016 hydrological stations are able to obtain important information such as the water level of the flooded areas to provide rapid situational awareness however the number of ground stations and the amount of historical data can be limited mallakpour and villarini 2015 another approach to monitoring floods is to take advantage of remote sensing

monitoring of dynamic changes in the vegetation and gauging the impact of floods on the vegetation at various geographical scales huang et al 2018 karthikeyan et al 2020 xu et al 2022 in this study we used the dartmouth flood observatory dfo database as the primary source for identifying a total of 3 325 flood events that occurred worldwide from 2001 to 2020 we extracted the start and end dates duration severity magnitude and affected area of these flood events and spatially matched them with global land cover products in addition we also performed a kernel density analysis on the centroid points of 3325 flood events and used the moving average method to calculate the annual moving average curve of the flood affected area we explored the magnitude duration and impact areas of floods and investigated the magnitude range and progression of the impact of floods on vegetation in a comprehensive manner the results of this study benefit the understanding of the mechanisms of global vegetation ecosystem restoration and the terrestrial carbon cycle in response to flood disasters providing an essential scientific foundation for human society to mitigate and adapt to the impact of disaster events on natural ecosystems 2 materials and methodology in this study we analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of flood events from 2001 to 2020 we compared the em dat database to the dartmouth flood observatory dfo database and found that dfo has more detailed flood positional records i e longitude latitude and country name flood start and end dates flood duration and the extent of impact and flood severity kundzewicz et al 2013 therefore we regarded dfo as a more reliable source following the studies by chen et al 2020 najibi and devineni 2018 and screened and eliminated any erroneous data we extracted the geographic distribution start and end dates duration severity and affected areas of 3325 flood events worldwide from 2001 to 2020 this study utilized flood severity and magnitude indicators to assess the exacerbated severity and magnitude of flood occurrences we employed moving average algorithms to reflect long term trends in areas impacted by floods by applying kernel density estimation we also revealed the extent of spatial clustering of flood events furthermore through spatial matching with global land cover products we comprehensively explored the magnitude range and progression of the impact of floods on vegetation the specific process is detailed in fig 1 2 1 materials in this study we mainly used dartmouth flood observatory dfo

dfo data includes information on flood event location longitude latitude and country name flood start and end dates duration the number of days between flood start and end dates and flood damage https floodobservatory colorado edu index html we extracted a total of 3 325 flood events from 2001 to 2020 2 1 2 emergency events database em dat em dat is a global database that collects and disseminates information about natural disasters technological disasters and complex disasters https www emdat be which contains important information on the occurrence and impact of more than 22 000 disasters in the world from 1900 to the present the em dat database includes the dates the number of people killed injured or affected and the financial damage in this study we compared the flood events recorded using the em dat database with those recorded by the dfo database 2 1 3 land cover product land cover represents the cover formed by natural and anthropogenic influences on the earth s surface such as

present with a temporal resolution of a year and a spatial resolution of 0 05 degree friedl et al 2010 sulla menashe et al 2019 the international geosphere biosphere programmer igbp defines 17 land cover categories yang et al 2017 including 11 categories of natural vegetation three categories of land use and three categories of unvegetated land covering the longitude within 180 180 degrees and the latitude within 64 84 degrees sulla menashe et al 2019 in this study according to the description of land cover types by igbp we reclassified igbp land cover categories into eight categories including forests shrublands and grasslands permanent wetlands croplands urban and built up lands snow and ice barren and water bodies chen et al 2022 the specific categories and their definitions are shown in table 1 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 flood severity and flood magnitude dfo proposed two indices characterizing floods flood severity and magnitude kundzewicz et al 2013 flood severity is grouped into three levels according to the severity of the disaster 1 large flood events 1 5 very large events and 2 extreme events the classification of floods into three levels is based on the extent of harm caused to edifices or agriculture the loss of human life and the frequency of occurrence class 1 pertains to instances where extensive harm is caused to edifices or agriculture resulting in the loss of human life or where no comparable incident has occurred in the past one to two decades class 1 5 refers to very sizeable floods that occur once every two or more decades affect a vast region of over 5000 sq km or have a local recurrence interval of 1 2 decades finally class 2 illustrates the occurrence of unprecedented floods that repeat themselves once every greater than 100 years although flood severity is an important feature that defines flood events the extent and duration of floods also characterize the magnitude of flood events therefore it is necessary to introduce flood magnitude as a comprehensive description indicator to represent the duration severity and affected area of floods kundzewicz et al 2013 we used the following formula to quantify flood magnitude 1 floodmagnitude log 10 d u r a t i o n s e v e r i t y a f f e c t e d a r e a where floodmagnitude serves as a function of flood severity duration and geographic flood extents the flood duration is derived from the start date and end date of the dfo database unit days the flood severity follows three different levels i e 1 1 5 and 2 the affectedarea represents the geographic extent of floods unit km2 with polygons representing the flood affected regions based upon information acquired from news sources it is important to note that the affected areas do not represent the flooded areas kundzewicz et al 2013 2 2 2 kernel density estimation the kernel density estimation built upon the first law of geography explores the spatial distribution of points and calculates the density of element points in the neighborhood wang et al 2020b in density analysis points that fall into the search area have different weights points close to the search center are assigned larger weights da silva j√∫nior et al 2019 the calculation of kernel density follows 2 f s 1 nh i 1 n k x x i h where x represents the position coordinates of estimated points and x i represents the position

moving average moving average is a statistical analysis method for smooth forecasting given a time series the moving average algorithm averages values in a moving window containing a series of values reflecting the long term trend of that time series bounouh et al 2021 relying on the moving average algorithm we are able to eliminate time series fluctuations and reveal the developing direction and trend of events ma et al 2021 we then analyze the long term trend of the forecast series according to the trend line in this study we calculated the annual moving average curve of flood affected areas using the moving average method the calculation of moving average follows 3 ma t p 1 p 2 p 3 p i n where ma t denotes the number of moving averages n denotes the temporal period p i denotes the flood affected area corresponding to time i 3 results 3 1 flood spatiotemporal distribution trends worldwide flood is regarded as one of the most significant stress factors affecting terrestrial vegetation ecosystems at the regional level wang et al 2019 we analyzed 3 325 historical flood events in the dfo database from 2001 to 2020 fig 2 the total affected area of these floods reached 351 million km2 we found that the main causes of flood hazards are heavy rain n 2855 85 86 tropical storm n 169 5 08 tropical cyclone n 123 3 70 snowmelt n 104 3 13 other factors n 74 2 23 in this context n denotes the number of occurrences of flood events countries with a high frequency of flood events include the united states 282 china 210 india 178 indonesia 158 australia 113 philippines 108 vietnam 80 brazil 75 russia 74 and afghanistan 64 fig 2a we assigned global flood events from 2001 to 2020 to each 10 latitude band fig 2b we found that the flood events worldwide were mainly distributed between 10 s 50 n n 2677 80 51 and reached their highest peak at 30 n 40 n n 573 17 23 a region characterized by rich forests and vegetation zhu et al 2016 the above observation suggests that frequent flood affected latitude areas tend to have vigorous tree growth and a wide variety of vegetation thus the damage of floods to vegetation needs additional attention zheng et al 2020 we noticed that the annual change curve of the flood quantity and the affected area fails to present a strong monotonic growth rather it shows a noticeable fluctuation with a considerably large number of floods in 2003 and 2007 fig 2 c in addition a comprehensive analysis of temporal trends of global flood events reveals a discernible pattern beginning in 2010 there is a distinct contrast between the number of flood events and the affected areas which is underscored by an escalating dilatation of single flood affected areas we used flood magnitude to measure the severity and intensity of flood events the results show that since the 21st century the proportion of low intensity flood events 1 fm 4 in the world has been decreasing while the proportion of medium and high intensity flood events 4 fm 9 has experienced an increasing trend the trendline of flood magnitude further confirmed this trend fig 2 d the increase in the number affected area severity and magnitude of extreme flood events serves as a warning that more effective flood control management measures are necessary to prevent the continuous expansion of losses caused by floods 3 2 spatial matching between flood events and land cover types in this study we refer to the coordinates of centroid points and the geographic locations of flood affected areas during 3325 flood events recorded from 2001 to 2020 provided by the dfo database by spatial matching the locations of flood events with global land cover products fig 3 a b we obtained the number of flood events in different land cover types during 2001 2020 fig 3d we found that flood events primarily occurred in land cover types such as forests shrublands grasslands and croplands the temporal trends of flood distribution in shrublands and grasslands are consistent with that of floods worldwide and the number of flood events in shrublands and grasslands reached two separate peaks in 2003 and 2007 in addition the distribution of flood events in the vegetation area has increased over the last five years further we performed a kernel density analysis on the flood event centroid points of 3 325 flood events fig 3c the results show strong spatial clustering of flood events in the southeast of north america the southeast of south america the east of africa the south of europe and the south of asia fig 3c in this study we counted the proportion of flood events in different land cover types for each five year time interval from 2001 to 2020 fig 4 we found that in the four five year intervals from 2001 to 2020 i e 2001 2005 2006 2010 2011 2015 and 2016 2020 17 6 19 9 17 8 and 20 4 of flood event centroids were located in forests 51 4 51 4 53 5 and 52 9 of flood event centroids were located in shrublands grasslands 19 0 18 5 18 9 and 16 4 of flood event centroids were located in croplands overall 88 89 8 90 6 and 89 7 of flood event centroids were located in forests shrublands grasslands and croplands the flood events in other land cover types account for less than 15 suggesting that frequent flood affected areas have vigorous tree growth and a wide variety of vegetation 3 3 the impact of flood spatiotemporal trends on vegetation in this study we investigated the flood affected areas of vegetation from 2001 to 2020 fig 5 a shows the dynamics of global flood affected areas on a monthly basis given that the monthly records of the global flood affected areas are greatly affected by cyclical and random fluctuations we used the moving average method to derive the annual moving average of the flood affected areas we found that the affected areas by floods from 2001 to 2020 present notable peaks from may to september demonstrating strong seasonal dynamics the annual moving average curve shows that the flood affected areas had two separate peaks in 2003 and 2007 consistent with the patterns of the flood event counts fig 5b shows the flood affected areas by land cover type and the average affected areas by land cover type per flood event the results confirmed again that forests shrublands grasslands and croplands are the main types of land cover affected by floods we calculated the distribution of flood affected areas in different land cover types from 2001 to 2020 fig 5c the results show that the main flood disaster areas are forests shrublands grasslands and croplands consistent with the patterns of the distribution of flood events in different land cover types furthermore the impact of floods on shrublands and grasslands peaked in 2003 2007 and 2009 in addition we calculated the average affected area of different land cover types for each flood event during our investigated period fig 5d overall different from the distribution curve of annual flood affected areas we noticed that the average impact area of a single flood event on the vegetation area shows a notable increasing trend and peaked in 2015 153 999 2 km2 in addition we counted the proportion of flood affected areas in different land cover types for each five year time interval from 2001 to 2020 fig 6 we found that in the four five year intervals from 2001 to 2020 i e 2001 2005 2006 2010 2011 2015 and 2016 2020 17 6 14 5 16 0 and 17 4 of flood affected area were located in forests 52 7 56 0 59 0 and 56 6 of flood affected area were located in shrublands grasslands 20 5 17 2 13 6 and 13 4 of flood affected area were located in croplands overall 90 8 87 7 88 6 and 87 4 of flood affected area were located in forests shrublands grasslands and croplands the results indicate that more than 85 of the global flood affected area is covered by vegetation with less than 15 comprising other land cover types this finding suggests that flood hazards pose severe threats to the terrestrial vegetation ecosystem 4 discussion the recently released report by the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change entitled climate change 2021 the physical science basis ipcc ar6 highlights the substantial impact of human activities on extreme weather and climate events across various regions of the globe masson delmotte et al 2021 the report emphasizes that sustained global warming will result in more frequent and severe extreme events for every 1 c escalation in global temperature atmospheric water vapor content expands by approximately 7 thereby intensifying extreme precipitation and leading to a corresponding rise in floods across numerous basins this ultimately results in heightened severity of extreme flood events seneviratne et al 2021 our study corroborates these findings and emphasizes the pressing need for more efficacious flood control management measures to mitigate the accelerating losses associated with such flood events previous studies have shown that from a macroscopic perspective floods can cause carbon flux to be exported to river waters as dissolved co2 and organic carbon by altering the carbon cycle mechanism of the floodplain ecosystem abril et al 2014 from a microscopic point of view supersaturated water causes insufficient soil oxygen content hinders vegetation root respiration reduces vegetation productivity and even causes large scale death zhou et al 2020 at the same time the dead vegetation releases a large amount of ch4 and co2 through decomposition which turns the vegetation carbon sink into a carbon source piao et al 2019 consequently flood events pose significant threats to terrestrial vegetation teng et al 2017 resulting in regional terrestrial vegetation ecosystems becoming increasingly susceptible to damage in the aftermath of flood events however due to the short duration of the flood disaster and the concentrated impact range the impact on vegetation mainly occurs in the flood affected area and is discretely distributed in space therefore the magnitude and scale of flood damage to vegetation have yet to be quantified lesk et al 2016 in this study we considered the intensity duration and area of floods the degree of impact on vegetation the impact scope and the impact process the purpose of the research is to underscore the need for proactive and efficacious measures by governmental bodies and pertinent organizations to enhance their capacity to prevent and address extreme flood related disasters furthermore this research highlights the imperative of a detailed assessment of flood induced damage to vegetation on a global scale our findings have significantly contributed to the precise quantification of flood affected regions on vegetation thus enabling a better comprehension of the underlying mechanisms of global vegetation ecosystem recovery and the terrestrial carbon cycle in response to flood disasters this study provides a crucial scientific basis for human society to mitigate and adapt to the impact of disaster events on natural ecosystems there was a notable correlation between the frequency of annual flood events in dfo and em dat from 2001 to 2020 pearson correlation r 0 415 jones et al 2022 the number of flood events recorded in the dfo database between 2001 and 2004 was higher than the number of flood events recorded in the em dat database with a significant difference between the two fig 7 a between 2005 and 2010 the difference between flood events recorded in the dfo database and the em dat database was trivial between 2010 and 2017 the number of flood events recorded by em dat was higher than those recorded by the dfo database from 2018 to 2020 the em dat database presented an increase in the frequency of floods with the number of flood events recorded by the em dat in 2019 and 2020 much higher than those in the dfo database fig 7a fig 7b shows the temporal variation of flood affected areas from 2001 to 2020 in both databases compared with the em dat database dfo presents considerably larger flood affected areas than em dat thanks to its more detailed documentation of flood events several limitations in our analysis need to be acknowledged to determine the impact of flood events on vegetation we mainly rely on dfo products despite the high quality records provided by dfo incomplete flood event records in the database might introduce uncertainties in addition flood hazards are complex in nature and discretization in space and time with vegetation distribution also having temporal periodicity and spatial uncertainty therefore we cannot perfectly control the experimental variables and errors when estimating the impact area of floods on vegetation which may lead to a certain level of under overestimation of the impact of floods on vegetation future efforts are encouraged to take advantage of various remote sensing data and deep learning based change detection algorithms to obtain more accurate flood inundation ranges durations and other critical information wang et al 2020a xu et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 the leverage of big earth data and the application of advanced analytical methods potentially benefits the extraction of indices e g vegetation greenness and productivity in the submerged area before and after flood events this would provide essential information for quantifying flood damages to vegetation more accurately 5 conclusions this study aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the impact of floods on vegetation at the global national regional scale with a focus on understanding the temporal trends and spatial distribution characteristics over the past 20 years 2001 2020 it represents the first study to evaluate the impact of floods on vegetation at a global scale incorporating information such as start and end dates duration severity magnitude and affected area of 3325 flood events and spatially matching them with global land cover products we also employ a kernel density analysis on the centroid points of these flood events and use the moving average method to calculate the annual moving average curve of the flood affected area through these methods we assess the severity and magnitude of flood occurrences reveal the long term trends in areas impacted by floods and identify the clustering patterns of flood events the results suggest an increasing trend in the number affected area severity and magnitude of extreme flood events with a shift towards medium and high intensity events the majority of flood events occur in the 10 s 50 n latitude range with strong spatial clustering observed in seven regions worldwide the high proportion of flood affected areas covered by vegetation highlights the serious threat posed by flood hazards to terrestrial ecosystems emphasizing the need for further research on flood damage to vegetation at a global scale this study s findings underscore the urgency of effective flood control management measures to mitigate and adapt to the impact of extreme flood events on natural ecosystems urging governments and relevant organizations to take positive and effective actions to prevent and resolve

1821,the impact of flooding on vegetation ecosystems worldwide has resulted in severe and widespread threats despite this there is a significant knowledge gap in understanding the impact of floods on vegetation to gain a comprehensive understanding of the response mechanism of the global vegetation ecosystem to flood disasters it is crucial to assess the loss of vegetation caused by flood events in this study we analyzed 3325 flood events around the world from 2001 to 2020 including the geographic distribution start and end dates duration severity and affected areas using kernel density estimation we assessed the exacerbated severity and magnitude of flood occurrences identifying spatial clustering of events through moving average was utilized to reveal the prolonged trends in areas impacted by floods additionally by spatially matching with global land cover products we comprehensively explored the magnitude range and progression of the impact of floods on vegetation the findings indicate that 1 extreme flood events have been increasing in number affected area severity and magnitude since the 21st century with the majority of events occurring between 10 s 50 n 2 strong spatial clustering of flood events was identified in the southeast of north america the southeast of south america the east of africa the south of europe and the south of asia 3 flood hazards in frequent flood affected areas pose severe threats to the terrestrial vegetation ecosystem highlighting the necessity of further detailed estimation of flood damages to vegetation at a global scale this research provides an extensive evaluation of the impact of floods on vegetation at the global national regional scale with a focus on understanding the temporal trends and spatial distribution characteristics over the past 20 years 2001 2020 keywords flood vegetation natural disasters terrestrial ecosystems remote sensing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction since the 21st century climate change induced by human activities has resulted in an increasing number of extreme weather events the intergovernmental panel on climate change sixth assessment report ipcc ar6 masson delmotte et al 2021 which leads to significant losses lesk et al 2016 globally numerous studies have documented the fact that the frequency severity and duration of flood disasters are experiencing an increasing trend due to climate change land use dynamics and human activities among other factors alfieri et al 2017 bl√∂schl et al 2019 najibi and devineni 2018 tellman et al 2021 these flood hazards pose serious threats to the terrestrial vegetation ecosystem assahira et al 2017 as one of the most significant land cover types in the global ecosystem vegetation is crucial for maintaining climate stability and regulating the carbon balance in the atmosphere ge et al 2021 pan et al 2018 vegetation mitigates carbon emissions chen et al 2022 keenan et al 2016 and serves as an important component of the sustainable development of terrestrial ecosystems bryan et al 2018 contributing to the improvement of air quality clean water sources soil and water conservation water source preservation and climate regulation vegetation is jointly affected by various factors such as climate change human activities and major natural disasters chen et al 2021 reichstein et al 2013 current efforts have been focusing on the effects of climate change and human activity on vegetation doughty et al 2015 ge et al 2021 and have concluded that global vegetation greening is primarily caused by climatic and atmospheric changes wu et al 2015 however in contrast to the effects of human activity and global climate change the impact of flood events on vegetation is localized discrete in space and featured by the discontinuation in the temporal dimension d≈æub√°kov√° et al 2015 therefore it remains to be underexploited to reveal the impact of floods on vegetation on a global scale in a comprehensive manner lesk et al 2016 at present flood disaster monitoring can be generally divided into two categories hydrological station monitoring and remote sensing monitoring teng et al 2017 twele et al 2016 hydrological stations are able to obtain important information such as the water level of the flooded areas to provide rapid situational awareness however the number of ground stations and the amount of historical data can be limited mallakpour and villarini 2015 another approach to monitoring floods is to take advantage of remote sensing technology to provide holistic dynamic near realtime and accurate flood situational awareness devries et al 2020 robert brakenridge et al 2012 the advantages of remote sensing images benefit the monitoring of dynamic changes in the vegetation and gauging the impact of floods on the vegetation at various geographical scales huang et al 2018 karthikeyan et al 2020 xu et al 2022 in this study we used the dartmouth flood observatory dfo database as the primary source for identifying a total of 3 325 flood events that occurred worldwide from 2001 to 2020 we extracted the start and end dates duration severity magnitude and affected area of these flood events and spatially matched them with global land cover products in addition we also performed a kernel density analysis on the centroid points of 3325 flood events and used the moving average method to calculate the annual moving average curve of the flood affected area we explored the magnitude duration and impact areas of floods and investigated the magnitude range and progression of the impact of floods on vegetation in a comprehensive manner the results of this study benefit the understanding of the mechanisms of global vegetation ecosystem restoration and the terrestrial carbon cycle in response to flood disasters providing an essential scientific foundation for human society to mitigate and adapt to the impact of disaster events on natural ecosystems 2 materials and methodology in this study we analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of flood events from 2001 to 2020 we compared the em dat database to the dartmouth flood observatory dfo database and found that dfo has more detailed flood positional records i e longitude latitude and country name flood start and end dates flood duration and the extent of impact and flood severity kundzewicz et al 2013 therefore we regarded dfo as a more reliable source following the studies by chen et al 2020 najibi and devineni 2018 and screened and eliminated any erroneous data we extracted the geographic distribution start and end dates duration severity and affected areas of 3325 flood events worldwide from 2001 to 2020 this study utilized flood severity and magnitude indicators to assess the exacerbated severity and magnitude of flood occurrences we employed moving average algorithms to reflect long term trends in areas impacted by floods by applying kernel density estimation we also revealed the extent of spatial clustering of flood events furthermore through spatial matching with global land cover products we comprehensively explored the magnitude range and progression of the impact of floods on vegetation the specific process is detailed in fig 1 2 1 materials in this study we mainly used dartmouth flood observatory dfo database emergency events database em dat and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land cover product mcd12c1 our investigation period spans from 2001 to 2020 with all data having a spatial resolution of 0 05 degree 2 1 1 dartmouth flood observatory dfo dartmouth flood observatory dfo detects maps and measures major flood events on a global scale using satellite remote sensing dfo data includes information on flood event location longitude latitude and country name flood start and end dates duration the number of days between flood start and end dates and flood damage https floodobservatory colorado edu index html we extracted a total of 3 325 flood events from 2001 to 2020 2 1 2 emergency events database em dat em dat is a global database that collects and disseminates information about natural disasters technological disasters and complex disasters https www emdat be which contains important information on the occurrence and impact of more than 22 000 disasters in the world from 1900 to the present the em dat database includes the dates the number of people killed injured or affected and the financial damage in this study we compared the flood events recorded using the em dat database with those recorded by the dfo database 2 1 3 land cover product land cover represents the cover formed by natural and anthropogenic influences on the earth s surface such as forests shrublands and grasslands permanent wetlands croplands urban and built up lands snow and ice barren and water bodies to list a few the land cover data we used were derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land cover product mcd12c1 https lpdaac usgs gov products mcd12c1v006 the temporal extent of mcd12c1 products covers the temporal period from 2001 to the present with a temporal resolution of a year and a spatial resolution of 0 05 degree friedl et al 2010 sulla menashe et al 2019 the international geosphere biosphere programmer igbp defines 17 land cover categories yang et al 2017 including 11 categories of natural vegetation three categories of land use and three categories of unvegetated land covering the longitude within 180 180 degrees and the latitude within 64 84 degrees sulla menashe et al 2019 in this study according to the description of land cover types by igbp we reclassified igbp land cover categories into eight categories including forests shrublands and grasslands permanent wetlands croplands urban and built up lands snow and ice barren and water bodies chen et al 2022 the specific categories and their definitions are shown in table 1 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 flood severity and flood magnitude dfo proposed two indices characterizing floods flood severity and magnitude kundzewicz et al 2013 flood severity is grouped into three levels according to the severity of the disaster 1 large flood events 1 5 very large events and 2 extreme events the classification of floods into three levels is based on the extent of harm caused to edifices or agriculture the loss of human life and the frequency of occurrence class 1 pertains to instances where extensive harm is caused to edifices or agriculture resulting in the loss of human life or where no comparable incident has occurred in the past one to two decades class 1 5 refers to very sizeable floods that occur once every two or more decades affect a vast region of over 5000 sq km or have a local recurrence interval of 1 2 decades finally class 2 illustrates the occurrence of unprecedented floods that repeat themselves once every greater than 100 years although flood severity is an important feature that defines flood events the extent and duration of floods also characterize the magnitude of flood events therefore it is necessary to introduce flood magnitude as a comprehensive description indicator to represent the duration severity and affected area of floods kundzewicz et al 2013 we used the following formula to quantify flood magnitude 1 floodmagnitude log 10 d u r a t i o n s e v e r i t y a f f e c t e d a r e a where floodmagnitude serves as a function of flood severity duration and geographic flood extents the flood duration is derived from the start date and end date of the dfo database unit days the flood severity follows three different levels i e 1 1 5 and 2 the affectedarea represents the geographic extent of floods unit km2 with polygons representing the flood affected regions based upon information acquired from news sources it is important to note that the affected areas do not represent the flooded areas kundzewicz et al 2013 2 2 2 kernel density estimation the kernel density estimation built upon the first law of geography explores the spatial distribution of points and calculates the density of element points in the neighborhood wang et al 2020b in density analysis points that fall into the search area have different weights points close to the search center are assigned larger weights da silva j√∫nior et al 2019 the calculation of kernel density follows 2 f s 1 nh i 1 n k x x i h where x represents the position coordinates of estimated points and x i represents the position coordinates of point i i 1 2 n tan et al 2021 n is the number of element points h is the search bandwidth of the kernel density calculation k function represents the spatial weight function kuang et al 2020 the search radius i e bandwidth is determined by silverman s rule of thumb bandwidth estimation formula that can effectively avoid spatial outliers silverman 1986 silverman s rule of thumb bandwidth estimation formula follows 3 searchradius 0 9 m i n s d 1 ln 2 d m n 0 2 where sd is the standard distance d m is the median distance from mean center n is the number of element points 2 2 3 moving average moving average is a statistical analysis method for smooth forecasting given a time series the moving average algorithm averages values in a moving window containing a series of values reflecting the long term trend of that time series bounouh et al 2021 relying on the moving average algorithm we are able to eliminate time series fluctuations and reveal the developing direction and trend of events ma et al 2021 we then analyze the long term trend of the forecast series according to the trend line in this study we calculated the annual moving average curve of flood affected areas using the moving average method the calculation of moving average follows 3 ma t p 1 p 2 p 3 p i n where ma t denotes the number of moving averages n denotes the temporal period p i denotes the flood affected area corresponding to time i 3 results 3 1 flood spatiotemporal distribution trends worldwide flood is regarded as one of the most significant stress factors affecting terrestrial vegetation ecosystems at the regional level wang et al 2019 we analyzed 3 325 historical flood events in the dfo database from 2001 to 2020 fig 2 the total affected area of these floods reached 351 million km2

affected latitude areas tend to have vigorous tree growth and a wide variety of vegetation thus the damage of floods to vegetation needs additional attention zheng et al 2020 we noticed that the annual change curve of the flood quantity and the affected area fails to present a strong monotonic growth rather it shows a noticeable fluctuation with a considerably large number of floods in 2003 and 2007 fig 2 c in addition a comprehensive analysis of temporal trends of global flood events reveals a discernible pattern beginning in 2010 there is a distinct contrast between the number of flood events and the affected areas which is underscored by an escalating dilatation of single flood affected areas we used flood magnitude to measure the severity and intensity of flood events the results show that since the 21st century the proportion of low intensity flood events 1 fm 4 in the world has been decreasing while the proportion of medium and high intensity flood events 4 fm 9 has experienced an increasing trend the trendline of flood magnitude further confirmed this trend fig 2 d the increase in the number affected area severity and magnitude of extreme flood events serves as a warning that more effective flood control management measures are necessary to prevent the continuous expansion of losses caused by floods 3 2 spatial matching between flood events and land cover types in this study we refer to the coordinates of centroid points and the geographic locations of flood affected areas during 3325 flood events recorded from 2001 to 2020 provided by the dfo database by spatial matching the locations of flood events with global land cover products fig 3 a b we obtained the number of flood events in different land cover types during 2001 2020 fig 3d we found that flood events primarily occurred in land cover types such as forests shrublands grasslands and croplands the temporal trends of flood distribution in shrublands and grasslands are consistent with that of floods worldwide and the number of flood events in shrublands and grasslands reached two separate peaks in 2003 and 2007 in addition the distribution of flood events in the vegetation area has increased over the last five years further we performed a kernel density analysis on the flood event centroid points of 3 325 flood events fig 3c the results show strong spatial clustering of flood events in the southeast of north america the southeast of south america the east of africa the south of europe and the south of asia fig 3c in this study we counted the proportion of flood events in different land cover types for each five year time interval from 2001 to 2020 fig 4 we found that in the four five year intervals from 2001 to 2020 i e 2001 2005 2006 2010 2011 2015 and 2016 2020 17 6

centroids were located in croplands overall 88 89 8 90 6 and 89 7 of flood event centroids were located in forests shrublands grasslands and croplands the flood events in other land cover types account for less than 15 suggesting that frequent flood affected areas have vigorous tree growth and a wide variety of vegetation 3 3 the impact of flood spatiotemporal trends on vegetation in this study we investigated the flood affected areas of vegetation from 2001 to 2020 fig 5 a shows the dynamics of global flood affected areas on a monthly basis given that the monthly records of the global flood affected areas are greatly affected by cyclical and random fluctuations we used the moving average method to derive the annual moving average of the flood affected areas we found that the affected areas by floods from 2001 to 2020 present notable peaks from may to september demonstrating strong seasonal dynamics the annual moving average curve shows that the flood affected areas had two separate peaks in 2003 and 2007 consistent with the patterns of the flood event counts fig 5b shows the flood affected areas by land cover type and the average affected areas by land cover type per flood event the results confirmed again that forests shrublands grasslands and croplands are the main types of land cover affected by floods we calculated the distribution of flood affected areas in different land cover types from 2001 to 2020 fig 5c the results show that the main flood disaster areas are forests shrublands grasslands and croplands consistent with the patterns of the distribution of flood events in different land cover types furthermore the impact of floods on shrublands and grasslands peaked in 2003 2007 and 2009 in addition we calculated the average affected area of different land cover types for each flood event during our investigated period fig 5d overall different from the distribution curve of annual flood affected areas we noticed that the average impact area of a single flood event on the vegetation area shows a notable increasing trend and peaked in 2015 153 999 2 km2 in addition we counted the proportion of flood affected areas in different land cover types for each five year time interval from 2001 to 2020 fig 6 we found that in the four five year intervals from 2001 to 2020 i e 2001 2005 2006 2010 2011 2015 and 2016 2020 17 6 14 5 16 0 and 17 4 of flood affected area were located in forests 52 7 56 0 59 0 and 56 6 of flood affected area were located in shrublands grasslands 20 5 17 2 13 6 and 13 4 of flood affected area were located in croplands overall 90 8 87 7 88 6 and 87 4 of flood affected area were located in forests shrublands grasslands and croplands the results indicate that more than 85 of the global flood affected area is covered by vegetation with less than 15 comprising other land cover types this finding suggests that flood hazards pose severe threats to the terrestrial vegetation ecosystem 4 discussion the recently released report by the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change entitled climate change 2021 the physical science basis ipcc ar6 highlights the substantial impact of human activities on extreme weather and climate events across various regions of the globe masson delmotte et al 2021 the report emphasizes that sustained global warming will result in more frequent and severe extreme events for every 1 c escalation in global temperature atmospheric water vapor content expands by approximately 7 thereby intensifying extreme precipitation and leading to a corresponding rise in floods across numerous basins this ultimately results in heightened severity of extreme flood events seneviratne et al 2021 our study corroborates these findings and emphasizes the pressing need for more efficacious flood control management measures to mitigate the accelerating losses associated with such flood events previous studies have shown that from a macroscopic perspective floods can cause carbon flux to be exported to river waters as dissolved co2 and organic carbon by altering the carbon cycle mechanism of the floodplain ecosystem abril et al 2014 from a microscopic point of view supersaturated water causes insufficient soil oxygen content hinders vegetation root respiration reduces vegetation productivity and even causes large scale death zhou et al 2020 at the same time the dead vegetation releases a large amount of ch4 and co2 through decomposition which turns the vegetation carbon sink into a carbon source piao et al 2019 consequently flood events pose significant threats to terrestrial vegetation teng et al 2017 resulting in regional terrestrial vegetation ecosystems becoming increasingly susceptible to damage in the aftermath of flood events however due to the short duration of the flood disaster and the concentrated impact range the impact on vegetation mainly occurs in the flood affected area and is discretely distributed in space therefore the magnitude and scale of flood damage to vegetation have yet to be quantified lesk et al 2016 in this study we considered the intensity duration and area of floods the degree of impact on vegetation the impact scope and the impact process the purpose of the research is to underscore the need for proactive and efficacious measures by governmental bodies and pertinent organizations to enhance their capacity to prevent and address extreme flood related disasters furthermore this research highlights the imperative of a detailed assessment of flood induced damage to vegetation on a global scale our findings have significantly contributed to the precise quantification of flood affected regions on vegetation thus enabling a better comprehension of the underlying mechanisms of global vegetation ecosystem recovery and the terrestrial carbon cycle in response to flood disasters this study provides a crucial scientific basis for human society to mitigate and adapt to the impact of disaster events on natural ecosystems there was a notable correlation between the frequency of annual flood events in dfo and em dat from 2001 to 2020 pearson correlation r 0 415 jones et al 2022 the number of flood events recorded in the dfo database between 2001 and 2004 was higher than the number of flood events recorded in the em dat database with a significant difference between the two fig 7 a between 2005 and 2010 the difference between flood events recorded in the dfo database and the em dat database was trivial between 2010 and 2017 the number of flood events recorded by em dat was higher than those recorded by the dfo database from 2018 to 2020 the em dat database presented an increase in the frequency of floods with the number of flood events recorded by the em dat in 2019 and 2020 much higher than those in the dfo database fig 7a fig 7b shows the temporal variation of flood affected areas from 2001 to 2020 in both databases compared with the em dat database dfo presents considerably larger flood affected areas than em dat thanks to its more detailed documentation of flood events several limitations in our analysis need to be acknowledged to determine the impact of flood events on vegetation we mainly rely on dfo products despite the high quality records provided by dfo incomplete flood event records in the database might introduce uncertainties in addition flood hazards are complex in nature and discretization in space and time with vegetation distribution also having temporal periodicity and spatial uncertainty therefore we cannot perfectly control the experimental variables and errors when estimating the impact area of floods on vegetation which may lead to a certain level of under overestimation of the impact of floods on vegetation future efforts are encouraged to take advantage of various remote sensing data and deep learning based change detection algorithms to obtain more accurate flood inundation ranges durations and other critical information wang et al 2020a xu et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 the leverage of big earth data and the application of advanced analytical methods potentially benefits the extraction of indices e g vegetation greenness and productivity in the submerged area before and after flood events this would provide essential information for quantifying flood damages to vegetation more accurately 5 conclusions this study aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the impact of floods on vegetation at the global national regional scale with a focus on understanding the temporal trends and spatial distribution characteristics over the past 20 years 2001 2020 it represents the first study to evaluate the impact of floods on vegetation at a global scale incorporating information such as start and end dates duration severity magnitude and affected area of 3325 flood events and spatially matching them with global land cover products we also employ a kernel density analysis on the centroid points of these flood events and use the moving average method to calculate the annual moving average curve of the flood affected area through these methods we assess the severity and magnitude of flood occurrences reveal the long term trends in areas impacted by floods and identify the clustering patterns of flood events the results suggest an increasing trend in the number affected area severity and magnitude of extreme flood events with a shift towards medium and high intensity events the majority of flood events occur in the 10 s 50 n latitude range with strong spatial clustering observed in seven regions worldwide the high proportion of flood affected areas covered by vegetation highlights the serious threat posed by flood hazards to terrestrial ecosystems emphasizing the need for further research on flood damage to vegetation at a global scale this study s findings underscore the urgency of effective flood control management measures to mitigate and adapt to the impact of extreme flood events on natural ecosystems urging governments and relevant organizations to take positive and effective actions to prevent and resolve

1822,cadmium cd is a toxic trace element that threatens ecosystem and human health worldwide quantitative understanding of land to river cd fluxes and riverine cd loads in response to various watershed management measures is essential for developing effective mitigation strategies for large river systems however detailed analyses of watershed cd dynamics under different management scenarios are lacking here we investigated the effects of four management scenarios by combining point and nonpoint source control measures with a previously developed watershed cd model that was validated with site specific measurements the soil and water assessment tool heavy metal swat hm model was applied to simulate the xiang river basin s xrb 90 000 km2 baseline hydrology soil erosion and cd transport processes in china using scenario simulations we found that smelting emissions reduction was the most influential measure for controlling dissolved cd dcd and particulate cd pcd loads at the basin scale elimination of 50 emissions from the smelting sector could significantly p 0 05 decrease the monthly mean loads of dcd from 940 to 720 kg and of pcd from 2150 to 1760 kg at the xrb outlet in contrast reduction in mining emissions had no influence on the cd load at the xrb outlet because most mining cd emissions occurred upstream and midstream of the xrb and the natural attenuation processes in the river limit the transportation of cd downstream the effectiveness of management practices for reducing total cd tcd and dcd loads was not always mutually beneficial for example soil erosion control may decrease the pcd flux via erosion but increase the subsurface dcd flux to rivers due to greater lateral flow in addition increasing soil ph could be a practical and effective measure to reduce nonpoint dcd and pcd fluxes such effects may be caused by the declined upward migration of cd through soil evaporation owing to the decreased cd concentration in the soil pore water after ph increases in conclusion effective watershed management of cd pollution in large basins requires an integrated plan that combines multiple mitigation measures strategic modeling experiments could provide valuable insights into the design of such plans keywords xiang river basin cadmium loads scenario analysis nonpoint source pollution industrial point emission watershed management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cadmium cd classified as a group 1 human carcinogen iarc 2018 is a global threat to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and human health kubier et al 2019 satarug et al 2003 satarug et al 2017 who 2010 industrial e g mining and smelting and agricultural e g phosphate fertilizers activities have discharged a large amount of cd into soils and water worldwide including in europe and china nziguheba and smolders 2008 shi et al 2019 ulrich 2019 human activities have increased soil cd concentrations by approximately 0 1 0 3 mg cd kg 1 above pre industrial levels smolders and mertens 2013 the long term dietary intake of cd at elevated levels can lead to serious health problems such as the itai itai disease that occurred in japan in the 1950s aoshima 2016 a 2014 national soil survey in china showed that cd is the most serious contaminant accounting for 43 of all soil quality exceedances mepprc 2014 in addition millions of hectares of agricultural land in china are now being removed from production due to cd pollution hou and li 2017 moreover soil cd concentrations continue to increase despite stricter environmental protection regulations hu et al 2016 according to a meta analysis of the global evaluation of heavy metal pollution in surface water china reported the most pollution sites of heavy metals followed by india and other developing countries kumar et al 2019 china s river basins have experienced extensive metal pollution over the past decades with the xiang river basin 90 000 km2 being the most polluted the issue of cd pollution in soil water sediment and rice in the xrb has attracted substantial attention han et al 2014 li et al 2018 williams et al 2009 zhang et al 2008 in 2011 the chinese central government approved the xiang river basin control plan for heavy metal pollution hereafter xrb plan to combat severe heavy metal pollution https www gov cn gzdt 2011 07 23 content 1912271 htm this ambitious xrb plan declared as the chinese rhine project invested up to 59 5 billion rmb 9 8 billion us dollars and focused mainly on the industrial sectors to reach the 50 target of metal emission reduction by 2015 from the 2008 level hu et al 2014 however river pollution mitigation requires holistic accounting for both point and nonpoint diffuse sources point emissions such as zn cd smelters have been stopped in numerous places however residual soil cd contamination remains e g zhou et al 2020b recent studies in uk mined watersheds have demonstrated that the remediation of point sources of metals could be less efficient because of the greater importance of untreated diffuse sources under extremely low flows groundwater from underground mine workings byrne et al 2020 and extremely high flows runoff from surface mine wastes jarvis et al 2019 elevated soil cd concentrations have been reported in many mining areas of the xrb e g lei et al 2015 moreover it has long been acknowledged that soil acidification can contribute to increased cd mobility and loss in soil e g kici≈Ñska et al 2022 therefore a quantitative understanding of land to river cd fluxes and riverine cd loads in response to different watershed management measures is vital for developing effective mitigation strategies in large scale complex river networks such as the xiang river system numerical models are valuable tools for developing remediation strategies nair et al 2022 xie et al 2015 zhuang et al 2016 several watershed scale heavy metal models with various levels of complexity have been developed to address these challenges including trex velleux et al 2008 inca metals whitehead et al 2009 swat hm meng et al 2018 ecomag hm motovilov and fashchevskaya 2019 and topkapi eth sui et al 2022 generally two main categories of processes contaminant transformation and transport are considered in the watershed scale metal fate and transport models contaminant transport commonly consists of three processes 1 overland hydrological processes 2 soil erosion and sediment transport and 3 in stream processes according to the temporal scales the models can be divided into event driven and continuous models for example trex is mainly an event model that can simulate the fate and transport of metals during a single rainfall event at the watershed scale velleux et al 2008 the ecomag hm does not include a sediment component and is inapplicable to erosion prone areas motovilov and fashchevskaya 2019 the topkapi eth is a fully distributed model that divides the watershed and sub basins into hydraulically connected grid cells to depict detailed cell to cell transport sui et al 2022 however owing to the computational burden and high demand for data the application of topkapi eth to large scale basins such as the xrb is limited in contrast models such as inca metals and swat hm are semi distributed continuous models with reasonable model structural complexity which enable them to analyze the long term effects of hydrological changes and water management practices in this study we chose swat hm because the swat component is a widely used nonpoint source hydrologic model with an open source code making it amenable to coupling with other models and expanding the model representation of different environmental management scenarios watershed models have been widely used for scenario analyses to assess the best management practices for sediment nitrogen and phosphorus load mitigation hunt et al 2019 kast et al 2021 shen et al 2015 thus far only a few watershed scale hm models have been used to evaluate the impacts of mitigation practices jiao et al 2014 for example whitehead et al 2009 examined the effects of mine restoration on downstream metal loads but were limited to point source cleanup scenarios nonpoint source control measures have rarely been considered in the evaluation of watershed management plans although many studies have suggested that nonpoint pathways play an important role in watershed scale metal transport for instance liu et al 2019 reported that soil conservation projects have reduced the lateral transport of heavy metals by 56 in the loess plateau over the past two decades moreover field experiments have shown that liming can effectively increase soil ph and reduce cd mobility and bioavailability in agricultural lands holland et al 2018 to the best of our knowledge a detailed investigation of watershed cd dynamics under different management scenarios particularly for large scale river systems with various point and nonpoint sources is lacking thus the overall aim of this study was to demonstrate how a watershed scale hm model can be used to assess the sensitivity of different management scenarios to land to river cd fluxes and riverine cd loads at various spatiotemporal scales and to develop a feasible and desirable watershed management plan for achieving water quality targets in the xrb the results of this study support the development of numerical models of cd fate and transport in large river basins and offer critical insights into the potential impacts of different cd pollution reduction strategies on water quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the xiang river basin e 110 30 114 15 n 24 38 28 39 is one of the seven major tributaries of the yangtze river located in south central china spanning over 9400 km2 with a length of 948 km fig 1 a the main stream of the xiang river flows from south to north and drains into dongting lake of the yangtze river system the xiang river can be divided into three main sections the upper section from the headstream to lapbutou the middle section from lapbutou to hengyang and the lower section from hengyang to the outlet dongting lake the major tributaries include the guan chonglin zheng lei mi juan lu lian liuyang laodao and wei rivers fig 1b in the xrb the elevation decreases from south to north varying from 2092 m to 7 m the basin is of a subtropical humid monsoon climate with an annual precipitation of 1400 mm mainly concentrated between april september 70 the main landuses of xrb are forests frst 62 1 paddy fields rice 20 8 agricultural land agrl 8 6 pasture past 4 0 and urban areas 1 7 fig 1c the river receives massive cd loads from both point e g industrial emissions and diffuse sources e g land runoff and erosion in a previous study zhou et al 2023 we estimated that intensive industrial activities discharged approximately 20 000 kg yr 1 of cd into the xiang river during 2000 2015 among them mining and processing of nonferrous metal ores hereafter referred to as mining and smelting and pressing of nonferrous metals hereafter referred to as smelting are two main polluters accounting for 93 of the total industrial cd emissions additionally many years of historical mining in the xrb have left abandoned mining waste that contributes metal loads to the xiang river via diffuse processes elevated cd concentrations in soils can also be transported to rivers through hydrological processes and soil erosion in general the xrb is representative of many industrialized river basins around the world with point and diffuse sources 2 2 watershed scale cd model in our model development paper zhou et al 2023 the swat hm model for the xrb was developed to quantify the flow sediment and dissolved cd dcd and particulate cd pcd fluxes in both the land and river phases of the xrb between 2000 and 2015 as discussed in zhou et al 2023 and illustrated in fig 2 the swat hm which combines a heavy metal transport and transformation module with the well established swat model arnold et al 1998 is a semi distributed process based model for simulating terrestrial metal delivery and riverine metal dynamics the swat model requires digital elevation model dem land use soil types and observed meteorological and hydrological and sediment data to run point sources e g industrial and municipal metal loads and nonpoint sources e g soil metal concentrations data are two main inputs for the hm module the original version of swat hm was developed by meng et al 2018 with a metal transformation module of three phase dissolved labile and non labile metal species equilibrium partitioning and kinetic reactions however detailed observations of labile and non labile metal species in soils are usually not available especially in large scale applications such as xrb the current version was thus modified by simplifying the metal transformation scheme in which solid labile and non labile metals are regarded together as particulate metals this modification maintains a reasonable model structural complexity while considerably minimizing the data requirements the data requirement of swat hm was summarized in table 1 of zhou et al 2023 with a detailed description in zhou et al 2023 si text s1 the model was run for extra two years a warm up period of 1998 1999 to equilibrate to steady state conditions to capture more detailed cd transport processes and facilitate management scenario analysis the xrb was divided into 1118 sub basins and 23 363 hydrologic response units hrus with the smallest spatial discretization of zero thresholds for land use soil and slope in each sub basin prior to this work parameters have been carefully constrained using multiple field measurements with a 2 step procedure zhou et al 2023 as a first step swat cup was used to calibrate and validate parameters related to hydrological and sediment processes abbaspour 2015 to investigate the intrinsic model performance and model defects five parameters pertaining to metal dynamics were deliberately not calibrated but were instead obtained from field measurements and the literature han et al 2014 meng et al 2018 qin et al 2012 zhou et al 2020a the model was validated against long term historical observations of monthly streamflow and sediment load and cd concentrations at 42 4380 data points 11 1183 data points and 10 600 data points gauges respectively as detailed in zhou et al 2023 sections 2 3 and 3 1 the model accuracy was evaluated using both statistical the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias and graphical scatter plots analyses for streamflow the mean of r2 and nse were 0 84 and 0 75 with the pbias ranging from 34 4 to 48 8 for the sediment load the r 2 and nse averaged 0 57 and 0 42 with a pbias of 61 7 to 39 3 approximately 92 0 of the simulated cd values were within the 5 fold range of the measured concentrations indicating that the swat hm model was successfully applied to the xrb the key components of the swat hm are introduced below for further information on model description and model development in the xrb see meng et al 2018 zhou et al 2020a zhou et al 2023 in swat surface runoff sr was estimated using the scs curve number method by eq 1 1 sr r i 2 r i s where r is the rainfall for the day i is the initial abstraction which includes surface storage interception and infiltration prior to runoff and s is the retention parameter which is a function of the curve number cn for the day eq 2 2 s 25 4 1000 cn 10 where cn is a function of the soil permeability land use and antecedent soil water conditions cn 2 was defined as the curve number for moisture condition ii

pollution control were proposed to mitigate cd pollution table 1 as detailed below management measures are represented in model simulations by changing the corresponding model inputs or parameter values to depict the changes in watershed processes and water quality responses industrial point source control is the major management measure in the xrb among which the mining and smelting sectors are the two main polluters scenarios s1 1 s1 5 and s2 1 s2 5 represent the reduction of mining and smelting cd emissions respectively by various percentages 10 20 30 40 and 50 metal industrial emissions should be reduced by 50 according to the xrb plan which defined targets of 10 20 30 40 and 50 as an approximation in the model the same elimination rate is evenly applied to the enterprises in the study area which is deemed realistic because regulation driven by a regional environmental authority is usually implemented by a uniform requirement for all enterprises nonetheless a uniform elimination rate across different enterprises will have different effects because of the location and hence hydrological connectivity disparities scenarios 3 1 3 5 consist of soil erosion control measures in swat terracing contour farming and strip cropping are built in management operations for soil conservation for example the adoption of contour farming permits the reduction of surface runoff by impounding water in small depressions and reduces soil erosion by reducing the erosive power of surface runoff arabi et al 2007 to represent contouring practice the scs curve number for moisture condition ii cn 2 and usle practice factor usle p were modified in scenario 3 1 3 5 the improvement in water infiltration was represented by reducing the calibrated cn2 value by 1 2 3 4 and 5 units in addition the usle p factor which represents the ratio of soil loss by a support practice to that of straight row farming up and down the slope was reduced by 10 20 30 40 and 50 the adjustment values for cn 2 and usle p were within the ranges suggested by tuppad et al 2010 scenarios 4 1 4 5 correspond to the implementation of soil remediation measures to increase the soil ph soil ph is the most prominent factor affecting metal partitioning in acidic soil to control the mobility and bioavailability of metals to control soil ph lime cao or ca oh 2 soda ash sodium carbonate na2co3 sodium hydroxide and to a lesser extent magnesium hydroxide are most commonly used liming to increase soil ph is an effective and economical option zhu et al 2016 therefore we derived scenarios 4 1 4 5 by simply increasing soil ph by 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 unit respectively the increase in cap by 0 5 was deemed practically attainable for example the application of 7 5 t ha 1 caco3 could increase soil ph from 5 5 to 6 5 at paddy sites chen et al 2018 the baseline scenario s0 represents the reference condition of watershed processes using calibrated parameters and default inputs zhou et al 2023 all scenarios including the baseline scenario were simulated using 16 year historical climate records from 2000 to 2015 given the spatial variability of cd loads management practices were implemented at priority sites within the watershed since the xrb plan was approved in 2011 and started in 2012 we identified 196 river sections fig 3 a where the monthly tcd concentration in 2012 2015 exceeded the class iii 1 0 Œºg l 1 of the environmental quality standard for surface water gb 3838 2002 furthermore 344 upstream sub basins fig 3b of these polluted river sections were selected as priority management areas finally 6 955 hrus fig 3c with 6 specific land uses forests frst paddy fields rice agricultural land agrl orchard orcd pasture past and barren land swrn were selected as management areas for nonpoint source control i e soil erosion control s3 1 3 5 and soil ph elevation s4 1 4 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 river sections exceeding the water quality standards first we investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of cd concentrations in the xiang river system based on the baseline model validated with site specific measurement fig 4 a displays the river sections where the monthly mean concentrations of tcd exceeded the water quality standard gb3838 2002 of 1 0 Œºg l 1 for the up mid and downstream regions in general the exceedance frequency increased first and then declined from 2000 to 2015 the midstream has the highest exceeding rates ranging from 5 4 to 15 9 with upstream and downstream having a range of 0 6 7 9 and 1 2 10 7 respectively in fig 4b a spatial analysis revealed that most river sections with high exceeding frequency 75 were clustered in the southeast of the xrb part of the midstream region in fig 1 because of the high mining emissions and low dilution capacity furthermore we compared the point cd fluxes industrial emissions and nonpoint cd fluxes surface runoff lateral flow soil erosion between the non exceeding and exceeding river sections the comparison was made at both the sub basin and upstream basin level since riverine cd loads originate from both upstream channels and sub basins at the sub basin level the exceeding river sections red dots in fig 4c occurred under large ranges of point and nonpoint cd fluxes which showed no obvious difference from the non exceeding river sections blue dots in fig 4c in contrast the accumulative point and nonpoint cd fluxes of the upstream sub basins were also compared at the upstream basin level the exceeding river sections red dots in fig 4d were generally clustered in the region of large point nonpoint ratios indicating the dominant role of industrial emissions on riverine cd load fig 4d for example sub basin outlet 164 fig 4b is located at the downstream of qing shui tang industrial district which is the largest industrial district in xrb and contributes 21 7 of the total industrial cd emissions between 2000 and 2015 zhou et al 2023 however there also exist some exceeding river sections with small point cd input e g sub basin outlet 1056 in fig 4b indicating that nonpoint source cd input is more responsible for the exceedance 3 2 changes in land to river cd fluxes in different scenarios four management scenarios were compared with the baseline condition to evaluate their effectiveness on land to river fluxes in four main transport pathways industrial emissions surface runoff lateral flow and soil erosion fig 5 at the basin level both the emission reductions of the mining and smelting sectors could significantly p 0 01 reduce the industrial emissions with a range of 3 1 to 30 8 fig 5a the elimination of 50 of the smelting sector resulted in the most significant reduction 30 8 in industrial cd emissions while a 50 cut in the mining sector could reduce 15 4 of industrial cd emissions clearly soil conservation and soil remediation did not affect industrial cd emissions but significantly p 0 01 impacted other cd pathways changing the soil ph had a greater influence than soil erosion control on cd fluxes in both surface runoff and lateral flow fig 5b c increasing soil ph by 0 5 units could reduce surface runoff and lateral flow of cd fluxes by 20 9 and 21 7 interestingly controlling soil erosion could increase the cd flux to the river through lateral flow fig 5c this is because infiltration and soil water increase when surface runoff decreases leading to higher cd fluxes through lateral flow soil conservation such as terraces has long been acknowledged as an effective way to control runoff and increase soil moisture leading to a greater lateral flow camera et al 2012 stanchi et al 2012 in addition increasing the soil ph may reduce cd fluxes through soil erosion owing to the decreased cd concentration in the top soil layer fig 5d heavy metals in soil could move upward to the topsoil through evaporation induced capillary rise dold and fontbot√© 2001 lima et al 2014 however the decreased dissolved cd concentration in soil pore water resulting from the ph induced equilibrium shift limits the upward movement of cd to the topsoil such effects may be caused by the declined upward migration of cd through soil evaporation owing to the decreased cd concentration in the soil pore water after ph increases additionally the impact of climate change in this area is worth mentioning for example du et al 2013 combined the standardized precipitation index and mann kendall mk statistical test to investigate trends of dry and wet conditions in the study area during 1951 2007 they found xrb becomes drier in spring and autumn and wetter in summer and winter many studies have shown that the relative contribution of different source waters varies greatly under dry and wet conditions e g li et al 2017 zhi et al 2019 such a change in climate and hydrological regime may change the mechanism of metal delivery from the upland to the river thus the impacts of climate change should be evaluated to address the challenges posed by climate change on water quality improvement 3 3 changes of riverine cd loads for different scenarios in addition to the land to river cd fluxes we investigated riverine cd loads under four management scenarios in the xrb the reduction in tcd loads varied across the 1186 sub basin outlets fig 6 for mining control the sub basin outlets with high load reduction appear mainly in the upstream and midstream reaches especially in the southeast lei river fig 1 in contrast smelting control mainly reduced tcd in the midstream and downstream areas this is reasonable because most large scale smelting activities occur in urban areas of the xrb midstream and downstream soil erosion control is the only management measure that could increase the tcd load as a result of the net increase in land to river cd fluxes in some sub basins as a practical and effective measure changing increasing the soil ph resulted in a reduction in tcd ranging from 53 0 to 0 across the sub basins soil acidification occurs widely in chinese croplands owing to excessive nitrogen fertilization and acid precipitation guo et al 2010 zhu et al 2018 for example a 30 year field experiment in paddy soils of xrb found that mean topsoil ph declined by 0 94 units from the 1980s to 2014 at a mean rate of 0 031 units yr 1 zhu et al 2016 acidification can significantly alter the biogeochemistry of cd in agroecosystems a century lasting experiment at rothamsted experimental station has revealed that soil acidification to ph 4 mobilized 60 90 of total soil cd blake and goulding 2002 therefore agricultural land acidification should be prevented to minimize cd transport in the xrb liming to increase the soil ph reducing the application rate of chemical nitrogen fertilizers and increasing organic fertilizers such as manure could be preferentially implemented fig 7 shows the boxplots of the monthly dcd and pcd loads at three representative outlets outlets 1056 495 and 5 a paired sample t test was used to determine whether the management scenario differed from the baseline scenario s0 the upward pointing triangle below each boxplot indicated a significant difference at the level of 0 05 outlet 1056 fig 4b is the exceeding river section with a small proportion of upstream point source input the upstream sub basins of outlet 1056 cover approximately 213 km2 with 96 percent of them designated as nonpoint source control areas details in section 2 3 as a nonpoint dominated site it benefited from soil erosion control s3 1 3 5 and soil ph elevation s4 1 4 5 as evidenced by the significant reductions of both dcd and pcd fig 7a b the outlet of sub basin 495 fig 4b is the outlet of the lei river one of the major tributaries in southeast xrb for outlet 495 fig 7c d mining control scenarios 1 1 1 5 led to a decline in monthly mean dcd by 5 4 28 2 and in monthly mean pcd by 5 2 25 6 the simulation results for the entire xrb outlet outlet 5 in fig 4b indicated that maximal improvements were achieved when implementing emission control of smelting sectors scenarios 2 1 2 5 in fig 7e f for example scenario 2 5 could significantly p 0 05 decrease the monthly mean loads of dcd from 940 to 720 kg and of pcd from 2 150 to 1 760 kg it should be noted that soil conservation scenarios did not reduce the dcd and pcd at the entire xrb outlet fig 7e f 3 4 watershed scale cd budgets reveal the effectiveness of management measures owing to the unexpected results of the limited reduction of riverine cd loads under soil conservation scenarios we further examined the complete watershed average cd fluxes in both land and in stream phases as shown in fig 8 a the implementation of soil erosion control s3 1 3 5 decreased the pcd flux 5 328 to 981 kg yr 1 in soil erosion and slightly increased the dcd fluxes 15 65 kg yr 1 through surface and subsurface flow overall this resulted in a reduction in the total cd fluxes to the river however the riverine tcd load at the xrb outlet did not decrease as expected but increased slightly this is because the net retention settling resuspension of cd in the stream also decreased moreover the reduction in cd retention was greater than that in the land to river cd load therefore a quantitative understanding of the variable importance of point and nonpoint sources of pollution as well as the instream processes of metal attenuation and release is crucial for evaluating the effects of measures on downstream water quality it should be noted that although soil conservation measures do not benefit the riverine cd load they can curb the accumulation of cd in river sediments for example the time series of yearly mean cd concentration in the sediment of 196 polluted river sections showed that soil erosion control could reduce the cd accumulation in sediment at the end of 2015 by 0 1 15 2 under s3 1 s3 5 fig 8b a frequent occurrence of heavy floods was witnessed across the xrb du et al 2019 which may flush these sediment bound metals downstream during high flow events recent studies have analyzed the simulated climate extreme indices from 18 cmip6 models and found that all regions of china witnessed an increase in extreme precipitation zhu et al 2021 for example the areal mean 95th percentile precipitation would increase remarkably by 16 5 25 4 and 46 5 for the 1 5 2 and 3 c global warming levels respectively with respect to the reference period of 1985 2005 therefore modified or new strategies may be required to minimize the potential negative impacts of climate change for example on river sediment dynamics to meet future water quality targets 4 conclusions in this study we applied a process based watershed scale cd model within a scenario analysis framework to understand and evaluate the effects of different management practices on land to river cd fluxes and riverine cd loads in an industrialized river basin with both point and nonpoint source pollution based on our findings we recommend several key management measures for achieving water quality targets in river basins with cd pollution 1 effective remediation requires a comprehensive understanding of the relative contributions of metals from all important sources in a basin and that understanding must be based on spatially detailed quantification of metal loads in different pathways in addition both loads from the upstream channels and the corresponding sub basin should be considered furthermore it is important to consider the dynamics of metals in the river network because in stream processes may significantly affect the riverine metal load at the downstream outlets numerical models such as the swat hm can be valuable tools to simulate metal fate and transport in both land and river phases to develop remediation strategies 2 different management measures will yield diverse outcomes for example reducing the riverine cd load at the xrb outlet could be achieved by cutting the point source cd emissions from the smelting sector rather than the mining sector owing to their different spatial distributions controlling soil erosion may decrease the pcd flux into rivers while increasing the dcd flux thereby affecting the riverine cd load to a limited extent however controlling soil erosion could be an effective way to restrain heavy metal accumulation in river sediments in addition increasing the soil ph could be a practical and effective measure for reducing the nonpoint cd loads in nonpoint dominated sub basins 3 targeted remedial strategies should be implemented for water quality management of large river basins such as the xrb for example a zoning control scheme can be proposed that includes point source control areas nonpoint source control areas and mixed source control areas given that smelting and mining are the two major drivers of water quality deterioration in most parts of the xrb industrial emission reductions need to be maintained in addition soil remediation could be implemented by increasing soil ph in nonpoint and mixed source control areas moreover incorporating climate change considerations and assessing the proposed management scenarios for their climate vulnerabilities will build more resilience in confronting future conditions credit authorship contribution statement lingfeng zhou conceptualization methodology software writing

1822,cadmium cd is a toxic trace element that threatens ecosystem and human health worldwide quantitative understanding of land to river cd fluxes and riverine cd loads in response to various watershed management measures is essential for developing effective mitigation strategies for large river systems however detailed analyses of watershed cd dynamics under different management scenarios are lacking here we investigated the effects of four management scenarios by combining point and nonpoint source control measures with a previously developed watershed cd model that was validated with site specific measurements the soil and water assessment tool heavy metal swat hm model was applied to simulate the xiang river basin s xrb 90 000 km2 baseline hydrology soil erosion and cd transport processes in china using scenario simulations we found that smelting emissions reduction was the most influential measure for controlling dissolved cd dcd and particulate cd pcd loads at the basin scale elimination of 50 emissions from the smelting sector could significantly p 0 05 decrease the monthly mean loads of dcd from 940 to 720 kg and of pcd from 2150 to 1760 kg at the xrb outlet in contrast reduction in mining emissions had no influence on the cd load at the xrb outlet because most mining cd emissions occurred upstream and midstream of the xrb and the natural attenuation processes in the river limit the transportation of cd downstream the effectiveness of management practices for reducing total cd tcd and dcd loads was not always mutually beneficial for example soil erosion control may decrease the pcd flux via erosion but increase the subsurface dcd flux to rivers due to greater lateral flow in addition increasing soil ph could be a practical and effective measure to reduce nonpoint dcd and pcd fluxes such effects may be caused by the declined upward migration of cd through soil evaporation owing to the decreased cd concentration in the soil pore water after ph increases in conclusion effective watershed management of cd pollution in large basins requires an integrated plan that combines multiple mitigation measures strategic modeling experiments could provide valuable insights into the design of such plans keywords xiang river basin cadmium loads scenario analysis nonpoint source pollution industrial point emission watershed management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cadmium cd classified as a group 1 human carcinogen iarc 2018 is a global threat to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and human health kubier et al 2019 satarug et al 2003 satarug et al 2017 who 2010 industrial e g mining and smelting and agricultural e g phosphate fertilizers activities have discharged a large amount of cd into soils and water worldwide including in europe and china nziguheba and smolders 2008 shi et al 2019 ulrich 2019 human activities have increased soil cd concentrations by approximately 0 1 0 3 mg cd kg 1 above pre industrial levels smolders and mertens 2013 the long term dietary intake of cd at elevated levels can lead to serious health problems such as the itai itai disease that occurred in japan in the 1950s aoshima 2016 a 2014 national soil survey in china showed that cd is the most serious contaminant accounting for 43 of all soil quality exceedances mepprc 2014 in addition millions of hectares of agricultural land in china are now being removed from production due to cd pollution hou and li 2017 moreover soil cd concentrations continue to increase despite stricter environmental protection regulations hu et al 2016 according to a meta analysis of the global evaluation of heavy metal pollution in surface water china reported the most pollution sites of heavy metals followed by india and other developing countries kumar et al 2019 china s river basins have experienced extensive metal pollution over the past decades with the xiang river basin 90 000 km2 being the most polluted the issue of cd pollution in soil water sediment and rice in the xrb has attracted substantial attention han et al 2014 li et al 2018 williams et al 2009 zhang et al 2008 in 2011 the chinese central government approved the xiang river basin control plan for heavy metal pollution hereafter xrb plan to combat severe heavy metal pollution https www gov cn gzdt 2011 07 23 content 1912271 htm this ambitious xrb plan declared as the chinese rhine project invested up to 59 5 billion rmb 9 8 billion us dollars and focused mainly on the industrial sectors to reach the 50 target of metal emission reduction by 2015 from the 2008 level hu et al 2014 however river pollution mitigation requires holistic accounting for both point and nonpoint diffuse sources point emissions such as zn cd smelters have been stopped in numerous places however residual soil cd contamination remains e g zhou et al 2020b recent studies in uk mined watersheds have demonstrated that the remediation of point sources of metals could be less efficient because of the greater importance of untreated diffuse sources under extremely low flows groundwater from underground mine workings byrne et al 2020 and extremely high flows runoff from surface mine wastes jarvis et al 2019 elevated soil cd concentrations have been reported in many mining areas of the xrb e g lei et al 2015 moreover it has long been acknowledged that soil acidification can contribute to increased cd mobility and loss in soil e g kici≈Ñska et al 2022 therefore a quantitative understanding of land to river cd fluxes and riverine cd loads in response to different watershed management measures is vital for developing effective mitigation strategies in large scale complex river networks such as the xiang river system numerical models are valuable tools for developing remediation strategies nair et al 2022 xie et al 2015 zhuang et al 2016 several watershed scale heavy metal models with various levels of complexity have been developed to address these challenges including trex velleux et al 2008 inca metals whitehead et al 2009 swat hm meng et al 2018 ecomag hm motovilov and fashchevskaya 2019 and topkapi eth sui et al 2022 generally two main categories of processes contaminant transformation and transport are considered in the watershed scale metal fate and transport models contaminant transport commonly consists of three processes 1 overland hydrological processes 2 soil erosion and sediment transport and 3 in stream processes according to the temporal scales the models can be divided into event driven and continuous models for example trex is mainly an event model that can simulate the fate and transport of metals during a single rainfall event at the watershed scale velleux et al 2008 the ecomag hm does not include a sediment component and is inapplicable to erosion prone areas motovilov and fashchevskaya 2019 the topkapi eth is a fully distributed model that divides the watershed and sub basins into hydraulically connected grid cells to depict detailed cell to cell transport sui et al 2022 however owing to the computational burden and high demand for data the application of topkapi eth to large scale basins such as the xrb is limited in contrast models such as inca metals and swat hm are semi distributed continuous models with reasonable model structural complexity which enable them to analyze the long term effects of hydrological changes and water management practices in this study we chose swat hm because the swat component is a widely used nonpoint source hydrologic model with an open source code making it amenable to coupling with other models and expanding the model representation of different environmental management scenarios watershed models have been widely used for scenario analyses to assess the best management practices for sediment nitrogen and phosphorus load mitigation hunt et al 2019 kast et al 2021 shen et al 2015 thus far only a few watershed scale hm models have been used to evaluate the impacts of mitigation practices jiao et al 2014 for example whitehead et al 2009 examined the effects of mine restoration on downstream metal loads but were limited to point source cleanup scenarios nonpoint source control measures have rarely been considered in the evaluation of watershed management plans although many studies have suggested that nonpoint pathways play an important role in watershed scale metal transport for instance liu et al 2019 reported that soil conservation projects have reduced the lateral transport of heavy metals by 56 in the loess plateau over the past two decades moreover field experiments have shown that liming can effectively increase soil ph and reduce cd mobility and bioavailability in agricultural lands holland et al 2018 to the best of our knowledge a detailed investigation of watershed cd dynamics under different management scenarios particularly for large scale river systems with various point and nonpoint sources is lacking thus the overall aim of this study was to demonstrate how a watershed scale hm model can be used to assess the sensitivity of different management scenarios to land to river cd fluxes and riverine cd loads at various spatiotemporal scales and to develop a feasible and desirable watershed management plan for achieving water quality targets in the xrb the results of this study support the development of numerical models of cd fate and transport in large river basins and offer critical insights into the potential impacts of different cd pollution reduction strategies on water quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the xiang river basin e 110 30 114 15 n 24 38 28 39 is one of the seven major tributaries of the yangtze river located in south central china spanning over 9400 km2 with a length of 948 km fig 1 a the main stream of the xiang river flows from south to north and drains into dongting lake of the yangtze river system the xiang river can be divided into three main sections the upper section from the headstream to lapbutou the middle section from lapbutou to hengyang and the lower section from hengyang to the outlet dongting lake the major tributaries include the guan chonglin zheng lei mi juan lu lian liuyang laodao and wei rivers fig 1b in the xrb the elevation decreases from south to north varying from 2092 m to 7 m the basin is of a subtropical humid monsoon climate with an annual precipitation of 1400 mm mainly concentrated between april september 70 the main landuses of xrb are forests frst 62 1 paddy fields rice 20 8 agricultural land agrl 8 6 pasture past 4 0 and urban areas 1 7 fig 1c the river receives massive cd loads from both point e g industrial emissions and diffuse sources e g land runoff and erosion in a previous study zhou et al 2023 we estimated that intensive industrial activities discharged approximately 20 000 kg yr 1 of cd into the xiang river during 2000 2015 among them mining and processing of nonferrous metal ores hereafter referred to as mining and smelting and pressing of nonferrous metals hereafter referred to as smelting are two main polluters accounting for 93 of the total industrial cd emissions additionally many years of historical mining in the xrb have left abandoned mining waste that contributes metal loads to the xiang river via diffuse processes elevated cd concentrations in soils can also be transported to rivers through hydrological processes and soil erosion in general the xrb is representative of many industrialized river basins around the world with point and diffuse sources 2 2 watershed scale cd model in our model development paper zhou et al 2023 the swat hm model for the xrb was developed to quantify the flow sediment and dissolved cd dcd and particulate cd pcd fluxes in both the land and river phases of the xrb between 2000 and 2015 as discussed in zhou et al 2023 and illustrated in fig 2 the swat hm which combines a heavy metal transport and transformation module with the well established swat model arnold et al 1998 is a semi distributed process based model for simulating terrestrial metal delivery and riverine metal dynamics the swat model requires digital elevation model dem land use soil types and observed meteorological and hydrological and sediment data to run point sources e g industrial and municipal metal loads and nonpoint sources e g soil metal concentrations data are two main inputs for the hm module the original version of swat hm was developed by meng et al 2018 with a metal transformation module of three phase dissolved labile and non labile metal species equilibrium partitioning and kinetic reactions however detailed observations of labile and non labile metal species in soils are usually not available especially in large scale applications such as xrb the current version was thus modified by simplifying the metal transformation scheme in which solid labile and non labile metals are regarded together as particulate metals this modification maintains a reasonable model structural complexity while considerably minimizing the data requirements the data requirement of swat hm was summarized in table 1 of zhou et al 2023 with a detailed description in zhou et al 2023 si text s1 the model was run for extra two years a warm up period of 1998 1999 to equilibrate to steady state conditions to capture more detailed cd transport processes and facilitate management scenario analysis the xrb was divided into 1118 sub basins and 23 363 hydrologic response units hrus with the smallest spatial discretization of zero thresholds for land use soil and slope in each sub basin prior to this work parameters have been carefully constrained using multiple field measurements with a 2 step procedure zhou et al 2023 as a first step swat cup was used to calibrate and validate parameters related to hydrological and sediment processes abbaspour 2015 to investigate the intrinsic model performance and model defects five parameters pertaining to metal dynamics were deliberately not calibrated but were instead obtained from field measurements and the literature han et al 2014 meng et al 2018 qin et al 2012 zhou et al 2020a the model was validated against long term historical observations of monthly streamflow and sediment load and cd concentrations at 42 4380 data points 11 1183 data points and 10 600 data points gauges respectively as detailed in zhou et al 2023 sections 2 3 and 3 1 the model accuracy was evaluated using both statistical the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias and graphical scatter plots analyses for streamflow the mean of r2 and nse were 0 84 and 0 75 with the pbias ranging from 34 4 to 48 8 for the sediment load the r 2 and nse averaged 0 57 and 0 42 with a pbias of 61 7 to 39 3 approximately 92 0 of the simulated cd values were within the 5 fold range of the measured concentrations indicating that the swat hm model was successfully applied to the xrb the key components of the swat hm are introduced below for further information on model description and model development in the xrb see meng et al 2018 zhou et al 2020a zhou et al 2023 in swat surface runoff sr was estimated using the scs curve number method by eq 1 1 sr r i 2 r i s where r is the rainfall for the day i is the initial abstraction which includes surface storage interception and infiltration prior to runoff and s is the retention parameter which is a function of the curve number cn for the day eq 2 2 s 25 4 1000 cn 10 where cn is a function of the soil permeability land use and antecedent soil water conditions cn 2 was defined as the curve number for moisture condition ii

pollution control were proposed to mitigate cd pollution table 1 as detailed below management measures are represented in model simulations by changing the corresponding model inputs or parameter values to depict the changes in watershed processes and water quality responses industrial point source control is the major management measure in the xrb among which the mining and smelting sectors are the two main polluters scenarios s1 1 s1 5 and s2 1 s2 5 represent the reduction of mining and smelting cd emissions respectively by various percentages 10 20 30 40 and 50 metal industrial emissions should be reduced by 50 according to the xrb plan which defined targets of 10 20 30 40 and 50 as an approximation in the model the same elimination rate is evenly applied to the enterprises in the study area which is deemed realistic because regulation driven by a regional environmental authority is usually implemented by a uniform requirement for all enterprises nonetheless a uniform elimination rate across different enterprises will have different effects because of the location and hence hydrological connectivity disparities scenarios 3 1 3 5 consist of soil erosion control measures in swat terracing contour farming and strip cropping are built in management operations for soil conservation for example the adoption of contour farming permits the reduction of surface runoff by impounding water in small depressions and reduces soil erosion by reducing the erosive power of surface runoff arabi et al 2007 to represent contouring practice the scs curve number for moisture condition ii cn 2 and usle practice factor usle p were modified in scenario 3 1 3 5 the improvement in water infiltration was represented by reducing the calibrated cn2 value by 1 2 3 4 and 5 units in addition the usle p factor which represents the ratio of soil loss by a support practice to that of straight row farming up and down the slope was reduced by 10 20 30 40 and 50 the adjustment values for cn 2 and usle p were within the ranges suggested by tuppad et al 2010 scenarios 4 1 4 5 correspond to the implementation of soil remediation measures to increase the soil ph soil ph is the most prominent factor affecting metal partitioning in acidic soil to control the mobility and bioavailability of metals to control soil ph lime cao or ca oh 2 soda ash sodium carbonate na2co3 sodium hydroxide and to a lesser extent magnesium hydroxide are most commonly used liming to increase soil ph is an effective and economical option zhu et al 2016 therefore we derived scenarios 4 1 4 5 by simply increasing soil ph by 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 unit respectively the increase in cap by 0 5 was deemed practically attainable for example the application of 7 5 t ha 1 caco3 could increase soil ph from 5 5 to 6 5 at paddy sites chen et al 2018 the baseline scenario s0 represents the reference condition of watershed processes using calibrated parameters and default inputs zhou et al 2023 all scenarios including the baseline scenario were simulated using 16 year historical climate records from 2000 to 2015 given the spatial variability of cd loads management practices were implemented at priority sites within the watershed since the xrb plan was approved in 2011 and started in 2012 we identified 196 river sections fig 3 a where the monthly tcd concentration in 2012 2015 exceeded the class iii 1 0 Œºg l 1 of the environmental quality standard for surface water gb 3838 2002 furthermore 344 upstream sub basins fig 3b of these polluted river sections were selected as priority management areas finally 6 955 hrus fig 3c with 6 specific land uses forests frst paddy fields rice agricultural land agrl orchard orcd pasture past and barren land swrn were selected as management areas for nonpoint source control i e soil erosion control s3 1 3 5 and soil ph elevation s4 1 4 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 river sections exceeding the water quality standards first we investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of cd concentrations in the xiang river system based on the baseline model validated with site specific measurement fig 4 a displays the river sections where the monthly mean concentrations of tcd exceeded the water quality standard gb3838 2002 of 1 0 Œºg l 1 for the up mid and downstream regions in general the exceedance frequency increased first and then declined from 2000 to 2015 the midstream has the highest exceeding rates ranging from 5 4 to 15 9 with upstream and downstream having a range of 0 6 7 9 and 1 2 10 7 respectively in fig 4b a spatial analysis revealed that most river sections with high exceeding frequency 75 were clustered in the southeast of the xrb part of the midstream region in fig 1 because of the high mining emissions and low dilution capacity furthermore we compared the point cd fluxes industrial emissions and nonpoint cd fluxes surface runoff lateral flow soil erosion between the non exceeding and exceeding river sections the comparison was made at both the sub basin and upstream basin level since riverine cd loads originate from both upstream channels and sub basins at the sub basin level the exceeding river sections red dots in fig 4c occurred under large ranges of point and nonpoint cd fluxes which showed no obvious difference from the non exceeding river sections blue dots in fig 4c in contrast the accumulative point and nonpoint cd fluxes of the upstream sub basins were also compared at the upstream basin level the exceeding river sections red dots in fig 4d were generally clustered in the region of large point nonpoint ratios indicating the dominant role of industrial emissions on riverine cd load fig 4d for example sub basin outlet 164 fig 4b is located at the downstream of qing shui tang industrial district which is the largest industrial district in xrb and contributes 21 7 of the total industrial cd emissions between 2000 and 2015 zhou et al 2023 however there also exist some exceeding river sections with small point cd input e g sub basin outlet 1056 in fig 4b indicating that nonpoint source cd input is more responsible for the exceedance 3 2 changes in land to river cd fluxes in different scenarios four management scenarios were compared with the baseline condition to evaluate their effectiveness on land to river fluxes in four main transport pathways industrial emissions surface runoff lateral flow and soil erosion fig 5 at the basin level both the emission reductions of the mining and smelting sectors could significantly p 0 01 reduce the industrial emissions with a range of 3 1 to 30 8 fig 5a the elimination of 50 of the smelting sector resulted in the most significant reduction 30 8 in industrial cd emissions while a 50 cut in the mining sector could reduce 15 4 of industrial cd emissions clearly soil conservation and soil remediation did not affect industrial cd emissions but significantly p 0 01 impacted other cd pathways changing the soil ph had a greater influence than soil erosion control on cd fluxes in both surface runoff and lateral flow fig 5b c increasing soil ph by 0 5 units could reduce surface runoff and lateral flow of cd fluxes by 20 9 and 21 7 interestingly controlling soil erosion could increase the cd flux to the river through lateral flow fig 5c this is because infiltration and soil water increase when surface runoff decreases leading to higher cd fluxes through lateral flow soil conservation such as terraces has long been acknowledged as an effective way to control runoff and increase soil moisture leading to a greater lateral flow camera et al 2012 stanchi et al 2012 in addition increasing the soil ph may reduce cd fluxes through soil erosion owing to the decreased cd concentration in the top soil layer fig 5d heavy metals in soil could move upward to the topsoil through evaporation induced capillary rise dold and fontbot√© 2001 lima et al 2014 however the decreased dissolved cd concentration in soil pore water resulting from the ph induced equilibrium shift limits the upward movement of cd to the topsoil such effects may be caused by the declined upward migration of cd through soil evaporation owing to the decreased cd concentration in the soil pore water after ph increases additionally the impact of climate change in this area is worth mentioning for example du et al 2013 combined the standardized precipitation index and mann kendall mk statistical test to investigate trends of dry and wet conditions in the study area during 1951 2007 they found xrb becomes drier in spring and autumn and wetter in summer and winter many studies have shown that the relative contribution of different source waters varies greatly under dry and wet conditions e g li et al 2017 zhi et al 2019 such a change in climate and hydrological regime may change the mechanism of metal delivery from the upland to the river thus the impacts of climate change should be evaluated to address the challenges posed by climate change on water quality improvement 3 3 changes of riverine cd loads for different scenarios in addition to the land to river cd fluxes we investigated riverine cd loads under four management scenarios in the xrb the reduction in tcd loads varied across the 1186 sub basin outlets fig 6 for mining control the sub basin outlets with high load reduction appear mainly in the upstream and midstream reaches especially in the southeast lei river fig 1 in contrast smelting control mainly reduced tcd in the midstream and downstream areas this is reasonable because most large scale smelting activities occur in urban areas of the xrb midstream and downstream soil erosion control is the only management measure that could increase the tcd load as a result of the net increase in land to river cd fluxes in some sub basins as a practical and effective measure changing increasing the soil ph resulted in a reduction in tcd ranging from 53 0 to 0 across the sub basins soil acidification occurs widely in chinese croplands owing to excessive nitrogen fertilization and acid precipitation guo et al 2010 zhu et al 2018 for example a 30 year field experiment in paddy soils of xrb found that mean topsoil ph declined by 0 94 units from the 1980s to 2014 at a mean rate of 0 031 units yr 1 zhu et al 2016 acidification can significantly alter the biogeochemistry of cd in agroecosystems a century lasting experiment at rothamsted experimental station has revealed that soil acidification to ph 4 mobilized 60 90 of total soil cd blake and goulding 2002 therefore agricultural land acidification should be prevented to minimize cd transport in the xrb liming to increase the soil ph reducing the application rate of chemical nitrogen fertilizers and increasing organic fertilizers such as manure could be preferentially implemented fig 7 shows the boxplots of the monthly dcd and pcd loads at three representative outlets outlets 1056 495 and 5 a paired sample t test was used to determine whether the management scenario differed from the baseline scenario s0 the upward pointing triangle below each boxplot indicated a significant difference at the level of 0 05 outlet 1056 fig 4b is the exceeding river section with a small proportion of upstream point source input the upstream sub basins of outlet 1056 cover approximately 213 km2 with 96 percent of them designated as nonpoint source control areas details in section 2 3 as a nonpoint dominated site it benefited from soil erosion control s3 1 3 5 and soil ph elevation s4 1 4 5 as evidenced by the significant reductions of both dcd and pcd fig 7a b the outlet of sub basin 495 fig 4b is the outlet of the lei river one of the major tributaries in southeast xrb for outlet 495 fig 7c d mining control scenarios 1 1 1 5 led to a decline in monthly mean dcd by 5 4 28 2 and in monthly mean pcd by 5 2 25 6 the simulation results for the entire xrb outlet outlet 5 in fig 4b indicated that maximal improvements were achieved when implementing emission control of smelting sectors scenarios 2 1 2 5 in fig 7e f for example scenario 2 5 could significantly p 0 05 decrease the monthly mean loads of dcd from 940 to 720 kg and of pcd from 2 150 to 1 760 kg it should be noted that soil conservation scenarios did not reduce the dcd and pcd at the entire xrb outlet fig 7e f 3 4 watershed scale cd budgets reveal the effectiveness of management measures owing to the unexpected results of the limited reduction of riverine cd loads under soil conservation scenarios we further examined the complete watershed average cd fluxes in both land and in stream phases as shown in fig 8 a the implementation of soil erosion control s3 1 3 5 decreased the pcd flux 5 328 to 981 kg yr 1 in soil erosion and slightly increased the dcd fluxes 15 65 kg yr 1 through surface and subsurface flow overall this resulted in a reduction in the total cd fluxes to the river however the riverine tcd load at the xrb outlet did not decrease as expected but increased slightly this is because the net retention settling resuspension of cd in the stream also decreased moreover the reduction in cd retention was greater than that in the land to river cd load therefore a quantitative understanding of the variable importance of point and nonpoint sources of pollution as well as the instream processes of metal attenuation and release is crucial for evaluating the effects of measures on downstream water quality it should be noted that although soil conservation measures do not benefit the riverine cd load they can curb the accumulation of cd in river sediments for example the time series of yearly mean cd concentration in the sediment of 196 polluted river sections showed that soil erosion control could reduce the cd accumulation in sediment at the end of 2015 by 0 1 15 2 under s3 1 s3 5 fig 8b a frequent occurrence of heavy floods was witnessed across the xrb du et al 2019 which may flush these sediment bound metals downstream during high flow events recent studies have analyzed the simulated climate extreme indices from 18 cmip6 models and found that all regions of china witnessed an increase in extreme precipitation zhu et al 2021 for example the areal mean 95th percentile precipitation would increase remarkably by 16 5 25 4 and 46 5 for the 1 5 2 and 3 c global warming levels respectively with respect to the reference period of 1985 2005 therefore modified or new strategies may be required to minimize the potential negative impacts of climate change for example on river sediment dynamics to meet future water quality targets 4 conclusions in this study we applied a process based watershed scale cd model within a scenario analysis framework to understand and evaluate the effects of different management practices on land to river cd fluxes and riverine cd loads in an industrialized river basin with both point and nonpoint source pollution based on our findings we recommend several key management measures for achieving water quality targets in river basins with cd pollution 1 effective remediation requires a comprehensive understanding of the relative contributions of metals from all important sources in a basin and that understanding must be based on spatially detailed quantification of metal loads in different pathways in addition both loads from the upstream channels and the corresponding sub basin should be considered furthermore it is important to consider the dynamics of metals in the river network because in stream processes may significantly affect the riverine metal load at the downstream outlets numerical models such as the swat hm can be valuable tools to simulate metal fate and transport in both land and river phases to develop remediation strategies 2 different management measures will yield diverse outcomes for example reducing the riverine cd load at the xrb outlet could be achieved by cutting the point source cd emissions from the smelting sector rather than the mining sector owing to their different spatial distributions controlling soil erosion may decrease the pcd flux into rivers while increasing the dcd flux thereby affecting the riverine cd load to a limited extent however controlling soil erosion could be an effective way to restrain heavy metal accumulation in river sediments in addition increasing the soil ph could be a practical and effective measure for reducing the nonpoint cd loads in nonpoint dominated sub basins 3 targeted remedial strategies should be implemented for water quality management of large river basins such as the xrb for example a zoning control scheme can be proposed that includes point source control areas nonpoint source control areas and mixed source control areas given that smelting and mining are the two major drivers of water quality deterioration in most parts of the xrb industrial emission reductions need to be maintained in addition soil remediation could be implemented by increasing soil ph in nonpoint and mixed source control areas moreover incorporating climate change considerations and assessing the proposed management scenarios for their climate vulnerabilities will build more resilience in confronting future conditions credit authorship contribution statement lingfeng zhou conceptualization methodology software writing

1823,for more than 30 years the lower section of the bia≈Çy dunajec river poland has been regulated by grade control structures gcss despite the short length of the section and the uniform method of regulation varying dynamics have been observed in the longitudinal profile the study aimed to identify the morphometric parameters of the channel and the hydraulic parameters of the flow that determine this variability to establish whether the variability in the morphodynamics of a regulated river can be predicted in the longitudinal profile and over time the novelty of this study is that it recognizes not only the variations in the morphology of the regulated river in the longitudinal profile and cross sections but also the changing flow dynamics over the last 60 years for this purpose archival designing projects were used in this study from which five different flow models were prepared using these models adjustments of the river to the changes made were reconstructed the study showed that the stream power which is often used to predict fluvial processes in natural channels was not useful while evaluating the regulated river where both sediment supply and lateral connectivity with the valley are severely limited the varying dynamics of the river depended on the morphometrical parameters of the channel especially depth and the w d ratio the magnitude of erosion was also positively correlated with the distance between gcss interestingly varying morphodynamics in the river showed similarities to those before regulation formerly erosive sections showed a tendency toward erosion and the braiding depositional section showed a tendency toward lateral erosion and deposition the river is unstable and the hydraulic structures are destroyed at low flows contrary to the design assumptions a key factor that seems to complicate the predictability of the processes in regulated rivers is the supply of debris which is not only severely limited but also spatially and temporally variable keywords mountain river morphodynamics fluvial processes grade control structure stream power channel parameters data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the morphodynamics of rivers and streams in mountain massifs worldwide has undergone high anthropogenic alterations kondolf 1997 surian 2006 hajdukiewicz and wy≈ºga 2019 v√°zquez tarr√≠o et al 2019 korpak 2020 one of the primary reasons for these changes is hydrotechnical regulation which has been used for many decades wohl 2006 various river sections have been regulated several times in the past using different methods subsequent regulations are often a response to unforeseen changes attributable to earlier engineering works korpak 2018 kiss et al 2019 mountain river regulation with longitudinal structures resulted in the shortening of the river course and the narrowing and straightening of the channels what increased river transport capacity surian 1999 rinaldi 2003 korpak 2007 ≈°karpich et al 2013 the construction of dam debris dam or weir interrupted the continuity of the bedload transport and reduced the supply of material from the upper reaches of the channel pickup 1977 kondolf 1997 kiss et al 2011 these measures resulted in a strong deepening of channel beds simon and rinaldi 2006 korpak 2018 hajdukiewicz and wy≈ºga 2019 marchi et al 2019 ≈°karpich et al 2019 v√°zquez tarr√≠o et al 2019 the construction of grade control structures gcss formed of concrete wood or natural boulders was supposed to stop erosion by stabilizing mountain stream and river beds garc√≠a and lenzi 2013 korpak 2018 a sequence of gcss reduces the original channel gradient by creating an equilibrium slope between structures thus ensuring a balance between erosion and accumulation processes in a given section of the channel galia et al 2016 therefore the primary objective of gcss is not only to prevent further erosion but also to ensure the hydrodynamic balance of the river garc√≠a and lenzi 2013 studies conducted on channels with gcss have shown that these structures often interrupt the continuity of material transport especially that of coarser particles kostadinov and dragoviƒá 2010 insufficient sediment supply can cause deepening and narrowing of the channel formation of armour layer and coarsening of bed sediment simon and darby 2002 boix fayos et al 2007 castillo et al 2007 recking 2012 wohl et al 2013 casserly et al 2020 upstream of the gcss in sedimentary wedges deposition of material predominates boix fayos et al 2007 csiki and rhoads 2014 casserly et al 2020 although some studies note the potential for erosion to occur in these locations goodarzi et al 2012 guan et al 2015 korpak et al 2021 downstream of gcs scour holes are often created which have been the subject of much analysis lenzi et al 2003 mart√≠n vide and andreatta 2009 bernard et al 2019 the widespread use of grade control structures in the polish carpathians began in the 1980 s today this is one of the most common system of regulation in carpathian rivers and streams radecki pawlik 2013 channels changed as a result of various human interventions are characterized by a different morphology and dynamics than natural channels therefore it is necessary to thoroughly recognize their functioning there is a huge body of work in the literature that aims to identify fluvial system characteristics that are responsible for changes in river morphodynamics and river patterns candel et al 2021 bankfull discharge channel slope leopold and wolman 1957 median bed grain size carson 1984 bank strength eaton et al 2010 the width depth w d ratio leopold and wolman 1957 pickup 1976 bridge 1993 eaton et al 2010 and presence of vegetation nicholas 2013 ielpi et al 2022 have been identified as the major characteristics determining the river pattern while studying river dynamics the stream power which informs about river energy and its workability is often used it combines several key parameters taking into account their interdependencies bagnold 1968 many relationships have been observed between stream power and other characteristics of the fluvial system such as the river pattern knighton and nanson 1993 van den berg 1995 development of fluvial forms simons and richardson 1966 sediment transport bagnold 1977 and morphological effectiveness of floods magilligan 1992 stream power was used to determine the river s ability to erode or deposit sediment at different scales local bizzi and lerner 2015 regional kaushal et al 2020 jha et al 2022 and national marcinkowski et al 2022 research has also been carried out to establish a stream power threshold that distinguishes stable channels from unstable ones brookes 1987 stacey and rutherfurd 2007 analysis of the variability in stream power along the river course has shown that stream power does not decrease linearly but is highly dependent on local variations in the gradient knighton 1999 the aforementioned studies have primarily focused on natural rivers with an undisturbed flow regime and sediment transport studies considering the suitability of different parameters in the prediction of changes in the morphodynamics of regulated channels are scarce the few such studies available usually describe the influence of the mode of regulation or geometrical parameters of hydraulic structures on the morphodynamics of rivers for example the influence of the height of the grade control structures galia and ≈°karpich 2017 and the stage of their destruction galia et al 2016 on the scale of erosion and grain size parameters between them has been studied furthermore the influence of the construction type of grade control structures on the location of scour zones has been analyzed korpak et al 2021 these studies mostly describe the cumulative changes over a long time after the river has been regulated especially changes in the channel morphology there is a lack of studies analyzing the gradual changes over time in both morphology and flow dynamics such analysis are rare because it is difficult to obtain data reflecting the morphodynamics of the river in a given section before the creation of the regulation after its creation and after a longer period of its operation this research aimed to partially fill this knowledge gap the research was conducted on the bia≈Çy dunajec river which is perfectly suited for such analysis the river has been regulated many times in the past and the successive stages of regulation have extensive documentation including archival maps cross sections and profiles showing the state of the channel prior to individual engineering works these factors were used in the creation of hydrodynamic models thanks to which not only the morphology but also the dynamics of the flow at different times was recognized the aim of the study was to determine changes in the morphodynamics of a regulated river in the longitudinal profile and over time the morphometric parameters of the channel and the hydraulic parameters of the flow that influence this variability were identified in particular attention was paid to the stream power which in natural rivers is used to assess morphodynamic changes an additional aim was to determine whether and how a mountain river adapts in the long term to the channel parameters imposed by regulation this aim deals with the effectiveness durability and reasonableness of regulating a mountain river the results of our research will help to interpret the dynamics and predict the evolution of a river heavily altered by multiple regulation this is very important for the proper maintenance of rivers and for ensuring their good ecological conditions brierley and fryirs 2005 therefore our research should be of widespread interest for fluvial geomorphologists hydraulic engineers river managers and designers 2 study area this research was conducted in the carpathian bia≈Çy dunajec river central europe poland which is 35 km long it originates in the tatra mountains at an altitude of 2004 m a s l and joins the dunajec river in the city of nowy targ 580 m a s l fig 1 a the studied catchment is characterized by different lithologies crystalline rocks dominate in the tatra mountains whereas flysch sandstone and shale limestone and marl dominate in the lower part of the catchment the fluvial material consists primarily of granite gravels and cobbles with admixtures of sandstone and shale climatic conditions in the catchment are highly variable the average annual temperature ranges from 0 8 c in the tatra mountains to 5 3 c in the city of nowy targ and the average annual precipitation ranges from 1610 mm to 760 mm respectively hess 1965 the climatic conditions high location of the catchment elongated shape and high gradients have made the regime of the bia≈Çy dunajec river high mountainous characterized by a quick flood wave buildup and extremely violent course of flood events detailed surveys were conducted in the lower section of the bia≈Çy dunajec river from 3 2 to 0 9 river km r km located in the orawsko nowotarska basin in the city of nowy targ the nearest gauging station is located in szaflary at 7 23 r km fig 1a there are no major tributaries between the study section and the gauging station and the catchment increase is only 6 25 the mean annual flow is 5 7 m3 s 1 designing project no 2064 the maximum annual high flows occur during summer months and as much as 70 of them occurred in june and july in the period of 1961 2020 the largest flood event in the period of 1961 2019 occurred in 1997 fig 2 with a value close to q100 480 m3 s 1 100 year discharge recurrence interval other floods larger than q2 92 m3 s 1 2 year recurrence interval occurred 29 times with as many as 25 of them not exceeding q5 190 m3 s 1 a noticeable increase in the frequency of floods has been observed recently with a recurrence interval varying between 2 and 5 years the lower part of the bia≈Çy dunajec river has undergone many engineering interventions in the past currently it is regulated using a grade control system consisting of 12 concrete structures fig 1b and 3 the section of the river from gcs 12 to gcs 2 was analyzed in detail the section downstream of gcs 2 was excluded from the analysis due to insufficient archival documentation of engineering works 2 1 engineering works in 1962 2019 in 1962 the studied section of the bia≈Çy dunajec river was almost natural wide and braiding the only technical regulation made to it was concentrating the flow with longitudinal structures below 1 1 r km designing project no 3963 more detail are provided at section 3 2 fig 4 at the end of the 1960 s bank protection was established in several places and a single thread channel was created by closing the side branches fig 4 the aim of these interventions was protecting the right bank against erosion where there was a small sports airport fig 4 in 1970 the channel was therefore already much narrower below 2 5 r km fig 4 without side branches designing project nos 3964 and 2220 the new regulatory route was heavily covered with sediment transported from the upper braiding section making it difficult to maintain and generating flood risks then in 1971 the regulation using groynes was carried out covering the section from 2 3 to 5 2 r km designing project no 3964 fig 4 the channel in this section was significantly narrowed this regulation resulted in intensive erosion and as a result bank reinforcements and side channel closures made in the 1960 s below 2 3 r km were destroyed korpak 2020 erosion of the banks and deposition of the bars again began fig 4 at that time there were also levees on both banks below the bridge that still function today designing project no 4170 fig 4 in 1979 the regulation with a grade control system was started in the section from 3 2 r km to the mouth designing project no 101 the design assumed the construction of 11 gcss from 12 to 2 with a height of 1 m which were made of concrete the stilling basins of the gcss were 0 8 m deep the planned channel gradient between gcss was 0 004 m m 1 a three part cross section of the channel with a total width of 50 m was designed in the middle part of the cross section the channel bed was 20 m wide whereas the side parts of the bottom 15 m wide were profiled with a slope of 1 15 biological development of the channel banks was also planned calculations showed that this regulation will ensure proper operation of gcss at the q20 flow and no sediment transport for sediment with a diameter larger than or equal to d50 0 074 m at the q10 flow according to design calculations the diameter of the paving layer d 0 112 m should be stable even at the q100 flow engineering works lasted as long as 6 years as many difficulties were encountered during the implementation of the project during the 1980 and 1983 floods gcs 12 was damaged twice and the river bypassed the regulatory route returning to its former channel designing project no 152 in 1983 reasons for failures in the implementation of the project were analyzed many irregularities and inconsistencies between the execution and the design were found improper location of the gcss in the longitudinal profile the maximum offset was 31 m differences in gcs heights from 0 62 m to 1 03 m differences in channel gradients from 0 0026 to 0 0092 m m 1 and no planned bank protection by vegetation between the gcss the average distance between gcss was 238 m but it was quite varied the smallest distance between gcss 11 and 10 was 169 m whereas the largest distance between gcss 3 and 2 was 505 m in response to these irregularities vegetation on the channel banks was planned in july 1986 an inventory of the completed regulation was conducted which showed a continued lack of vegetation along the banks and local erosion and deposition problems designing project no 4170 fig 4 on may 23 1987 a large flood occurred fig 2 which caused extensive damage to the recently constructed regulatory route especially between gcss 12 and 6 fig 4 surveys carried out in october 1987 showed damage to the banks and end sills designing project no 4170 the total area of the bars was about 5 5 times larger than that before the flood in 2019 the gcss were in a fairly good condition after 33 years of operation fig 3 a old bank reinforcements were visible on most of the river banks in a few places especially between gcss 6 and 3 the reinforcements were being repaired after the 2018 flood fig 3d unfortunately the exact extent and effect of these works were impossible to reconstruct there are two weirs upstream of the surveyed section of the river at 6 3 and 5 5 r km the first with a water intake for the city of nowy targ is 5 1 m high and was built in the 1960 s the second with a small water power station is 5 0 m high and was built in 2000 these weirs have changed the conditions for water flow and sediment transport in the river downstream of them however their distance from the section under consideration is large enough not to directly affect its morphodynamic 3 materials and methods 3 1 fieldwork the contemporary morphology of the channel was determined during fieldwork in october 2019 a mapping of the channel was carried out in which fluvial forms bars and cutbanks and grade control structures in the surveyed section were located and measured using a measuring tape and a gps device in parallel with the mapping 22 cross sections of the channel were made each cross section had its beginning and end on the boundary between the channel edge and the floodplain and included all bars both vegetated and non vegetated the boundary between the channel edge and the floodplain was easy to define due to the regular trapezoidal shape of the regulatory channel two cross sections were made in each reach between the gcss one was located in close proximity average 35 7 m 14 8 m to the end sill of a gcs and the other in close proximity average 31 4 m 15 8 m to the crest of the next gcs an additional two cross sections were made in the longest reach between gcss 3 and 2 fig 5 grain size analysis were carried out using the sieve method samples were collected from the central part of gravel bars one sample was taken in each reach between gcss and two samples were taken only in the longest reach between gcss 3 and 2 fig 5 there was no bar between gcss 7 and 6 hence no sample was taken in this reach samples were extracted from an approximately 1 m2 area from a depth not lower than twice the maximum diameter of grains found on a given bar diplas and fripp 1992 typically the depth was 0 5 1 0 m a single sample weighed an average of 163 9 kg 21 0 kg the collected material was sieved through seven sieves with the following mesh sizes 12 8 6 4 2 1 and 0 5 mm and weighed in the field using a spring scale grains smaller than 0 5 mm were subjected to further sieve analysis under laboratory conditions gradation curves were generated and used to identify characteristic diameters d5 d16 d50 d84 and d90 m the sorting index si was also calculated as follows folk and ward 1957 si œï84 œï16 4 œï95 œï5 6 6 the percentiles in the above formula are expressed in œï units thus it is necessary to convert meters into œï units using the following formula œï 3 322 lg d 3 2 historical analysis the history of the regulation and changes in the channel morphology were reconstructed based on documents from the cracow s regional water management authority using designing projects expert reports etc from 1962 1968 1969 1977 1983 1986 1987 and 2003 designing projects nos 3963 3964 2220 101 152 4170 and 2064 these materials provide an extremely valuable source of information on the condition of the channel and stages of its progressive regulation during various periods the projects of 1962 1977 1986 and 1987 contain full documentation in the form of channel maps longitudinal profiles and cross sections as well as technical descriptions data from these projects was used to create hydraulic models and conduct detailed analysis documentation from the other projects was incomplete but still helpful in creating a description of the regulatory work and its morphological effects the 1962 project unfortunately covers a shorter section of the channel from 2 3 to 0 9 r km however it was also included in the analysis as it shows an almost natural channel with only minor hydraulic engineering interventions additionally an archival aerial photograph from 1977 was used which allowed for a more accurate recognition of the channel morphology at that time the photograph was brought to a uniform scale of 1 10 000 using polish coordinate system puwg1992 rectification of this aerial photo and archival channel maps was carried out using the affine method with about 100 adjustment points in each case the points were selected so that their distance from the river channel was not large based on the position deviations the root mean square error rmse was determined which did not exceed 2 m analysis of the above mentioned archival materials led to the distinction of sections of the channel with a dominant fluvial process incision lateral erosion or deposition in 1962 and 1977 the assumption was made that one can identify the character of the channel dynamics on the basis of its characteristic features in a given section a similar assumption was used in many works krzemie≈Ñ 1999 sear et al 2003 korpak 2007 bizzi and lerner 2015 the dominance of the erosion process was evidenced by the lowering of the bed level evident on the cross sections and longitudinal profiles compared and the absence or small number and area of unvegetated bars evident on the archival maps the dominance of lateral erosion was evidenced by the shape of the cross section and the presence of cutbanks the dominance of deposition was evidenced by the rising of the bed level and the presence of a large number of unvegetated bars for the period 1986 2019 the dominant processes in the studied section of the channel were taken after the publication of korpak 2020 they were determined on the basis of analysis of designing projects from 1986 and 1987 field surveys in 2019 and comparison of the location of bars and cutbanks on orthophotos from 2003 2009 2015 and 2018 the historical analysis compared 4 periods 1962 1977 1977 1986 1986 1987 and 1986 2019 in the period 1962 1977 the morphodynamic conditions in the studied channel section were the closest to natural ones the period 1977 1986 was characterized by the most intensive regulatory work at that time gcss were constructed channel changes during this period were not the result of natural processes but of engineering works the last two periods overlap but this is intentional in 1986 the regulatory work in the channel was completed and in may 1987 there was a flood the period 1986 1987 illustrates the effects of the first large flood that occurred after the regulation with the gcss immediately afterwards the channel was repaired designing project no 4170 but the extent of the repair work is unknown the period 1986 2019 illustrates the long term changes in the channel since the installation of gcss during this period large floods occurred several times after which the channel underwent repair work however the details are not known our idea was to show changes after the regulation with grade control system so the base year for both periods was 1986 due to the available data a bed level change index was created which is a value showing the change in the vertical position of the channel bed in a given cross section resulting from both natural erosion deposition processes and intentional engineering works the index was calculated at successive cross sections of the channel for the periods 1962 1977 1977 1986 1986 1987 and 1986 2019 cross sections from 1986 and 1987 were chosen as the basis for the calculations due to their large number and the same location fig 5 the cross sections from 1962 1977 and 2019 were interpolated to have the same location as those of 1986 and 1987 the value of the bed level change index is the difference between the lowest channel ordinates in a given cross section at the end and at the beginning of a given period a negative value indicates a lowering of the bed level a positive value an increase the lower the value of the index the greater the lowering of the channel bed the value obtained does not indicate actual erosion or deposition but only erosion deposition trends in the channel the bed level change index for the period 1962 1977 was calculated for a shorter section 1 2 2 4 r km for which cross sections from 1962 were available 3 3 hydraulic calculations hydraulic modeling was carried out using a one dimensional 1d steady flow hec ras model usace 2010 the hec ras software calculates the flow profile using the energy equation for steady flow which creates string models for all cross sections based on the cross sectional geometry elevation and distance between them chow 1959 chang 2008 a mixed flow regime mode was used for modeling the models were calibrated following usace 2010 with respect to the uncertainty of numerical modeling hydraulic conditions in rivers are usually complex flows but the basic flow structure can be determined using 1d modeling ali and goodwin 2002 horritt and bates 2002 five 1d models were prepared four of which were based on historical data from the archived projects from the following years the 1962 model based on 21 cross sections designing project no 3963 the 1977 model based on 40 cross sections designing project no 101 the 1986 model based on 58 cross sections designing project no 4170 and the 1987 model based on 58 cross sections designing project no 4170 the fifth model was created based on 29 geodetic cross sections taken in 2019 all these models captured the changing flow dynamics in the study section the location of all cross sections in the longitudinal profile of the studied river is shown in fig 5 a single roughness coefficient value of n 0 031 was assumed for model calculations based on the averaged value of the diameter d50 of the sediment taken during the 2019 field survey it was assumed that the grain size did not change during the analyzed period roughness was calculated using an empirical formula following the method of strickler 1923 n 0 047 d 50 1 6 an important task was to determine the value of the design discharge in the model to analyze the morphodynamic changes in the channel bankfull discharge is usually used which is considered the most effective for geomorphic works emmett and wolman 2001 determining the magnitude of bankfull discharge in different rivers is not easy or obvious radecki pawlik 2002 radecki pawlik and skalski 2008 as reported by petit and pauquet 1997 in gravel bed rivers this value is close to the discharge with a recurrence interval of 1 2 years in the case of rivers which has been subjected to multiple changes over the years and the bia≈Çy dunajec is such a river the magnitude of bankfull discharge may be variable over time and highly erroneous values may be achieved while determining it xia et al 2017 for simplicity in the five models analyzed a discharge q2 was assumed which is close to bankfull discharge and is often used in stream power analysis ghunowa et al 2021 in the studied river section the q2 value was found to be 92 m3 s 1 which is consistent with the values found in all the archival designing projects analyzed designing projects nos 3963 3964 2220 101 152 4170 and 2064 comparable results from successive transformation periods of the bia≈Çy dunajec river section were prepared using the standardization of the discharge all flow characteristics morphometric and hydraulic parameters flow depth d water surface width w water surface gradient i w d ratio ratio of the water surface width to the flow depth and stream power œâ were derived from the subsequent hydraulic models they were therefore calculated at individual cross sections for flow q2 the adoption of the same source for historical and contemporary data enabled reliable comparative analysis in the analysis specific stream power w m 2 was used which is defined as follows œâ œâ w where œâ is the total stream power per unit channel length w m 1 and w is the channel width m the total stream power is expressed as follows œâ Œ≥ q2 i where Œ≥ is the specific weight of water 9810 n m 3 q2 is the water discharge m3 s 1 and i is the water surface gradient m m 1 3 4 data analysis various channel and flow parameters were compared between years the null hypothesis used was that there were no statistically significant differences between years as variances in the compared data groups showed inhomogeneity a nonparametric mann whitney test was used to assess the differences between groups differences were considered statistically significant if the p value 0 05 to identify the causes of the differences in morphology and flow conditions along the river course and in different years correlation analysis were carried out these were considered statistically significant at p value 0 05 in the text the reach numbers correspond to the gcs numbers e g reach 7 6 indicates the reach between gcss 7 and 6 fig 1b 4 4 results 4 1 contemporary river morphology and grain size characteristics in 2019 there were 27 bars in the studied channel section most of them lateral only 6 were central fig 3b c 4 there were 1 4 bars in each reach between gcss only in the reach between gcss 6 and 7 there was no bar at all the bars were mostly small with a median length of 55 m and a median width of 4 m in some reaches particularly between gcss 8 and 5 the cutbanks were observed with a median length of 160 m they were located both upstream and downstream of the gcss fig 3b 4 the grain size analysis showed that gravel and cobble sediment fraction was dominant the percentile d50 ranged from 0 054 m in the section between gcss 4 and 3 to 0 098 m in the section between gcss 11 and 10 fig 6 the largest fractions reached as much as 0 4 m the material was sorted poorly 1 phi si 2 phi or very poorly 2 phi si 4 phi no clear tendency was observed along the longitudinal profile to fining or coarsening and little variations were found in grain size the grain size was also likely disturbed as a result of local repair work after the 2018 flood fig 3d 4 2 changes in river morphodynamics from 1962 to 2019 from 1962 to 2019 due to repeated engineering works the channel of the bia≈Çy dunajec river was transformed from a braided to a single thread and was also significantly narrowed and straightened as can be seen on archival maps of the channel fig 4 during this period its bed lowered by an average of 3 3 m and a maximum of 4 1 m fig 5 the intensity of the lowering of the bottom varied over time with the highest value occurring before the construction of gcss table 1 this channel bed lowering was the result of both the erosion process and engineering works for example in accordance with designing project no 101 engineering works related to the construction of gcss deepened the channel in the range of 0 1 8 m since 1986 the vertical changes in the channel bed were no longer as great in most of the cross sections the bed level has lowered but in some it has risen table 1 fig 5 the general characteristics of the changes in the morphometric parameters of the river are presented in figs 7 and 8 for 1962 only data from the shorter section from 2 4 to 1 2 r km was available in order to make the data comparable only this section was taken into account for the all years before regulation by gcss the channel was wide median water surface width was 69 1 m in 1962 and 89 9 m in 1977 fig 7a relatively shallow median flow depth was 1 5 m in 1962 and 1 0 m in 1977 m fig 7b and characterized by a high w d ratio median w d ratio was 49 4 in 1962 and 100 3 in 1977 fig 7c it was also morphologically varied as evidenced by the large variation in parameter values the newly profiled channel in 1986 was much narrower median water surface width was 46 6 m fig 7a and deeper than that of 1977 median flow depth was 1 6 m fig 7b so its shape was more compact median w d ratio was 29 3 fig 7c furthermore the water surface gradient decreased significantly reducing the median gradient from 0 0079 m m 1 in 1977 to 0 0021 m m 1 in 1986 fig 7d since 1986 the morphometric parameters of the channel have been standardized in the longitudinal profile and almost constant over time the dynamics of river processes is largely determined by the stream power which includes information on the gradient and width of the channel differences between the calculated stream power values for all channel cross sections in the subsequent analyzed periods i e 1962 1977 1977 1986 1986 1987 and 1986 2019 were not statistically significant p is 0 18 0 79 0 62 and 0 93 respectively stream power values were the highest and most varied in 1962 the median being 103 8 w m 2 fig 8 with successive stages of engineering works the median stream power gradually decreased reaching the lowest value in 1987 almost three times lower than in 1962 this was due to a decrease in the channel gradient or in 1977 an increase in the channel width fig 7 the biggest change was caused by the construction of gcss since 1986 the differences in the median of the stream power have not been large however an increase in the variation in stream power values can be observed in 2019 fig 8 based on the analysis carried out so far two periods were distinguished before and after the construction of the gcss which functioned differently for these two periods the variation of channel morphodynamics in the longitudinal profile is presented below 4 2 1 morphodynamics of the river from 1962 to 1986 in 1962 and 1977 the channel in the studied section was mostly natural and its longitudinal profile was irregular with a highly variable but generally high gradient figs 5 7d the channel was single thread in the upper and lower parts of the section partially regulated by longitudinal structures fig 4 channel bed incision was dominant there fig 9 a in the middle part of the section at 2 2 1 4 r km in 1962 and 2 3 1 4 r km in 1977 the river was much wider and multi thread fig 4 and the deposition was dominant in 1962 in this part of the profile erosion occurred only on a short reach 1 8 1 5 r km with a much higher gradient fig 9a stream power values were related to the dominant processes and they were higher and more varied in the erosion zones mean 155 8 w m 2 standard deviation 81 6 w m 2 in 1962 and mean 88 3 w m 2 standard deviation 42 9 w m 2 in 1977 and lower and more equal in the deposition zones mean 66 2 w m 2 standard deviation 43 0 w m 2 in 1962 and mean 68 4 w m 2 standard deviation 19 5 w m 2 in 1977 although these differences were not statistically significant fig 9b to form a regulatory route with a grade control system the longitudinal profile of the channel was leveled by unevenly deepening the channel bed the natural tendencies of the river were not taken into account the section at 2 4 1 5 r km was deepened the most where deposition was dominant fig 5 a lack of correlation was observed between the rates of bed level lowering from 1962 to 1977 when natural processes dominated and from 1977 to 1986 when the channel was artificially remodeled table 2 4 2 2 morphodynamics of the river from 1986 to 2019 after the construction of gcss a study published in 2020 showed that since the construction of the gcss to 2019 three sections of the studied river could be distinguished which were dominated by different fluvial processes korpak 2020 in the upper section of the channel between gcss 12 and 10 the channel was formed by deposition incision and lateral erosion fig 10 a lateral erosion and deposition dominated between gcss 10 and 5 with downward erosion playing a lesser role fig 10a below gcs 5 incision played the primary role fig 10a the type and intensity of processes that occurred due to one flood just after the regulation period 1986 1987 and in the long period 1986 2019 were compared tendency to erosion was dominant in both time intervals studied but it was greater in the first period than in the second mean bed level change index was 0 27 m and 0 13 m respectively fig 11 table 1 the values of bed level change index of both time intervals were positively correlated with each other table 2 indicating that the trends of incision or aggradation in the same locations were generally similar this was especially true for the reaches in the upper and lower sections of the studied channel between gcss 12 and 11 and between gcss 5 and 2 which were eroded in both periods fig 11 the greatest erosion occurred in the section between gcss 3 and 2 reaching a value of approximately 1 m in the section between gcss 11 and 5 the process trends in the 1986 1987 and 1986 2019 periods were no longer so clear both the site and the intensity of erosion and deposition processes varied locally after 1986 the values of stream power showed high regularity in the longitudinal profile referring to the location of the cross section fig 10b this was of course due to the method and purpose of the regulation decreasing the gradient upstream of the gcss locally increasing it downstream of them thus downstream of the gcss the values of stream power were significantly higher than upstream of them and the differences were statistically significant p is 0 009 in 1986 0 002 in 1987 and 0 002 in 2019 fig 12 these values seem to be unrelated to the processes occurring in the channel both erosion and deposition occurred at high values of stream power downstream of the gcss 9 8 and 7 zones of deposition were observed whereas downstream of the gcss 6 5 4 and 3 zones of erosion were observed erosion also occurred at low values of stream power in locations upstream of the gcs crests fig 10b and 11 to investigate in more detail the causes of such unusual dynamics of fluvial processes the variability of parameters of the channel in the longitudinal profile was analyzed fig 10c the water surface gradient referred obviously to the value of stream power which was higher in locations downstream of the gcss than in the other locations upstream of the gcss and in the middle part of reaches between gcss the lowest and least varied was between gcss 7 and 3 where it generally did not exceed the value of 0 005 m m 1 the values of the w d ratio were slightly lower at cross sections upstream of the gcss than downstream of them during the study period thus the shape of the channel upstream of the gcss was more compact fig 10c and fig 13 cross sections at this location were generally wider and deeper than those downstream of the gcss fig 10c and fig 13 these differences were insignificant in 1986 but extremely clear in 2019 this may indicate that the channel upstream of the gcss was transformed by lateral erosion and incision the location of the scours formed in the 1986 1987 period was consistent with the location of increased flow depths fig 10c and 11 throughout the entire channel fragment studied its middle reach between gcss 7 and 3 stood out it functioned differently in many respects and not in accordance with the principles of hydraulics despite the low gradient and small values of stream power incision was observed especially downstream of the gcs 5 it was the narrowest section with the most compact shape with the lowest values of the w d ratio however intense lateral erosion was observed the deposition process occurred primarily downstream of the end sills of gcss in zones with the greatest gradient and stream power 4 3 causes of changes in the morphodynamics of the bia≈Çy dunajec river correlations between the bed level change index in a given period and various parameters of the river at the beginning and the end of the studied period were examined table 3 parameters at the beginning of a given period characterize the flow conditions that had a potential impact on the course of fluvial processes the parameters defined at the end of the period characterize the flow conditions that have been established as a result of fluvial processes that have occurred in the meantime correlation analysis showed that the hydromorphological changes in the bia≈Çy dunajec channel were more influenced by morphometric than by hydraulic parameters no effect of the water surface gradient on the bed level change was observed in the studied periods furthermore stream power was an insignificant parameter influencing tendency and rate of vertical changes of channel bed it was significant only during 1987 flood table 3 the best predictors of the location of fluvial processes in the studied section of the bia≈Çy dunajec channel were depth and the w d ratio erosion tendency was indicated by low depth values and high w d ratio values table 3 this was true for both the time when the river was almost natural 1962 1977 period and the long period of operation of gcss in the river 1986 2019 in which the large channel width also proved to be important for predicting erosion this was also true for the period 1977 1986 indicating that the widest and shallowest sections were deepened the most during the engineering works however a short period after the flood 1986 1987 stood out in which high erosion was correlated with low width and high values of stream power in cross sections modelled by erosion the shape of the channel changed to a more compact one this is indicated by the negative correlation between the bed level change index and depth as well as positive correlation between the bed level change index and width at the end of the periods in question table 3 the water surface gradient and stream power decreased due to the prevailing erosion positive correlation between these parameters and the bed level change index at the end of the periods in question such relationships were observed in the periods 1986 1987 and 1986 2019 interestingly no correlations were observed between the bed level change index and any parameter at the end of the near natural period 1962 1977 the dependence of the average bed level change index and the maximum bed level change index for a given reach between the gcss on the parameters of the regulatory route was also analyzed table 4 the average bed level change index was calculated as the average value of bed level change indexes in a given reach between gcss the maximum bed level change index is the greatest value of erosion indexes in a given reach between gcss the distance between the gcss was found to be the most important parameter influencing the tendency to erosion deposition processes in both the short period 1986 1987 and the long period 1986 2019 the longer the distance between the gcss the stronger the erosion the effect of the location of the gcs relative to the location of the natural rapids in the channel in 1977 on changes in the morphodynamics of the river was also considered rapids were identified as places with a particularly high gradient in the longitudinal profile of the river fig 5 gcss 11 10 9 8 7 and 3 were constructed more or less at the locations of the former rapids in sections between gcs 11 and 7 as well as downstream of gcs 3 a rhythm of alternating high and low stream power high downstream of the end sill of the gcss and decreasing to the next gcs crest has been observed gcs 6 5 and 4 were constructed in a section where there were no clearly developed rapid pool sequences in 1977 the rhythm of the stream power run in this section has been disturbed and has not manifested regularity despite the identical mode of regulation and similar parameters of the gcss the section between gcss 3 and 2 is noteworthy it is the longest section and has been heavily eroded erosion was lower only in the place where the elevation of the channel bed remains constant over the years at 1 15 r km in this unique place the trends of the river s morphometric and hydraulic parameters have changed the water surface gradient has increased and the flow depth has decreased a natural rapid has developed here that has functioned almost like an additional missing gcs it should be noted that prior to regulation with gcss a rapid was observed at this location fig 5 despite the artificial regulation route the river has recreated its natural rhythm where there was no regular sequence of rapids and pools before regulation the river seems to have overlooked artificial rapids i e the gcss where the artificial rapids are too far apart compared with natural rapids before regulation the river has developed an additional natural rapid 5 discussion regulation with gcss was the major intervention in the channel of the bia≈Çy dunajec river in the last 60 years before this regulation three sections with varying morphodynamics were distinguishable along the analyzed river section the upper and lower sections 3 2 2 3 r km and 1 4 0 9 r km respectively were single thread narrower straighter and erosive whereas the middle section 2 3 1 4 r km was braiding and wide dominated by aggradation the grade control system unified the morphology of the channel along its entire length however after years of operation of gcss three sections with varying morphodynamics could again be distinguished moreover the location of these morphodynamic sections resemble those prior to construction of gcss the upper and lower sections 3 2 2 3 r km and 1 78 0 9 r km respectively were dominated by incision in the middle section 2 3 1 8 r km lateral erosion and deposition dominated as was the case before the regulation with the gcss at 2 3 1 4 r km in the upper section the deposition process was also active after each flood this section was covered with sediment transported from the section located upstream of the gcs system at 5 2 3 2 r km it was possible especially since as a result of the floods in 1997 and 2001 the longitudinal structures built there in 1971 were destroyed and the channel banks were effectively washed away korpak 2020 the dominance of incision in the lower section can probably be explained by the imbalance between sediment supply and sediment transport capacity montgomery and buffington 1997 the farther downstream the river the less material reaches from the upper parts of the channel and the lateral supply is extremely limited studies carried out in carpathian rivers with similar grade control systems have shown that the transport of material through gcss takes place but over short distances and primarily small fractions galia et al 2016 korpak et al 2021 the distinguished morphodynamic zones in the periods before and after regulation with gcs are also characterized by similarity in stream power distribution in the zones with erosion dominance stream powers were slightly higher and more diverse this was also true for the erosion section that was artificially narrowed and straightened in 1971 fig 4 this shows that within the artificially constricted channel natural rapids and pools were formed as described by leopold and wolman 1957 in sections with deposition dominance stream powers were slightly lower and less diverse these differences are visible in the graphs figs 9 10 but have not been confirmed by statistical analysis these results showed that stream power is not crucial parameter explaining morphological changes in the regulated channel interestingly even in the period 1962 1977 when the channel was close to the natural one no statistically significant correlation was observed between stream power and the dominant processes this contradicts the observations of researchers who have proved the relationship between the values of stream power and dominant fluvial processes in a given cross section bizzi and lerner 2015 yochum et al 2017 these studies have reported that high values of stream power or increasing values from cross section to cross section are responsible for erosion whereas low values or decreasing values from cross section to cross section are responsible for deposition in the case of the bia≈Çy dunajec river erosion occurred in cross sections with both large and small values of stream power without showing any regularity this was especially the case for some cross sections located upstream of the gcs crests where stream power was very low and despite this scours were formed similar observations have been made in the carpathian river mszanka regulated by gcss where the mechanism of scour formation upstream of gcs crests has been documented which may be related to the specific construction of gcss korpak et al 2021 yochum et al 2017 and tolentino et al 2022 have argued that although stream power is a valuable parameter for fluvial dynamics it is not sufficient to predict river style because river style depends also on other factors such as geology sediment supply vegetation and lateral connectivity of the channel with the hillslopes therefore it seems that stream power is not useful for forecasting the course of morphological changes in the regulated channel where both sediment supply and lateral connectivity with the valley are severely limited furthermore this parameter did not explain the channel dynamics even in the period 1962 1977 when the bia≈Çy dunajec river was only partially subjected to engineering works another issue addressed in many studies is the relationship between stream power and channel stability brookes 1987 bizzy and lerner 2015 jha et al 2022 it is a general assumption that stable rivers differ from potentially unstable ones with a stream power limit of 35 w m 2 however not all studies have confirmed this relationship stacey and rutherfurd 2007 in addition to a high value of stream power the risk of instability is determined by low sediment supply brookes 1987 bojarski et al 2005 prior to regulation by gcss the studied section of the bia≈Çy dunajec river generally had a much higher value of stream power than after the construction of the gcss which significantly reduced the water surface gradient the values of stream power exceeding 100 w m 2 were recorded in 31 2 of the cross sections in 1977 and 22 6 of the cross sections in 1986 whereas values 35 w m 2 were recorded in 9 4 of the cross sections in 1977 and in 43 4 of the cross sections in 1986 however because the regulation by gcss strongly reduced the transport of river material almost all cross sections could be considered unstable and incision occurred even at the values of stream power 35 w m 2 channel depth and its w d ratio were found to be better predictors of the morphodynamics of the bia≈Çy dunajec river high erosion tendency could be expected in shallower zones with high w d values this finding is consistent with the findings of lisenby and fryirs 2016 who stated that channel sections with an increased w d ratio are most susceptible to geomorphic adjustments another parameter affecting the formation of morphological processes in the studied channel was the distance between gcss a large distance between the gcss increased the probability of strong erosion which is consistent with the results of lenzi et al 2003 comiti et al 2013 and korpak et al 2021 at very large distances natural rapids can occur where the gcs is missing therefore gcss should be built at the locations of natural rapids marion et al 2004 the 1986 regulation with the grade control system did not fulfill its basic role i e it did not prevent the erosion of the channel bed and did not ensure the hydrodynamic balance of the river contrary to the designers calculations the channel was designed for a q10 discharge material transport and erosion and deposition processes occurred even at lower discharges during the first flood after the completion of the grade control system in 1987 flood with a recurrence interval of about 4 years not only the channel but also the gcss designed for q20 were significantly damaged the morphology and dynamics of the river were completely disturbed after the regulation certainly this is partly due to the mistakes made during the regulation works especially the differentiation of equilibrium slopes between gcss s distances between the gcss l and height of the gcss h in a properly designed grade control system appropriate relationships 1 h l s 2 should be maintained between these parameters otherwise the regulation threatens the stability of the river and the hydraulic structures and generates ecological problems wohl et al 2013 however errors in the execution of the regulation are not the only cause of channel instability a key factor that seems to complicate the predictability of the processes is the supply of sediment which is not only severely limited but also spatially and temporally variable marion et al 2006 the amount of material reaching the section with gcss is dependent on the frequency and magnitude of the floods the condition of the hydraulic structures and the channel after the last flood the supply of material from the slopes of the catchment and tributaries and the condition of the channel upstream of the section with gcss in the bia≈Çy dunajec river this upstream supply depended on the degree of regulation of the channel section located upstream of the section with gcss at 3 2 5 2 r km it had been braided high supply from bed and banks until 1971 single thread and constricted by groynes no supply from banks and reduced supply from bed between 1971 and 1997 and sinuous with a tendency to braiding after the destruction of groynes increased supply from bed and banks after the 1997 flood laboratory studies by marion et al 2006 mart√≠n vide and andreatta 2009 pagliara et al 2011 and pagliara and palermo 2013 have shown that an increase in the sediment delivery with unchanged hydraulic conditions and geometrical parameters of the channel results in a significant reduction in scouring downstream of gcss an insufficient bed material load serves as a cause of river bed deepening and coarsening of bed material boix fayos et al 2007 castillo et al 2007 recking 2012 wohl et al 2013 piton and recking 2016 korpak and lenar matyas 2019 korpak et al 2021 research has also shown that some of the behaviors of rivers cannot be easily explained it seems that a river does not forget its preregulation morphodynamics and is constantly trying to recreate it shen et al 1979 have discussed such a phenomenon the bia≈Çy dunajec river did not allow itself to be tamed for a long time after each flood in 1979 1983 stubbornly destroyed the emerging gcss and the river returned to the old channel but even today it poses huge maintenance problems and the channel is constantly being repaired usually the banks in the section that already showed lateral migration tendencies before the regulation are destroyed this proves the existence of the difficult to explain phenomenon of river memory 6 conclusions the bia≈Çy dunajec river flows in a completely altered channel and has nothing in common with a natural mountain river despite the extent and frequency of the engineering work carried out here in the last 60 years and although a long period of 30 years has passed since the last regulation with the grade control system the river has not allowed itself to be completely tamed the bia≈Çy dunajec river tries to recreate its natural dynamics ignoring the restrictions imposed it is not equally successful throughout its course the supply of sediment plays a crucial role without which the river does not have the ability of self restoration the parameters of the channel play a role in the functioning of the river primarily locally the distance between the gcss influences the intensity of the erosion process in contrast the value of stream power does not directly influence not only the type of fluvial process but also its intensity this is an atypical observation in the natural channels studied so far such a relationship has usually been demonstrated the generalization of the lack of such a relationship for rivers regulated with gcss requires studies in other fluvial systems with such regulation it seems that the general trends of the adjustment of the bia≈Çy dunajec river reflect the natural hydrodynamics of the river before regulation research has demonstrated the high usefulness of archival designing projects in reconstructing the gradual changes in the morphodynamics of a regulated river these changes are often hard to reach sources of information that are rarely used but they are worth getting the mechanism of regulated rivers is much less well understood than that of natural rivers usually the cumulative effects of various human interventions are studied and assessed years later thanks to the designing projects carried out in different years this study had the opportunity to determine how the river has adjusted to the various interferences and to assess its long term evolutionary trends under strong anthropopression this is highly important in the context of the present restoration works acquiring a detailed knowledge of the functioning of the regulated fluvial system will help make the right engineering decisions and prevent faulty river regulations credit authorship contribution statement joanna korpak conceptualization methodology formal analysis

1823,for more than 30 years the lower section of the bia≈Çy dunajec river poland has been regulated by grade control structures gcss despite the short length of the section and the uniform method of regulation varying dynamics have been observed in the longitudinal profile the study aimed to identify the morphometric parameters of the channel and the hydraulic parameters of the flow that determine this variability to establish whether the variability in the morphodynamics of a regulated river can be predicted in the longitudinal profile and over time the novelty of this study is that it recognizes not only the variations in the morphology of the regulated river in the longitudinal profile and cross sections but also the changing flow dynamics over the last 60 years for this purpose archival designing projects were used in this study from which five different flow models were prepared using these models adjustments of the river to the changes made were reconstructed the study showed that the stream power which is often used to predict fluvial processes in natural channels was not useful while evaluating the regulated river where both sediment supply and lateral connectivity with the valley are severely limited the varying dynamics of the river depended on the morphometrical parameters of the channel especially depth and the w d ratio the magnitude of erosion was also positively correlated with the distance between gcss interestingly varying morphodynamics in the river showed similarities to those before regulation formerly erosive sections showed a tendency toward erosion and the braiding depositional section showed a tendency toward lateral erosion and deposition the river is unstable and the hydraulic structures are destroyed at low flows contrary to the design assumptions a key factor that seems to complicate the predictability of the processes in regulated rivers is the supply of debris which is not only severely limited but also

v√°zquez tarr√≠o et al 2019 korpak 2020 one of the primary reasons for these changes is hydrotechnical regulation which has been used for many decades wohl 2006 various river sections have been regulated several times in the past using different methods subsequent regulations are often a response to unforeseen changes attributable to earlier engineering works korpak 2018 kiss et al 2019 mountain river regulation with longitudinal structures resulted in the shortening of the river course and the narrowing and straightening of the channels what increased river transport capacity surian 1999 rinaldi 2003 korpak 2007 ≈°karpich et al 2013 the construction of dam debris dam or weir interrupted the continuity of the bedload transport and reduced the supply of material from the upper reaches of the channel pickup 1977 kondolf 1997 kiss et al 2011 these measures resulted in a strong deepening of channel beds simon and rinaldi 2006 korpak 2018 hajdukiewicz and wy≈ºga 2019 marchi et

mountain stream and river beds garc√≠a and lenzi 2013 korpak 2018 a sequence of gcss reduces the original channel gradient by creating an equilibrium slope between structures thus ensuring a balance between erosion and accumulation processes in a given section of the channel galia et al 2016 therefore the primary objective of gcss is not only to prevent further erosion but also to ensure the hydrodynamic balance of the river garc√≠a and lenzi 2013 studies conducted on channels with gcss have shown that these structures often interrupt the continuity of material transport especially that

interventions are characterized by a different morphology and dynamics than natural channels therefore it is necessary to thoroughly recognize their functioning there is a huge body of work in the

nicholas 2013 ielpi et al 2022 have been identified as the major characteristics determining the river pattern while studying river dynamics the stream power which informs about river energy and its workability is often used it combines several key parameters taking into account their interdependencies bagnold 1968 many relationships have been observed between stream power and other characteristics of the fluvial system such as the river pattern knighton and nanson 1993 van den berg 1995 development of fluvial forms simons and richardson 1966 sediment transport bagnold 1977 and morphological effectiveness of floods magilligan 1992 stream power was used to determine the river s ability to erode or deposit sediment at different scales local bizzi and lerner 2015 regional kaushal et al 2020 jha et al 2022 and national marcinkowski et al 2022 research has also been carried out to establish a stream power threshold that distinguishes stable channels from unstable ones brookes 1987 stacey and rutherfurd 2007 analysis of the variability in stream power along the river course has shown that stream power does not decrease linearly but is highly dependent on local variations in the gradient knighton 1999 the aforementioned studies have primarily focused on natural rivers with an undisturbed flow regime and sediment transport studies considering the suitability of different parameters in the prediction of changes in the morphodynamics of regulated channels are scarce the few such studies available usually describe the influence of the mode of regulation or geometrical parameters of hydraulic structures on the morphodynamics of rivers for example the influence of the height of the grade control structures galia and ≈°karpich 2017 and the stage of their destruction galia et al 2016 on the scale of erosion and grain size parameters between them has been studied furthermore the influence of the construction type of grade control structures on the location of scour zones has been analyzed korpak et al 2021 these studies mostly describe the cumulative changes over a long time after the river has been regulated especially changes in the channel morphology there is a lack of studies analyzing the gradual changes over time in both morphology and flow dynamics such analysis are rare because it is difficult to obtain data reflecting the morphodynamics of the river in a given section before the creation of the regulation after its creation and after a longer period of its operation this research aimed to partially fill this knowledge gap the research was conducted on the bia≈Çy dunajec river which is perfectly suited for such analysis the river has been regulated many times in the past and the successive stages of regulation have extensive documentation including archival maps cross sections and profiles showing the state of the channel prior to individual engineering works these factors were used in the creation of hydrodynamic models thanks to which not only the morphology but also the dynamics of the flow at different times was recognized the aim of the study was to determine changes in the morphodynamics of a regulated river in the longitudinal profile and over time the morphometric parameters of the channel and the hydraulic parameters of the flow that influence this variability were identified in particular attention was paid to the stream power which in natural rivers is used to assess morphodynamic changes an additional aim was to determine whether and how a mountain river adapts in the long term to the channel parameters imposed by regulation this aim deals with the effectiveness durability and reasonableness of regulating a mountain river the results of our research will help to interpret the dynamics and predict the evolution of a river heavily altered by multiple regulation this is very important for the proper maintenance of rivers and for ensuring their good ecological conditions brierley and fryirs 2005 therefore our research should be of widespread interest for fluvial geomorphologists hydraulic engineers river managers and designers 2 study area this research was conducted in the carpathian bia≈Çy dunajec river central europe poland which is 35 km long it originates in the tatra mountains at an altitude of 2004 m a s l and joins the dunajec river in the city of nowy targ 580 m a s l fig 1 a the studied catchment is characterized by different lithologies crystalline rocks dominate in the tatra mountains whereas flysch sandstone and shale limestone and marl dominate in the lower part of the catchment the fluvial material consists primarily of granite gravels and cobbles with admixtures of sandstone and shale climatic conditions in the catchment are highly variable the average annual temperature ranges from 0 8 c in the tatra mountains to 5 3 c in the city of nowy targ and the average annual precipitation ranges from 1610 mm to 760 mm respectively hess 1965 the climatic conditions high location of the catchment elongated shape and high gradients have made the regime of the bia≈Çy dunajec river high mountainous characterized by a quick flood wave buildup and extremely violent course of flood events detailed surveys were conducted in the lower section of the bia≈Çy dunajec river from 3 2 to 0 9 river km r km located in the orawsko nowotarska basin in the city of nowy targ the nearest gauging station is located in szaflary at 7 23 r km fig 1a there are no major tributaries between the study section and the gauging station and the catchment increase is only 6 25 the mean annual flow is 5 7 m3 s 1 designing project no 2064 the maximum annual high flows occur during summer months and as much as 70 of them occurred in june and july in the period of 1961 2020 the largest flood event in the period of 1961 2019 occurred in 1997 fig 2 with a value close to q100 480 m3 s 1 100 year discharge recurrence interval other floods larger than q2 92 m3 s 1 2 year recurrence interval occurred 29 times with as many as 25 of them not exceeding q5 190 m3 s 1 a noticeable increase in the frequency of floods has been observed recently with a recurrence interval varying between 2 and 5 years the lower part of the bia≈Çy dunajec river has undergone many engineering interventions in the past currently it is regulated using a grade control system consisting of 12 concrete structures fig 1b and 3 the section of the river from gcs 12 to gcs 2 was analyzed in detail the section downstream of gcs 2 was excluded from the analysis due to insufficient archival documentation of engineering works 2 1 engineering works in 1962 2019 in 1962 the studied section of the bia≈Çy dunajec river was almost natural wide and braiding the only technical regulation made to it was concentrating the flow with longitudinal structures below 1 1 r km designing project no 3963 more detail are provided at section 3 2 fig 4 at the end of the 1960 s bank protection was established in several places and a single thread channel was created by closing the side branches fig 4 the aim of these interventions was protecting the right bank against erosion where there was a small sports airport fig 4 in 1970 the channel was therefore already much narrower below 2 5 r km fig 4 without side branches designing project nos 3964 and 2220 the new regulatory route was heavily covered with sediment transported from the upper braiding section making it difficult to maintain and generating flood risks then in 1971 the regulation using groynes was carried out covering the section from 2 3 to 5 2 r km designing project no 3964 fig 4 the channel in this section was significantly narrowed this regulation resulted in intensive erosion and as a result bank reinforcements and side channel closures made in the 1960 s below 2 3 r km were destroyed korpak 2020 erosion of the banks and deposition of the bars again began fig 4 at that time there were also levees on both banks below the bridge that still function today designing project no 4170 fig 4 in 1979 the regulation with a grade control system was started in the section from 3 2 r km to the mouth designing project no 101 the design assumed the construction of 11 gcss from 12 to 2 with a height of 1 m which were made of concrete the stilling basins of the gcss were 0 8 m deep the planned channel gradient between gcss was 0 004 m m 1 a three part cross section of the channel with a total width of 50 m was designed in the middle part of the cross section the channel bed was 20 m wide whereas the side parts of the bottom 15 m wide were profiled with a slope of 1 15 biological development of the channel banks was also planned calculations showed that this regulation will ensure proper operation of gcss at the q20 flow and no sediment transport for sediment with a diameter larger than or equal to d50 0 074 m at the q10 flow according to design calculations the diameter of the paving layer d 0 112 m should be stable even at the q100 flow engineering works lasted as long as 6 years as many difficulties were encountered during the implementation of the project during the 1980 and 1983 floods gcs 12 was damaged twice and the river bypassed the regulatory route returning to its former channel designing project no 152 in 1983 reasons for failures in the implementation of the project were analyzed many irregularities and inconsistencies between the execution and the design were found improper location of the gcss in the longitudinal profile the maximum offset was 31 m differences in gcs heights from 0 62 m to 1 03 m differences in channel gradients from 0 0026 to 0 0092 m m 1 and no planned bank protection by vegetation between the gcss the average distance between gcss was 238 m but it was quite varied the smallest distance between gcss 11 and 10 was 169 m whereas the largest distance between gcss 3 and 2 was 505 m in response to these irregularities vegetation on the channel banks was planned in july 1986 an inventory of the completed regulation was conducted which showed a continued lack of vegetation along the banks and local erosion and deposition problems designing project no 4170 fig 4 on may 23 1987 a large flood occurred fig 2 which caused extensive damage to the recently constructed regulatory route especially between gcss 12 and 6 fig 4 surveys carried out in october 1987 showed damage to the banks and end sills designing project no 4170 the total area of the bars was about 5 5 times larger than that before the flood in 2019 the gcss were in a fairly good condition after 33 years of operation fig 3 a old bank reinforcements were visible on most of the river banks in a few places especially between gcss 6 and 3 the reinforcements were being repaired after the 2018 flood fig 3d unfortunately the exact extent and effect of these works were impossible to reconstruct there are two weirs upstream of the surveyed section of the river at 6 3 and 5 5 r km the first with a water intake for the city of nowy targ is 5 1 m high and was built in the 1960 s the second with a small water power station is 5 0 m high and was built in 2000 these weirs have changed the conditions for water flow and sediment transport in the river downstream of them however their distance from the section under consideration is large enough not to directly affect its morphodynamic 3 materials and methods 3 1 fieldwork the contemporary morphology of the channel was determined during fieldwork in october 2019 a mapping of the channel was carried out in which fluvial forms bars and cutbanks and grade control structures in the surveyed section were located and measured using a measuring tape and a gps device in parallel with the mapping 22 cross sections of the channel were made each cross section had its beginning and end on the boundary between the channel edge and the floodplain and included all bars both vegetated and non vegetated the boundary between the channel edge and the floodplain was easy to define due to the regular trapezoidal shape of the regulatory channel two cross sections were made in each reach between the gcss one was located in close proximity average 35 7 m 14 8 m to the end sill of a gcs and the other in close proximity average 31 4 m 15 8 m to the crest of the next gcs an additional two cross sections were made in the longest reach between gcss 3 and 2 fig 5 grain size analysis were carried out using the sieve method samples were collected from the central part of gravel bars one sample was taken in each reach between gcss and two samples were taken only in the longest reach between gcss 3 and 2 fig 5 there was no bar between gcss 7 and 6 hence no sample was taken in this reach samples were extracted from an approximately 1 m2 area from a depth not lower than twice the maximum diameter of grains found on a given bar diplas and fripp 1992 typically the depth was 0 5 1 0 m a single sample weighed an average of 163 9 kg 21 0 kg the collected material was sieved through seven sieves with the following mesh sizes 12 8 6 4 2 1 and 0 5 mm and weighed in the field using a spring scale grains smaller than 0 5 mm were subjected to further sieve analysis under laboratory conditions gradation curves were generated and used to identify characteristic diameters d5 d16 d50 d84 and d90 m the sorting index si was also calculated as follows folk and ward 1957 si œï84 œï16 4 œï95 œï5 6 6 the percentiles in the above formula are expressed in œï units thus it is necessary to convert meters into œï units using the following formula œï 3 322 lg d 3 2 historical analysis the history of the regulation and changes in the channel morphology were reconstructed based on documents from the cracow s regional water management authority using designing projects expert reports etc from 1962 1968 1969 1977 1983 1986 1987 and 2003 designing projects nos 3963 3964 2220 101 152 4170 and 2064 these materials provide an extremely valuable source of information on the condition of the channel and stages of its progressive regulation during various periods the projects of 1962 1977 1986 and 1987 contain full documentation in the form of channel maps longitudinal profiles and cross sections as well as technical descriptions data from these projects was used to create hydraulic models and conduct detailed analysis documentation from the other projects was incomplete but still helpful in creating a description of the regulatory work and its morphological effects the 1962 project unfortunately covers a shorter section of the channel from 2 3 to 0 9 r km however it was also included in the analysis as it shows an almost natural channel with only minor hydraulic engineering interventions additionally an archival aerial photograph from 1977 was used which allowed for a more accurate recognition of the channel morphology at that time the photograph was brought to a uniform scale of 1 10 000 using polish coordinate system puwg1992 rectification of this aerial photo and archival channel maps was carried out using the affine method with about 100 adjustment points in each case the points were selected so that their distance from the river channel was not large based on the position deviations the root mean square error rmse was determined which did not exceed 2 m analysis of the above mentioned archival materials led to the distinction of sections of the channel with a dominant fluvial process incision lateral erosion or deposition in 1962 and 1977 the assumption was made that one can identify the character of the channel dynamics on the basis of its characteristic features in a given section a similar assumption was used in many works krzemie≈Ñ 1999 sear et al 2003 korpak 2007 bizzi and lerner 2015 the dominance of the erosion process was evidenced by the lowering of the bed level evident on the cross sections and longitudinal profiles compared and the absence or small number and area of unvegetated bars evident on the archival maps the dominance of lateral erosion was evidenced by the shape of the cross section and the presence of cutbanks the dominance of deposition was evidenced by the rising of the bed level and the presence of a large number of unvegetated bars for the period 1986 2019 the dominant processes in the studied section of the channel were taken after the publication of korpak 2020 they were determined on the basis of analysis of designing projects from 1986 and 1987 field surveys in 2019 and comparison of the location of bars and cutbanks on orthophotos from 2003 2009 2015 and 2018 the historical analysis compared 4 periods 1962 1977 1977 1986 1986 1987 and 1986 2019 in the period 1962 1977 the morphodynamic conditions in the studied channel section were the closest to natural ones the period 1977 1986 was characterized by the most intensive regulatory work at that time gcss were constructed channel changes during this period were not the result of natural processes but of engineering works the last two periods overlap but this is intentional in 1986 the regulatory work in the channel was completed and in may 1987 there was a flood the period 1986 1987 illustrates the effects of the first large flood that occurred after the regulation with the gcss immediately afterwards the channel was repaired designing project no 4170 but the extent of the repair work is unknown the period 1986 2019 illustrates the long term changes in the channel since the installation of gcss during this period large floods occurred several times after which the channel underwent repair work however the details are not known our idea was to show changes after the regulation with grade control system so the base year for both periods was 1986 due to the available data a bed level change index was created which is a value showing the change in the vertical position of the channel bed in a given cross section resulting from both natural erosion deposition processes and intentional engineering works the index was calculated at successive cross sections of the channel for the periods 1962 1977 1977 1986 1986 1987 and 1986 2019 cross sections from 1986 and 1987 were chosen as the basis for the calculations due to their large number and the same location fig 5 the cross sections from 1962 1977 and 2019 were interpolated to have the same location as those of 1986 and 1987 the value of the bed level change index is the difference between the lowest channel ordinates in a given cross section at the end and at the beginning of a given period a negative value indicates a lowering of the bed level a positive value an increase the lower the value of the index the greater the lowering of the channel bed the value obtained does not indicate actual erosion or deposition but only erosion deposition trends in the channel the bed level change index for the period 1962 1977 was calculated for a shorter section 1 2 2 4 r km for which cross sections from 1962 were available 3 3 hydraulic calculations hydraulic modeling was carried out using a one dimensional 1d steady flow hec ras model usace 2010 the hec ras software calculates the flow profile using the energy equation for steady flow which creates string models for all cross sections based on the cross sectional geometry elevation and distance between them chow 1959 chang 2008 a mixed flow regime mode was used for modeling the models were calibrated following usace 2010 with respect to the uncertainty of numerical modeling hydraulic conditions in rivers are usually complex flows but the basic flow structure can be determined using 1d modeling ali and goodwin 2002 horritt and bates 2002 five 1d models were prepared four of which were based on historical data from the archived projects from the following years the 1962 model based on 21 cross sections designing project no 3963 the 1977 model based on 40 cross sections designing project no 101 the 1986 model based on 58 cross sections designing project no 4170 and the 1987 model based on 58 cross sections designing project no 4170 the fifth model was created based on 29 geodetic cross sections taken in 2019 all these models captured the changing flow dynamics in the study section the location of all cross sections in the longitudinal profile of the studied river is shown in fig 5 a single roughness coefficient value of n 0 031 was assumed for model calculations based on the averaged value of the diameter d50 of the sediment taken during the 2019 field survey it was assumed that the grain size did not change during the analyzed period roughness was calculated using an empirical formula following the method of strickler 1923 n 0 047 d 50 1 6 an important task was to determine the value of the design discharge in the model to analyze the morphodynamic changes in the channel bankfull discharge is usually used which is considered the most effective for geomorphic works emmett and wolman 2001 determining the magnitude of bankfull discharge in different rivers is not easy or obvious radecki pawlik 2002 radecki pawlik and skalski 2008 as reported by petit and pauquet 1997 in gravel bed rivers this value is close to the discharge with a recurrence interval of 1 2 years in the case of rivers which has been subjected to multiple changes over the years and the bia≈Çy dunajec is such a river the magnitude of bankfull discharge may be variable over time and highly erroneous values may be achieved while determining it xia et al 2017 for simplicity in the five models analyzed a discharge q2 was assumed which is close to bankfull discharge and is often used in stream power analysis ghunowa et al 2021 in the studied river section the q2 value was found to be 92 m3 s 1 which is consistent with the values found in all the archival designing projects analyzed designing projects nos 3963 3964 2220 101 152 4170 and 2064 comparable results from successive transformation periods of the bia≈Çy dunajec river section were prepared using the standardization of the discharge all flow characteristics morphometric and hydraulic parameters flow depth d water surface width w water surface gradient i w d ratio ratio of the water surface width to the flow depth and stream power œâ were derived from the subsequent hydraulic models they were therefore calculated at individual cross sections for flow q2 the adoption of the same source for historical and contemporary data enabled reliable comparative analysis in the analysis specific stream power w m 2 was used which is defined as follows œâ œâ w where œâ is the total stream power per unit channel length w m 1 and w is the channel width m the total stream power is expressed as follows œâ Œ≥ q2 i where Œ≥ is the specific weight of water 9810 n m 3 q2 is the water discharge m3 s 1 and i is the water surface gradient m m 1 3 4 data analysis various channel and flow parameters were compared between years the null hypothesis used was that there were no statistically significant differences between years as variances in the compared data groups showed inhomogeneity a nonparametric mann whitney test was used to assess the differences between groups differences were considered statistically significant if the p value 0 05 to identify the causes of the differences in morphology and flow conditions along the river course and in different years correlation analysis were carried out these were considered statistically significant at p value 0 05 in the text the reach numbers correspond to the gcs numbers e g reach 7 6 indicates the reach between gcss 7 and 6 fig 1b 4 4 results 4 1 contemporary river morphology and grain size characteristics in 2019 there were 27 bars in the studied channel section most of them lateral only 6 were central fig 3b c 4 there were 1 4 bars in each reach between gcss only in the reach between gcss 6 and 7 there was no bar at all the bars were mostly small with a median length of 55 m and a median width of 4 m in some reaches particularly between gcss 8 and 5 the cutbanks were observed with a median length of 160 m they were located both upstream and downstream of the gcss fig 3b 4 the grain size analysis showed that gravel and cobble sediment fraction was dominant the percentile d50 ranged from 0 054 m in the section between gcss 4 and 3 to 0 098 m in the section between gcss 11 and 10 fig 6 the largest fractions reached as much as 0 4 m the material was sorted poorly 1 phi si 2 phi or very poorly 2 phi si 4 phi no clear tendency was observed along the longitudinal profile to fining or coarsening and little variations were found in grain size the grain size was also likely disturbed as a result of local repair work after the 2018 flood fig 3d 4 2 changes in river morphodynamics from 1962 to 2019 from 1962 to 2019 due to repeated engineering works the channel of the bia≈Çy dunajec river was transformed from a braided to a single thread and was also significantly narrowed and straightened as can be seen on archival maps of the channel fig 4 during this period its bed lowered by an average of 3 3 m and a maximum of 4 1 m fig 5 the intensity of the lowering of the bottom varied over time with the highest value occurring before the construction of gcss table 1 this channel bed lowering was the result of both the erosion process and engineering works for example in accordance with designing project no 101 engineering works related to the construction of gcss deepened the channel in the range of 0 1 8 m since 1986 the vertical changes in the channel bed were no longer as great in most of the cross sections the bed level has lowered but in some it has risen table 1 fig 5 the general characteristics of the changes in the morphometric parameters of the river are presented in figs 7 and 8 for 1962 only data from the shorter section from 2 4 to 1 2 r km was available in order to make the data comparable only this section was taken into account for the all years before regulation by gcss the channel was wide median water surface width was 69 1 m in 1962 and 89 9 m in 1977 fig 7a relatively shallow median flow depth was 1 5 m in 1962 and 1 0 m in 1977 m fig 7b and characterized by a high w d ratio median w d ratio was 49 4 in 1962 and 100 3 in 1977 fig 7c it was also morphologically varied as evidenced by the large variation in parameter values the newly profiled channel in 1986 was much narrower median water surface width was 46 6 m fig 7a and deeper than that of 1977 median flow depth was 1 6 m fig 7b so its shape was more compact median w d ratio was 29 3 fig 7c furthermore the water surface gradient decreased significantly reducing the median gradient from 0 0079 m m 1 in 1977 to 0 0021 m m 1 in 1986 fig 7d since 1986 the morphometric parameters of the channel have been standardized in the longitudinal profile and almost constant over time the dynamics of river processes is largely determined by the stream power which includes information on the gradient and width of the channel differences between the calculated stream power values for all channel cross sections in the subsequent analyzed periods i e 1962 1977 1977 1986 1986 1987 and 1986 2019 were not statistically significant p is 0 18 0 79 0 62 and 0 93 respectively stream power values were the highest and most varied in 1962 the median being 103 8 w m 2 fig 8 with successive stages of engineering works the median stream power gradually decreased reaching the lowest value in 1987 almost three times lower than in 1962 this was due to a decrease in the channel gradient or in 1977 an increase in the channel width fig 7 the biggest change was caused by the construction of gcss since 1986 the differences in the median of the stream power have not been large however an increase in the variation in stream power values can be observed in 2019 fig 8 based on the analysis carried out so far two periods were distinguished before and after the construction of the gcss which functioned differently for these two periods the variation of channel morphodynamics in the longitudinal profile is presented below 4 2 1 morphodynamics of the river from 1962 to 1986 in 1962 and 1977 the channel in the studied section was mostly natural and its longitudinal profile was irregular with a highly variable but generally high gradient figs 5 7d the channel was single thread in the upper and lower parts of the section partially regulated by longitudinal structures fig 4 channel bed incision was dominant there fig 9 a in the middle part of the section at 2 2 1 4 r km in 1962 and 2 3 1 4 r km in 1977 the river was much wider and multi thread fig 4 and the deposition was dominant in 1962 in this part of the profile erosion occurred only on a short reach 1 8 1 5 r km with a much higher gradient fig 9a stream power values were related to the dominant processes and they were higher and more varied in the erosion zones mean 155 8 w m 2 standard deviation 81 6 w m 2 in 1962 and mean 88 3 w m 2 standard deviation 42 9 w m 2 in 1977 and lower and more equal in the deposition zones mean 66 2 w m 2 standard deviation 43 0 w m 2 in 1962 and mean 68 4 w m 2 standard deviation 19 5 w m 2 in 1977 although these differences were not statistically significant fig 9b to form a regulatory route with a grade control system the longitudinal profile of the channel was leveled by unevenly deepening the channel bed the natural tendencies of the river were not taken into account the section at 2 4 1 5 r km was deepened the most where deposition was dominant fig 5 a lack of correlation was observed between the rates of bed level lowering from 1962 to 1977 when natural processes dominated and from 1977 to 1986 when the channel was artificially remodeled table 2 4 2 2 morphodynamics of the river from 1986 to 2019 after the construction of gcss a study published in 2020 showed that since the construction of the gcss to 2019 three sections of the studied river could be distinguished which were dominated by different fluvial processes korpak 2020 in the upper section of the channel between gcss 12 and 10 the channel was formed by deposition incision and lateral erosion fig 10 a lateral erosion and deposition dominated between gcss 10 and 5 with downward erosion playing a lesser role fig 10a below gcs 5 incision played the primary role fig 10a the type and intensity of processes that occurred due to one flood just after the regulation period 1986 1987 and in the long period 1986 2019 were compared tendency to erosion was dominant in both time intervals studied but it was greater in the first period than in the second mean bed level change index was 0 27 m and 0 13 m respectively fig 11 table 1 the values of bed level change index of both time intervals were positively correlated with each other table 2 indicating that the trends of incision or aggradation in the same locations were generally similar this was especially true for the reaches in the upper and lower sections of the studied channel between gcss 12 and 11 and between gcss 5 and 2 which were eroded in both periods fig 11 the greatest erosion occurred in the section between gcss 3 and 2 reaching a value of approximately 1 m in the section between gcss 11 and 5 the process trends in the 1986 1987 and 1986 2019 periods were no longer so clear both the site and the intensity of erosion and deposition processes varied locally after 1986 the values of stream power showed high regularity in the longitudinal profile referring to the location of the cross section fig 10b this was of course due to the method and purpose of the regulation decreasing the gradient upstream of the gcss locally increasing it downstream of them thus downstream of the gcss the values of stream power were significantly higher than upstream of them and the differences were statistically significant p is 0 009 in 1986 0 002 in 1987 and 0 002 in 2019 fig 12 these values seem to be unrelated to the processes occurring in the channel both erosion and deposition occurred at high values of stream power downstream of the gcss 9 8 and 7 zones of deposition were observed whereas downstream of the gcss 6 5 4 and 3 zones of erosion were observed erosion also occurred at low values of stream power in locations upstream of the gcs crests fig 10b and 11 to investigate in more detail the causes of such unusual dynamics of fluvial processes the variability of parameters of the channel in the longitudinal profile was analyzed fig 10c the water surface gradient referred obviously to the value of stream power which was higher in locations downstream of the gcss than in the other locations upstream of the gcss and in the middle part of reaches between gcss the lowest and least varied was between gcss 7 and 3 where it generally did not exceed the value of 0 005 m m 1 the values of the w d ratio were slightly lower at cross sections upstream of the gcss than downstream of them during the study period thus the shape of the channel upstream of the gcss was more compact fig 10c and fig 13 cross sections at this location were generally wider and deeper than those downstream of the gcss fig 10c and fig 13 these differences were insignificant in 1986 but extremely clear in 2019 this may indicate that the channel upstream of the gcss was transformed by lateral erosion and incision the location of the scours formed in the 1986 1987 period was consistent with the location of increased flow depths fig 10c and 11 throughout the entire channel fragment studied its middle reach between gcss 7 and 3 stood out it functioned differently in many respects and not in accordance with the principles of hydraulics despite the low gradient and small values of stream power incision was observed especially downstream of the gcs 5 it was the narrowest section with the most compact shape with the lowest values of the w d ratio however intense lateral erosion was observed the deposition process occurred primarily downstream of the end sills of gcss in zones with the greatest gradient and stream power 4 3 causes of changes in the morphodynamics of the bia≈Çy dunajec river correlations between the bed level change index in a given period and various parameters of the river at the beginning and the end of the studied period were examined table 3 parameters at the beginning of a given period characterize the flow conditions that had a potential impact on the course of fluvial processes the parameters defined at the end of the period characterize the flow conditions that have been established as a result of fluvial processes that have occurred in the meantime correlation analysis showed that the hydromorphological changes in the bia≈Çy dunajec channel were more influenced by morphometric than by hydraulic parameters no effect of the water surface gradient on the bed level change was observed in the studied periods furthermore stream power was an insignificant parameter influencing tendency and rate of vertical changes of channel bed it was significant only during 1987 flood table 3 the best predictors of the location of fluvial processes in the studied section of the bia≈Çy dunajec channel were depth and the w d ratio erosion tendency was indicated by low depth values and high w d ratio values table 3 this was true for both the time when the river was almost natural 1962 1977 period and the long period of operation of gcss in the river 1986 2019 in which the large channel width also proved to be important for predicting erosion this was also true for the period 1977 1986 indicating that the widest and shallowest sections were deepened the most during the engineering works however a short period after the flood 1986 1987 stood out in which high erosion was correlated with low width and high values of stream power in cross sections modelled by erosion the shape of the channel changed to a more compact one this is indicated by the negative correlation between the bed level change index and depth as well as positive correlation between the bed level change index and width at the end of the periods in question table 3 the water surface gradient and stream power decreased due to the prevailing erosion positive correlation between these parameters and the bed level change index at the end of the periods in question such relationships were observed in the periods 1986 1987 and 1986 2019 interestingly no correlations were observed between the bed level change index and any parameter at the end of the near natural period 1962 1977 the dependence of the average bed level change index and the maximum bed level change index for a given reach between the gcss on the parameters of the regulatory route was also analyzed table 4 the average bed level change index was calculated as the average value of bed level change indexes in a given reach between gcss the maximum bed level change index is the greatest value of erosion indexes in a given reach between gcss the distance between the gcss was found to be the most important parameter influencing the tendency to erosion deposition processes in both the short period 1986 1987 and the long period 1986 2019 the longer the distance between the gcss the stronger the erosion the effect of the location of the gcs relative to the location of the natural rapids in the channel in 1977 on changes in the morphodynamics of the river was also considered rapids were identified as places with a particularly high gradient in the longitudinal profile of the river fig 5 gcss 11 10 9 8 7 and 3 were constructed more or less at the locations of the former rapids in sections between gcs 11 and 7 as well as downstream of gcs 3 a rhythm of alternating high and low stream power high downstream of the end sill of the gcss and decreasing to the next gcs crest has been observed gcs 6 5 and 4 were constructed in a section where there were no clearly developed rapid pool sequences in 1977 the rhythm of the stream power run in this section has been disturbed and has not manifested regularity despite the identical mode of regulation and similar parameters of the gcss the section between gcss 3 and 2 is noteworthy it is the longest section and has been heavily eroded erosion was lower only in the place where the elevation of the channel bed remains constant over the years at 1 15 r km in this unique place the trends of the river s morphometric and hydraulic parameters have changed the water surface gradient has increased and the flow depth has decreased a natural rapid has developed here that has functioned almost like an additional missing gcs it should be noted that prior to regulation with gcss a rapid was observed at this location fig 5 despite the artificial regulation route the river has recreated its natural rhythm where there was no regular sequence of rapids and pools before regulation the river seems to have overlooked artificial rapids i e the gcss where the artificial rapids are too far apart compared with natural rapids before regulation the river has developed an additional natural rapid 5 discussion regulation with gcss was the major intervention in the channel of the bia≈Çy dunajec river in the last 60 years before this regulation three sections with varying morphodynamics were distinguishable along the analyzed river section the upper and lower sections 3 2 2 3 r km and 1 4 0 9 r km respectively were single thread narrower straighter and erosive whereas the middle section 2 3 1 4 r km was braiding and wide dominated by aggradation the grade control system unified the morphology of the channel along its entire length however after years of operation of gcss three sections with varying morphodynamics could again be distinguished moreover the location of these morphodynamic sections resemble those prior to construction of gcss the upper and lower sections 3 2 2 3 r km and 1 78 0 9 r km respectively were dominated by incision in the middle section 2 3 1 8 r km lateral erosion and deposition dominated as was the case before the regulation with the gcss at 2 3 1 4 r km in the upper section the deposition process was also active after each flood this section was covered with sediment transported from the section located upstream of the gcs system at 5 2 3 2 r km it was possible especially since as a result of the floods in 1997 and 2001 the longitudinal structures built there in 1971 were destroyed and the channel banks were effectively washed away korpak 2020 the dominance of incision in the lower section can probably be explained by the imbalance between sediment supply and sediment transport capacity montgomery and buffington 1997 the farther downstream the river the less material reaches from the upper parts of the channel and the lateral supply is extremely limited studies carried out in carpathian rivers with similar grade control systems have shown that the transport of material through gcss takes place but over short distances and primarily small fractions galia et al 2016 korpak et al 2021 the distinguished morphodynamic zones in the periods before and after regulation with gcs are also characterized by similarity in stream power distribution in the zones with erosion dominance stream powers were slightly higher and more diverse this was also true for the erosion section that was artificially narrowed and straightened in 1971 fig 4 this shows that within the artificially constricted channel natural rapids and pools were formed as described by leopold and wolman 1957 in sections with deposition dominance stream powers were slightly lower and less diverse these differences are visible in the graphs figs 9 10 but have not been confirmed by statistical analysis these results showed that stream power is not crucial parameter explaining morphological changes in the regulated channel interestingly even in the period 1962 1977 when the channel was close to the natural one no statistically significant correlation was observed between stream power and the dominant processes this contradicts the observations of researchers who have proved the relationship between the values of stream power and dominant fluvial processes in a given cross section bizzi and lerner 2015 yochum et al 2017 these studies have reported that high values of stream power or increasing values from cross section to cross section are responsible for erosion whereas low values or decreasing values from cross section to cross section are responsible for deposition in the case of the bia≈Çy dunajec river erosion occurred in cross sections with both large and small values of stream power without showing any regularity this was especially the case for some cross sections located upstream of the gcs crests where stream power was very low and despite this scours were formed similar observations have been made in the carpathian river mszanka regulated by gcss where the mechanism of scour formation upstream of gcs crests has been documented which may be related to the specific construction of gcss korpak et al 2021 yochum et al 2017 and tolentino et al 2022 have argued that although stream power is a valuable parameter for fluvial dynamics it is not sufficient to predict river style because river style depends also on other factors such as geology sediment supply vegetation and lateral connectivity of the channel with the hillslopes therefore it seems that stream power is not useful for forecasting the course of morphological changes in the regulated channel where both sediment supply and lateral connectivity with the valley are severely limited furthermore this parameter did not explain the channel dynamics even in the period 1962 1977 when the bia≈Çy dunajec river was only partially subjected to engineering works another issue addressed in many studies is the relationship between stream power and channel stability brookes 1987 bizzy and lerner 2015 jha et al 2022 it is a general assumption that stable rivers differ from potentially unstable ones with a stream power limit of 35 w m 2 however not all studies have confirmed this relationship stacey and rutherfurd 2007 in addition to a high value of stream power the risk of instability is determined by low sediment supply brookes 1987 bojarski et al 2005 prior to regulation by gcss the studied section of the bia≈Çy dunajec river generally had a much higher value of stream power than after the construction of the gcss which significantly reduced the water surface gradient the values of stream power exceeding 100 w m 2 were recorded in 31 2 of the cross sections in 1977 and 22 6 of the cross sections in 1986 whereas values 35 w m 2 were recorded in 9 4 of the cross sections in 1977 and in 43 4 of the cross sections in 1986 however because the regulation by gcss strongly reduced the transport of river material almost all cross sections could be considered unstable and incision occurred even at the values of stream power 35 w m 2 channel depth and its w d ratio were found to be better predictors of the morphodynamics of the bia≈Çy dunajec river high erosion tendency could be expected in shallower zones with high w d values this finding is consistent with the findings of lisenby and fryirs 2016 who stated that channel sections with an increased w d ratio are most susceptible to geomorphic adjustments another parameter affecting the formation of morphological processes in the studied channel was the distance between gcss a large distance between the gcss increased the probability of strong erosion which is consistent with the results of lenzi et al 2003 comiti et al 2013 and korpak et al 2021 at very large distances natural rapids can occur where the gcs is missing therefore gcss should be built at the locations of natural rapids marion et al 2004 the 1986 regulation with the grade control system did not fulfill its basic role i e it did not prevent the erosion of the channel bed and did not ensure the hydrodynamic balance of the river contrary to the designers calculations the channel was designed for a q10 discharge material transport and erosion and deposition processes occurred even at lower discharges during the first flood after the completion of the grade control system in 1987 flood with a recurrence interval of about 4 years not only the channel but also the gcss designed for q20 were significantly damaged the morphology and dynamics of the river were completely disturbed after the regulation certainly this is partly due to the mistakes made during the regulation works especially the differentiation of equilibrium slopes between gcss s distances between the gcss l and height of the gcss h in a properly designed grade control system appropriate relationships 1 h l s 2 should be maintained between these parameters otherwise the regulation threatens the stability of the river and the hydraulic structures and generates ecological problems wohl et al 2013 however errors in the execution of the regulation are not the only cause of channel instability a key factor that seems to complicate the predictability of the processes is the supply of sediment which is not only severely limited but also spatially and temporally variable marion et al 2006 the amount of material reaching the section with gcss is dependent on the frequency and magnitude of the floods the condition of the hydraulic structures and the channel after the last flood the supply of material from the slopes of the catchment and tributaries and the condition of the channel upstream of the section with gcss in the bia≈Çy dunajec river this upstream supply depended on the degree of regulation of the channel section located upstream of the section with gcss at 3 2 5 2 r km it had been braided high supply from bed and banks until 1971 single thread and constricted by groynes no supply from banks and reduced supply from bed between 1971 and 1997 and sinuous with a tendency to braiding after the destruction of groynes increased supply from bed and banks after the 1997 flood laboratory studies by marion et al 2006 mart√≠n vide and andreatta 2009 pagliara et al 2011 and pagliara and palermo 2013 have shown that an increase in the sediment delivery with unchanged hydraulic conditions and geometrical parameters of the channel results in a significant reduction in scouring downstream of gcss an insufficient bed material load serves as a cause of river bed deepening and coarsening of bed material boix fayos et al 2007 castillo et al 2007 recking 2012 wohl et al 2013 piton and recking 2016 korpak and lenar matyas 2019 korpak et al 2021 research has also shown that some of the behaviors of rivers cannot be easily explained it seems that a river does not forget its preregulation morphodynamics and is constantly trying to recreate it shen et al 1979 have discussed such a phenomenon the bia≈Çy dunajec river did not allow itself to be tamed for a long time after each flood in 1979 1983 stubbornly destroyed the emerging gcss and the river returned to the old channel but even today it poses huge maintenance problems and the channel is constantly being repaired usually the banks in the section that already showed lateral migration tendencies before the regulation are destroyed this proves the existence of the difficult to explain phenomenon of river memory 6 conclusions the bia≈Çy dunajec river flows in a completely altered channel and has nothing in common with a natural mountain river despite the extent and frequency of the engineering work carried out here in the last 60 years and although a long period of 30 years has passed since the last regulation with the grade control system the river has not allowed itself to be completely tamed the bia≈Çy dunajec river tries to recreate its natural dynamics ignoring the restrictions imposed it is not equally successful throughout its course the supply of sediment plays a crucial role without which the river does not have the ability of self restoration the parameters of the channel play a role in the functioning of the river primarily locally the distance between the gcss influences the intensity of the erosion process in contrast the value of stream power does not directly influence not only the type of fluvial process but also its intensity this is an atypical observation in the natural channels studied so far such a relationship has usually been demonstrated the generalization of the lack of such a relationship for rivers regulated with gcss requires studies in other fluvial systems with such regulation it seems that the general trends of the adjustment of the bia≈Çy dunajec river reflect the natural hydrodynamics of the river before regulation research has demonstrated the high usefulness of archival designing projects in reconstructing the gradual changes in the morphodynamics of a regulated river these changes are often hard to reach sources of information that are rarely used but they are worth getting the mechanism of regulated rivers is much less well understood than that of natural rivers usually the cumulative effects of various human interventions are studied and assessed years later thanks to the designing projects carried out in different years this study had the opportunity to determine how the river has adjusted to the various interferences and to assess its long term evolutionary trends under strong anthropopression this is highly important in the context of the present restoration works acquiring a detailed knowledge of the functioning of the regulated fluvial system will help make the right engineering decisions and prevent faulty river regulations credit authorship contribution statement joanna korpak conceptualization methodology formal analysis

frequently used as an indicator for biological integrity and ecosystem response to multiple environmental pressures li et al 2019 however challenges exist in accurate and comprehensive identification of the zooplankton communities conventional microscopical approaches have difficulties in collecting endangered or threatened species low efficiency and resolution inability to distinguish a large number of tiny plankton and the inability to explore at the community level rees et al 2014 these have hindered the integration of zooplankton community diversity into daily water ecological health assessment systems current studies on zooplankton basically focus on the changes in community structure physiological characteristics and temporal and spatial characteristics revealed through traditional ecological approaches while in the application of zooplankton detection technology the molecular ecology techniques have not been fully studied and they still have strong attraction

572 580 raw reads were yielded via the 18s rrna gene marker through sequencing and data filtering using the microbial ecology pipeline 551 985 reads were obtained with an average of 36 799 reads per sample a total of 655 772 raw reads were produced by the coi gene marker after filtering and quality control 648 266 reads were retained with an average of 43 218 reads per sample according to the edna metabarcoding data a total of 2 phyla 33 genera and 69 species were detected by two molecular markers in the zooplankton taxonomic group 2 phyla 22 genera and 53 species were detected via the coi gene 2 phyla 16 genera and 20 species were detected by the 18s rrna gene a total of 3 phyla 14 genera and 24 species were identified by conventional microscopical approaches the number of zooplankton taxa identified by the edna was much higher than that of the microscopic method table 3 both molecular approaches and morphological identification showed that rotifers rotifera were the main group of zooplankton in the weihe river among them brachionus polyarthra filinia rotaria and asplanchna were jointly monitored by edna metabarcoding and traditional morphological taxonomy comparing morphological species dominance with edna species abundance ranking results we found that the dominant species dominance value y greater than 0 02 of molecular methods and morphology were consistent both of which were brachionus calyciflorus fig 3 species detected in samples species not detected in samples 3 3 taxonomic composition and biodiversity characteristics of molecular data the two gene markers showed a relatively high abundance of otus in rotifers rotifera at the phylum level fig 4 a f in coi genetic marker rotifers accounted for 96 with arthropods accounting for 4 while in 18s rrna genetic marker rotifers accounted for 75 and arthropods accounted for 25 at the class level the sequences of most monitoring sites of coi were annotated as monogononta hexanauplia and bdelloidea while the 18s rrna gene data were mainly monogononta and hexanauplia at the family level brachionidae and synchaetidae appeared in each monitoring section of coi and the abundance of otus was more balanced among various groups while the high abundance taxa of 18s were mainly concentrated in the middle and lower reaches with the gradual decrease of the classification level genus and species the difference in species composition of coi and 18s rrna gene sequences increases significantly but the species composition and richness of the coi gene were increased relatively high the pca results indicated that both edna 18s and coi and morphology can clarify the difference in the spatial distribution of zooplankton communities fig 5 however coi gene markers were more discriminative for the mid and downstream biological communities heterogeneity the first two principal components pc1 and pc2 of the 18s rrna gene explained 56 40 of the variance of the total variables the first two principal components of the coi gene mark pc1 and pc2 explained 55 54 of the variance of the total variables the first two principal components pc1 and pc2 of the morphological approach explained 54 05 of the variance of the total variables in general the results of the two methods both revealed significant differences between the upstream and downstream zooplankton communities p 0 01 3 4 relationships between molecular and morphological diversity there was a significant positive relationship between species abundance and otus in the 18s genetic marker of zooplankton r 0 84 p 0 05 but the sequences and biomass were poorly correlated r 0 56 fig 6 a in the coi genetic marker fig 6c the abundance of zooplankton had a relatively high correlation with otus r 0 97 p 0 05 sequences and biomass r 0 98 p 0 05 specifically the correlation of rotifera was higher than that of cladocera and copepoda in both gene markers p 0 05 fig 6b and fig 6d 3 5 the co occurrence pattern of the zooplankton community by different genetic markers the network analysis results revealed positive or negative association patterns cooperation or competition between rotifers and arthropods in the community fig 7 overall the density connectivity and complexity of the network between species in the coi gene were higher competitive and cooperative relationships among species coexisted in the coi gene while the symbiotic or reciprocal relationships among species were mainly in the 18s gene during spring april the interactions between zooplankton showed positive correlations and negative correlations were mainly observed between the genera synchaeta rotifera brachionus rotifera trichocerca rotifera polyarthra rotifera and euchirella cladocera the dominant genera brachionus and synchaeta had high connectivity in the coi genetic marker in addition some rare taxa with an abundance of 1 also exhibited high connectivity such as cyclops anuraeopsis polyarthra and plationus the 18s genetic marker illustrated that some species abundance 0 1 such as eucyclops sinocalanus eothinia and filinia are characterized by high connectivity in the community 3 6 responses of zooplankton communities to environmental and hydrological variables rda biplots of zooplankton community structure and water parameters were shown in fig 8 the cumulative contribution of the two axes of the water environmental variables rda diagram of coi gene was 55 51 tn tp nh4 n and ph were significantly correlated with each other p 0 01 and had a significant impact on zooplankton communities in the middle and downstream regions the cumulative contribution of the two axes of the hydrological variables rda diagram of coi gene was 54 84 velocity and altitude had prominent impacts on upstream regions while water temperature water depth and river width were significantly correlated impacting downstream p 0 01 total nitrogen r 2 0 922 p 0 01 altitude r 2 0 919 p 0 01 and water temperature r 2 0 896 p 0 01 were the three key impact factors of community structure the cumulative contributions of the two axes of water environment and hydrological variables rda diagram of 18s gene were 49 56 and 48 36 respectively total nitrogen r 2 0 917 p 0 01 water temperature r 2 0 878 p 0 01 river width r 2 0 907 p 0 01 and altitude r 2 0 978 p 0 01 were more important in affecting the zooplankton community composition than other environmental variables the results of redundancy analysis of morphology showed that 47 24 and 44 70 of the overall variability in zooplankton community composition were explained by the first two principal components rda1 and rda2 respectively effects of total nitrogen r 2 0 581 p 0 01 ammonia nitrogen r 2 0 760 p 0 01 and ph r 2 0 691 p 0 01 were greater than were other environment factors the mantel test showed that water temperature r 2 0 826 p 0 01 river width r 2 0 901 p 0 01 and altitude r 2 0 963 p 0 01 had a significant effect on structures of zooplankton communities edna technology showed a better ability to identify the differences of group abundance caused by land use type change the relative abundance of brachionus was the highest in two gene markers followed by synchaeta polyarthra and keratella fig 9 relatively low dominant zooplankton proportion in forest and grassland basins and the relative abundance of synchaeta was higher in the coi gene markers the most dominant groups in agricultural and urban land both are brachionus coi gene obtained more information about zooplankton group abundance which could effectively identify community differences caused by land use type changes 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of edna metabarcoding and results from conventional microscopical method the comparative analysis between edna metabarcoding and conventional microscopical method is important to evaluate the accuracy of edna taylor et al 2017 such a comparison is also necessary to assess whether the edna metabarcoding measurement is suitable for the identification of zooplankton communities creer et al 2016 in our study edna can provide more realistic higher diversity results through the combination of 18s and coi than conventional microscopical methods the identification and classification of zooplankton by conventional microscopical methods are mainly based on external morphological and internal structural characteristics for groups with similar morphology or low abundance this method has apparent limitations the rare species detected by edna metabarcoding in this study did not appear in the morphological identification results table 2 the difference in taxonomic composition was potentially attributed to the high sensitivity of molecular methods for rare species deiner et al 2016 additionally in the process of microscopical identification taxonomists may ignore larvae and other uncountable species and the size of the zooplankton mesh may cause some tiny organisms to escape which may impact the classification and counting skjoldal et al 2013 although considered an effective biological analytical method limitations still exist in edna metabarcoding on the one hand incomplete and inaccurate reference databases may lead to questionable identification of some species on the other hand edna does not allow us to identify stages of life history and health status of biological individuals and could include sequences from dead or decaying biological matter cowart et al 2018 overall although not suitable to replace morphological methods at present edna 18s and coi metabarcoding provides a more realistic diversity index than morphology better revealing the characteristics of zooplankton community structure djurhuus et al 2018 in addition the use of different types of genetic markers could reduce the bias of the genetic markers improving the effectiveness of biodiversity assessment in aquatic communities harvey et al 2017 molecular methods complemented with morphological methods can achieve the scientific and comprehensive assessment of aquatic organisms in our study significant differences were found in zooplankton community diversity between the coi and 18s suggesting that the choice of primer pairs has a significant impact on the study of zooplankton community structure and species diversity the number of sequences and otus classified into zooplankton groups in the coi genetic marker was much higher than that of the 18s genetic marker moreover stronger species specificity and sensitivity were found in the coi genetic marker as well as a better balance in dominance among the three main groups rotifera cladocera and copepoda bagley et al 2019 previous studies have shown that some zooplankton taxa are characterized by complex life history cycles switching between asexual and sexual reproduction and resulting in greater intraspecific diversity redmond et al 2018 the difference in the results of the two genetic markers were also attributed to the versatility of the primers the ability to amplify in different biota and the inconsistent coverage of the reference sequence databases for different markers mauvisseau et al 2019 in addition multiple studies have shown that the number of zooplankton species identified by two barcode markers coi and 18s is larger than that of any single molecular marker clarke et al 2017 different markers not only have different taxonomic resolutions but also complement one another which can make the results of zooplankton diversity research more comprehensive zhao et al 2021 the highest number of rotifer species was detected with the molecular method similar to the existing zooplankton monitoring data in the region previous results also suggested that rotifers have an advantage in the species composition of the weihe river wang et al 2019 for biological diversity assessment 18s may be suitable for classification at higher taxonomic ranks while coi is more suitable for classification at lower taxonomic ranks such as inferring ecological distribution patterns from the species level although the morphological data could distinguish the difference of zooplankton composition the edna data reflected that zooplankton communities were more sensitive to habitat changes since edna significantly improved the capability of species identification 4 2 analysis of edna metabarcoding biomass inferred from molecular methods plays an important role in estimating zooplankton abundance especially when such data are absent from traditional surveys shelton et al 2019 in our research a positive relationship was found between the zooplankton biomass estimated using molecular methods and the biomass calculated using traditional morphological taxonomic analysis our results were consistent with previous studies on the quantitative assessment of species based on molecular methods and both indicate a positive correlation between species abundance and edna concentration bucklin et al 2019 since edna metabarcoding cannot perform absolute quantification of species using the relative abundance of various genetic markers coi or 18s to quantify species produces certain differences this is likely because edna sequence and otu abundances are subject to biases such as preferential amplification and differences in zooplankton biomass or gene copy number across species reeder and knight 2010 4 3 network analysis of the structure of biological communities a large number of studies have indicated that molecular ecological network analysis provides a relatively reliable method to infer biological interactions and key species in complex communities and high throughput sequencing technology provides sufficient data for constructing such networks wu et al 2019 xu et al 2020 recent years have seen the use of networks in exploring complicated biological interactions in various ecosystems such as water bodies sediments and humans chun et al 2020 li et al 2017 the network analysis method based on correlations can construct a network topology between organisms endow different nodes with various functions and explore the relationship between species at the community level it enabled a comprehensive and in depth understanding of its structure and function bianconi et al 2009 network analysis showed diverse relationships between the species owing to the complex influence of nutrient acquisition and spatial heterogeneity in our study rotifers and arthropods often exhibit either a positive correlation between co occurrence and cohabitation or a negative correlation between competition and predation yang et al 2020a among them the network relationship between species in the community of coi genetic markers is more complicated because the diversity of coi is higher than that of 18s coi genetic markers revealed that synchaeta and euchirella have negative correlations with many species in the community predation and competition are the most important causes of fluctuations in biological populations as well as the main driving force for regulating the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems neptune and bouchard 2020 synchaeta and euchirella are ferocious species of predatory rotifers that feed on other plankton moody and wilkinson 2019 changes in feeding patterns may cause different relationships between euchirella and other species in the community the outcomes of interspecific competition between brachionus calyciflorus and moina depend on food density while the competitive outcomes between brachionus angularis and moina depend on temperature food density and the initial population density of rotifers yin et al 2018 note that most of the nodes with high connectivity in the 18s and coi networks are rare species 0 1 1 and the coexistence relationship between rare species and dominant species may play an important role in maintaining the structural stability and ecological functions of communities djurhuus et al 2020 4 4 responses of zooplankton communities to environmental variables assessed by different genetic markers rda results indicated that both coi and 18s genetic markers could effectively reveal the impact of water quality and hydrological condition on zooplankton communities however there were certain differences in reflecting the relationship between species and environmental variables because parts of the species such as synchaeta tremula and euchirella messinensis were inconsistent in the regions of the two genetic markers total nitrogen water temperature water transparency and altitude were the key driving factors for zooplankton community structure and spatial heterogeneity the significant changes in velocity from upstream to downstream hydrological gradients lead to differences in the abundance and biomass of zooplankton in the spatial distribution zhao et al 2013 the two larger tributaries of the jinghe river and beiluohe river converged on the lower reaches of the wei river increasing the food source of zooplankton in the downstream river reach when passing through the guanzhong metropolitan area the community of zooplankton was affected by the increase in nutrients and pollutants the composition of the zooplankton species was significantly changed han et al 2021 vezi et al 2019 therefore the diversity of zooplankton downstream is higher with a more stable community structure than that of upstream previous studies showed that edna based biological indices were closely related to water quality and edna method improves the timeliness of water ecological health assessment yang and zhang 2020 in this study we found that edna results of zooplankton community structure also well indicated the condition of ecosystem status in the weihe river the change in land use directly reflects the significant impact of human activities on river water quality and water ecology shen et al 2021 different types of land use affect the transmission of runoff and pollutants into surface water bodies in varied ways which in turn affect the water environment and aquatic ecological health yang et al 2021b some studies have shown that changes in land use and urbanization have affected aquatic communities in rivers and had adverse effects on aquatic ecological health liu et al 2021 we found that weaker anthropogenic activities may have led to lower selection pressures in the upper river lu et al 2020 forest and grassland have a strong retention effect on pollutants in the runoff and could purify water therefore the number of pollutants entering rivers decreases accordingly and the zooplankton biomass could be correspondingly reduced in the lower river where the land use types are farmland and urban areas intense anthropogenic activities brought about changes in the composition and abundance of the communities while the change of land use type had a negative effect on the diversity of taxa and further reduced the ecosystem function peters et al 2019 growing evidence suggests that differences in riparian land types may contribute to variation in the physical and hydrological conditions of pollutant types concentration flow rate and turbidity in rivers which have a further impact on environmentally sensitive zooplankton communities yang et al 2021a wilkening et al 2021 moreover land use type indirectly affects the changes in the structures of zooplankton communities by affecting the river microbial community structures kang et al 2010 urban and agricultural land accounted for a relative high percentage in the middle and lower reaches where the point source and non point source pollution enters the river with the surface runoff resulting in the increase of river nutrients and zooplankton biomass we found that nutrient is a critical factor in restraining the diversity of zooplankton and other aquatic organisms therefore controlling the transmission of nutrient in downstream area will become a notable measure for improving water ecology luo et al 2020 5 conclusions our results demonstrated that edna is able to identify the variation characteristics of community structure more efficiently and comprehensively this method offers a novel approach to study the diversity of the ecosystem rotifera had the highest otus abundance accounting for more than 75 in both gene markers the first two principal components pc1 and pc2 explained more than 50 of the variance of the total variables the results of the two methods both revealed significant differences between the upstream and downstream zooplankton communities p 0 01 there were significant differences in the molecular ecological networks of different gene markers p 0 05 among which coi gene networks are more complex and had higher connectivity edna can clearly indicate the ecological characteristics of rivers under different land use conditions the changes of nitrogen concentration and water temperature distinctly restricted the zooplankton

land use types led to significant differences in zooplankton abundance total nitrogen water temperature river width and altitudewere the key impact factors of zooplankton community change p 0 01 we believe that our research would provide meaningful demos on the application of edna technology in river ecosystem monitoring and assessment keywords edna metabarcoding taxonomic diversity river

currently under stresses caused by climate change and anthropogenic activities zalewski et al 2021 located at the bottom of aquatic food webs planktons are playing crucial roles in the cycling of biogenic elements energy flow and stability of the aquatic ecosystem khaksar et al 2019 among them zooplankton is extremely sensitive to external disturbances and environmental changes they are frequently used as an indicator for biological integrity and ecosystem response to multiple environmental pressures li et al 2019 however challenges exist in accurate and comprehensive identification of the zooplankton communities conventional microscopical approaches have difficulties in collecting endangered or threatened species low efficiency and resolution inability to distinguish a large number of tiny plankton and the inability to explore at the community level rees et al 2014 these have hindered the integration of zooplankton community diversity into daily water ecological health assessment systems current studies on zooplankton basically focus on the changes in community structure physiological characteristics and temporal and spatial characteristics revealed through traditional ecological approaches while in the application of zooplankton detection technology the molecular ecology techniques have not been fully studied and they still have strong attraction mauffrey et al 2021 richon and tagliabue 2021 shen et al 2021 in terms of scientific discovery further exploration is needed to explore the community response characteristics of zooplankton during ecological hydrology process murphy et al 2020 in recent years with the rapid development of molecular biology species identification methods have begun to transfer from morphological classification to molecular biology especially the development and application of dna edna technology harper et al 2019 edna is the genetic material that can be extracted from the environment of an organism and enables rapid noninvasive and cost effective assessment of biodiversity deiner et al 2017 edna metabarcoding approaches have unprecedented advantages compared with conventional microsopic approaches in biodiversity surveys of aquatic ecosystems liddicoat et al 2022 edna technology can be used to describe the taxonomic compositions of planktonic communities with a high quality reference library castro et al 2021 currently the edna metabarcoding has been widely applied to freshwater coastal and marine biological monitoring providing fundamental basis for water environment protection and ecosystem management schenk and fontaneto 2020 in addition the combination of edna technology and metabarcoding that resulted in a more comprehensive and efficient taxonomy identification bellisario et al 2021 promisingly it has been proposed the implementation of eu water framework directives by applying molecular technologies e g edna hering et al 2018 identification of species composition in biological communities is the core issue in ecology and evolution which is the fundamental unit in biodiversity analysis in this process the choice of genetic markers is the key to using edna metabarcoding technology to study biodiversity king et al 2022 to date some genetic markers have been introduced in molecular research of aquatic organisms such as hypervariable regions of mitochondrial 16s rrna 18s rrna 28s rrna 23s rrna 12s rrna its cytochrome oxidase i coi and rbcl albaina et al 2016 djurhuus et al 2017 goetze 2010 he et al 2021 hirai et al 2013 sawaya et al 2019 among these markers coi has been employed in many recent studies including applications in biodiversity surveys environmental monitoring and dietary studies because of their capability of carrying out pcr amplification from most mammals and insects clarke et al 2017 the 18s rrna has also been widely applied to monitor the composition and structure of marine and freshwater metazoan semmouri et al 2020 when conducting edna metabarcoding analysis of a certain biological group a variety of primer combinations are often used to achieve comprehensive results fais et al 2020 recently researchers used two barcode markers coi and 18s rrna and multiple primer pairs to improve the species detection rates of zooplankton by 14 to 35 making it an attractive biological monitoring method zhang et al 2018 metabarcoding of coi and 18s rrna genes on zooplankton community tissues were also used by some scientists to explore the relationship between biomass and the relative abundance of sequences djurhuus et al 2018 located on the loess plateau a typical ecologically vulnerable area the wei river is the largest tributary of the yellow river the river basin has been experiencing significant changes in ecological and hydrological processes with an array of ecological and environmental problems such as a shortage of water resources insufficient environmental flow heavy soil errosion and sharp declines in biodiversity yang et al 2020b previous surveys based on conventional microscopic methodologies showed that the number of zooplankton species in the weihe river system including the main stem and tributaries varied from 19 to 57 mean 48 wang et al 2019 existing datasets and research results are rare and scattered to support a clearer understanding of zooplankton communities in the wei river e g diversity structure and ecosystem functioning it seemed to be promising to apply the new approach edna metabarcoding to support the identification and analysis of zooplankton community structure and to analyze the environmental driven forces and stress on zooplankton communities in the river system here we use edna technology to analyze the community structure of zooplankton in the weihe river our objective is i to explore the differences between molecular and traditional approaches ii to compare the biodiversity detected by 18s rrna and coi gene markers iii to reveal the effects of land use change on zooplankton abundance and iv to analyze the relationship between environmental variables and the zooplankton community we believe that this work will provide a demo for the application of edna technology in the field of ecological flow formulation and river ecological restoration promoting biodiversity protection in ecologically fragile areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the weihe river is the largest tributary of the china s yellow river it covers a watershed area of 1 35 105 km2 ranging from 33 42 n 106 18 e to 37 20 n 110 37 e

xianyang city to tongguan county song et al 2018 recent years witnessed a drastically decline of the aquatic biodiversity in the river basin and higher sensitivity of biomes to climate change continuous degradation of river ecosystem functions and significant weakening in interference resistance had posed severe risk to the ecological health of the river qiao et al 2020 2 2 land use lucc

standards in the sampling processes the traditional morphology researches of zooplankton were conducted based on specification from freshwater plankton research methods at present since researches based on edna monitoring are still in the transition from technology verification to technology standardization the experimental protocols applied in this study were formulated based on a large number

instrument co ltd tianjin china after sampling wang et al 2021 the filter membrane was then kept in a sterile test tube and stored at 80 c until dna extraction during field surveys to minimize cross contamination from sampling points the water samples were collected first before any other samples or measurements were taken both the water samples collected in the field and filtered samples were stored in time and analyzed within 1 month in order to avert the degradation of dna resulting in errors in experiments liang et al 2022 at each sampling site zooplankton was collected using a plankton

average phred scores of 20 sequences that contained ambiguous bases and sequences that contained mononucleotide repeats of greater than 8 bp the remaining high quality sequences were otus clustered according to the similarity of 97 in the qiime v1 8 0 platform and the obtained representative sequences were compared with the database by blast in software to obtain otu taxonomic information edgar 2010 the 18s otus and coi otus were annotated using blast against the nucleotide database genbank in ncbi available at ftp ftp ncbi nih gov blast db we removed all prokaryotes fungi and phytoplankton from the data analysis based on the taxonomic annotation to focus exclusively on zooplankton for the purpose of this manuscript after decontamination all otus were grouped by their species annotation

such as nitrogen and phosphorus showed a trend of increasing from upstream to downstream tn showed a generally greater increase the altitude of the weihe river varies greatly from 2167 m at the source of the river to 331 m downstream and the water temperature also gradually increased from 4 13 c to 22 17 c in addition as the width and depth of the river increase the transparency and velocity gradually decrease the compositions of land use types in the weihe river basin are significantly different fig 2 large compositions of woodland and grassland areas accounting for more than 60 are distributed in the upper reach region urban land and agricultural land are basically centralized in the middle and lower reaches of the weihe river it is worth noting that the proportion of urban areas in the basin increased from 4 20 in 2005 to 5 86 in 2018 with the development of the guanzhong metropolitan area the proportion of urban land has increased from 6 05 to 8 45 v stream velocity

572 580 raw reads were yielded via the 18s rrna gene marker through sequencing and data filtering using the microbial ecology pipeline 551 985 reads were obtained with an average of 36 799 reads per sample a total of 655 772 raw reads were produced by the coi gene marker after filtering and quality control 648 266 reads were retained with an average of 43 218 reads per sample according to the edna metabarcoding data a total of 2 phyla 33 genera and 69 species were detected by two molecular markers in the zooplankton taxonomic group 2 phyla 22 genera and 53 species were detected via the coi gene 2 phyla 16 genera and 20 species were detected by the 18s rrna gene a total of 3 phyla 14 genera and 24 species were identified by conventional microscopical approaches the number of zooplankton taxa identified by the edna was much higher than that of the microscopic method table 3 both molecular approaches and morphological identification showed that rotifers rotifera were the main group of zooplankton in the weihe river among them brachionus polyarthra filinia rotaria and asplanchna were jointly monitored by edna metabarcoding and traditional morphological taxonomy comparing morphological species dominance with edna species abundance ranking results we found that the dominant species dominance value y greater than 0 02 of molecular methods and morphology were consistent both of which were brachionus calyciflorus fig 3 species detected in samples species not detected in samples 3 3 taxonomic composition and biodiversity characteristics of molecular data the two gene markers showed a relatively high abundance of otus in rotifers rotifera at the phylum level fig 4 a f in coi genetic marker rotifers accounted for 96 with arthropods accounting for 4 while in 18s rrna genetic marker rotifers accounted for 75 and arthropods accounted for 25 at the class level the sequences of most monitoring sites of coi were annotated as monogononta hexanauplia and bdelloidea while the 18s rrna gene data were mainly monogononta and hexanauplia at the family level brachionidae and synchaetidae appeared in each monitoring section of coi and the abundance of otus was more balanced among various groups while the high abundance taxa of 18s were mainly concentrated in the middle and lower reaches with the gradual decrease of the classification level genus and species the difference in species composition of coi and 18s rrna gene sequences increases significantly but the species composition and richness of the coi gene were increased relatively high the pca results indicated that both edna 18s and coi and morphology can clarify the difference in the spatial distribution of zooplankton communities fig 5 however coi gene markers were more discriminative for the mid and downstream biological communities heterogeneity the first two principal components pc1 and pc2 of the 18s rrna gene explained 56 40 of the variance of the total variables the first two principal components of the coi gene mark pc1 and pc2 explained 55 54 of the variance of the total variables the first two principal components pc1 and pc2 of the morphological approach explained 54 05 of the variance of the total variables in general the results of the two methods both revealed significant differences between the upstream and downstream zooplankton communities p 0 01 3 4 relationships between molecular and morphological diversity there was a significant positive relationship between species abundance and otus in the 18s genetic marker of zooplankton r 0 84 p 0 05 but the sequences and biomass were poorly correlated r 0 56 fig 6 a in the coi genetic marker fig 6c the abundance of zooplankton had a relatively high correlation with otus r 0 97 p 0 05 sequences and biomass r 0 98 p 0 05 specifically the correlation of rotifera was higher than that of cladocera and copepoda in both gene markers p 0 05 fig 6b and fig 6d 3 5 the co occurrence pattern of the zooplankton community by different genetic markers the network analysis results revealed positive or negative association patterns cooperation or competition between rotifers and arthropods in the community fig 7 overall the density connectivity and complexity of the network between species in the coi gene were higher competitive and cooperative relationships among species coexisted in the coi gene while the symbiotic or reciprocal relationships among species were mainly in the 18s gene during spring april the interactions between zooplankton showed positive correlations and negative correlations were mainly observed between the genera synchaeta rotifera brachionus rotifera trichocerca rotifera polyarthra rotifera and euchirella cladocera the dominant genera brachionus and synchaeta had high connectivity in the coi genetic marker in addition some rare taxa with an abundance of 1 also exhibited high connectivity such as cyclops anuraeopsis polyarthra and plationus the 18s genetic marker illustrated that some species abundance 0 1 such as eucyclops sinocalanus eothinia and filinia are characterized by high connectivity in the community 3 6 responses of zooplankton communities to environmental and hydrological variables rda biplots of zooplankton community structure and water parameters were shown in fig 8 the cumulative contribution of the two axes of the water environmental variables rda diagram of coi gene was 55 51 tn tp nh4 n and ph were significantly correlated with each other p 0 01 and had a significant impact on zooplankton communities in the middle and downstream regions the cumulative contribution of the two axes of the hydrological variables rda diagram of coi gene was 54 84 velocity and altitude had prominent impacts on upstream regions while water temperature water depth and river width were significantly correlated impacting downstream p 0 01 total nitrogen r 2 0 922 p 0 01 altitude r 2 0 919 p 0 01 and water temperature r 2 0 896 p 0 01 were the three key impact factors of community structure the cumulative contributions of the two axes of water environment and hydrological variables rda diagram of 18s gene were 49 56 and 48 36 respectively total nitrogen r 2 0 917 p 0 01 water temperature r 2 0 878 p 0 01 river width r 2 0 907 p 0 01 and altitude r 2 0 978 p 0 01 were more important in affecting the zooplankton community composition than other environmental variables the results of redundancy analysis of morphology showed that 47 24 and 44 70 of the overall variability in zooplankton community composition were explained by the first two principal components rda1 and rda2 respectively effects of total nitrogen r 2 0 581 p 0 01 ammonia nitrogen r 2 0 760 p 0 01 and ph r 2 0 691 p 0 01 were greater than were other environment factors the mantel test showed that water temperature r 2 0 826 p 0 01 river width r 2 0 901 p 0 01 and altitude r 2 0 963 p 0 01 had a significant effect on structures of zooplankton communities edna technology showed a better ability to identify the differences of group abundance caused by land use type change the relative abundance of brachionus was the highest in two gene markers followed by synchaeta polyarthra and keratella fig 9 relatively low dominant zooplankton proportion in forest and grassland basins and the relative abundance of synchaeta was higher in the coi gene markers the most dominant groups in agricultural and urban land both are brachionus coi gene obtained more information about zooplankton group abundance which could effectively identify community differences caused by land use type changes 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of edna metabarcoding and results from conventional microscopical method the comparative analysis between edna metabarcoding and conventional microscopical method is important to evaluate the accuracy of edna taylor et al 2017 such a comparison is also necessary to assess whether the edna metabarcoding measurement is suitable for the identification of zooplankton communities creer et al 2016 in our study edna can provide more realistic higher diversity results through the combination of 18s and coi than conventional microscopical methods the identification and classification of zooplankton by conventional microscopical methods are mainly based on external morphological and internal structural characteristics for groups with similar morphology or low abundance this method has apparent limitations the rare species detected by edna metabarcoding in this study did not appear in the morphological identification results table 2 the difference in taxonomic composition was potentially attributed to the high sensitivity of molecular methods for rare species deiner et al 2016 additionally in the process of microscopical identification taxonomists may ignore larvae and other uncountable species and the size of the zooplankton mesh may cause some tiny organisms to escape which may impact the classification and counting skjoldal et al 2013 although considered an effective biological analytical method limitations still exist in edna metabarcoding on the one hand incomplete and inaccurate reference databases may lead to questionable identification of some species on the other hand edna does not allow us to identify stages of life history and health status of biological individuals and could include sequences from dead or decaying biological matter cowart et al 2018 overall although not suitable to replace morphological methods at present edna 18s and coi metabarcoding provides a more realistic diversity index than morphology better revealing the characteristics of zooplankton community structure djurhuus et al 2018 in addition the use of different types of genetic markers could reduce the bias of the genetic markers improving the effectiveness of biodiversity assessment in aquatic communities harvey et al 2017 molecular methods complemented with morphological methods can achieve the scientific and comprehensive assessment of aquatic organisms in our study significant differences were found in zooplankton community diversity between the coi and 18s suggesting that the choice of primer pairs has a significant impact on the study of zooplankton community structure and species diversity the number of sequences and otus classified into zooplankton groups in the coi genetic marker was much higher than that of the 18s genetic marker moreover stronger species specificity and sensitivity were found in the coi genetic marker as well as a better balance in dominance among the three main groups rotifera cladocera and copepoda bagley et al 2019 previous studies have shown that some zooplankton taxa are characterized by complex life history cycles switching between asexual and sexual reproduction and resulting in greater intraspecific diversity redmond et al 2018 the difference in the results of the two genetic markers were also attributed to the versatility of the primers the ability to amplify in different biota and the inconsistent coverage of the reference sequence databases for different markers mauvisseau et al 2019 in addition multiple studies have shown that the number of zooplankton species identified by two barcode markers coi and 18s is larger than that of any single molecular marker clarke et al 2017 different markers not only have different taxonomic resolutions but also complement one another which can make the results of zooplankton diversity research more comprehensive zhao et al 2021 the highest number of rotifer species was detected with the molecular method similar to the existing zooplankton monitoring data in the region previous results also suggested that rotifers have an advantage in the species composition of the weihe river wang et al 2019 for biological diversity assessment 18s may be suitable for classification at higher taxonomic ranks while coi is more suitable for classification at lower taxonomic ranks such as inferring ecological distribution patterns from the species level although the morphological data could distinguish the difference of zooplankton composition the edna data reflected that zooplankton communities were more sensitive to habitat changes since edna significantly improved the capability of species identification 4 2 analysis of edna metabarcoding biomass inferred from molecular methods plays an important role in estimating zooplankton abundance especially when such data are absent from traditional surveys shelton et al 2019 in our research a positive relationship was found between the zooplankton biomass estimated using molecular methods and the biomass calculated using traditional morphological taxonomic analysis our results were consistent with previous studies on the quantitative assessment of species based on molecular methods and both indicate a positive correlation between species abundance and edna concentration bucklin et al 2019 since edna metabarcoding cannot perform absolute quantification of species using the relative abundance of various genetic markers coi or 18s to quantify species produces certain differences this is likely because edna sequence and otu abundances are subject to biases such as preferential amplification and differences in zooplankton biomass or gene copy number across species reeder and knight 2010 4 3 network analysis of the structure of biological communities a large number of studies have indicated that molecular ecological network analysis provides a relatively reliable method to infer biological interactions and key species in complex communities and high throughput sequencing technology provides sufficient data for constructing such networks wu et al 2019 xu et al 2020 recent years have seen the use of networks in exploring complicated biological interactions in various ecosystems such as water bodies sediments and humans chun et al 2020 li et al 2017 the network analysis method based on correlations can construct a network topology between organisms endow different nodes with various functions and explore the relationship between species at the community level it enabled a comprehensive and in depth understanding of its structure and function bianconi et al 2009 network analysis showed diverse relationships between the species owing to the complex influence of nutrient acquisition and spatial heterogeneity in our study rotifers and arthropods often exhibit either a positive correlation between co occurrence and cohabitation or a negative correlation between competition and predation yang et al 2020a among them the network relationship between species in the community of coi genetic markers is more complicated because the diversity of coi is higher than that of 18s coi genetic markers revealed that synchaeta and euchirella have negative correlations with many species in the community predation and competition are the most important causes of fluctuations in biological populations as well as the main driving force for regulating the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems neptune and bouchard 2020 synchaeta and euchirella are ferocious species of predatory rotifers that feed on other plankton moody and wilkinson 2019 changes in feeding patterns may cause different relationships between euchirella and other species in the community the outcomes of interspecific competition between brachionus calyciflorus and moina depend on food density while the competitive outcomes between brachionus angularis and moina depend on temperature food density and the initial population density of rotifers yin et al 2018 note that most of the nodes with high connectivity in the 18s and coi networks are rare species 0 1 1 and the coexistence relationship between rare species and dominant species may play an important role in maintaining the structural stability and ecological functions of communities djurhuus et al 2020 4 4 responses of zooplankton communities to environmental variables assessed by different genetic markers rda results indicated that both coi and 18s genetic markers could effectively reveal the impact of water quality and hydrological condition on zooplankton communities however there were certain differences in reflecting the relationship between species and environmental variables because parts of the species such as synchaeta tremula and euchirella messinensis were inconsistent in the regions of the two genetic markers total nitrogen water temperature water transparency and altitude were the key driving factors for zooplankton community structure and spatial heterogeneity the significant changes in velocity from upstream to downstream hydrological gradients lead to differences in the abundance and biomass of zooplankton in the spatial distribution zhao et al 2013 the two larger tributaries of the jinghe river and beiluohe river converged on the lower reaches of the wei river increasing the food source of zooplankton in the downstream river reach when passing through the guanzhong metropolitan area the community of zooplankton was affected by the increase in nutrients and pollutants the composition of the zooplankton species was significantly changed han et al 2021 vezi et al 2019 therefore the diversity of zooplankton downstream is higher with a more stable community structure than that of upstream previous studies showed that edna based biological indices were closely related to water quality and edna method improves the timeliness of water ecological health assessment yang and zhang 2020 in this study we found that edna results of zooplankton community structure also well indicated the condition of ecosystem status in the weihe river the change in land use directly reflects the significant impact of human activities on river water quality and water ecology shen et al 2021 different types of land use affect the transmission of runoff and pollutants into surface water bodies in varied ways which in turn affect the water environment and aquatic ecological health yang et al 2021b some studies have shown that changes in land use and urbanization have affected aquatic communities in rivers and had adverse effects on aquatic ecological health liu et al 2021 we found that weaker anthropogenic activities may have led to lower selection pressures in the upper river lu et al 2020 forest and grassland have a strong retention effect on pollutants in the runoff and could purify water therefore the number of pollutants entering rivers decreases accordingly and the zooplankton biomass could be correspondingly reduced in the lower river where the land use types are farmland and urban areas intense anthropogenic activities brought about changes in the composition and abundance of the communities while the change of land use type had a negative effect on the diversity of taxa and further reduced the ecosystem function peters et al 2019 growing evidence suggests that differences in riparian land types may contribute to variation in the physical and hydrological conditions of pollutant types concentration flow rate and turbidity in rivers which have a further impact on environmentally sensitive zooplankton communities yang et al 2021a wilkening et al 2021 moreover land use type indirectly affects the changes in the structures of zooplankton communities by affecting the river microbial community structures kang et al 2010 urban and agricultural land accounted for a relative high percentage in the middle and lower reaches where the point source and non point source pollution enters the river with the surface runoff resulting in the increase of river nutrients and zooplankton biomass we found that nutrient is a critical factor in restraining the diversity of zooplankton and other aquatic organisms therefore controlling the transmission of nutrient in downstream area will become a notable measure for improving water ecology luo et al 2020 5 conclusions our results demonstrated that edna is able to identify the variation characteristics of community structure more efficiently and comprehensively this method offers a novel approach to study the diversity of the ecosystem rotifera had the highest otus abundance accounting for more than 75 in both gene markers the first two principal components pc1 and pc2 explained more than 50 of the variance of the total variables the results of the two methods both revealed significant differences between the upstream and downstream zooplankton communities p 0 01 there were significant differences in the molecular ecological networks of different gene markers p 0 05 among which coi gene networks are more complex and had higher connectivity edna can clearly indicate the ecological characteristics of rivers under different land use conditions the changes of nitrogen concentration and water temperature distinctly restricted the zooplankton community succession p 0 01 this work will provide forceful technical support for ecological flow management and ecological restoration credit authorship contribution statement jinxi song
