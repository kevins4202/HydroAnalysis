14060,the treatment of acid mine drainage amd using dissimilatory sulfate reduction dsr utilises the ability of sulfate reducing bacteria srb to reduce sulfate to sulfide using organic compounds as electron donors given that amd contains relatively low levels of organic matter the electron donors need to be supplied externally to facilitate the bioremediation process in this research we recognise fischer tropsch waste water ftww as a potential organic source because of its richness in organic acids and alcohols the ftww was combined with synthetic amd at an initial cod so4 2 ratio of 1 8 and was maintained in batch mode for 800 h before being turned to a fed batch mode with an aerobic reactor receiving the sulfide rich effluent from the sulfate reducing reactor the purpose of the aerobic reactor was to remove hydrogen sulfide through biological oxidation the influent oxygen was regulated to avoid complete conversion of hydrogen sulfide to sulfate we obtained up to 92 63 sulfate removal and almost 100 cod removal in the anaerobic sulfate reducing reactor the ph in the anaerobic reactor was raised from approximately 2 to above neutral the subsequent aerobic sulfur oxidising reactor was able to convert up to 96 82 of the sulfide produced in the anaerobic sulfate reducing reactor to sulfur keywords acid mine drainage bioremediation dissimilatory sulfate reduction sulfate reducing bacteria bioreactor 1 introduction the exploration of coal and metals results in the exposure of sulfide bearing rocks to atmospheric oxygen and water this leads to the production of an acidic effluent which is high in dissolved metal and salt concentrations 1 3 this effluent which is commonly known as acid mine drainage amd has been one of the major causes of surface and ground water pollution across the world 4 amd is formed when sulfide minerals are oxidised in the presence of oxygen and water the oxidation process is greatly accelerated by a species of bacteria thiobacillus ferroxidants 5 6 iron pyrite iron sulfide is the greatest contributor in the formation of amd the oxidation of pyrite in the presence of water and oxygen eq 1 is the most important

potentially affected 12 the corrosive nature of amd which is mostly a result of the presence of sulfate affects mining infrastructure and the built environment 13 the high acidity metal toxicity salt concentration and the sedimentation characteristics of amd pose a serious threat to human health animals and ecological systems 2 7 12 18 fourie 2006 cited in 19 minimising or preventing the formation of amd has been done by isolating one or more of the three principals required in the formation of amd oxygen water and thiobacillus ferroxidase from contacting sulfide minerals 2 14 20 21 this has been done through exclusion of oxygen by flooding and sealing of underground mines underwater storage of mine tailings or the sealing of waste rocks in heaps sealed with clay 2 21 23 further sealing is conducted by diverting the water from pyrite rock 22 johnson and hallberg 2005 2 20 23 mixing of alkaline waste rock with pyritic material and or adding microbial inhibitors to kill or slow down the microorganisms which are involved in the formation of amd 2 22 sheridan et al 24 proposed pumping from depth where oxygen is naturally absent to preclude the generation of amd after amd has been formed the only option available would be to collect and treat the amd before discharging into the environment different methods of treating amd have been applied depending on cost and status of the mine whether operating or abandoned these treatment methods are broadly divided into active or passive due to the large capital costs and labour requirements active treatment systems of amd are usually applied to operating mines whilst passive treatment systems which operate with minimal external inputs are more suited to closed abandoned mines these treatment systems can be further classified into abiotic and biotic processes abiotic treatment involves the addition of alkaline chemicals to the amd the chemicals increase the ph of the amd and decrease the dissolved metal concentration by promoting the precipitation of heavy metals often as hydroxide complexes 21 sibrell and watten 2003 cited in 2 22 the application of chemicals in the treatment of amd is limited by the cost of the chemicals and the need to safely dispose or store the toxic sludge formed from the precipitation process the chemical treatment process does not allow metal recovery 15 25 28 physical processes for the treatment of amd include electrochemical treatments filtration reverse osmosis ion exchange and adsorption 29 30 biotic treatment of amd is based on the ability of sulfate reducing

ethanol lactate sugars and other simple organics based on their substrate utilization srb can be divided into two metabolic groups these include complete oxidizers such as the genera desulfomonas desulfobacter desulfosarcina and desulfoacium which are capable of oxidising the substrate to produce carbon dioxide while the other group which include the genera desulfovibrio desulfomicrobium desulfobolotus and others can only oxidise the substrate to acetate 35 in nature simple organic feedstocks electron donors are provided by the activities of cellulose degraders and fermenters the breakdown of cellulose is a slow process and is generally the rate limiting step thereby slowing the treatment process commercially available simple organic compounds ethanol butanol lactate and simple sugars have been successfully used at a laboratory scale however the cost of these materials prohibits their application at a larger scale this has led to the search for cheaper substrates with many organic rich effluents having been tested with varying levels of success these wastes include amongst others compost domestic agricultural and industrial wastes 32 36 here we propose the use of fischer tropsch waste water ftww to provide the organic feed for biological sulfate reduction we hypothesized that the simple organic constituents of ftww would be able to support biological sulfate reduction the simple organics in ftww include short chain fatty acids scfa and alcohols with methanol and ethanol constituting more than 85 of the total cod concentration which ranges from 6 000 mg l to 30 000 mg l table 1 ftww is produced by the fischer tropsch ft process which converts synthetic gas hydrogen and carbon monoxide into hydrocarbon fuels 37 the ft process was developed in germany by franz fischer and hans tropsch to produce liquid fuels from solid carbon 38 the process has since been successfully implemented in south africa by the south african synthetic oil limited sasol and was used to supplement liquid fuels during the imposition of sanctions during the apartheid era currently sasol provides 30 of the liquid fuels in south africa 39 sasol uses coal to liquid ctl technology which converts coal to carbon monoxide and hydrogen the synthetic gas syngas is purified to remove sulfur and other impurities before being passed over a catalyst at appropriate temperatures and pressure producing hydrocarbons of different length this process requires large volumes of water and produces large volumes of organic rich effluent ftww sasol and many other ctl plants across the world have used aerobic digestion to treat ftww 39 this results in the loss of carbon as the organics are oxidised to carbon dioxide and water this aerobic digestion also produces a large amount of sludge which needs further disposal a disadvantage of aerobic digestion is the extensive need for energy for aeration and mixing due to these extensive oxygen requirements sasol has recently developed an anaerobic membrane bioreactor technology anmbr for the treatment of ftww this technology removes the organics from the waste water while providing biogas as a by product for power generation the technology also produces less sludge than the oxidation process 39 sasol as with many other ctl operations across the world mine their own coal 38 it is by design that the ctl plants are located on or near coal mines to reduce the cost of transportation due to this coal mining near these ctl plants there is potential generation of amd in close proximity to them we suggest here that the amd produced on site or in other abandoned or operating mines can be combined with the organic rich effluent generated by the ft process and inoculated with srb this allows for the removal of sulfate as metal sulfides from the amd and improvement of the ph through biologically generated alkalinity organics can therefore potentially be removed from ftww allowing for the co treatment of amd and ftww although literature is scarce on the use of ftww as a substrate for biological sulfate reduction various levels of success have been obtained by using the individual components of ftww as sole electron donors ethanol and methanol being the main constituents of ftww were used individually by greben et al 40 to support biological sulfate reduction the results from the ethanol fed reactor were satisfactory while methanol alone supported methanogenesis bomberg et al 41 used ethanol fed sulfate removal bioreactors with 50 sulfate removal efficiencies 42 however reported 40 70 sulfate removal using methanol as the sole substrate methanogenesis was eliminated by using thermophilic srb at 65 c with ph adjustment to 7 5 butanol was used by sarti and zaiat 43 to provide carbon for sulfate reduction with up to 99 sulfate removals obtained cao et al 44 followed the utilization of organic acids and alcohols in the removal of sulfate and the attenuation of ph using srb their results show that different organic electron donors influence the efficiency of sulfate reduction formic acid 97 sulfate removal efficiency had the highest rate followed by lactic acid 89 malic acid 88 propanol 87 butanol 76 pyruvic acid 71 ethanol 70 acetic acid 65 methanol 62 followed by glycerol 61 all these electron donors were able to produce enough alkalinity to increase the ph to above 7 guo et al 45 reported sodium acetate to be the optimal substrate to achieve the highest sulfide production rate followed by ethanol methanol glycerol pyruvic acid acetic acid n propanol n butanol lactic acid sodium lactate propionic acid and sodium propionate in that order other compounds found in ftww which have been used successfully as feedstocks in sulfidogenic reactors include proprionate butyrate 46 and pentanol 44 47 although some of the substrates have been shown to support single strains of srb most are able to sustain sulfate reduction from many srb strains because ftww is the sum of all these alcohols and fatty acids we assumed that it would be able to support more srb strains than the individual components hence its suitability for biological sulfate reduction the fact that ftww is produced on sites where amd is produced or where the potential of amd production is high makes ftww a potential substrate for sulfate reduction as costs of transportation are lessened or removed in the investigation presented here sulfur oxidising bacteria sob were used to oxidise the sulfide rich effluent from a sulfate reducing bioreactor sob of the genera thiobacillus sulfolobus beggiatta and acidothiobacillus can utilise reduced inorganic sulfur compounds as their electron donors and carbon dioxide as the carbon source 48 49 the two most important bio conversions in the aerobic sulfide oxidising bioreactor are eq 9 and eq 10 kuenen et al 1975 cited in mahmood et al 2007 9 2hs o2 2s 2oh g0 129 50 kj molhs 10 2hs 4o2 2so4 2 h g0 772 43 kj molhs the presented g0 values stp are given for physiological conditions i e at ph 7 under oxygen limiting conditions i e at oxygen concentrations below 0 1 mg l sulfur is the major end product of sulfide oxidation eq 9 whereas sulfate is formed under sulfide limiting conditions eq 10 48 50 52 in this study the conversion of sulfide to sulfur was of interest because sulfur has economic value it can be used in the manufacture of fertilizers and or other industrial products the removal of sulfide as sulfur is also important in that unlike the complete oxidation of sulfide to sulfate the production of sulfur does not lead to the acidification of the bioreactors i e regeneration of the acid 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor set up and operation the anaerobic bioreactors were made from modified 2 l glass measuring cylinders with a height of 50 cm and a 10 cm diameter the reactors had inlet pipes placed at the bottom and the outlet pipes placed at the top with three sampling ports spaced at 15 cm intervals along the length of the reactors the bioreactors were operated as fixed beds packed with charcoal of 1 5 2 cm in diameter the influent was pumped into the reactors using a peristaltic pump and the effluent was discharged by gravity through an overflow tube into the aerobic reactor placed in series with the anaerobic reactor fig 1 the anaerobic reactors were fed with synthetic amd samd and synthetic ftww sftww as the organic source charcoal was used for immobilising the microorganisms no sterilisation was done on any of the materials used and the reactors were sealed to prevent air ingress the initial concentration of sulfate in the bioreactors was 3000 mg l which was initially made up of 307 mg l introduced as h2so4 and the remainder introduced as na2so4 the stock solution of the sftww had a concentration of 20 945 mg cod l made from alcohols and organic acids mainly methanol ethanol propanol butanol propionic and acetic acid the composition of the ftww was adopted from majone et al 37 and is as shown in table 2 the sftww was diluted to provide a cod so4 2 ratio of 1 8 the reactors were inoculated with srb inoculum obtained from passive bioreactors on the roof of the richard ward building at the university of the witwatersrand in johannesburg south africa and were kept in batch mode until the appearance of a biofilm subsequently a semi continuous load of a combined influent of sftww and samd was applied during batch operation the media was enriched with trace elements consisting of 0 5 g l kh2po4 1 g l nh4cl 1 g l caso4 3 5 g l sodium lactate 1 g l yeast extract and 0 1 g l ascorbic acid this was added to encourage microbial growth this enrichment media was removed when evidence of the establishment of microbial growth on the charcoal was satisfactory biofilm growth the bioreactors were operated at ambient temperature the batch reactor was run for 840 h at ambient temperatures before it was changed to fed batch loading the initiation of the fed batch reactor was done when the sulfate levels were at 28 mg l cod was at 96 mg l and the ph was above neutral at 7 29 50 ml of the combined influent of amd ftww at ph 2 cod sulfate ratio of 1 4 was pulsed into the anaerobic sulfate reducing bioreactor each day the sulfide rich effluent from the anaerobic reactor was then collected into the aerobic sulfur oxidising reactor using gravity flow the aerobic reactor was initially allowed to run without additional oxygen as the volume increased this was to allow the oxygen in the reactor to be depleted the pulsing of oxygen was only initiated when the reactor was 75 full samples were collected and analysed for cod sulfate sulfide and ph the aerobic sulfur oxidising bioreactor was placed after to the sulfate reducing reactor fig 1 the reactor was of similar design to the anaerobic reactor polyurethane was used as the immobilising matrix in order to allow the mass movement of o2 and h2s an air inlet and influent inlet were placed near the bottom of the reactor the effluent exited the reactors at the top the influent of the sulfur oxidising bioreactor was received from the sulfate reducing reactor the sob were obtained from the research constructed wetlands on the roof of the richard ward building at the university of the witwatersrand the sulfur oxidising bacteria were initially grown in liquid medium containing 5 1 g l na2s2o3 2 0 g l kh2po4 0 4 g l nh4cl 0 2 g l mgcl2 7h2o and 0 01 g l feso4 7h2o the ph of the solution was adjusted to 7 using sodium hydroxide upon the formation of biofilm on the polyurethane the media was replaced by a semi continuous flow of effluent from the sulfate reducing bioreactor aerobic conditions were obtained by pulsing air regularly using a labotec air pump the amount of oxygen pumped into the bioreactor was limited to allow for the oxidation of sulfide to sulfur samples were collected from the reactors for ph cod sulfate and sulfide analysis 2 2 chemical analysis alkalinity was determined by following the standard methods alpha 2005 of titration to an end point of ph 4 3 53 the determination of ph was conducted using a data harvest easy sense ph electrode and easy sense software the sulfate sulfide and cod evaluations were conducted using a p 12 photometer macherey nagel germany all the reagents test kits for determinations were supplied by macherey nagel germany the procedures followed were as per the supplier s manual the kits used for sulfate and sulfide determinations were viscolor eco test 592 and viscolor eco test 594 respectively the test kits used for cod assays were viscolor eco test 0 26 for cod ranges between 15 160 mg l and viscolor eco test 0 28 for cod ranges from 1000 to 15 000 mg l appropriate dilutions were done to samples whose cod concentration range were between 160 mg l and 1000 mg l the pf 12 was factory calibratied 3 results and discussion during the batch operations microbial activities were determined by monitoring ph sulfate and cod concentration changes as well as the sulfide and alkalinity produced fig 2 and fig 3 the sulfate concentration decreased from 3000 mg l to 28 mg l a 99 99 sulfate removal efficiency this was accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of cod from 5450 mg l to 96 mg l a 99 98 cod removal efficiency the decrease in cod and sulfate concentrations is a function of microbial activities srb were able to consume both cod and sulfate through dissimilatory sulfate reduction this process produces carbonate alkalinity which aids in neutralising the acidity in amd improving the ph of the effluent in this study enough alkalinity was generated to increase the ph from 2 01 7 45 fig 3 this was achieved in 35 days the increase in ph was attributed to microbial activity only as no chemical neutralising agents were added to the reactors this is an indication that the mixed culture of srb used was able to work at the extremely low ph levels found in the bioreactor a function which can be attributed to the resilience of immobilized cells or that there was a wide variety of srb strains as well as the availability of several substrates which were available for sulfate reduction dissimilatory sulfate reduction also produces h2s the h2s produced was however difficult to quantify hydrogen sulfide exists in different forms which may be aqueous or gaseous this depends on the ph of the bulk liquid 54 55 with 50 of the sulfide species existing as hs at ph 6 5 55 at low ph levels the solubility of h2s decreases thus h2s is driven out of the liquid and remains in the gaseous form 56 this made quantifying of the total sulfide species produced in the reactor difficult especially at low ph the method used for this study was specifically for dissolved hydrogen sulfide the results did not therefore account for the total h2s gas only dissolved h2s was quantified with a maximum concentration of 116 mg l obtained these results were similar to nagpal et al 57 who obtained a maximum sulfide production of 100 mg l against sulfate influent above 2500 mg l showing no correlation with the amount of sulfate removed from the reactor in a similar investigation subtil et al 58 got similar variations in the amounts of sulfide produced in comparison to the total amount of sulfate removed they attributed this to the fact that sulfide may exist in different forms such as liquid and gas phases therefore the measured sulfide cannot account for the total sulfide produced at a cod so4 2 ratio of 0 67 velasco et al 59 obtained a maximum dissolved sulfide concentration of 140 mg l using ethanol as the sole carbon source the maximum dissolved h2s increased as the cod so4 2 concentration was increased to 2 5 in the fed batch reactor effluent sulfate concentration was maintained at levels within the recommended range 250 500 mg l against a sulfate influent concentration of 4150 mg l fig 4 the sulfate removal efficiency of 92 63 in the fed batch reactors was lower than the 99 98 obtained in the batch reactor this can be attributed to the fact that the fed batch reactor had limited residence time although a mixture of alcohols and acids ftww were used in this study to provide electrons for biological sulfate removal similar sulfate removal results were obtained using ethanol nagpal et al 57 above 95 sulfate removal buccambuso et al 60 greater than 95 velasco et al 59 94 sulfate removal butanol sarti and zaiat 43 99 sulfate removal propionate greben et al 61 78 sulfate removal and acetate greben et al 61 55 5 sulfate removal other low molecular weight organic acids and alcohols have also been used as sole electron providers in the removal of sulfate with satisfactory removal efficiencies being obtained the near complete removal of cod fig 4 in the sulfate reducing bioreactor was not expected considering that the cod so4 2 ratio of 1 4 which was used in the fed batch reactor was above the stoichiometric requirement for the total removal of cod this was in contrast to results found by velasco et al 59 they reported acetate accumulation at high cod so4 2 ratios as a result of sulfate limiting conditions most studies suggest a cod so4 2 ratio of 0 67 is sufficient for the purpose of complete organic matter removal 62 64 this suggest that cod is being removed by other bacteria such as methanogens which compete with srb for substrates as the cod so4 2 ratio shifts due to consumption methanogens may dominate srb leading to the exhaustion of cod before complete sulfate removal this agrees with findings of lens et al 64 who suggested that complete cod removal in wastewaters with cod so4 2 ratio of above 0 67 also requires methanogenic cod digestion the low h2s concentration may not have been inhibitory to methanogens thus allowing them to proliferate in the reactors choi and rim 1991 cited in velasco et al 59 observed that at higher cod so4 2 ratios methanogenic archaea tend to compete with srb for hydrogen and acetate acetate is produced in the anaerobic reactor as a result of the incomplete oxidation of ethanol to co2 in terms of ph attenuation the fed batch reactor produced sufficient buffering capacity to maintain the reactor ph at above 7 against a semi continuous influent of ph 2 1 in the sulfur oxidising bioreactor the levels of hydrogen sulfide were significantly oxidised with up to 96 8 sulfide being converted to sulfur figs 5 and 6 with a very small amount of sulfide being converted to sulfate fig 5 the quantity of the other species of sulfur such as polysulfides and thiosulfides were not determined this might have led to the theoretical quantity of the sulfur yield being inflated in a project similar to this molwantwa and rose 65 reported 88 sulfide removal through biological oxidation of sulfide to sulfur and polysulfides with 66 sulfur recovery the removal of sulfide as sulfur is preferred as it eliminates odours the corrosive potential of the effluent is lessened and above all prevents the complete oxidation of sulfide to sulfate sulfur is a non corrosive solid which can form precipitates which are easily be removed from the bioreactors however the packing material used in this study may trap some of the sulfur particles in the pores preventing maximum sulfur recovery breaking and washing of the packing material can be done to recover much of the trapped sulfur this drawback may be overcome by using suspended growth bioreactors that do not have packing materials 66 these bioreactors were operated in hot summer temperatures a major concern is that they might not achieve the same results in colder winter temperatures or in cooler climates this is because the rate of most microbial mediated reactions decrease as the temperature decreases gusek 32 however suggested that cold temperatures do not significantly affect the performance of some sulfidogenic reactor designs as some reactors were able to perform satisfactorily at temperatures below 1 c this might apply to reactors which are constructed underground 3 1 sulfur balance the mass of sulfur entering the reactor should be equal to the mass of sulfur exiting the reactor at 648 h the above equation translates to h2s in 117 mg l so4 2 in 325 mg l so out so4 2 out 340 mg l h2s out 6 mg l 32 34 x 117 mg l 32 96 x 325 mg l so out 32 96 340 32 34 6 so 99 39 mg l therefore at 648 h the total amount of sulfur in the reactor was equivalent to 99 39 mg l the average theoretical sulfur output was 102 22 mg l d the performance of the sulfur oxidising bioreactor may be overstated because intermediate sulfur species such as polysulfides were not determined according to 67 68 polysulfides exist in sulfur oxidising reactors and they would lower the efficiency and recovery of sulfur 4 conclusion in this study it was possible to co treat two separate waste streams ftww provided the carbon source and electrons for dissimilatory sulfate reduction with the subsequent removal of sulfate from amd to levels within the recommended standards for domestic use there was almost total removal of cod from ftww this process was able to generate enough alkalinity to increase the ph to above neutral without the addition of any external alkalinity this indicates that biological sulfate reduction can potentially be used for the co treatment of cod rich domestic and industrial waste waters and sulfate and metal rich amd the toxic effects of hydrogen sulfide were removed by converting the sulfide to less non toxic sulfur species in this study although the results show that sulfide is converted to other sulfur species excepting sulfate we were not able to quantify the actual sulfur compounds sulfur polysulfites and thiosulfates it was assumed that under the operating conditions of the sulfur oxidising bioreactor conditions sulfur would be the predominant species overall the quality of the two waste streams was significantly improved this work indicates that there is potential and merit in co reacting two waste streams thereby eliminating the risk posed by either one with the potential to create a valuable product declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this work was supported by the university of the

used to supplement liquid fuels during the imposition of sanctions during the apartheid era currently sasol provides 30 of the liquid fuels in south africa 39 sasol uses coal to liquid ctl technology which converts coal to carbon monoxide and hydrogen the synthetic gas syngas is purified to remove sulfur and other impurities before being passed over a catalyst at appropriate temperatures and pressure producing hydrocarbons of different length this process requires large volumes of water and produces large volumes of organic rich effluent ftww sasol and many other ctl plants across the world have used aerobic digestion to treat ftww 39 this results in the loss of carbon as the organics are oxidised to carbon dioxide and water this aerobic digestion also produces a large amount of sludge which needs further disposal a disadvantage of aerobic digestion is the extensive need for energy for aeration and mixing due to these extensive oxygen requirements sasol has recently developed an anaerobic membrane bioreactor technology anmbr for the treatment of ftww this technology removes the organics from the waste water while providing biogas as a by product for power generation the technology also produces less sludge than the oxidation process 39 sasol as with many other ctl operations across the world mine their own coal 38 it is by design that the ctl plants are located on or near coal mines to reduce the cost of transportation due to this coal mining near these ctl plants there is potential generation of amd in close proximity to them we suggest here that the amd produced on site or in other abandoned or operating mines can be combined with the organic rich effluent generated by the ft process and inoculated with srb this allows for the removal of sulfate as metal sulfides from the amd and improvement of the ph through biologically generated alkalinity organics can therefore potentially be removed from ftww allowing for the co treatment of amd and ftww although literature is scarce on the use of ftww as a substrate for biological sulfate reduction various levels of success have been obtained by using the individual components of ftww as sole electron donors ethanol and methanol being the main constituents of ftww were used individually by greben et al 40 to support biological sulfate reduction the results from the ethanol fed reactor were satisfactory while methanol alone supported methanogenesis bomberg et al 41 used ethanol fed sulfate removal bioreactors with 50 sulfate removal efficiencies 42 however reported 40 70 sulfate removal using methanol as the sole substrate methanogenesis was eliminated by using thermophilic srb at 65 c with ph adjustment to 7 5 butanol was used by sarti and zaiat 43 to provide carbon for sulfate reduction with up to 99 sulfate removals obtained cao et al 44 followed the utilization of organic acids and alcohols in the removal of sulfate and the attenuation of ph using srb their results show that different organic electron donors influence the efficiency of sulfate reduction formic acid 97 sulfate removal efficiency had the highest rate followed by lactic acid 89 malic acid 88 propanol 87 butanol 76 pyruvic acid 71 ethanol 70 acetic acid 65 methanol 62 followed by glycerol 61 all these electron donors were able to produce enough alkalinity to increase the ph to above 7 guo et al 45 reported sodium acetate to be the optimal substrate to achieve the highest sulfide production rate followed by ethanol methanol glycerol pyruvic acid acetic acid n propanol n butanol lactic acid sodium lactate propionic acid and sodium propionate in that order other compounds found in ftww which have been used successfully as feedstocks in sulfidogenic reactors include proprionate butyrate 46 and pentanol 44 47 although some of the substrates have been shown to support single strains of srb most are able to sustain sulfate reduction from many srb strains because ftww is the sum of all these alcohols and fatty acids we assumed that it would be able to support more srb strains than the individual components hence its suitability for biological sulfate reduction the fact that ftww is produced on sites where amd is produced or where the potential of amd production is high makes ftww a potential substrate for sulfate reduction as costs of transportation are lessened or removed in the investigation presented here sulfur oxidising bacteria sob were used to oxidise the sulfide rich effluent from a sulfate reducing bioreactor sob of the genera thiobacillus sulfolobus beggiatta and acidothiobacillus can utilise reduced inorganic sulfur compounds as their electron donors and carbon dioxide as the carbon source 48 49 the two most important bio conversions in the aerobic sulfide oxidising bioreactor are eq 9 and eq 10 kuenen et al 1975 cited in mahmood et al 2007 9 2hs o2 2s 2oh g0 129 50 kj molhs 10 2hs 4o2 2so4 2 h g0 772 43 kj molhs the presented g0 values stp are given for physiological conditions i e at ph 7 under oxygen limiting conditions i e at oxygen concentrations below 0 1 mg l sulfur is the major end product of sulfide oxidation eq 9 whereas sulfate is formed under sulfide limiting conditions eq 10 48 50 52 in this study the conversion of sulfide to sulfur was of interest because sulfur has economic value it can be used in the manufacture of fertilizers and or other industrial products the removal of sulfide as sulfur is also important in that unlike the complete oxidation of sulfide to sulfate the production of sulfur does not lead to the acidification of the bioreactors i e regeneration of the acid 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor set up and operation the anaerobic bioreactors were made from modified 2 l glass measuring cylinders with a height of 50 cm and a 10 cm diameter the reactors had inlet pipes placed at the bottom and the outlet pipes placed at the top with three sampling ports spaced at 15 cm intervals along the length of the reactors the bioreactors were operated as fixed beds packed with charcoal of 1 5 2 cm in diameter the influent was pumped into the reactors using a peristaltic pump and the effluent was discharged by gravity through an overflow tube into the aerobic reactor placed in series with the anaerobic reactor fig 1 the anaerobic reactors were fed with synthetic amd samd and synthetic ftww sftww as the organic source charcoal was used for immobilising the microorganisms no sterilisation was done on any of the materials used and the reactors were sealed to prevent air ingress the initial concentration of sulfate in the bioreactors was 3000 mg l which was initially made up of 307 mg l introduced as h2so4 and the remainder introduced as na2so4 the stock solution of the sftww had a concentration of 20 945 mg cod l made from alcohols and organic acids mainly methanol ethanol propanol butanol propionic and acetic acid the composition of the ftww was adopted from majone et al 37 and is as shown in table 2 the sftww was diluted to provide a cod so4 2 ratio of 1 8 the reactors were inoculated with srb inoculum obtained from passive bioreactors on the roof of the richard ward building at the university of the witwatersrand in johannesburg south africa and were kept in batch mode until the appearance of a biofilm subsequently a semi continuous load of a combined influent of sftww and samd was applied during batch operation the media was enriched with trace elements consisting of 0 5 g l kh2po4 1 g l nh4cl 1 g l caso4 3 5 g l sodium lactate 1 g l yeast extract and 0 1 g l ascorbic acid this was added to encourage microbial growth this enrichment media was removed when evidence of the establishment of microbial growth on the charcoal was satisfactory biofilm growth the bioreactors were operated at ambient temperature the batch reactor was run for 840 h at ambient temperatures before it was changed to fed batch loading the initiation of the fed batch reactor was done when the sulfate levels were at 28 mg l cod was at 96 mg l and the ph was above neutral at 7 29 50 ml of the combined influent of amd ftww at ph 2 cod sulfate ratio of 1 4 was pulsed into the anaerobic sulfate reducing bioreactor each day the sulfide rich effluent from the anaerobic reactor was then collected into the aerobic sulfur oxidising reactor using gravity flow the aerobic reactor was initially allowed to run without additional oxygen as the volume increased this was to allow the oxygen in the reactor to be depleted the pulsing of oxygen was only initiated when the reactor was 75 full samples were collected and analysed for cod sulfate sulfide and ph the aerobic sulfur oxidising bioreactor was placed after to the sulfate reducing reactor fig 1 the reactor was of similar design to the anaerobic reactor polyurethane was used as the immobilising matrix in order to allow the mass movement of o2 and h2s an air inlet and influent inlet were placed near the bottom of the reactor the effluent exited the reactors at the top the influent of the sulfur oxidising bioreactor was received from the sulfate reducing reactor the sob were obtained from the research constructed wetlands on the roof of the richard ward building at the university of the witwatersrand the sulfur oxidising bacteria were initially grown in liquid medium containing 5 1 g l na2s2o3 2 0 g l kh2po4 0 4 g l nh4cl 0 2 g l mgcl2 7h2o and 0 01 g l feso4 7h2o the ph of the solution was adjusted to 7 using sodium hydroxide upon the formation of biofilm on the polyurethane the media was replaced by a semi continuous flow of effluent from the sulfate reducing bioreactor aerobic conditions were obtained by pulsing air regularly using a labotec air pump the amount of oxygen pumped into the bioreactor was limited to allow for the oxidation of sulfide to sulfur samples were collected from the reactors for ph cod sulfate and sulfide analysis 2 2 chemical analysis alkalinity was determined by following the standard methods alpha 2005 of titration to an end point of ph 4 3 53 the determination of ph was conducted using a data harvest easy sense ph electrode and easy sense software the sulfate sulfide and cod evaluations were conducted using a p 12 photometer macherey nagel germany all the reagents test kits for determinations were supplied by macherey nagel germany the procedures followed were as per the supplier s manual the kits used for sulfate and sulfide determinations were viscolor eco test 592 and viscolor eco test 594 respectively the test kits used for cod assays were viscolor eco test 0 26 for cod ranges between 15 160 mg l and viscolor eco test 0 28 for cod ranges from 1000 to 15 000 mg l appropriate dilutions were done to samples whose cod concentration range were between 160 mg l and 1000 mg l the pf 12 was factory calibratied 3 results and discussion during the batch operations microbial activities were determined by monitoring ph sulfate and cod concentration changes as well as the sulfide and alkalinity produced fig 2 and fig 3 the sulfate concentration decreased from 3000 mg l to 28 mg l a 99 99 sulfate removal efficiency this was accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of cod from 5450 mg l to 96 mg l a 99 98 cod removal efficiency the decrease in cod and sulfate concentrations is a function of microbial activities srb were able to consume both cod and sulfate through dissimilatory sulfate reduction this process produces carbonate alkalinity which aids in neutralising the acidity in amd improving the ph of the effluent in this study enough alkalinity was generated to increase the ph from 2 01 7 45 fig 3 this was achieved in 35 days the increase in ph was attributed to microbial activity only as no chemical neutralising agents were added to the reactors this is an indication that the mixed culture of srb used was able to work at the extremely low ph levels found in the bioreactor a function which can be attributed to the resilience of immobilized cells or that there was a wide variety of srb strains as well as the availability of several substrates which were available for sulfate reduction dissimilatory sulfate reduction also produces h2s the h2s produced was however difficult to quantify hydrogen sulfide exists in different forms which may be aqueous or gaseous this depends on the ph of the bulk liquid 54 55 with 50 of the sulfide species existing as hs at ph 6 5 55 at low ph levels the solubility of h2s decreases thus h2s is driven out of the liquid and remains in the gaseous form 56 this made quantifying of the total sulfide species produced in the reactor difficult especially at low ph the method used for this study was specifically for dissolved hydrogen sulfide the results did not therefore account for the total h2s gas only dissolved h2s was quantified with a maximum concentration of 116 mg l obtained these results were similar to nagpal et al 57 who obtained a maximum sulfide production of 100 mg l against sulfate influent above 2500 mg l showing no correlation with the amount of sulfate removed from the reactor in a similar investigation subtil et al 58 got similar variations in the amounts of sulfide produced in comparison to the total amount of sulfate removed they attributed this to the fact that sulfide may exist in different forms such as liquid and gas phases therefore the measured sulfide cannot account for the total sulfide produced at a cod so4 2 ratio of 0 67 velasco et al 59 obtained a maximum dissolved sulfide concentration of 140 mg l using ethanol as the sole carbon source the maximum dissolved h2s increased as the cod so4 2 concentration was increased to 2 5 in the fed batch reactor effluent sulfate concentration was maintained at levels within the recommended range 250 500 mg l against a sulfate influent concentration of 4150 mg l fig 4 the sulfate removal efficiency of 92 63 in the fed batch reactors was lower than the 99 98 obtained in the batch reactor this can be attributed to the fact that the fed batch reactor had limited residence time although a mixture of alcohols and acids ftww were used in this study to provide electrons for biological sulfate removal similar sulfate removal results were obtained using ethanol nagpal et al 57 above 95 sulfate removal buccambuso et al 60 greater than 95 velasco et al 59 94 sulfate removal butanol sarti and zaiat 43 99 sulfate removal propionate greben et al 61 78 sulfate removal and acetate greben et al 61 55 5 sulfate removal other low molecular weight organic acids and alcohols have also been used as sole electron providers in the removal of sulfate with satisfactory removal efficiencies being obtained the near complete removal of cod fig 4 in the sulfate reducing bioreactor was not expected considering that the cod so4 2 ratio of 1 4 which was used in the fed batch reactor was above the stoichiometric requirement for the total removal of cod this was in contrast to results found by velasco et al 59 they reported acetate accumulation at high cod so4 2 ratios as a result of sulfate limiting conditions most studies suggest a cod so4 2 ratio of 0 67 is sufficient for the purpose of complete organic matter removal 62 64 this suggest that cod is being removed by other bacteria such as methanogens which compete with srb for substrates as the cod so4 2 ratio shifts due to consumption methanogens may dominate srb leading to the exhaustion of cod before complete sulfate removal this agrees with findings of lens et al 64 who suggested that complete cod removal in wastewaters with cod so4 2 ratio of above 0 67 also requires methanogenic cod digestion the low h2s concentration may not have been inhibitory to methanogens thus allowing them to proliferate in the reactors choi and rim 1991 cited in velasco et al 59 observed that at higher cod so4 2 ratios methanogenic archaea tend to compete with srb for hydrogen and acetate acetate is produced in the anaerobic reactor as a result of the incomplete oxidation of ethanol to co2 in terms of ph attenuation the fed batch reactor produced sufficient buffering capacity to maintain the reactor ph at above 7 against a semi continuous influent of ph 2 1 in the sulfur oxidising bioreactor the levels of hydrogen sulfide were significantly oxidised with up to 96 8 sulfide being converted to sulfur figs 5 and 6 with a very small amount of sulfide being converted to sulfate fig 5 the quantity of the other species of sulfur such as polysulfides and thiosulfides were not determined this might have led to the theoretical quantity of the sulfur yield being inflated in a project similar to this molwantwa and rose 65 reported 88 sulfide removal through biological oxidation of sulfide to sulfur and polysulfides with 66 sulfur recovery the removal of sulfide as sulfur is preferred as it eliminates odours the corrosive potential of the effluent is lessened and above all prevents the complete oxidation of sulfide to sulfate sulfur is a non corrosive solid which can form precipitates which are easily be removed from the bioreactors however the packing material used in this study may trap some of the sulfur particles in the pores preventing maximum sulfur recovery breaking and washing of the packing material can be done to recover much of the trapped sulfur this drawback may be overcome by using suspended growth bioreactors that do not have packing materials 66 these bioreactors were operated in hot summer temperatures a major concern is that they might not achieve the same results in colder winter temperatures or in cooler climates this is because the rate of most microbial mediated reactions decrease as the temperature decreases gusek 32 however suggested that cold temperatures do not significantly affect the performance of some sulfidogenic reactor designs as some reactors were able to perform satisfactorily at temperatures below 1 c this might apply to reactors which are constructed underground 3 1 sulfur balance the mass of sulfur entering the reactor should be equal to the mass of sulfur exiting the reactor at 648 h the above equation translates to h2s in 117 mg l so4 2 in 325 mg l so out so4 2 out 340 mg l h2s out 6 mg l 32 34 x 117 mg l 32 96 x 325 mg l so out 32 96 340 32 34 6 so 99 39 mg l therefore at 648 h the total amount of sulfur in the reactor was equivalent to 99 39 mg l the average theoretical sulfur output was 102 22 mg l d the performance of the sulfur oxidising bioreactor may be overstated because intermediate sulfur species such as polysulfides were not determined according to 67 68 polysulfides exist in sulfur oxidising reactors and they would lower the efficiency and recovery of sulfur 4 conclusion in this study it was possible to co treat two separate waste streams ftww provided the carbon source and electrons for dissimilatory sulfate reduction with the subsequent removal of sulfate from amd to levels within the recommended standards for domestic use there was almost total removal of cod from ftww this process was able to generate enough alkalinity to increase the ph to above neutral without the addition of any external alkalinity this indicates that biological sulfate reduction can potentially be used for the co treatment of cod rich domestic and industrial waste waters and sulfate and metal rich amd the toxic effects of hydrogen sulfide were removed by converting the sulfide to less non toxic sulfur species in this study although the results show that sulfide is converted to other sulfur species excepting sulfate we were not able to quantify the actual sulfur compounds sulfur polysulfites and thiosulfates it was assumed that under the operating conditions of the sulfur oxidising bioreactor conditions sulfur would be the predominant species overall the quality of the two waste streams was significantly improved this work indicates that there is potential and merit in co reacting two waste streams thereby eliminating the risk posed by either one with the potential to create a valuable product declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

heavy metal pollution has become the most serious environmental problems owing to the rapid development of industry and the accelerated urbanization especially for heavy metal polluted water 1 2 removal of heavy metals from polluted water is necessary and urgent 3 cadmium cd is a non nutritive heavy metal it is highly toxic to all organisms including plants animals and humans 4 6 cd which has a long biological half life of 2 3 years can enter humans and other organisms through contaminated water and the food chain and causes irreversibility damage such as serious damage to the kidneys and bones 7 9 many methods had been developed for removing cd from water including condensation chemical precipitation 10 ion exchange 11 membrane separation processes 12 and adsorption 13 and so on among of them adsorption is a fast and universal method due to its cost effectiveness simple operation and effective implementation 14 due to its low cost and associated physical and chemical properties such as high porosity wide surface area and structured carbon matrix biochar with potential environmental benefits has received increasing attention in recent years 15 16 in the case of partial or complete anoxic conditions the thermal decomposition of organic materials can be manipulated to produce solid carbon rich residues collectively referred to as biochar 17 19 biochar has a wide range of raw materials including wood materials greens and agricultural wastes animal manure sludge bone and so on 20 25 the physicochemical properties of biochar can be largely impacted by the characteristics of raw materials 26 biochar can be used as a surface sorbent to remove heavy metals and biological contaminants in water as well as be used as a more convenient absorbent for heavy metal removal in industrialization 27 biochar owns a high proportion of organic carbon structures with oxygen rich groups which can provide specific adsorption sites for heavy metal ions in order to further improve the metal adsorption efficiency of biochar modification is necessary 28 among the modified chemical reagents zinc chloride zncl2 29 potassium hydroxide koh 30 phosphoric acid h3po4 14 28 and potassium permanganate kmno4 31 have been widely reported potassium hydroxide with good modification effect has been studied extensively it found that the removal efficiency of cd in aqueous solution had been considerably improved by using koh to activate the ipomoea fistulosa derived biochar 32 wongrod et al studied the as iii sorption by chemically treated sewage sludge digestate derived biochars it found that biochar being treated with koh could efficiently improve the biochar sorption capacity 33 in this research biochars produced from four kinds of raw materials crop straw wood mineralized waste and animal residues which are four types of raw materials almost cover all of china s biochar raw materials were prepared and activated by koh the physicochemical characterization of the

experiment cd no3 2 solution with different cd ii concentration was obtained by using certain amount of 0 01 m of nano3 solution as the background electrolyte to maintain a constant ionic strength adsorption experiments were carried out by mixing biochar 80 mg with 25 ml of cadmium solution 20 mg l in a centrifuge tube with volume of 50 ml at 25 c the ph value of the mixture was adjusted by naoh solution 0 1 m or hno3 solution 0 1 m to 7 0 the centrifuge tubes were then sealed and fixed to an incubator shaker nhwy 100b shanghai jingqi instrument co ltd shanghai china and the mixture

obtained supernatant was filtrated through a 0 22 μm membrane filter and then the cadmium concentration in the filtrate was analyzed by an atomic absorption spectroscopy spectra a240fs varian inc california usa the adsorption capacity of biochar at equilibrium was calculated using the following equation 1 q e c 0 c e m v where c0 and ce are the initial concentration and equilibrium concentration of cd ii mg l m is the mass of biochar g and v is the volume of solution l the langmuir and freundlich models are the most frequently used models to describe the experimental data of

were analyzed by tg dtg test as was shown in fig 1 the pyrolysis processes were mainly divided into three stages for all the raw materials the pyrolysis stage of a appearing in the range of 30 170 c was represent the escape of free water existed in the raw materials the mass loss in stage of a was 9 5 7 9 4 7 and 6 9 for sludge cow dung corn stalk and willow branch respectively for sludge the stage of b was appeared in the range of 145 574 8 c hemicellulose and biodegradable materials such as protein and sugars were gradually decomposed at this stage the pyrolysis stage of c was happened above 574 8 c which was mainly caused by thermal degradation of inorganic contents 35 as for cow dung the temperature range of the b stage was from 169 2 c to 562 7 c at this stage a sharp mass loss of around 35 occurred reflecting that the volatiles went through complex thermochemical reaction such as lignocellulose depolymerization and glucoside linkage scission the shoulder shape peak showed in this stage was ascribed to the decomposition of lipids and crude protein 36 37 the stage of c 574 8 700 c was formed mainly due to the thermal cracking dehydrogenation as well as the decomposition of formed char and other inorganic matters 37 as for corn straw the stage of b was appeared in the range of 128 589 1 c at this stage the chemical bonds of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin were broken resulting in the production of many volatile substances and other products 38 about 59 9 weight was lost at this stage the pyrolysis stage of c was appeared in the range of 589 1 700 c which was formed by char combustion 39 the thermogravimetric curve of willow branch was similar to the thermogravimetric curve of corn stalk the stage of b 135 9 447 7 c was mainly caused by the slow decomposition of hemicellulose and cellulose the cracking of methoxyl groups in the lignin part of willow branch was carried out at the third stage of c 447 7 640 c 40 ftir spectroscopy demonstrated qualitative differences in surface functional groups of biochar due to differences in raw materials and pyrolysis conditions 1 fig 2 presented the ftir spectra of biochars the band around 3552 cm 1 was attributed to the bending of oh the peak at around 2881 cm 1 was related to the stretching vibration of c h 41 the unresolved shoulder near 1649 cm 1 co stretching carboxyl aldehyde ketone ester was appeared in the four kinds of biochars the peaks appeared at 1558 cm 1 representing vibration of cc became more apparent in cb and wb it indicated that the electron density of cc in cb and wb was stronger than that in sb and db thus cd2 p interaction was enhanced to result in higher sorption of cd2 by cb and wb 28 the sem images of biochars were as shown in fig 3 sb with irregular shape was observed and small particles were aggregated to form bulk aggregate small particles were also observed in the sem images of db moreover bulk with long stripped tubular channels was observed in the sem images of db these bulks were mainly derived from the incomplete digestion of lignocellulose due to the fact that cows are herbivore animals an elongated tubular structure with regular shape and surface folds was appeared in cb a tubular structure also observed in the sem images of wb meanwhile a smooth surface was observed in the sem images of cb and wb elemental analysis of sb db cb and wb was as shown in table 1 the content of carbon for all the samples was in the order of cb wb db sb nearly 80 of the composition for cb and wb was carbon moreover the oxygen mass ratio in these two kinds of biochars was relatively higher however the ratio of h c and o c was relatively lower for cb and wb the rich of c content of cb and wb provided sufficient carbon structure to provide a structural basis for adsorption of heavy metals only 26 02 and 3 29 of c content were obtained for db and sb respectively large quantities of other mineral elements exist in these two kinds of biochars the ratios of h c were represented the indices of aromaticity and polarity 42 since the molar ratio of h c was less than 0 5 for all the biochars strong carbonization and high aromaticity were existed in the carbon adsorbent 43 44 it was found that the highest ratios of h c and o c were obtained by sb which indicated that sb had lower aromaticity and higher polarity 45 moreover the total compositions of n c s and o for sb db cb and wb were 10 95 34 67 93 61 and 90 04 which indicated that higher content of mineral substance existed in sb and db the specific surface area pore volumes and pore diameters of biochars were as shown in table 2 the specific surface areas of these four kinds of biochars were in the order of cb wb db sb the highest specific surface area with a value of 1467 m2 g was obtained by cb the micropore areas of these four kinds of biochars were in the order of wb cb db sb the micropore area for wb was 1061 m2 g which indicated that most of the surface area of wb was derived from the micropore area and the external surface area was only 183 m2 g the external surface area of these four kinds of biochars were in the order of cb db wb sb cb had the largest external surface area with a value of 1022 m2 g it indicated that large amount of specific surface area of cb was derived from external surface area 3 2 cd ii adsorption the results of cd ii adsorption by sb db cb and wb was as shown in fig 4 the adsorption capacity of these four biochars was in the order of cb db wb sb the highest adsorption capacity was obtained by cb these results were consisted with the change of external surface area of the biochars external surface area of biochar played an important role in the adsorption capacity of cd ii higher external surface area enhanced the contact area between biochar and cd ii thus increased the adsorption capacity of cd ii by biochar higher micropore area was not favorable for the adsorption of cd ii in aqueous solution by biochar meanwhile the stronger electron density of c c in cb could further enhance the cd2 p interaction and then further enhanced the adsorption of cd2 by cb 28 effects of variable factors in the adsorption process on the adsorption capacity of cb were investigated in this research including the effect of the initial ph value of the solution adsorbent dosage concentration of cd ii and contact time the results were as shown in fig 5 the ph of the solution was one of the most important factors that determine the adsorption performance of the adsorbent 46 the effect of ph was investigated by adjusting the initial ph in the range from 3 0 7 0 the condition for cd ii adsorption by cb was that the amount of biochar was 0 08 g for 24 h under 20 mg l cd ii solution the influence of initial solution ph on cd ii removal by biochar was shown in fig 5a at ph 3 0 the competition of h and cd ii for the same adsorption active sites led to the lower cd ii adsorption capacity according to earlier studies at low ph high concentrations of h protonated functional groups on the surface of the biochar 47 it led to electrostatic repulsion between the protonated functional groups and the positively charged cd ii 48 the adsorption removal rate of cd ii increased gradually with initial solution ph values increasing when the ph reached 6 7 the adsorption removal rate was relatively stable at a higher level in the alkaline phase oh led to the formation of cadmium precipitated such as cd oh 2 and cd oh 3 by using bio char by products from fast wood bark pyrolysis as adsorbent 49 which affected the judgment of the experimental results the effect of adsorbent dosage 0 02 0 08 g on the removal of cd ii from water was also studied fig 5b the condition for cd ii adsorption by cb was that ph was 7 for 24 h under 20 mg l cd ii solution it found that when the bc dosage increased from 0 02 to 0 08 g the cd ii adsorption capacity of biochar decreased from 7 61 to 4 49 mg g before reaching equilibrium however the removal percentage of cd ii increased from 31 80 to 75 09 increasing the dosage of cb could increase the adsorption sites as well as bring more available exchangeable sites thus increased the removal of cd ii by cb from aqueous solutions fig 5c showed the influence of time on cd ii adsorption by cb the effect of contact time on the adsorption of biochar was studied by adjusting the different adsorption time 2 h 4 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h as for cb the adsorption of cd ii reached to 3 02 mg g in 2 h which was 38 of the maximum adsorption amount of cd ii the sorption capacities of cd ii increased sharply at a short contact time which was caused by the large quantities of free active sites existed on the surface of the bc in the initial stage 50 after the adsorption time reached 12 h the adsorption reached equilibrium the desorption and adsorption rates were in dynamic equilibrium and the adsorption capacity was only slightly varied around a stable equilibrium it can be deduced that the adsorption mechanism might be related to physical and chemical adsorption in the initial stage the adsorption mainly acted on the pores and functional groups on the surface of the biochar over time the adsorption of cd ii gradually entered the micropores of the biochar material and eventually reaches saturation 7 fig 5d showed the effect of initial concentrations of cd ii solution on cd ii removal percentage by cb the condition for different biochars adsorption was that ph was 7 and the amount of biochar was 0 08 g for 24 h the effect of the concentration on the adsorption of biochar was studied by adjusting the different concentrations of cd ii 5 mg l 10 mg l 20 mg l 30 mg l 50 mg l and 100 mg l the sorption capacity increased from 4 20 mg g to 19 90 mg g when the concentration of the initial solution increased from 5 mg l to 100 mg l the increased sorption capacity of biochar was caused by the elevation of mass transfer of cd ii between aqueous solution and biochar under higher cd ii concentration solution 51 3 3 adsorption isotherms the adsorption isotherms of cd ii by cb was shown in fig 6 the corresponding coefficients of the langmuir and freundlich equations were obtained as for cb the correlation coefficients of the langmuir equation r2 0 95 was the same with the freundlich equation showing that the adsorption cd ii data fitted both the freundlich model and the langmuir model the maximum adsorption capacity of cd ii by cb was 40 mg g according to the result of the langmuir model the adsorption isotherms were all s type 1 n 1 which meant that the competition and adsorption tendencies between adsorption sites increased with increasing equilibrium concentration 52 3 4 kinetic studies the adsorption kinetics mainly studies the specific process and rate of adsorption of adsorbate on the adsorbent and the specific adsorption process and rate directly affect the adsorption effect studying adsorption kinetics is not only helpful for understanding the mechanism of adsorption reaction but also for predicting the migration and fate behavior of pollutants the results of biochar adsorption on the amount of 20 mg l cd ii adsorbed in solution over different time were shown in fig 7 and the adsorption kinetics curve was fitted using the pseudo first order kinetics and pseudo second order kinetics model kinetic studies showed that the experimental data could fit the pseudo second order rate equation well in addition the adsorption capacity obtained from the pseudo secondary model fitting was consistent with the experimental data and the chemisorption rate control mechanism 4 conclusions raw materials have significant impact on the physicochemical properties and cd ii adsorption capacity of biochars in this research the biochar prepared from sludge and caw dung contained higher inorganic materials than that of biochars from corn stalk and willow branches the specific surface areas of the four kinds of biochars were in the order of cb wb db sb the highest and lowest specific surface areas were obtained by cb 1467 m2 g and sb 72 m2 g respectively high external surface area of biochar can promote the adsorption capacity of cd ii from water the highest external surface area of 1022 m2 g as well as a higher cd ii adsorption capacity were obtained by cb higher percentage of micropore area in biochar decreased the cd ii adsorption capacity among the various influence factors on the adsorption capacity of cd ii by cb it found that the adsorption performance of cb was influenced by ph dosage of adsorbent adsorption time and concentration of cd ii the pseudo second order kinetics model was suitable for removal of cd ii by cb the freundlich model and langmuir model were both fit for the experimental isotherm data the maximum adsorption capacity of 40 mg g was obtained by cb declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts of interest to declare

complete anoxic conditions the thermal decomposition of organic materials can be manipulated to produce solid carbon rich residues collectively referred to as biochar 17 19 biochar has a wide range of raw materials including wood materials greens and agricultural wastes animal manure sludge bone and so on 20 25 the physicochemical properties of biochar can be largely impacted by the characteristics

obtained supernatant was filtrated through a 0 22 μm membrane filter and then the cadmium concentration in the filtrate was analyzed by an atomic absorption spectroscopy spectra a240fs varian inc california usa the adsorption capacity of biochar at equilibrium was calculated using the following equation 1 q e c 0 c e m v where c0 and ce are the initial concentration and equilibrium concentration of cd ii mg l m is the mass of biochar g and v is the volume of solution l the langmuir and freundlich models are the most frequently used models to describe the experimental data of

were analyzed by tg dtg test as was shown in fig 1 the pyrolysis processes were mainly divided into three stages for all the raw materials the pyrolysis stage of a appearing in the range of 30 170 c was represent the escape of free water existed in the raw materials the mass loss in stage of a was 9 5 7 9 4 7 and 6 9 for sludge cow dung corn stalk and willow branch respectively for sludge the stage of b was appeared in the range of 145 574 8 c hemicellulose and biodegradable materials such as protein and sugars were gradually decomposed at this stage the pyrolysis stage of c was happened above 574 8 c which was mainly caused by thermal degradation of inorganic contents 35 as for cow dung the temperature range of the b stage was from 169 2 c to 562 7 c at this stage a sharp mass loss of around 35 occurred reflecting that the volatiles went through complex thermochemical reaction such as lignocellulose depolymerization and glucoside linkage scission the shoulder shape peak showed in this stage was ascribed to the decomposition of lipids and crude protein 36 37 the stage of c 574 8 700 c was formed mainly due to the thermal cracking dehydrogenation as well as the decomposition of formed char and other inorganic matters 37 as for corn straw the stage of b was appeared in the range of 128 589 1 c at this stage the chemical bonds of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin were broken resulting in the production of many volatile substances and other products 38 about 59 9 weight was lost at this stage the pyrolysis stage of c was appeared in the range of 589 1 700 c which was formed by char combustion 39 the thermogravimetric curve of willow branch was similar to the thermogravimetric curve of corn stalk the stage of b 135 9 447 7 c was mainly caused by the slow decomposition of hemicellulose and cellulose the cracking of methoxyl groups in the lignin part of willow branch was carried out at the third stage of c 447 7 640 c 40 ftir spectroscopy demonstrated qualitative differences in surface functional groups of biochar due to differences in raw materials and pyrolysis conditions 1 fig 2 presented the ftir spectra of biochars the band around 3552 cm 1 was attributed to the bending of oh the peak at around 2881 cm 1 was related to the stretching vibration of c h 41 the unresolved shoulder near 1649 cm 1 co stretching carboxyl aldehyde ketone ester was appeared in the four kinds of biochars the peaks appeared at 1558 cm 1 representing vibration of cc became more apparent in cb and wb it indicated that the electron density of cc in cb and wb was stronger than that in sb and db thus cd2 p interaction was enhanced to result in higher sorption of cd2 by cb and wb 28 the sem images of biochars were as shown in fig 3 sb with irregular shape was observed and small particles were aggregated to form bulk aggregate small particles were also observed in the sem images of db moreover bulk with long stripped tubular channels was observed in the sem images of db these bulks were mainly derived from the incomplete digestion of lignocellulose due to the fact that cows are herbivore animals an elongated tubular structure with regular shape and surface folds was appeared in cb a tubular structure also observed in the sem images of wb meanwhile a smooth surface was observed in the sem images of cb and wb elemental analysis of sb db cb and wb was as shown in table 1 the content of carbon for all the samples was in the order of cb wb db sb nearly 80 of the composition for cb and wb was carbon moreover the oxygen mass ratio in these two kinds of biochars was relatively higher however the ratio of h c and o c was relatively lower for cb and wb the rich of c content of cb and wb provided sufficient carbon structure to provide a structural basis for adsorption of heavy metals only 26 02 and 3 29 of c content were obtained for db and sb respectively large quantities of other mineral elements exist in these two kinds of biochars the ratios of h c were represented the indices of aromaticity and polarity 42 since the molar ratio of h c was less than 0 5 for all the biochars strong carbonization and high aromaticity were existed in the carbon adsorbent 43 44 it was found that the highest ratios of h c and o c were obtained by sb which indicated that sb had lower aromaticity and higher polarity 45 moreover the total compositions of n c s and o for sb db cb and wb were 10 95 34 67 93 61 and 90 04 which indicated that higher content of mineral substance existed in sb and db the specific surface area pore volumes and pore diameters of biochars were as shown in table 2 the specific surface areas of these four kinds of biochars were in the order of cb wb db sb the highest specific surface area with a value of 1467 m2 g was obtained by cb the micropore areas of these four kinds of biochars were in the order of wb cb db sb the micropore area for wb was 1061 m2 g which indicated that most of the surface area of wb was derived from the micropore area and the external surface area was only 183 m2 g the external surface area of these four kinds of biochars were in the order of cb db wb sb cb had the largest external surface area with a value of 1022 m2 g it indicated that large amount of specific surface area of cb was derived from external surface area 3 2 cd ii adsorption the results of cd ii adsorption by sb db cb and wb was as shown in fig 4 the adsorption capacity of these four biochars was in the order of cb db wb sb the highest adsorption capacity was obtained by cb these results were consisted with the change of external surface area of the biochars external surface area of biochar played an important role in the adsorption capacity of cd ii higher external surface area enhanced the contact area between biochar and cd ii thus increased the adsorption capacity of cd ii by biochar higher micropore area was not favorable for the adsorption of cd ii in aqueous solution by biochar meanwhile the stronger electron density of c c in cb could further enhance the cd2 p interaction and then further enhanced the adsorption of cd2 by cb 28 effects of variable factors in the adsorption process on the adsorption capacity of cb were investigated in this research including the effect of the initial ph value of the solution adsorbent dosage concentration of cd ii and contact time the results were as shown in fig 5 the ph of the solution was one of the most important factors that determine the adsorption performance of the adsorbent 46 the effect of ph was investigated by adjusting the initial ph in the range from 3 0 7 0 the condition for cd ii adsorption by cb was that the amount of biochar was 0 08 g for 24 h under 20 mg l cd ii solution the influence of initial solution ph on cd ii removal by biochar was shown in fig 5a at ph 3 0 the competition of h and cd ii for the same adsorption active sites led to the lower cd ii adsorption capacity according to earlier studies at low ph high concentrations of h protonated functional groups on the surface of the biochar 47 it led to electrostatic repulsion between the protonated functional groups and the positively charged cd ii 48 the adsorption removal rate of cd ii increased gradually with initial solution ph values increasing when the ph reached 6 7 the adsorption removal rate was relatively stable at a higher level in the alkaline phase oh led to the formation of cadmium precipitated such as cd oh 2 and cd oh 3 by using bio char by products from fast wood bark pyrolysis as adsorbent 49 which affected the judgment of the experimental results the effect of adsorbent dosage 0 02 0 08 g on the removal of cd ii from water was also studied fig 5b the condition for cd ii adsorption by cb was that ph was 7 for 24 h under 20 mg l cd ii solution it found that when the bc dosage increased from 0 02 to 0 08 g the cd ii adsorption capacity of biochar decreased from 7 61 to 4 49 mg g before reaching equilibrium however the removal percentage of cd ii increased from 31 80 to 75 09 increasing the dosage of cb could increase the adsorption sites as well as bring more available exchangeable sites thus increased the removal of cd ii by cb from aqueous solutions fig 5c showed the influence of time on cd ii adsorption by cb the effect of contact time on the adsorption of biochar was studied by adjusting the different adsorption time 2 h 4 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h as for cb the adsorption of cd ii reached to 3 02 mg g in 2 h which was 38 of the maximum adsorption amount of cd ii the sorption capacities of cd ii increased sharply at a short contact time which was caused by the large quantities of free active sites existed on the surface of the bc in the initial stage 50 after the adsorption time reached 12 h the adsorption reached equilibrium the desorption and adsorption rates were in dynamic equilibrium and the adsorption capacity was only slightly varied around a stable equilibrium it can be deduced that the adsorption mechanism might be related to physical and chemical adsorption in the initial stage the adsorption mainly acted on the pores and functional groups on the surface of the biochar over time the adsorption of cd ii gradually entered the micropores of the biochar material and eventually reaches saturation 7 fig 5d showed the effect of initial concentrations of cd ii solution on cd ii removal percentage by cb the condition for different biochars adsorption was that ph was 7 and the amount of biochar was 0 08 g for 24 h the effect of the concentration on the adsorption of biochar was studied by adjusting the different concentrations of cd ii 5 mg l 10 mg l 20 mg l 30 mg l 50 mg l and 100 mg l the sorption capacity increased from 4 20 mg g to 19 90 mg g when the concentration of the initial solution increased from 5 mg l to 100 mg l the increased sorption capacity of biochar was caused by the elevation of mass transfer of cd ii between aqueous solution and biochar under higher cd ii concentration solution 51 3 3 adsorption isotherms the adsorption isotherms of cd ii by cb was shown in fig 6 the corresponding coefficients of the langmuir and freundlich equations were obtained as for cb the correlation coefficients of the langmuir equation r2 0 95 was the same with the freundlich equation showing that the adsorption cd ii data fitted both the freundlich model and the langmuir model the maximum adsorption capacity of cd ii by cb was 40 mg g according to the result of the langmuir model the adsorption isotherms were all s type 1 n 1 which meant that the competition and adsorption tendencies between adsorption sites increased with increasing equilibrium concentration 52 3 4 kinetic studies the adsorption kinetics mainly studies the specific process and rate of adsorption of adsorbate on the adsorbent and the specific adsorption process and rate directly affect the adsorption effect studying adsorption kinetics is not only helpful for understanding the mechanism of adsorption reaction but also for predicting the migration and fate behavior of pollutants the results of biochar adsorption on the amount of 20 mg l cd ii adsorbed in solution over different time were shown in fig 7 and the adsorption kinetics curve was fitted using the pseudo first order kinetics and pseudo second order kinetics model kinetic studies showed that the experimental data could fit the pseudo second order rate equation well in addition the adsorption capacity obtained from the pseudo secondary model fitting was consistent with the experimental data and the chemisorption rate control mechanism 4 conclusions raw materials have significant impact on the physicochemical properties and cd ii adsorption capacity of biochars in this research the biochar prepared from sludge and caw dung contained higher inorganic materials than that of biochars from corn stalk and willow branches the specific surface areas of the four kinds of biochars were in the order of cb wb db sb the highest and lowest specific surface areas were obtained by cb 1467 m2 g and sb 72 m2 g respectively high external surface area of biochar can promote the adsorption capacity of cd ii from water the highest external surface area of 1022 m2 g as well as a higher cd ii adsorption capacity were obtained by cb higher percentage of micropore area in biochar decreased the cd ii adsorption capacity among the various influence factors on the adsorption capacity of cd ii by cb it found that the adsorption performance of cb was influenced by ph dosage of adsorbent adsorption time and concentration of cd ii the pseudo second order kinetics model was suitable for removal of cd ii by cb the freundlich model and langmuir model were both fit for the experimental isotherm data the maximum adsorption capacity of 40 mg g was obtained by cb declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts of interest to declare

14062,wastewater treatment through anaerobic carbon removal followed by sulfide based denitrification for nitrogen removal offers significant advantages over conventional processes in terms of decreased sludge production and reduced energy requirements while the process has been demonstrated to treat wastewater with very high sulfate concentrations resulting from saline water supply this contribution assesses the potential of sulfide based denitrification for a broader range of municipal wastewater characteristics a mass balance based calculation procedure was presented to determine the optimal recycle ratio and the corresponding effluent nitrogen concentrations in a pre denitrification system the calculation procedure was first validated with experimental data from literature and was then applied to various scenarios the latter showed that legal effluent requirements may be achievable only for specific municipal wastewater streams with a low nitrogen concentration and an elevated sulfate content 42 g s m 3 e g close to the sea or if a significant amount of biodegradable carbon enters the anoxic reactor to stimulate auxiliary heterotrophic denitrification a stoichiometric calculation illustrated that even with external carbon addition to supplement the sulfide based denitrification the total sludge production and aeration energy could still be reduced compared to a scenario with purely heterotrophic denitrification finally it was shown that a broader range of wastewater types could be treated when applying nitrification denitrification over nitrite

sulfide g cod g h2s s 1 1 introduction anaerobic wastewater treatment for organic carbon removal is a well proven technology which results in a low sludge production compared to aerobic treatment anaerobic treatment of municipal wastewater is especially applied in warmer climates in countries such as brazil and india but treatment at lower temperatures also looks promising 1 2 uasb upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors are widely used for this purpose they comprise typical operating costs savings of above 50 and investment costs savings of 20 50 compared to conventional activated sludge processes 3 yet anaerobic treatment has a lower carbon removal efficiency and therefore may require post treatment to deal with residual carbon in case of stringent effluent requirements 3 moreover anaerobic treatment does not remove nitrogen which leaves the anaerobic treatment step in the form of ammonium additional treatment is thus required to remove both nitrogen and residual carbon from the anaerobic effluent in case the incoming wastewater contains sulfate it is reduced during anaerobic treatment to sulfide by sulfate reducing bacteria srb thereby removing organic carbon from wastewater sulfide production is in many cases unwanted because it is associated with odour and corrosion toxicity and a lower methane yield per unit of degraded organic waste 4 however the formation of sulfide during anaerobic wastewater treatment can also be beneficially applied for nitrogen removal more specifically sulfide can be used by sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob as an electron donor for sulfide based denitrification as an alternative to organic carbon usage in conventional heterotrophic denitrification 5 elemental sulfur is a known intermediate during sulfide oxidation by sob but complete oxidation to sulfate is expected in case of an excess of nitrate as is the case for domestic wastewater 6 the coupling of an anaerobic treatment step for organic carbon removal and sulfide production with nitrification and sulfide based denitrification results in an integrated sulfur based carbon and nitrogen removal process integrated sulfur based carbon and nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater has recently been demonstrated on a large scale to treat municipal wastewater characterized by high sulfate concentrations over 150 g so 4 2 s m 3 resulting from the usage of seawater for toilet flushing this so called sani sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification nitrification integrated process 5 7 involves up to 60 70 reduction in excess sludge compared to a conventional wastewater treatment process taking up 30 40 less volume 7 this process also promotes saline water supply as an economic and sustainable solution for water scarcity in wastewater from municipalities without seawater toilet flushing sulfate is also commonly present but in a lower concentration range 8 24 g so 4 2 s m 3 8 nevertheless the concentration range of sulfate in municipal wastewater is typically higher when located closer to the sea grab samples indicated concentrations up to 44 g so 4 2 s m 3 in the influent of a wwtp close to the sea or due to brackish sulfate rich groundwater intrusion 9 furthermore the conditions in municipal wastewater treatment are well suited for the application of biological sulfate reduction for organic carbon removal provided that the concentration of sulfate is sufficiently high cod so 4 2 0 67 g cod g so 4 2 1 9 alternative process configurations have been proposed in regions where limiting sulfate concentrations are expected 10 in some cases experimental measurements revealed the presence of an unknown sulfur source which made it possible to remove more than 75 of the chemical oxygen demand excluding sulfide through anaerobic treatment thereby extending its beneficial application to more locations than initially expected 11 these findings also broaden the potential scope of sulfide based denitrification as part of a subsequent nitrogen removal step which this study focuses on this contribution assesses the application potential of sulfide based nitrogen removal for non saline municipal wastewater i e without seawater toilet flushing but including the higher sulfate concentrations encountered in coastal regions a calculation procedure based on steady state mass balances for a pre denitrification system is presented first to calculate the optimal recycle flow rate and corresponding lowest effluent nitrogen concentration this procedure was validated based on experimental data available in literature sulfide based nitrogen removal over nitrite was proposed in this study as an alternative to sulfide based nitrogen removal over nitrate for wastewaters with a relatively lower incoming sulfate concentration because of the 40 less electron donor usage for both process options scenario analysis was applied to investigate for which municipal wastewater characteristics sulfide based denitrification is able to meet the eu directive nitrogen standards 2 calculation procedure optimal recycle ratio and effluent nitrogen concentration 2 1 process configuration for sulfide based nitrogen removal the feasibility of nitrogen removal through sulfide based denitrification was assessed considering a pre denitrification system fig 1 analogous to the ones applying conventional heterotrophic denitrification in this configuration the nitrification reactor is placed after the denitrification reactor in order to make the best possible use of the electron donor organic carbon or sulfide for denitrification avoiding its aerobic oxidation 12 during nitrification ammonium present in the influent is oxidized with oxygen to nitrate by nitrifying bacteria a recycle stream q r m 3 d 1 brings nitrate from the nitrification reactor to the anoxic denitrification reactor the influent is assumed not to contain nitrate nor nitrite during sulfide based denitrification nitrate no 3 is converted into nitrogen gas while sulfide is oxidized into sulfate by sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob beside sulfide also residual organic carbon remaining after the preceding anaerobic step can be used as electron donor for denitrification the sulfide based pre denitrification and nitrification processes are typically realized in moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs 7 in this contribution sulfide based pre denitrification over nitrite instead of over nitrate was considered as an alternative process option implying 40 less electron donors needed to this end ammonium needs to be oxidized to nitrite and consequently nitrite is denitrified to nitrogen gas 2 2 denitrification potential the procedure for sulfide based nitrogen removal presented in this study was based on the well established calculation procedure of 13 for conventional nitrogen removal over nitrate in pre denitrification systems the denitrification potential is defined as the mass of nitrate or nitrite per influent volume that can be denitrified biologically in the anoxic reactor to which extent nitrate or nitrite removal actually takes place in the anoxic reactor depends on the amount of nitrate nitrite present as supplied through the recycle flow 14 the denitrification potential over nitrate d p no 3 g n m 3 eq 1 or nitrite d p no 2 g n m 3 eq 2 is defined based on h2s and organics as electron donors 1 d p no

the amount of nitrate and nitrite consumed per gram h 2 s respectively while 1 y h 2 86 and 1 y h 1 71 represents the amount of nitrate and nitrite consumed per gram cod respectively see fig 1 and table a 1 in supplementary information the denitrification potential expresses the amount of nitrate eq 1 or nitrite eq 2 which can stoichiometrically be denitrified considering the available electron donors no kinetic limitations are considered in the anoxic reactor the complete amount of h 2 s and organics is assumed to be available for denitrification this implies a large enough anoxic volume to achieve complete consumption within the residence time in this study the applicability of sulfide based denitrification over nitrate was investigated assuming no nitrite accumulation in the aerobic or anoxic reactor to examine the applicability of sulfide based denitrification over nitrite only nitrite formation was considered in the aerobic reactor and no nitrate formation while in the anoxic reactor denitrification of nitrite to nitrogen gas was considered 2 3 equivalent nitrate nitrite load optimal recycle ratio the denitrification potential relates to the amount of electron donors that enters the anoxic reactor the amount of nitrate or nitrite that will be actually denitrified depends on the amount of electron acceptors entering the anoxic reactor through the recycle flow the total electron acceptor load comprises not only nitrate or nitrite formed in the aerobic reactor but also oxygen which is unavoidably recycled along the resulting so called equivalent nitrate load n nlp no 3 g n m 3 or equivalent nitrite load n nlp no 2 g n m 3 expressed per volume of influent flow is defined by eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 n nlp no 3 s no 3 e r s o 2 r 2 86 r 4 n nlp no 2 s no 2 e r s o

concentration in the recycle stream g o2 m 3 and r the recycle ratio between the recycle flow rate and the influent flow rate 5 r q r q i the optimal recycle ratio is obtained when the equivalent nitrate or nitrite load is equal to the corresponding denitrification potential in this case all the nitrate or nitrite entering the anoxic reactor will be completely converted to nitrogen gas through denitrification so no nitrate or nitrite will be present in the outflow of the anoxic reactor as a result the effluent nitrate or nitrite concentration denoted by s no x e in general will be determined by the amount of nitrate or nitrite produced by nitrification 6 s no x e n c 1 r in which n c g n m 3 denotes the nitrification capacity which is defined as the mass of nitrate or nitrite produced from the influent tkn by nitrification per influent volume and which is calculated as the difference between the influent and effluent tkn concentrations 7 n c c tkn i c tkn e nitrogen removal through incorporation in the sludge was reasonably neglected in eq 7 indeed while about 20 of the influent nitrogen ends up in the sludge for activated sludge processes 13 this fraction will be much lower for the process setup in this study because i most organic carbon has been removed in the preceding anaerobic reactor ii the growth yield of autotrophic denitrifiers is low in comparison to heterotrophic denitrifiers and iii the solids retention time in biofilm systems is usually long leading to a low sludge production appendix b in supplementary information note that the calculation of the effluent nitrate and nitrite concentrations from n c by eq 6 takes into account the dilution caused by the recycle flow rate r eq 5 the optimal recycle ratios r opt no 3 for nitrogen removal over nitrate r opt no 2 for nitrogen removal over nitrite respectively are obtained by setting the equivalent nitrate load eq 3 or equivalent nitrite load eq 4 equal to the corresponding denitrification potential eq 1 or eq 2 substituting the effluent nitrate or nitrite concentration by eq 6 and solving the resulting equation for the recycle ratio 8 r opt no 3 d p no 3 n c s o 2 r 2

and overloading r r opt no x in what follows the effluent nitrate or nitrite concentrations is calculated for each of these cases in case the optimal recycle ratio is applied the equivalent nitrate or nitrite load is equal to the corresponding denitrification potential so the anoxic reactor is optimally loaded leading to the maximal nitrogen removal and the minimal effluent nitrate or nitrite concentration the latter is obtained by eq 6 in which r r opt no 3 eq 8 or r r opt no 2 eq 9 in case the recycle ratio is lower than the optimum value the equivalent nitrate or nitrite load is lower than the corresponding denitrification potential the anoxic reactor is then underloaded with electron acceptors recycled nitrate nitrite and oxygen coming from the aerobic reactor which will be completely converted the available electron donors h 2 s and organics are not completely consumed i e the denitrification potential is not completely used increasing the recycle flow rate would increase the nitrogen removal so the performance is less than optimal the effluent nitrate and nitrite concentrations are calculated based on eq 6 which is valid for recycle ratios lower than or equal to the optimal recycle ratio 10 s no 3 e n c 1 r for r r opt no 3 11 s no 2 e n c 1 r for r r opt no 2 in case the applied recycle ratio would be higher than the optimal one the equivalent nitrate or nitrite load is higher than the corresponding denitrification potential the anoxic reactor is then overloaded with electron acceptors coming from the aerobic reactor so not all recycled nitrate nitrite can be denitrified increasing the recycle flow rate beyond the optimal value leads to decreased denitrification because the dissolved oxygen input from the aerobic reactor increases and this is a preferred electron acceptor compared to nitrate nitrite 15 the effluent nitrate or nitrite concentration is calculated as the difference between the amount of nitrate nitrite formed through nitrification added up with the nitrate nitrite equivalent of the oxygen concentration and the denitrification potential 12 s no 3 e n c s o 2 r 2 86 r d p no 3 for r r opt no 3 13 s no 2 e n c s o 2

becomes so high that the denitrification potential is completely used up by dissolved oxygen coming from the aerobic reactor no denitrification can take place this is the case when s o 2 r 2 86 r d p

calculation procedure presented in this study was validated against experimental data from literature of a lab scale sulfur based carbon and nitrogen removal process treating saline wastewater 16 in the latter study the effluent nitrate concentrations and nitrogen removal efficiencies were investigated under different recycle flow rates between the aerobic and anoxic filter in order to determine the optimal recycle flow rate in this study the experimentally obtained values were compared to the ones obtained from the calculation procedure and considering nitrification denitrification over nitrate with the parameter values from table 2 for the average anaerobic effluent tkn and hydrogen sulfide concentrations from 16 table 1 from the latter study the reported amount of organic carbon additionally consumed in the anoxic filter was taken assuming that not the complete amount of anaerobic effluent organic carbon is necessarily biodegradable the feasibility of sulfide based nitrogen removal was assessed for a range of typical municipal wastewater characteristics after anaerobic treatment table 1 the hydrogen sulfide sulfur concentration s h 2 s i entering the denitrification reactor was taken from typical so 4 2 concentrations of municipal wastewater this assumes a complete reduction of so 4 2 to dissolved h 2 s in the preceding anaerobic reactor and no gas phase losses due to minimal biogas production and the improved solubility of h 2 s at alkaline conditions as observed in a pilot study with municipal wastewater 11 a small amount of influent biodegradable organics c org i was assumed as well based on reported measurements of cod in the influent and effluent of sulfide based denitrification reactors following anaerobic treatment 18 16 19 5 7 appendix c in supplementary information typical values of c tkn i in raw municipal wastewater were taken 17 to calculate the nitrification capacity a well functioning nitrification reactor was assumed resulting in an effluent tkn concentration c tkn e of 2 g n m 3 at all times in practice high recycle rates from the aerobic to the anoxic reactor could lead to short circuiting and very low recycle rates may lead to sulfide slipping to the aerobic reactor where it might inhibit nitrification 20 22 however these situations should be avoided for optimal operation in the recycle stream 4 5 g o 2 m 3 was assumed to be present based on measurements in a large scale sani process 7 for sulfide based denitrification over nitrite a lower oxygen concentration in the recycle stream of 3 g o 2 m 3 was assumed based on a study of 23 on nitritation in a mbbr table 2 summarizes the applied parameter values according to the eu directive 98 15 ec the total effluent nitrogen concentration of an urban wastewater treatment plant should not exceed 15 g n m 3 for areas with 10 000 100 000 p e or 10 g n m 3 for areas with more than 100 000 p e and or have a minimum percentage of reduction i e total nitrogen removal efficiency of 70 80 the total nitrogen removal efficiency n removal was calculated as the difference between the incoming nitrogen tkn concentration and the outgoing nitrogen concentration tkn nitrate or nitrite relative to the influent tkn concentration 16 n removal c tkn i c tkn e s no 3 e s no 2 e c tkn i 100 these legal requirements were used as criteria to determine which municipal wastewater types could potentially be treated with sulfide based denitrification dedicated operating diagrams that map the applicability of sulfide based denitrification over nitrate and over nitrite in terms of influent hydrogen sulfide and organic carbon concentrations were set up the calculation procedure and operating diagrams presented in this study indicate which wastewaters could potentially be treated with sulfide based nitrogen removal the procedure is based on the following assumptions i steady state mass balances ii complete conversion of sulfate to h 2 s in the preceding reactor and no loss of h 2 s to the gas phase iii no kinetic limitations in the anoxic reactor iv a well functioning nitrification reactor ensuring an effluent tkn concentration as low as 2 g n m 3 these assumptions may entail a somewhat overestimation of the reactor performance the proposed procedure should therefore not be seen as a final confirmation of the applicability of sulfide based denitrification but should rather be used to identify interesting scenarios for further research 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of the calculation procedure the effluent nitrate concentrations calculated from eq 10 or eq 12 depending on the recycle ratio closely matched the experimentally measured data by tsang et al 16 for all investigated recycle ratios fig 2 a the nitrogen removal efficiency was well reproduced for recycle ratios up to 3 but was overestimated for the highest recycle ratio studied by tsang et al 16 namely r 4 tsang et al 16 and wang et al 5 who examined the same lab scale process hypothesized that this drop in the removal efficiency was due to short circuiting flows in the nitrification reactor such hydraulic constraints associated with scale were not included in the calculation procedure in this study which assumed a well functioning nitrification reactor in all cases as a result the calculated optimal recycle flow rate amounted to r opt 12 fig d 1 in supplementary information which is higher than the value r opt 3 found experimentally overall the validation confirms that the calculation procedure despite its associated assumptions is suitable to identify interesting scenarios for further research 4 2 applicability of sulfide based denitrification over nitrate 4 2 1 reference scenario the calculation procedure was illustrated for the reference scenario table 1 considering nitrogen removal over nitrate fig 3 summarizes the influence of the recycle ratio on the performance of the denitrification reactor in terms of the used denitrification potential and the effluent nitrate concentration the optimal recycle ratio for nitrogen removal over nitrate was calculated from eq 8 as r opt no 3 0 22 for recycle ratios between zero and 0 22 the anoxic reactor is underloaded with nitrate and oxygen r r opt no 3 which implies that a portion of the denitrification potential d p no 3 is unused fig 3 a as a result in this zone an increasing recycle rate of nitrate and oxygen to the anoxic reactor results in a decreasing effluent nitrate concentration until a recycle ratio of 0 22 is reached at the optimal recycle ratio r opt no 3 0 22 the denitrification potential is fully used and its maximum portion is used for nitrate removal in other words the equivalent nitrate load on the anoxic reactor is equal to the denitrification potential the recycle ratio corresponding with the lowest effluent nitrate concentration is termed the optimal recycle ratio r opt no 3 and in this case amounts to 0 22 for increasing recycle ratios beyond r opt no 3 0 22 more oxygen will be recycled to the denitrification reactor which will be preferentially used as an electron acceptor resulting in a larger fraction of the denitrification potential used for oxygen removal on its turn leading to higher effluent nitrate concentrations note that when increasing the recycle ratio to values higher than 6 74 the amount of do entering the anoxic reactor s o 2 r r 2 86 is even higher than the denitrification potential d p no 3 at this point all electron donors are consumed with oxygen while nitrate leaves the process unconverted no nitrogen removal takes place anymore which constitutes the limit of applicability of eq 12 the denitrification performance is optimal at r opt no 3 but even at this optimal recycle ratio the effluent nitrate concentration remains too high 48 g n m 3 15 g n m 3 and the nitrogen removal efficiency too low 17 70 to meet the prevailing effluent standards this is due to the low optimal recycle rate which makes that most of the nitrate formed in the aerobic reactor is simply discharged via the effluent it can be concluded that sulfide based denitrification over nitrate is not feasible for the reference case since the legal performance requirements cannot be met even under the best circumstances r r opt due to physical and bio chemical constraints 4 2 2 applicability for a range of municipal wastewater characteristics apart from the reference scenario for which the effluent nitrate concentration was too high the applicability of sulfide based denitrification was examined for a wide range of municipal wastewater characteristics increasing influent h 2 s and or organic carbon concentrations resulted in a higher denitrification potential d p no 3 eq 1 in order to fully use the denitrification potential more nitrate had to be recycled from the aerobic to the anoxic reactor resulting in a higher optimal recycle ratio r opt no 3 for increasing influent h 2 s and influent organic carbon concentrations fig e 2 b in supplementary information as a result also more nitrate was denitrified in the anoxic reactor and the effluent nitrate concentration decreased as a result the applicability of sulfide based denitrification increased with increasing influent h 2 s and or influent organic carbon concentrations fig 4 b the influent tkn concentrations also affected the optimal recycle ratio and the applicability of sulfide based denitrification decreasing the influent tkn concentration from 60 to 30 g n m 3 led to a lower nitrification capacity n c as a consequence the equivalent nitrate load was lower the optimal recycle ratio was higher fig e 2 in supplementary information and the effluent nitrate concentration was lower implying a higher nitrogen removal efficiency overall the applicability of sulfide based denitrification increased with decreasing influent tkn concentrations fig 4 for example considering an influent tkn concentration of 30 g n m 3 and an influent biodegradable organics concentration of 12 g cod m 3 sulfide based denitrification over nitrate may be applicable if the wastewater contains an influent hydrogen sulfide concentration higher than 42 g s m 3 fig 4 a for a hydrogen sulfide concentration of 44 g s m 3 an effluent nitrate concentration of 6 g n m 3 may be achieved this is lower than the maximum allowable effluent nitrogen concentration of 15 g n m 3 10 000 100 000 p e and 10 g n m 3 100 000 p e taking into account the effluent tkn concentration also a nitrogen removal efficiency of more than 70 is achieved even though this influent hydrogen sulfide concentration is higher than the ones typically expected for municipal wastewater table 1 such high concentrations are possible for e g a wwtp close to the sea 9 furthermore other sulfur sources could still be present in wastewater leading to higher sulfide concentrations than originating from sulfate only a topic that warrants further research 11 4 2 3 plant wide calculation for lower influent hydrogen sulfide concentrations more influent biodegradable organics would be required to have sufficient total electron donor for denitrification for instance for an influent hydrogen sulfide concentration of 24 g s m 3 and an influent tkn concentration of 30 g n m 3 about 100 g bcod m 3 would need to be supplied fig 4 a this is higher than typical influent biodegradable organic carbon concentrations present in anaerobically pre treated municipal wastewater table 1 in order to supply additional biodegradable organics to the pre denitrification system either the anaerobic pre treatment could be operated such that a higher amount of biodegradable organics remains in the anaerobic effluent alternatively external organic carbon should be dosed to the anoxic reactor in any case this implies relatively more heterotrophic denitrification besides sulfide based denitrification a plant wide calculation was performed comparing scenario a based on anaerobic carbon removal and sulfide heterotrophic denitrification with a conventional scenario b based on carbon and nitrogen removal in a pre denitrification configuration fig 5 the theoretical plant wide calculation was based on the assumption of complete sulfate reduction in the anaerobic reactor and complete sulfide oxidation to sulfate in the anoxic reactor this implies no detrimental influence of residual h 2 s in the consecutive aerobic reactor the calculations for the sludge production and the oxygen consumption are detailed in appendix f tables f 4 and f 5 the results show that even when denitrification relies on organic carbon as an electron donor besides sulfide still plant wide benefits could be realized in terms of reduced aeration energy consumption 56 less and reduced sludge production 30 less the latter was due to both the low sludge yield in the anaerobic reactor and the low yield of the sob in the anoxic reactor 4 3 applicability of sulfide based denitrification over nitrite a lower amount of electron donors is needed when realizing sulfide based nitrogen removal over nitrite instead of nitrate broadening the application range for sulfide based denitrification the denitrification potential of sulfide based denitrification over nitrite d p no 2 is higher than the one over nitrate d p no 3 this implies that the optimal recycle ratio r opt no 2 for sulfide based denitrification over nitrite is higher than the one for sulfide based denitrification over nitrate and more nitrogen compounds can be denitrified in the anoxic reactor fig g 3 in supplementary information as a result the potential of sulfide based denitrification over nitrite to meet the eu effluent regulations fig 6 is higher than for sulfide based denitrification over nitrate fig 4 sulfide based denitrification over nitrite was found applicable for an influent tkn concentration of 30 g n m 3 and an influent hydrogen sulfide concentration at the high end of 24 g s m 3 if the influent biodegradable organics concentration is higher than 16 g cod m 3 in this region sulfide based denitrification over nitrite could meet not only a total effluent nitrogen concentration below 15 g n m 3 but also below 10 g n m 3 required for wwtps larger than 100 000 p e overall this study demonstrates the potential of sulfide based denitrification over nitrite for biological nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater with elevated sulfate concentrations relatively high sulfate concentrations in wastewater are encountered particularly in coastal areas which are typically also most densely populated for instance coastal areas made up 40 of the eu territory and hosted 40 8 of the eu population in 2011 25 this will become even more important if sea level rises further due to climate change the application of sulfide based denitrification for nitrogen removal from wastewater containing sulfate implies a previous anaerobic treatment step for carbon removal anaerobic treatment of municipal wastewater is increasingly advocated for aiming at energy neutrality or even net energy production 26 27 already proven in warmer climates the application of anaerobic treatment at lower temperatures also looks promising 1 2 it is clear that the increasing interest for anaerobic treatment of municipal wastewater entails a concomitant increasing interest in sulfide based denitrification overall this research has shown under which conditions sulfide based denitrification has technical potential a comparison with alternative process schemes 28 in terms of economics sustainability etc is recommended 5 conclusions in this contribution the applicability of sulfide based denitrification for anaerobically pre treated municipal wastewater was assessed a procedure to calculate the optimal nitrate recycle ratio and the resulting effluent nitrogen concentrations was presented for sulfide based nitrogen removal in a pre denitrification configuration the applicability of sulfide based nitrogen removal was assessed for a wide range of municipal wastewater characteristics its application potential increased with increasing hydrogen sulfide and residual organic carbon concentrations as well as with decreasing influent tkn concentrations which were obtained with a higher optimal recycle ratio sulfide based denitrification over nitrate may be applicable if the wastewater contains an influent hydrogen sulfide concentration higher than 42 g s m 3 for a low influent tkn concentration of 30 g n m 3 and an influent biodegradable organics concentration of 12 g cod m 3 for lower influent hydrogen sulfide concentrations or higher influent tkn concentrations more biodegradable organics need to be supplied to have sufficient total electron donor for denitrification this implies relatively more heterotrophic denitrification besides sulfide based denitrification still plant wide benefits could be realized in terms of reduced aeration energy consumption and reduced sludge production the application range for sulfide based nitrogen removal became broader when realizing sulfide based nitrogen removal over nitrite instead of nitrate implying 40 less electron donor needed for the range of municipal wastewater characteristics considered sulfide based denitrification over nitrite was applicable for an influent tkn concentration of 30 g n m 3

14062,wastewater treatment through anaerobic carbon removal followed by sulfide based denitrification for nitrogen removal offers significant advantages over conventional processes in terms of decreased sludge production and reduced energy requirements while the process has been demonstrated to treat wastewater with very high sulfate concentrations resulting from saline water supply this contribution assesses the potential of sulfide based denitrification for a broader range of municipal wastewater characteristics a mass balance based calculation procedure was presented to determine the optimal recycle ratio and the corresponding effluent nitrogen concentrations in a pre denitrification system the calculation procedure was first validated with experimental data from literature and was then applied to various scenarios the latter showed that legal effluent requirements may be achievable only for specific municipal wastewater streams with a low nitrogen concentration and an elevated sulfate content 42 g s m 3 e g close to the sea or if a significant amount of biodegradable carbon enters the anoxic reactor to stimulate auxiliary heterotrophic denitrification a stoichiometric calculation illustrated that even with external carbon addition to supplement the sulfide based denitrification the total sludge production and aeration energy could still be reduced compared to a scenario with purely heterotrophic denitrification finally it was shown that a broader range of wastewater types could be treated when applying nitrification denitrification over nitrite

anaerobic treatment of municipal wastewater is especially applied in warmer climates in countries such as brazil and india but treatment at lower temperatures also looks promising 1 2 uasb upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors are widely used for this purpose they comprise typical operating costs savings of above 50 and investment costs savings of 20 50 compared to conventional activated sludge processes 3 yet anaerobic treatment has a lower carbon removal efficiency and therefore may require post treatment to deal with residual carbon in case of stringent effluent requirements 3 moreover anaerobic treatment does not remove nitrogen which leaves the anaerobic treatment step in the form of ammonium additional treatment is thus required to remove both nitrogen and residual carbon from the anaerobic effluent in case the incoming wastewater contains sulfate it is reduced during anaerobic treatment to sulfide by sulfate reducing bacteria srb thereby removing organic carbon from wastewater sulfide production is in many cases unwanted because it is associated with odour and corrosion toxicity and a lower methane yield per unit of degraded organic waste 4 however the formation of sulfide during anaerobic wastewater treatment can also be beneficially applied for nitrogen removal more specifically sulfide can be used by sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob as an electron donor for sulfide based denitrification as an alternative to organic carbon usage in conventional heterotrophic denitrification 5 elemental sulfur is a known intermediate during sulfide oxidation by sob but complete oxidation to sulfate is expected in case of an excess of nitrate as is the case for domestic wastewater 6 the coupling of an anaerobic treatment step for organic carbon removal and sulfide production with nitrification and sulfide based denitrification results in an integrated sulfur based carbon and nitrogen removal process integrated sulfur based carbon and nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater has recently been demonstrated on a large scale to treat municipal wastewater characterized by high sulfate concentrations over 150 g so 4 2 s m 3 resulting from the usage of seawater for toilet flushing this so called sani sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification nitrification integrated process 5 7 involves up to 60 70 reduction in excess sludge compared to a conventional wastewater treatment process taking up 30 40 less volume 7 this process also promotes saline water supply as an economic and sustainable solution for water scarcity in wastewater from municipalities without seawater toilet flushing sulfate is also commonly present but in a lower concentration range 8 24 g so 4 2 s m 3 8 nevertheless the concentration range of sulfate in municipal wastewater is typically higher when located closer to the sea grab samples indicated concentrations up to 44 g so 4 2 s m 3 in the influent of a wwtp close to the sea or due to brackish sulfate rich groundwater intrusion 9 furthermore the conditions in municipal wastewater treatment are well suited for the application of biological sulfate reduction for organic carbon removal provided that the concentration of sulfate is sufficiently high cod so 4 2 0 67 g cod g so 4 2 1 9 alternative process configurations have been proposed in regions where limiting sulfate concentrations are expected 10 in some cases experimental measurements revealed the presence of an unknown sulfur source which made it possible to remove more than 75 of the chemical oxygen demand excluding sulfide through anaerobic treatment thereby extending its beneficial application to more locations than initially expected 11 these findings also broaden the potential scope of sulfide based denitrification as part of a subsequent nitrogen removal step which this study focuses on this contribution assesses the application potential of sulfide based nitrogen removal for non saline municipal wastewater i e without seawater toilet flushing but including the higher sulfate concentrations encountered in coastal regions a calculation procedure based on steady state mass balances for a pre denitrification system is presented first to calculate the optimal recycle flow rate and corresponding lowest effluent nitrogen concentration this procedure was validated based on experimental data available in literature sulfide based nitrogen removal over nitrite was proposed in this study as an alternative to sulfide based nitrogen removal over nitrate for wastewaters with a relatively lower incoming sulfate concentration because of the 40 less electron donor usage for both process options scenario analysis was applied to investigate for which municipal wastewater characteristics sulfide based denitrification is able to meet the eu directive nitrogen standards 2 calculation procedure optimal recycle ratio and effluent nitrogen concentration 2 1 process configuration for sulfide based nitrogen removal the feasibility of nitrogen removal through sulfide based denitrification was assessed considering a pre denitrification system fig 1 analogous to the ones applying conventional heterotrophic denitrification in this configuration the nitrification reactor is placed after the denitrification reactor in order to make the best possible use of the electron donor organic carbon or sulfide for denitrification avoiding its aerobic oxidation 12 during nitrification ammonium present in the influent is oxidized with oxygen to nitrate by nitrifying bacteria a recycle stream q r m 3 d 1 brings nitrate from the nitrification reactor to the anoxic denitrification reactor the influent is assumed not to contain nitrate nor nitrite during sulfide based denitrification nitrate no 3 is converted into nitrogen gas while sulfide is oxidized into sulfate by sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob beside sulfide also residual organic carbon remaining after the preceding anaerobic step can be used as electron donor for denitrification the sulfide based pre denitrification and nitrification processes are typically realized in moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs 7 in this contribution sulfide based pre denitrification over nitrite instead of over nitrate was considered as an alternative process option implying 40 less electron donors needed to this end ammonium needs to be oxidized to nitrite and consequently nitrite is denitrified to nitrogen gas 2 2 denitrification potential the procedure for sulfide based nitrogen removal presented in this study was based on the well established calculation procedure of 13 for conventional nitrogen removal over nitrate in pre denitrification systems the denitrification potential is defined as the mass of nitrate or nitrite per influent volume that can be denitrified biologically in the anoxic reactor to which extent nitrate or nitrite removal actually takes place in the anoxic reactor depends on the amount of nitrate nitrite present as

table a 1 in supplementary information the denitrification potential expresses the amount of nitrate eq 1 or nitrite eq 2 which can stoichiometrically be denitrified considering the available electron donors no kinetic limitations are considered in the anoxic reactor the complete amount of h 2 s and organics is assumed to be available for denitrification this implies a large enough anoxic volume to achieve complete consumption within the residence time in this study the applicability of sulfide based denitrification over nitrate was investigated assuming no nitrite accumulation in the aerobic or anoxic reactor to examine the applicability of sulfide based denitrification over nitrite only nitrite formation was considered in the aerobic reactor and no nitrate formation while in the anoxic reactor denitrification of nitrite to nitrogen gas was considered 2 3 equivalent nitrate nitrite load optimal recycle ratio the denitrification potential relates to the amount of electron donors that enters the anoxic reactor the amount of nitrate or nitrite that will be actually denitrified depends on the amount of electron acceptors entering the anoxic reactor through the recycle flow the total electron acceptor load comprises not only nitrate or nitrite formed in the aerobic reactor but also oxygen which is unavoidably recycled along the resulting so called equivalent nitrate load n nlp no 3 g n m 3 or equivalent nitrite load n nlp no 2 g n m 3 expressed per volume of influent flow is defined by eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 n nlp no 3 s no 3 e r s o 2 r 2 86 r 4 n nlp no 2 s no 2 e r s o

concentration in the recycle stream g o2 m 3 and r the recycle ratio between the recycle flow rate and the influent flow rate 5 r q r q i the optimal recycle ratio is obtained when the equivalent nitrate or nitrite load is equal to the corresponding denitrification potential in this case all the nitrate or nitrite entering the anoxic reactor will be completely converted to nitrogen gas through denitrification so no nitrate or nitrite will be present in the outflow of the anoxic reactor as a result the effluent nitrate or nitrite concentration denoted by s no x e in general will be determined by the amount of nitrate or nitrite produced by nitrification 6 s no x e n c 1 r in which n c g n m 3 denotes the nitrification capacity which is defined as the mass of nitrate or nitrite produced from the influent tkn by nitrification per influent volume and which is calculated as the difference between the influent and effluent tkn concentrations 7 n c c tkn i c tkn e nitrogen removal through incorporation in the sludge was reasonably neglected in eq 7 indeed while about 20 of the influent nitrogen ends up in the sludge for activated sludge processes 13 this fraction will be much lower for the process setup in this study because i most organic carbon has been removed in the preceding anaerobic reactor ii the growth yield of autotrophic denitrifiers is low in comparison to heterotrophic denitrifiers and iii the solids retention time in biofilm systems is usually long leading to a low sludge production appendix b in supplementary information note that the calculation of the effluent nitrate and nitrite concentrations from n c by eq 6 takes into account the dilution caused by the recycle flow rate r eq 5 the optimal recycle ratios r opt no 3 for nitrogen removal over nitrate r opt no 2 for nitrogen removal over nitrite respectively are obtained by setting the equivalent nitrate load eq 3 or equivalent nitrite load eq 4 equal to the corresponding denitrification potential eq 1 or eq 2 substituting the effluent nitrate or nitrite concentration by eq 6 and solving the resulting equation for the recycle ratio 8 r opt no 3 d p no 3 n c s o 2 r 2

and overloading r r opt no x in what follows the effluent nitrate or nitrite concentrations is calculated for each of these cases in case the optimal recycle ratio is applied the equivalent nitrate or nitrite load is equal to the corresponding denitrification potential so the anoxic reactor is optimally loaded leading to the maximal nitrogen removal and the minimal effluent nitrate or nitrite concentration the latter is obtained by eq 6 in which r r opt no 3 eq 8 or r r opt no 2 eq 9 in case the recycle ratio is lower than the optimum value the equivalent nitrate or nitrite load is lower than the corresponding denitrification potential the anoxic reactor is then underloaded with electron acceptors recycled nitrate nitrite and oxygen coming from the aerobic reactor which will be completely converted the available electron donors h 2 s and organics are not completely consumed i e the denitrification potential is not completely used increasing the recycle flow rate would increase the nitrogen removal so the performance is less than optimal the effluent nitrate and nitrite concentrations are calculated based on eq 6 which is valid for recycle ratios lower than or equal to the optimal recycle ratio 10 s no 3 e n c 1 r for r r opt no 3 11 s no 2 e n c 1 r for r r opt no 2 in case the applied recycle ratio would be higher than the optimal one the equivalent nitrate or nitrite load is higher than the corresponding denitrification potential the anoxic reactor is then overloaded with electron acceptors coming from the aerobic reactor so not all recycled nitrate nitrite can be denitrified increasing the recycle flow rate beyond the optimal value leads to decreased denitrification because the dissolved oxygen input from the aerobic reactor increases and this is a preferred electron acceptor compared to nitrate nitrite 15 the effluent nitrate or nitrite concentration is calculated as the difference between the amount of nitrate nitrite formed through nitrification added up with the nitrate nitrite equivalent of the oxygen concentration and the denitrification potential 12 s no 3 e n c s o 2 r 2 86 r d p no 3 for r r opt no 3 13 s no 2 e n c s o 2

becomes so high that the denitrification potential is completely used up by dissolved oxygen coming from the aerobic reactor no denitrification can take place this is the case when s o 2 r 2 86 r d p no 3 or s o 2 r 1 71 r d p no 2 the effluent nitrate nitrite concentration is then equal to the nitrification capacity irrespective of the recycle flow rate eqs 12 and 13 can thus be further

calculation procedure presented in this study was validated against experimental data from literature of a lab scale sulfur based carbon and nitrogen removal process treating saline wastewater 16 in the latter study the effluent nitrate concentrations and nitrogen removal efficiencies were investigated under different recycle flow rates between the aerobic and anoxic filter in order to determine the optimal recycle flow rate in this study the experimentally obtained values were compared to the ones obtained from the calculation procedure and considering nitrification denitrification over nitrate with the parameter values from table 2 for the average anaerobic effluent tkn and hydrogen sulfide concentrations from 16 table 1 from the latter study the reported amount of organic carbon additionally consumed in the anoxic filter was taken assuming that not the complete amount of anaerobic effluent organic carbon is necessarily biodegradable the feasibility of sulfide based nitrogen removal was assessed for a range of typical municipal wastewater characteristics after anaerobic treatment table 1 the hydrogen sulfide sulfur concentration s h 2 s i entering the denitrification reactor was taken from typical so 4 2 concentrations of municipal wastewater this assumes a complete reduction of so 4 2 to dissolved h 2 s in the preceding anaerobic reactor and no gas phase losses due to minimal biogas production and the improved solubility of h 2 s at alkaline conditions as observed in a pilot study with municipal wastewater 11 a small amount of influent biodegradable organics c org i was assumed as well based on reported measurements of cod in the influent and effluent of sulfide based denitrification reactors following anaerobic treatment 18 16 19 5 7 appendix c in supplementary information typical values of c tkn i in raw municipal wastewater were taken 17 to calculate the nitrification capacity a well functioning nitrification reactor was assumed resulting in an effluent tkn concentration c tkn e of 2 g n m 3 at all times in practice high recycle rates from the aerobic to the anoxic reactor could lead to short circuiting and very low recycle rates may lead to sulfide slipping to the aerobic reactor where it might inhibit nitrification 20 22 however these situations should be avoided for optimal operation in the recycle stream 4 5 g o 2 m 3 was assumed to be present based on measurements in a large scale sani process 7 for sulfide based denitrification over nitrite a lower oxygen concentration in the recycle stream of 3 g o 2 m 3 was assumed based on a study of 23 on nitritation in a mbbr table 2 summarizes the applied parameter values according to the eu directive 98 15 ec the total effluent nitrogen concentration of an urban wastewater treatment plant should not exceed 15 g n m 3 for areas with 10 000 100 000 p e or 10 g n m 3 for areas with more than 100 000 p e and or have a minimum percentage of reduction i e total nitrogen removal efficiency of 70 80 the total nitrogen removal efficiency n removal was calculated as the difference between the incoming nitrogen tkn concentration and the outgoing nitrogen concentration tkn nitrate or nitrite relative to the influent tkn concentration 16 n removal c tkn i c tkn e s no 3 e s no 2 e c tkn i 100 these legal requirements were used as criteria to determine which municipal wastewater types could potentially be treated with sulfide based denitrification dedicated operating diagrams that map the applicability of sulfide based denitrification over nitrate and over nitrite in terms of influent hydrogen sulfide and organic carbon concentrations were set up the calculation procedure and operating diagrams presented in this study indicate which wastewaters could potentially be treated with sulfide based nitrogen removal the procedure is based on the following assumptions i steady state mass balances ii complete conversion of sulfate to h 2 s in the preceding reactor and no loss of h 2 s to the gas phase iii no kinetic limitations in the anoxic reactor iv a well functioning nitrification reactor ensuring an effluent tkn concentration as low as 2 g n m 3 these assumptions may entail a somewhat overestimation of the reactor performance the proposed procedure should therefore not be seen as a final confirmation of the applicability of sulfide based denitrification but should rather be used to identify interesting scenarios for further research 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of the calculation procedure the effluent nitrate concentrations calculated from eq 10 or eq 12 depending on the recycle ratio closely matched the experimentally measured data by tsang et al 16 for all investigated recycle ratios fig 2 a the nitrogen removal efficiency was well reproduced for recycle ratios up to 3 but was overestimated for the highest recycle ratio studied by tsang et al 16 namely r 4 tsang et al 16 and wang et al 5 who examined the same lab scale process hypothesized that this drop in the removal efficiency was due to short circuiting flows in the nitrification reactor such hydraulic constraints associated with scale were not included in the calculation procedure in this study which assumed a well functioning nitrification reactor in all cases as a result the calculated optimal recycle flow rate amounted to r opt 12 fig d 1 in supplementary information which is higher than the value r opt 3 found experimentally overall the validation confirms that the calculation procedure despite its associated assumptions is suitable to identify interesting scenarios for further research 4 2 applicability of sulfide based denitrification over nitrate 4 2 1 reference scenario the calculation procedure was illustrated for the reference scenario table 1 considering nitrogen removal over nitrate fig 3 summarizes the influence of the recycle ratio on the performance of the denitrification reactor in terms of the used denitrification potential and the effluent nitrate concentration the optimal recycle ratio for nitrogen removal over nitrate was calculated from eq 8 as r opt no 3 0 22 for recycle ratios between zero and 0 22 the anoxic reactor is underloaded with nitrate and oxygen r r opt no 3 which implies that a portion of the denitrification potential d p no 3 is unused fig 3 a as a result in this zone an increasing recycle rate of nitrate and oxygen to the anoxic reactor results in a decreasing effluent nitrate concentration until a recycle ratio of 0 22 is reached at the optimal recycle ratio r opt no 3 0 22 the denitrification potential is fully used and its maximum portion is used for nitrate removal in other words the equivalent nitrate load on the anoxic reactor is equal to the denitrification potential the recycle ratio corresponding with the lowest effluent nitrate concentration is termed the optimal recycle ratio r opt no 3 and in this case amounts to 0 22 for increasing recycle ratios beyond r opt no 3 0 22 more oxygen will be recycled to the denitrification reactor which will be preferentially used as an electron acceptor resulting in a larger fraction of the denitrification potential used for oxygen removal on its turn leading to higher effluent nitrate concentrations note that when increasing the recycle ratio to values higher than 6 74 the amount of do entering the anoxic reactor s o 2 r r 2 86 is even higher than the denitrification potential d p no 3 at this point all electron donors are consumed with oxygen while nitrate leaves the process unconverted no nitrogen removal takes place anymore which constitutes the limit of applicability of eq 12 the denitrification performance is optimal at r opt no 3 but even at this optimal recycle ratio the effluent nitrate concentration remains too high 48 g n m 3 15 g n m 3 and the nitrogen removal efficiency too low 17 70 to meet the prevailing effluent standards this is due to the low optimal recycle rate which makes that most of the nitrate formed in the aerobic reactor is simply discharged via the effluent it can be concluded that sulfide based denitrification over nitrate is not feasible for the reference case since the legal performance requirements cannot be met even under the best circumstances r r opt due to physical and bio chemical constraints 4 2 2 applicability for a range of municipal wastewater characteristics apart from the reference scenario for which the effluent nitrate concentration was too high the applicability of sulfide based denitrification was examined for a wide range of municipal wastewater characteristics increasing influent h 2 s and or organic carbon concentrations resulted in a higher denitrification potential d p no 3 eq 1 in order to fully use the denitrification potential more nitrate had to be recycled from the aerobic to the anoxic reactor resulting in a higher optimal recycle ratio r opt no 3 for increasing influent h 2 s and influent organic carbon concentrations fig e 2 b in supplementary information as a result also more nitrate was denitrified in the anoxic reactor and the effluent nitrate concentration decreased as a result the applicability of sulfide based denitrification increased with increasing influent h 2 s and or influent organic carbon concentrations fig 4 b the influent tkn concentrations also affected the optimal recycle ratio and the applicability of sulfide based denitrification decreasing the influent tkn concentration from 60 to 30 g n m 3 led to a lower nitrification capacity n c as a consequence the equivalent nitrate load was lower the optimal recycle ratio was higher fig e 2 in supplementary information and the effluent nitrate concentration was lower implying a higher nitrogen removal efficiency overall the applicability of sulfide based denitrification increased with decreasing influent tkn concentrations fig 4 for example considering an influent tkn concentration of 30 g n m 3 and an influent biodegradable organics concentration of 12 g cod m 3 sulfide based denitrification over nitrate may be applicable if the wastewater contains an influent hydrogen sulfide concentration higher than 42 g s m 3 fig 4 a for a hydrogen sulfide concentration of 44 g s m 3 an effluent nitrate concentration of 6 g n m 3 may be achieved this is lower than the maximum allowable effluent nitrogen concentration of 15 g n m 3 10 000 100 000 p e and 10 g n m 3 100 000 p e taking into account the effluent tkn concentration also a nitrogen removal efficiency of more than 70 is achieved even though this influent hydrogen sulfide concentration is higher than the ones typically expected for municipal wastewater table 1 such high concentrations are possible for e g a wwtp close to the sea 9 furthermore other sulfur sources could still be present in wastewater leading to higher sulfide concentrations than originating from sulfate only a topic that warrants further research 11 4 2 3 plant wide calculation for lower influent hydrogen sulfide concentrations more influent biodegradable organics would be required to have sufficient total electron donor for denitrification for instance for an influent hydrogen sulfide concentration of 24 g s m 3 and an influent tkn concentration of 30 g n m 3 about 100 g bcod m 3 would need to be supplied fig 4 a this is higher than typical influent biodegradable organic carbon concentrations present in anaerobically pre treated municipal wastewater table 1 in order to supply additional biodegradable organics to the pre denitrification system either the anaerobic pre treatment could be operated such that a higher amount of biodegradable organics remains in the anaerobic effluent alternatively external organic carbon should be dosed to the anoxic reactor in any case this implies relatively more heterotrophic denitrification besides sulfide based denitrification a plant wide calculation was performed comparing scenario a based on anaerobic carbon removal and sulfide heterotrophic denitrification with a conventional scenario b based on carbon and nitrogen removal in a pre denitrification configuration fig 5 the theoretical plant wide calculation was based on the assumption of complete sulfate reduction in the anaerobic reactor and complete sulfide oxidation to sulfate in the anoxic reactor this implies no detrimental influence of residual h 2 s in the consecutive aerobic reactor the calculations for the sludge production and the oxygen consumption are detailed in appendix f tables f 4 and f 5 the results show that even when denitrification relies on organic carbon as an electron donor besides sulfide still plant wide benefits could be realized in terms of reduced aeration energy consumption 56 less and reduced sludge production 30 less the latter was due to both the low sludge yield in the anaerobic reactor and the low yield of the sob in the anoxic reactor 4 3 applicability of sulfide based denitrification over nitrite a lower amount of electron donors is needed when realizing sulfide based nitrogen removal over nitrite instead of nitrate broadening the application range for sulfide based denitrification the denitrification potential of sulfide based denitrification over nitrite d p no 2 is higher than the one over nitrate d p no 3 this implies that the optimal recycle ratio r opt no 2 for sulfide based denitrification over nitrite is higher than the one for sulfide based denitrification over nitrate and more nitrogen compounds can be denitrified in the anoxic reactor fig g 3 in supplementary information as a result the potential of sulfide based denitrification over nitrite to meet the eu effluent regulations fig 6 is higher than for sulfide based denitrification over nitrate fig 4 sulfide based denitrification over nitrite was found applicable for an influent tkn concentration of 30 g n m 3 and an influent hydrogen sulfide concentration at the high end of 24 g s m 3 if the influent biodegradable organics concentration is higher than 16 g cod m 3 in this region sulfide based denitrification over nitrite could meet not only a total effluent nitrogen concentration below 15 g n m 3 but also below 10 g n m 3 required for wwtps larger than 100 000 p e overall this study demonstrates the potential of sulfide based denitrification over nitrite for biological nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater with elevated sulfate concentrations relatively high sulfate concentrations in wastewater are encountered particularly in coastal areas which are typically also most densely populated for instance coastal areas made up 40 of the eu territory and hosted 40 8 of the eu population in 2011 25 this will become even more important if sea level rises further due to climate change the application of sulfide based denitrification for nitrogen removal from wastewater containing sulfate implies a previous anaerobic treatment step for carbon removal anaerobic treatment of municipal wastewater is increasingly advocated for aiming at energy neutrality or even net energy production 26 27 already proven in warmer climates the application of anaerobic treatment at lower temperatures also looks promising 1 2 it is clear that the increasing interest for anaerobic treatment of municipal wastewater entails a concomitant increasing interest in sulfide based denitrification overall this research has shown under which conditions sulfide based denitrification has technical potential a comparison with alternative process schemes 28 in terms of economics sustainability etc is recommended 5 conclusions in this contribution the applicability of sulfide based denitrification for anaerobically pre treated municipal wastewater was assessed a procedure to calculate the optimal nitrate recycle ratio and the resulting effluent nitrogen concentrations was presented for sulfide based nitrogen removal in a pre denitrification configuration the applicability of sulfide based nitrogen removal was assessed for a wide range of municipal wastewater characteristics its application potential increased with increasing hydrogen sulfide and residual organic carbon concentrations as well as with decreasing influent tkn concentrations which were obtained with a higher optimal recycle ratio sulfide based denitrification over nitrate may be applicable if the wastewater contains an influent hydrogen sulfide concentration higher than 42 g s m 3 for a low influent tkn concentration of 30 g n m 3 and an influent biodegradable organics concentration of 12 g cod m 3 for lower influent hydrogen sulfide concentrations or higher influent tkn concentrations more biodegradable organics need to be supplied to have sufficient total electron donor for denitrification this implies relatively more heterotrophic denitrification besides sulfide based denitrification still plant wide benefits could be realized in terms of reduced aeration energy consumption and reduced sludge production the application range for sulfide based nitrogen removal became broader when realizing sulfide based nitrogen removal over nitrite instead of nitrate implying 40 less electron donor needed for the range of municipal wastewater characteristics considered sulfide based denitrification over nitrite was applicable for an influent tkn concentration of 30 g n m 3 and an influent hydrogen sulfide concentration at the high end of 24 g s m 3 if the influent biodegradable organics concentration is higher than 16 g cod m 3 conflict of interest none declared

14063,layered double hydroxides ldhs are excellent adsorbent for removal of organic and inorganic contaminates from water and wastewater in this aspect extrudates of ldhs are of great importance for water wastewater treatment through fixed bed column operations the present study reports preparation of biopolymer modified ldh extrudates by one pot co precipitation and extrusion method for their effective application in column based water wastewater treatment systems the microstructural properties of the ldh extrudates were studied by thermogravimetric analysis tga x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infra red spectroscopy ft ir scanning electron microscopy sem and nitrogen adsorption desorption analysis the adsorption performance of the prepared ldh extrudates was studied through batch system and fixed bed column experiments for the adsorption of acid orange ii dye in aqueous medium the adsorbent extrudates are found to be stable between a solution ph of 5 and 10 the adsorption kinetics followed a pseudo second order kinetic model these ldh starch cellulose extrudates found to be user friendly adsorbent for column based water purification systems keywords layered double hydroxide extrudates starch cellulose adsorbent adsorption 1 introduction layered double hydroxides ldhs also known as hydrotalcite like compounds are made of positively charged hydroxyl layers of bivalent and trivalent metal ions stacked one over another the positive residual charges on the metal hydroxide framework are generated by the isomorphic substitution of some of the bivalent metal ions by the trivalent metal ions which are counterbalanced by the anions located interstitially between the layers ldhs can be represented by the general formula mx 2 my 3 oh 2 x y ay n n mh2o where m2 is a bivalent metal ion zn mg cu co ni etc m3 is a trivalent metal ion al fe cr etc and an is the exchangeable anion 1 the presence of positive surface charge and reasonable number of exchangeable interlayer anions make this class of materials an excellent adsorbent ion exchanger for anionic species because of easy synthesis procedure regenerability tailor made functionality and high adsorption ion exchange capacity of the ldhs they are considered as one of the most preferred adsorbents for removing various inorganic and organic pollutants like fluoride 2 3 arsenic selenium 4 boron 5 chromium 6 and dyes 7 8 from water wastewater 9 efforts have been taken to improve the adsorption performance by increasing the dispersity porosity of the ldh by supporting stabilizing the ldh on various natural and synthetic polymers like starch 10 cellulose 11 13 chitosan 14 sodium alginate 15 polyethylene glycol 16 etc however all available reports related to the use of ldhs for water wastewater treatments are in laboratory scale research the practical application of this group of adsorbents for large scale water wastewater treatment is limited because of the small particle size nm range and relatively low porosity of the ldh adsorbents separation of the adsorbent from the liquid phase is difficult in the batch adsorption system and a huge pressure drop is created and even blocking will occur if they are directly packed into the device used in fixed bed column system 12 hence making of granular extrudates form of ldh with suitable porosity is necessary for the application of this group of adsorbents in fixed bed column system for water wastewater purification 17 18 synthetic dyes colorants are the most significant contaminant among various industrial pollutants among all the synthetic dyes azo dye is one of the more detrimental classes because it is highly persistent in the aquatic environment 8 hence their removal from the waste streams is an environmental priority acid orange ii denoted as ao ii is an acidic azo dye that possesses a complex structure comprising two aromatic rings an azo bond and a sulfonated group ao ii is mainly found in the wastewater of textile dyeing cosmetic and leather industries 19 20 ao ii is a poorly biodegradable azo dye which is relatively stable and resistant to microbial attack the objective of the present research was to develop ldh extrudates using non toxic natural polymeric binder and filler for their plausible application in fixed bed column operations ao ii dye was selected as the model dye to

characterization of adsorbent the elemental analyses of the ldh ldhs and ldhcs are presented in table 1 the nitrogen content in the ldh represents the interlayer nitrate ions from the precursor salts a decrease in nitrogen content in the ldhs and ldhcs as compared to the ldh indicates partial replacement of the nitrate ions by the hydroxyl ions the higher carbon content of the ldhs and ldhcs than the ldh is due to the starch or and cellulose that is used to make the extrudates the presence of starch or and cellulose is also reflected in the percentage residues obtained from the tga of the adsorbents fig 2 shows the tga thermograms of the ldh ldhs and ldhcs the percentage residues of the adsorbents remain after 800 c are 54 31 49 45 and 48 44 for the ldh ldhs and ldhcs respectively the lower values of the percentage residues for ldhs and ldhcs than that of the ldh indicates higher weight loss which is attributed to the decomposition of starch in the ldhs and both starch and cellulose in the ldhcs x ray diffraction patterns of the ldh ldhs ldhcs along with the starch and the cellulose are presented in fig 3 the xrd patterns of the ldh ldhs and ldhcs show diffraction peaks at 2θ positions 10 6 21 2 34 3 38 1 45 60 6 and 60 9 degrees which are characteristics of typical mg al ldh with no3 interlayer anion 22 the xrd patterns of the ldhs and ldhcs show no change in the crystal structure of the basic ldh on incorporating starch or and cellulose the xrd pattern of the starch shows typical a type xrd pattern with diffraction peaks at 2θ positions 15 16 9 17 7 and 22 8 degrees respectively 23 xrd diagram of the cellulose shows characteristic diffraction peaks of cellulose at 2θ positions 14 7 16 4 22 7 and 34 6 degrees 24 25 the ftir spectra of the adsorbent extrudates and their precursors are presented in fig 4 the ftir spectra of the ldh ldhs and ldhcs show similar pattern with characteristic bands between 3000 3700 cm 1 at 1638 cm 1 and at 1382 cm 1 attributed to the oh stretching vibration oh bending vibration and asymmetric stretching vibration of the intercalated nitrate ions respectively the al o and mg o vibrations in the brucite like layers are found at around 580 cm 1 the vibrational bands due to oh stretching and bending modes at 3000 3700 cm 1 and at 1638 cm 1 are also observed in the ftir spectra of the starch and cellulose the sharp band observed between 2800 3000 cm 1 due to the c h stretching vibration and the low intense band at 1164 cm 1 due to the coc asymmetric stretching vibration are the characteristic bands for both starch and cellulose 26 27 the specific surface area determined by the bet n2 adsorption desorption technique for the extrudates of ldhs and ldhcs are 1 7 and 3 0 m2 g respectively while that of powdered ldh is 101 5 m2 g the low values of surface area of the ldhs and ldhcs extrudates as compared to the powdered ldh are due to the filling up of the pores and cracks by the starch the total pore volume recorded for the ldhs and ldhcs extrudates are 0 007 and 0 009 cm3 g respectively and that for powdered ldh is 0 22 cm3 g the low pore volume of ldhs and ldhcs extrudates as compared to the powdered ldh is primarily due to the filling up of the pores by the starch which got accentuated due to the pressure applied to make the extrudates however both surface area and porosity of the ldhcs extrudates are marginally higher than those of the ldhs extrudates which is attributed to the incorporation of cellulose in the ldh starch matrix the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of the adsorbents taken at liquid nitrogen temperature are presented in fig 5 the shape of the isotherm is indicative of the pore structure of the respective adsorbents the similar shape of the isotherms implies that the pore structures of ldhs and ldhcs extrudates fig 5a are similar to that of powdered ldh fig 5b the hysteresis loop formed by the adsorption desorption curves exhibits typical type e hysteresis produced by tubular pores containing narrow constriction 15 this type of hysteresis loop has been attributed to ink bottle pores and may be associated with the removal of capillary condensate from the spaces pores between the layers the bjh desorption plots of volume desorbed versus pore diameter presented in the insets of fig 5 show that both the adsorbent extrudates have similar pattern of pore size distribution the pore size distribution of ldhs and ldhcs lies between 1 5 nm while the powdered ldh showed relatively wide pore size distribution that lies in the range 1 15 nm a wider pore size distribution between 1 140 nm for co3 2 containing mg al ldh has been reported in the literature by shan et al 28 the sem images of the ldh ldhs and ldhcs are presented in fig 6 unlike ldh the sem image of ldhs shows the blocks of strongly clustered particles due to the presence of starch the image of ldhcs clearly shows the presence of cellulose fibers in addition to the clustered particles 3 2 batch adsorption studies 3 2 1 influence of starch and cellulose on the adsorption capacity of ldh extrudates the adsorption of ao ii on the ldh extrudates and on the starch powder and cellulose powder was studied through batch adsorption experiments at three different ao ii concentrations and the adsorption performances were evaluated the adsorption capacities of the ldhs and ldhcs extrudates along with those of the precursor starch and cellulose at different ao ii concentrations are presented in fig 7 fig 7 shows that the ao ii adsorption capacity of all the adsorbents increased with increase in initial ao ii concentration nevertheless the ao ii adsorption capacities of both starch and cellulose individually are much less as compared to the ldhs and ldhcs extrudates the results indicate that the synergy between the ldh starch and cellulose has definite positive influence on the adsorption capacity of the ldhs and lshcs adsorbents moreover better performance of the extrudates of ldhcs than that of ldhs confirms the fact that cellulose introduces porosity in the adsorbent that leads to increase in available surface area and hence the adsorption capacity increases 3 2 2 influence of solution ph the influence of solution ph on the ao ii adsorption by the ldhs and ldhcs extrudates in the solution ph range between 2 and 11 is presented in fig 8 the adsorbent extrudates were stable in the solution ph range of 5 10 and in this ph range the ao ii adsorption capacity of the adsorbents is not significantly influenced by the solution ph further the final ph of the solution lies between 6 4 and 7 5 however at a solution ph less than 3 the adsorbent extrudates start to disintegrate leading to free ldh in the solution which in turn leads to increase in adsorption capacity due to higher available surface area of the adsorbent a decrease in adsorption capacity at higher alkaline ph 10 might be attributed to the increase in the concentration of competitive anions oh ions in the solution 16 a similar observation of decrease in methyl orange dye adsorption capacity of the calcined ni al ldh adsorbent at higher solution ph has been reported by monash and pugazhenthi 29 based on the ph variation results all further studies were performed at the normal ph of the ao ii solution ph 6 1 without any ph adjustment 3 2 3 influence of contact time the influence of contact time on the ao ii adsorption capacity of the ldhs and ldhcs extrudates are presented in fig 9 the influence of contact time on the adsorption capacity of the starch and cellulose both of which are in powdered form represented by p are also presented in fig 9 for comparison the adsorption of ao ii on the starch and cellulose attained equilibrium at 4 h and the ao ii adsorption capacities at equilibrium are 10 02 and 11 43 mg g respectively this shows that although both starch and cellulose contribute positively to the adsorption capacity of the ldhs and ldhcs extrudates however ldh is the primary active material responsible for the adsorption of ao ii in aqueous medium the ldhs and ldhcs extrudates show continuous increase in adsorption capacity and the equilibrium adsorption was not achieved even after 24 h after 24 h of contact the ao ii adsorption capacities of the ldhs and ldhcs extrudates were 73 8 and 94 6 mg g respectively the distinct difference in adsorption capacities between the two adsorbents ldhs and ldhcs indicates that the presence of cellulose in the adsorbent plays significant role towards the adsorption efficiency of the adsorbent extrudates further fig 9 indicates that the ao ii adsorption rates of the ldhs and ldhcs extrudates are slow which is in line with their n2 adsorption desorption results a similar observation has been reported by zubair et al where the methyl orange adsorption rate of the nife ldh decreased with introduction of starch into the ldh matrix 26 the difference in adsorption characteristics between the powdered and extrudates granular forms of ldh 17 makes it difficult to compare their adsorption capacities further most of the literature reports on ao ii removal from water are by using powdered adsorbents materials hence they are not reported here however ao ii adsorption capacities of various adsorbents are reported in our previous publications 16 30 the kinetic data of the ldhs and ldhcs extrudates were fitted to the lagergren pseudo first order eq 4 31 and the pseudo second order kinetic models eq 5 32 4 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where qt mg g is the amount of ao ii adsorbed by the adsorbents at a time t min qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g k1 min 1 and k2 g mg min are the pseudo first order and the pseudo second order rate constants respectively the values of the rate constants k1 and k2 equilibrium adsorption capacities qe and the correlation coefficients r2 were calculated from the slope and intercept of the linear plots of eqs 4 and 5 and presented in table 2 the r2 values indicate reasonably good fitting of the kinetic data with both the kinetic models however the values of second order rate constants k2 for both the adsorbents are 100 folds less than that of their respective first order rate constants k1 moreover the values of equilibrium adsorption capacities qe calculated using the pseudo second order model are close to the experimental qe values this indicates that the pseudo second order kinetic model can be considered as the most suitable model for explaining the ao ii adsorption kinetics of the ldhs and ldhcs extrudates the pseudo second order kinetic model has been proposed as the suitable model for adsorption of anionic dyes on pristine calcined ldhs and ldh polymer composites by many research groups 30 33 the pseudo second order kinetic model signifies that the rate limiting step for the adsorption of ao ii on the ldhs and ldhcs may be chemical in nature 3 3 fixed bed column studies the breakthrough curves obtained from the fixed bed column experiments with the ldhs and ldhcs extrudates are presented in fig 10 the breakthrough curves do not show very sharp break point which might be due to the slow adsorption nature of the adsorbents which is confirmed through the kinetic studies performed in batch mode the breakthrough parameters were calculated by considering the break point vb at ct c0 0 1 and the column was considered to be saturated at the point ct c0 0 9 the total volume of treated effluent at the break point and that at the point of saturation was estimated from the breakthrough curves the ao ii uptake capacities of the ldhs and ldhcs qtot obtained from the fixed bed column experiments are presented in table 3 along with the breakthrough parameters the ao ii adsorption capacities of the ldhs and ldhcs extrudates in fixed bed column experiments were 18 06 and 28 16 mg g respectively the breakthrough curves and the breakthrough parameters clearly indicate the better adsorption characteristics of the ldhcs than that of the ldhs which can be attributed to the higher porosity of the ldhcs due to incorporation of the cellulose the higher porosity leads to higher available surface area and hence higher adsorption capacity of the ldhcs the ph of the eluted water was 6 8 at the beginning of the experiment and remained same up to the break point ct c0 0 1 after the break point the ph started decreasing slowly and finally reached to 6 2 at the exhaustion of the column 3 4 regeneration of the adsorbents for reuse regeneration of any adsorbent is essential for economic viability and for environmental sustainability as regeneration and reuse of adsorbents minimizes the solid waste generation as per literature reports anionic dye loaded ldh adsorbents are generally regenerated by two methods chemical regeneration using alkaline solution 12 26 and thermal regeneration by calcination of the exhausted adsorbent between 450 500 c for 1 4 h 3 7 8 a detailed study on thermal regeneration of ao ii loaded peg modified ldh adsorbents and its reuse has been presented elsewhere 16 however to optimize the regeneration and reuse of the present ldh extrudates adsorbents more works are essential further for practical application of the adsorbents in the industrial level a detailed cost analysis and comparison with different processes must be worked out 4 conclusions and future perspectives the extrudates of layered double hydroxides were successfully prepared using starch and cellulose by one pot co precipitation and extrusion method the presence of starch and cellulose in the adsorbent extrudates were confirmed by the decreased percentage residues in tga analyses the ldh extrudates ldhs and ldhcs were successfully tested for adsorptive removal of ao ii from water in batch and fixed bed column experiments the ao ii adsorption capacities of ldhs and ldhcs after 24 h of adsorption in batch mode were 73 8 and 94 6 mg g respectively when the initial ao ii concentration was 200 mg l the same in fixed bed column mode were 18 06 and 28 16 mg g for ldhs and ldhcs respectively when the initial ao ii concentration was 100 mg l nevertheless the adsorption capacity of the ldhs extrudates could be enhanced by the incorporation of cellulose fibers the adsorbent extrudates were stable in the solution ph between 5 and 10 and in this ph range the adsorption capacity is not significantly influence by the solution ph the present investigation shows that extrudates beads of ldh adsorbent prepared using starch binder along with an appropriate proportion of cellulose fibers can be an effective adsorbent for treatment of water wastewater in fixed bed column operations further the ldhcs ldh starch cellulose extrudates are environment friendly and versatile adsorbent for removal of anionic contaminants from water declaration of competing interest

14063,layered double hydroxides ldhs are excellent adsorbent for removal of organic and inorganic contaminates from water and wastewater in this aspect extrudates of ldhs are of great importance for water wastewater treatment through fixed bed column operations the present study reports preparation of biopolymer modified ldh extrudates by one pot co precipitation and extrusion method for their effective application in column based water wastewater treatment systems the microstructural properties of the ldh extrudates were studied by thermogravimetric analysis tga x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infra red spectroscopy ft ir scanning electron microscopy sem and nitrogen adsorption desorption analysis the adsorption performance of the prepared ldh extrudates was studied through batch system and fixed bed column experiments for the adsorption of acid orange ii dye in aqueous medium the adsorbent extrudates are found to be stable between a solution ph of 5 and 10 the adsorption kinetics followed a pseudo second order kinetic model these ldh starch cellulose extrudates found to be user friendly adsorbent for column based water purification systems keywords layered double hydroxide extrudates starch cellulose adsorbent adsorption 1 introduction layered double hydroxides ldhs also known as hydrotalcite like compounds are made of positively charged hydroxyl layers of bivalent and trivalent metal ions stacked one over another the positive residual charges on the metal hydroxide framework are generated by the isomorphic substitution of some of the bivalent metal ions by the trivalent metal ions which are counterbalanced by the anions located interstitially between the layers ldhs can be represented by the general formula mx 2 my 3 oh 2 x y ay n n mh2o where m2 is a bivalent metal ion zn mg cu co ni etc m3 is a trivalent metal ion al fe cr etc and an is the exchangeable anion 1 the presence of positive surface charge and reasonable number of exchangeable interlayer anions make this class of materials an excellent adsorbent ion exchanger for anionic species because of easy synthesis procedure regenerability tailor made functionality and high adsorption ion exchange capacity of the ldhs they are considered as one of the most preferred adsorbents for removing various inorganic and organic pollutants like fluoride 2 3 arsenic selenium 4 boron 5 chromium 6 and dyes 7 8 from water wastewater 9 efforts have been taken to improve the adsorption performance by increasing the dispersity porosity of the ldh by supporting stabilizing the ldh on various natural and synthetic polymers like starch 10 cellulose 11 13 chitosan 14 sodium alginate 15 polyethylene glycol 16 etc however all available reports related to the use of ldhs for water wastewater treatments are in laboratory scale research the practical application of this group of adsorbents for large scale water wastewater treatment is limited because of the small particle size nm range and relatively low porosity of the ldh adsorbents separation of the adsorbent from the liquid phase is difficult in the batch adsorption system and a huge pressure drop is created and even blocking will occur if they are directly packed into the device used in fixed bed column system 12 hence making of granular extrudates form of ldh with suitable porosity is necessary for the application of this group of adsorbents in fixed bed column system for water wastewater purification 17 18 synthetic dyes colorants are the most significant contaminant among various industrial pollutants among all the synthetic dyes azo dye is one of the more detrimental classes because it is highly persistent in the aquatic environment 8 hence their removal from the waste streams is an environmental priority acid orange ii denoted as ao ii is an acidic azo dye that possesses a complex structure comprising two aromatic rings an azo bond and a sulfonated group ao ii is mainly found in the wastewater of textile dyeing cosmetic and leather industries 19 20 ao ii is a poorly biodegradable azo dye which is relatively stable and resistant to microbial attack the objective of the present research was to develop ldh extrudates using non toxic natural polymeric binder and filler for their plausible application in fixed bed column operations ao ii dye was selected as the model dye to study the adsorption characteristics of the developed adsorbents in this study extrudates of mg al ldh were made using starch from arrowroot as binder and cellulose as filler the developed extrudates were characterized using thermogravimetric analysis tga x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infra red spectroscopy ft ir scanning electron microscopy sem and nitrogen adsorption desorption

checked with ph indicator paper for ph neutrality followed by centrifugation to remove adhered water then the thick and wet precipitate was converted to extrudates using a manual extruder and dried at

dissolved in 100 ml of distilled water stirred at 100 c for 30 min after which the temperature was reduced to 60 c afterwards a calculated amount of cellulose powder 5 of the ldh was added to the preheated starch solution slowly with continuous stirring to the prepared starch cellulose suspension ldh was precipitated following the procedure mentioned above for synthesis of ldhs and the extrudates of ldhcs was prepared using a manual extruder the dried extrudates were preserved for further studies 2 3 adsorbent characterization the synthesized ldh ldhs and ldhcs adsorbents were

observation has been reported by zubair et al where the methyl orange adsorption rate of the nife ldh decreased with introduction of starch into the ldh matrix 26 the difference in adsorption characteristics between the powdered and extrudates granular forms of ldh 17 makes it difficult to compare their adsorption capacities further most of the literature reports on ao ii removal from water are by using powdered adsorbents materials hence they are not reported here however ao ii adsorption capacities of various adsorbents are reported in our previous publications 16 30 the kinetic data of the ldhs and ldhcs extrudates were fitted to the lagergren pseudo first order eq 4 31 and the pseudo second order kinetic models eq 5 32 4 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where qt mg g is the amount of ao ii adsorbed by the adsorbents at a time t min qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g k1 min 1 and k2 g mg min are the pseudo first order and the pseudo second order rate constants respectively the values of the rate constants k1 and k2 equilibrium adsorption capacities qe and the correlation coefficients r2 were calculated from the slope and intercept of the linear plots of eqs 4 and 5 and presented in table 2 the r2 values indicate reasonably good fitting of the kinetic data with both the kinetic models however the values of second order rate constants k2 for both the adsorbents are 100 folds less than that of their respective first order rate constants k1 moreover the values of equilibrium adsorption capacities qe calculated using the pseudo second order model are close to the experimental qe values this indicates that the pseudo second order kinetic model can be considered as the most suitable model for explaining the ao ii adsorption kinetics of the ldhs and ldhcs extrudates the pseudo second order kinetic model has been proposed as the suitable model for adsorption of anionic dyes on pristine calcined ldhs and ldh polymer composites by many research groups 30 33 the pseudo second order kinetic model signifies that the rate limiting step for the adsorption of ao ii on the ldhs and ldhcs may be chemical in nature 3 3 fixed bed column studies the breakthrough curves obtained from the fixed bed column experiments with the ldhs and ldhcs extrudates are presented in fig 10 the breakthrough curves do not show very sharp break point which might be due to the slow adsorption nature of the adsorbents which is confirmed through the kinetic studies performed in batch mode the breakthrough parameters were calculated by considering the break point vb at ct c0 0 1 and the column was considered to be saturated at the point ct c0 0 9 the total volume of treated effluent at the break point and that at the point of saturation was estimated from the breakthrough curves the ao ii uptake capacities of the ldhs and ldhcs qtot obtained from the fixed bed column experiments are presented in table 3 along with the breakthrough parameters the ao ii adsorption capacities of the ldhs and ldhcs extrudates in fixed bed column experiments were 18 06 and 28 16 mg g respectively the breakthrough curves and the breakthrough parameters clearly indicate the better adsorption characteristics of the ldhcs than that of the ldhs which can be attributed to the higher porosity of the ldhcs due to incorporation of the cellulose the higher porosity leads to higher available surface area and hence higher adsorption capacity of the ldhcs the ph of the eluted water was 6 8 at the beginning of the experiment and remained same up to the break point ct c0 0 1 after the break point the ph started decreasing slowly and finally reached to 6 2 at the exhaustion of the column 3 4 regeneration of the adsorbents for reuse regeneration of any adsorbent is essential for economic viability and for environmental sustainability as regeneration and reuse of adsorbents minimizes the solid waste generation as per literature reports anionic dye loaded ldh adsorbents are generally regenerated by two methods chemical regeneration using alkaline solution 12 26 and thermal regeneration by calcination of the exhausted adsorbent between 450 500 c for 1 4 h 3 7 8 a detailed study on thermal regeneration of ao ii loaded peg modified ldh adsorbents and its reuse has been presented elsewhere 16 however to optimize the regeneration and reuse of the present ldh extrudates adsorbents more works are essential further for practical application of the adsorbents in the industrial level a detailed cost analysis and comparison with different processes must be worked out 4 conclusions and future perspectives the extrudates of layered double hydroxides were successfully prepared using starch and cellulose by one pot co precipitation and extrusion method the presence of starch and cellulose in the adsorbent extrudates were confirmed by the decreased percentage residues in tga analyses the ldh extrudates ldhs and ldhcs were successfully tested for adsorptive removal of ao ii from water in batch and fixed bed column experiments the ao ii adsorption capacities of ldhs and ldhcs after 24 h of adsorption in batch mode were 73 8 and 94 6 mg g respectively when the initial ao ii concentration was 200 mg l the same in fixed bed column mode were 18 06 and 28 16 mg g for ldhs and ldhcs respectively when the initial ao ii concentration was 100 mg l nevertheless the adsorption capacity of the ldhs extrudates could be enhanced by the incorporation of cellulose fibers the adsorbent extrudates were stable in the solution ph between 5 and 10 and in this ph range the adsorption capacity is not significantly influence by the solution ph the present investigation shows that extrudates beads of ldh adsorbent prepared using starch binder along with an appropriate proportion of cellulose fibers can be an effective adsorbent for treatment of water wastewater in fixed bed column operations further the ldhcs ldh starch cellulose extrudates are environment friendly and versatile adsorbent for removal of anionic contaminants from water declaration of competing interest

ozone dosage and the presence of different background ions were also evaluated results show that iohexol degradation during ozonation followed the pseudo first order kinetics well the degradation rate increased with the increase of ph values and reached a maximum of 1 29 0 05 10 1 min 1 at ph 9 as the ozone concentration gradually increased from 0 342 to 1 13 mg l the corresponding pseudo first

contrast medium icms are important components 1 icms are commonly used drugs in interventional radiology for medical imaging of blood vessels and body cavities 2 the structures of icms are stable and the traditional water treatment processes cannot effectively remove them 3 the global consumption of icms is proximately 3 5 106 kg per year 4 and 95 of which is excreted without being metabolized from human bodies compared with other ionic contrast agents iohexol is a non ionic contrast media and causes less adverse reactions than ionic contrast agents during actual use 5 6 in surface water iohexol is the most commonly detected icm along with iopamidol 7 iohexol has 6 hydroxyl groups in its molecular chain therefore iohexol is highly soluble in water and has strong polarity and low protein binding capacity 8 although icms do not show negative impact on the environment they are considered to be a major source of iodine involved in the formation of iodinated disinfection by

amount of strong oxidizing agents such as oh to effectively degrade persistent substances in a solution 11 various aops can be applied in water treatment such as uv ozone h2o2 and persulfate and the combination of them 12 13 fernandes et al reported that post oxidative effluents could be treated under alkaline phs using sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes s aops 14 several previous studies have focused on the degradation of icms using aops 7 15 17 for example uv irradiation and uv chlorination can achieve high removal of various icms including diatrizoate iopamidol iohexol iomeprol and iopromide 3 11 18 ozone is commonly used for sterilization disinfection deodorization and decolorization because of its high oxidation reduction potential in water 19 therefore ozone is widely applied in water and wastewater treatment processes 20 and is considered a kind of green oxidant 20 21 because it can completely convert organic matter into co2 and h2o under ideal conditions 22 organic pollutants can be degraded by ozone through a direct reaction with molecular ozone or through indirect reactions with free radicals produced by the decomposition of ozone 23 ozone can rapidly and extensively inactivate viral and bacterial pathogens compared with traditional methods refractory substances can be more efficiently degraded by ozone 24 for example ssynergistic effects

results of acoustic cavitation aided by ozone for the treatment of industrial effluents however to the best of the authors knowledge no relevant literature regarding the degradation kinetics of

maintained by circulating the water in the outer layer of the glass tube to a water bath controlled at a constant temperature of 25 c the aeration sheet in the double layer glass reactor allowed the ozone to diffuse into the solution as uniformly as possible to ensure a stable ozone concentration the schematic diagram of the ozone reaction system is displayed in fig 1 2 3 experimental procedures the sample solutions were prepared in beakers containing 500 ml of iohexol solution 10 μm and buffered using 10 mm phosphate solution the ph value of the solutions was adjusted to a desired value ph 5 9 for potential source water in drinking water treatment plants by adding a small amount 5 ml of h2so4 0 18 m or naoh 1 m in order to ensure the purity of the produced ozone the ozone generator was pre ventilated for 30 min and discharged into a saturated potassium iodide solution to quench ozone before releasing it into the air after the pre venting process was finished the prepared iohexol solution was poured into the reactor to start the ozonation reaction at different time points 1 ml of the sample solution was withdrawn from the reactor and transferred into an hplc vial after sampling the reaction was quenched by using na2s2o3 then the samples were stored in a 4 c incubator before the analysis of residual iohexol concentrations using hplc for dbp formation experiments the iohexol solution 10 μm buffered at ph 7 was poured into the reactor for 2 h ozonation then the solution was poured out and dosed with the stock chlorine solution to get 100 μm chlorine concentration distributed into several 45 ml glass vials with screw caps and stored at 25 c in the dark under headspace free conditions after 3 d reaction time all samples were quenched with na2s2o3 cooncentration

gas was 30 ml min 1 the detention limits for all dbp species were in the range of 0 1 1 0 μg l 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of iohexol degradation during ozonation fig 2 displays the pseudo first order kinetics plot of iohexol degradation during ozonation iohexol was degraded by more than 74 3 after 60 min ozonation the high linearity of the fitted line in fig 2 r2 0 996 indicates that iohexol degradation followed the pseudo first order kinetics well during ozonation and the degradation rate can be expressed in eq 3 3 d iohexol dt k obs iohexol t where iohexol represents the iohexol concentration at time t kobs min 1 represents the observed pseudo first order rate constant of iohexol degradation during ozonation which was calculated to be 2 17 0 04 10 2 min 1 in fig 2 3 2 effect of ph and ozone concentration on iohexol degradation during ozonation iohexol degradation during ozonation was investigated at ph 5 9 and the results are presented in fig 3 the degradation rate of iohexol gradually increased from 1 00 0 03 10 2 min 1 at ph 5 to the maximum value of 1 29 0 05 10 1 min 1 at ph 9 the dosed iohexol can be completely decomposed at ph 7 5 9 0 the rate constants of iohexol degradation during ozonation under alkaline conditions were significantly higher than those under acidic conditions this phenomenon can be explained by the major contribution of hydroxyl radicals oh to iohexol degradation which will be further discussed in section 3 4 at ph 7 oh in the solution can promote the formation of hydroxyl radicals according to eqs 4 and 5 accordingly a series of reactions happened with the generation of other active radicals at different ph values such as oh o2 o 3 ho 3 o and ho 2 eqs 6 to 8 therefore the ph of the solution is an important factor for iohexol degradation during ozonation 32 4 o 3 oh h o 2 o 2 k 4 2 10 2 m 1 min 1 5 o 3 h o 2 oh o 2 o 2 k 1 68 10 8 m 1 min 1 6 o 3 o 2 o 3 o 2 k 9 6 10 10 m 1 min 1 7a at ph 8 o 3 h h o 3 7b h o 3 o h o 2 8a at ph 8 o 3 o o 2 8b o h 2 o o h oh 8c o h o 3 h o 2 o 2 effect of ozone concentration on iohexol degradation was investigated at ph 7 and the results are displayed in fig 4 as the initial concentration of ozone increased from 0 342 to 1 13 mg l the molar ratio of ozone to iohexol increased from 0 72 to 2 32 the value of kobs increased from 7 25 0 30 10 3 to 5 77 0 26 10 2 min 1 according to eqs 6 9 the amount of generated radicals oh o2 o 3 and ho 3 in the solution increased with increasing ozone concentration which can react and degrade iohexol resulting in the increasing rate of iohexol degradation with increasing initial ozone concentration in fig 4 33 3 3 effects of background ions on iohexol degradation the effects of different background ions on iohexol degradation were studied and their corresponding kobs values of iohexol degradation are displayed in fig 5 tert butanol tba and methanol two strong hydroxyl radical inhibitors were dosed in the solution for confirming the role oh during iohexol ozonation the results indicate that all the tested background ions exhibited different extent of inhibitory effects on iohexol degradation during ozonation hco3 and co3 2 were weaker hydroxyl radical inhibitors compared to tba and methanol which would reduce the amount of hydroxyl radicals in the solution so as to reduce the iohexol degradation rate 34 the reaction rate constant of tba and oh was calculated to be 3 6 1010 m 1 min 1 and that of methanol and oh was calculated to be 5 82 1010 m 1 min 1 35 both species can consume oh effectively and have been commonly applied as radical scavengers in oh based aop processes 36 however the reaction rate of tba and ozone was extremely low k 1 8 10 1 m 1 min 1 37 therefore the significant inhibitation of iohexol degradation by ozone in the presence of tba in this study fig 5 implied that oh played the dominant role in iohexol degradation during ozonation as for chloride it can react with oh to form weaker oxidizing agents such as cl and hocl in eqs 9 13 35 which can also react with iohexol therefore the presence of cl exhibited the slightest inhibitory effect among the evaluated background ions 9 o h cl clo h 10 clo h h cl h 2 o 11 cl cl cl 2 12 2 cl 2 cl 2 cl 13 cl 2 h 2 o hocl cl as the bromide concentration increased in the solution the degradation rate of iohexol decreased significantly fig 6 the phenomena can be explained by the compete consumption of ozone by br 38 solutions contanining br are prone to form bro3 during ozonation according to previous studies bro3 can be formed mainly in two routes route one is br reacting with ozone through eqs 14 16 to form stable bro3 the other route is br reacting with ozone to form bromine radicals and the strong oxdizing agent hobr through eqs 17 20 which can further react with oh to form bro and bro2 through eqs 21 22 and go back to route one 39 40 therefore the chain reactions enhanced the consumption to o3 and decreased iohexol degradation as observed in fig 6 14 o 3 br bro o 2 15 o 3 bro bro 2 2o 2 16 o 3 bro 2 bro 3 17 2 br 2 o 3 2b r 3 o 2 18 b r br b r 2 19 b r 2 b r 2 br b r 3 20 b r 3 h 2 o hobr h 2 br 21 oh hobr bro h 2 o 22 2bro h 2 o bro bro 2 h 3 4 effects of ph on the formation of dbps after post chlorination due to the concern of the toxic volatile and semivolatile of some organic compounds that might be formed during the subsequent disinfection process in a drinking water plant 39 41 effect of solution ph on dbp formation was evaluated after 3 d chlorination to simulate water distribution in pipelines as shown in fig 7 four major dbps were detected at ph 5 9 after iohexol ozonation followed by chlorination including chloroform chcl3 dichloroacetonitrile c2hcl2n nitrochloroform ccl3no2 and trichloroacetone c3h3cl3o the concentrations of chcl3 and c2hcl2n exhibited a decreasing followed by an increasing trend as the ph value increased from 5 to 9 the minimum total dbp formation happened at ph 7 however ccl3no2 the most commonly detected nitrogenated dbps in the chlorination process 42 exhibited an opposite trend and c3h3cl3o decreased with increasing ph value because c3h3cl3o is not stable under alkaline conditions and is prone to hydrolysis it was produced in lower amounts at ph 7 43 icms can be degraded to different extent during aopsto form inorganic iodine and organic iodide 44 ozone can oxidize i to io3 very quickly eq 23 45 which is stable nontoxic and is a desired sink of i in water 46 therefore no i dbps were detected in the solution in the subsequent chlorination process 23 i 3 o 3 i o 3 3 o 2 3 5 effect of bromide concentration on the formation of dbps after post chlorination fig 8 displays the effect of bromide concentration the formation of dbps after chlorination of ozone oxidized iohexol the formation of chcl3 c2hcl3 and chbr2cl remained relatively low and stable as bromide concentration increased from 10 to 200 μm however the concentrations of chbr3 and c2hcl2n increased with increasing bromine concentration while the concentrations of two detected i dbps chcl2i and chclbri exhibited an increasing and then decreasing trend the presence of br in the solution can react with hocl to form hobr 47 48 which is a strong oxidizing agent with oxidation power stronger than that of hocl 49 50 and can react with iohexol or its degradation intermediates with the reaction rate much higher than of hocl 51 therefore in the presence of br three more brominated trihalomethanes br thms chbr2cl chbr3 and chclbri were significantly formed fig 8 compared to the condition in the absence of br fig 7 in order to further analyze the contribution of bromine to thms the bromine incorporation factor bif was calculate according to eq 24 52 24 bif n 0 3 n chc a 3 n br n n 0 3 chc a 3 n br n where n represents the molar concentration of a br thm and a represents chlorine or iodine in a thm species the range of bif is 0 3 52 the larger the bif value the greater the contribution of bromine to thms indicating the greater the proportion of br thms in thms the change in bif is displayed in the inserted in fig 8 as the concentration of bromide increased from 10 to 200 μm the bif increasd from 0 58 to 1 86 implying that brominated dbps were preferentially produced while chlorinated dbps were inhibited in the presence of bromide in the subsequent chlorination after iohexol ozonation 53 4 conclusions this work highlighted the successful application of ozone to decompose iohexol iohoxl degradation during ozonation followed pseudo first order kinetics well oh played a major role in the iohexol degradation process which was confirmed by the quenching experiments using tba and methanol at 25 c the degradation rate of iohexol by ozonation increased with increasing solution ph and ozone concentration however the formation of dbps was significant under alkaline conditions and the minimum was reached at ph 7 which is good for the control of dbp formation in treating real source water in the presence of backgroud ions hco3 co3 2 cl and br all exhibited different extent of inhibitary effects on the degradation of iohexol as the br concentration increased the iohexol degradation efficiency decreased significantly which was due to the competetition of ozone with iohexol and resulted in enhancing dbp formation after post chlorination especailly br thms the bif was calculated and exhibited an increasing trend from 0 58 to 1 86 with increasing bromide concentration from 10 to 200 μm therefore the potential environmental risks of iohexol degradation in the presence of bromide during ozonation should be considered acknowledgements this study was supported by the natural science foundation of china grant

first order kinetics plot of iohexol degradation during ozonation iohexol was degraded by more than 74 3 after 60 min ozonation the high linearity of the fitted line in fig 2 r2 0 996 indicates that iohexol degradation followed the pseudo first order kinetics well during ozonation and the degradation rate can be expressed in eq 3 3 d iohexol dt k obs iohexol t where iohexol represents the iohexol concentration at time t kobs min 1 represents the observed pseudo first order rate constant of iohexol degradation during ozonation which was calculated to be 2 17 0 04 10 2 min 1 in fig 2 3 2 effect of ph and ozone concentration on iohexol degradation during ozonation iohexol degradation during ozonation was investigated at ph 5 9 and the results are presented in fig 3 the degradation rate of iohexol gradually increased from 1 00 0 03 10 2 min 1 at ph 5 to the maximum value of 1 29 0 05 10 1 min 1 at ph 9 the dosed iohexol can be completely decomposed at ph 7 5 9 0 the rate constants of iohexol degradation during ozonation under alkaline conditions were significantly higher than those under acidic conditions this phenomenon can be explained by the major contribution of hydroxyl radicals oh to iohexol degradation which will be further discussed in section 3 4 at ph 7 oh in the solution can promote the formation of hydroxyl radicals according to eqs 4 and 5 accordingly a series of reactions happened with the generation of other active radicals at different ph values such as oh o2 o 3 ho 3 o and ho 2 eqs 6 to 8 therefore the ph of the solution is an important factor for iohexol degradation during ozonation 32 4 o 3 oh h o 2 o 2 k 4 2 10 2 m 1 min 1 5 o 3 h o 2 oh o 2 o 2 k 1 68 10 8 m 1 min 1 6 o 3 o 2 o 3 o 2 k 9 6 10 10 m 1 min 1 7a at ph 8 o 3 h h o 3 7b h o 3 o h o 2 8a at ph 8 o 3 o o 2 8b o h 2 o o h oh 8c o h o 3 h o 2 o 2 effect of ozone concentration on iohexol degradation was investigated at ph 7 and the results are displayed in fig 4 as the initial concentration of ozone increased from 0 342 to 1 13 mg l the molar ratio of ozone to iohexol increased from 0 72 to 2 32 the value of kobs increased from 7 25 0 30 10 3 to 5 77 0 26 10 2 min 1 according to eqs 6 9 the amount of generated radicals oh o2 o 3 and ho 3 in the solution increased with increasing ozone concentration which can react and degrade iohexol resulting in the increasing rate of iohexol degradation with increasing initial ozone concentration in fig 4 33 3 3 effects of background ions on iohexol degradation the effects of different background ions on iohexol degradation were studied and their corresponding kobs values of iohexol degradation are displayed in fig 5 tert butanol tba and methanol two strong hydroxyl radical inhibitors were dosed in the solution for confirming the role oh during iohexol ozonation the results indicate that all the tested background ions exhibited different extent of inhibitory effects on iohexol degradation during ozonation hco3 and co3 2 were weaker hydroxyl radical inhibitors compared to tba and methanol which would reduce the amount of hydroxyl radicals in the solution so as to reduce the iohexol degradation rate 34 the reaction rate constant of tba and oh was calculated to be 3 6 1010 m 1 min 1 and that of methanol and oh was calculated to be 5 82 1010 m 1 min 1 35 both species can consume oh effectively and have been commonly applied as radical scavengers in oh based aop processes 36 however the reaction rate of tba and ozone was extremely low k 1 8 10 1 m 1 min 1 37 therefore the significant inhibitation of iohexol degradation by ozone in the presence of tba in this study fig 5 implied that oh played the dominant role in iohexol degradation during ozonation as for chloride it can react with oh to form weaker oxidizing agents such as cl and hocl in eqs 9 13 35 which can also react with iohexol therefore the presence of cl exhibited the slightest inhibitory effect among the evaluated background ions 9 o h cl clo h 10 clo h h cl h 2 o 11 cl cl cl 2 12 2 cl 2 cl 2 cl 13 cl 2 h 2 o hocl cl as the bromide concentration increased in the solution the degradation rate of iohexol decreased significantly fig 6 the phenomena can be explained by the compete consumption of ozone by br 38 solutions contanining br are prone to form bro3 during ozonation according to previous studies bro3 can be formed mainly in two routes route one is br reacting with ozone through eqs 14 16 to form stable bro3 the other route is br reacting with ozone to form bromine radicals and the strong oxdizing agent hobr through eqs 17 20 which can further react with oh to form bro and bro2 through eqs 21 22 and go back to route one 39 40 therefore the chain reactions enhanced the consumption to o3 and decreased iohexol degradation as observed in fig 6 14 o 3 br bro o 2 15 o 3 bro bro 2 2o 2 16 o 3 bro 2 bro 3 17 2 br 2 o 3 2b r 3 o 2 18 b r br b r 2 19 b r 2 b r 2 br b r 3 20 b r 3 h 2 o hobr h

compounds that might be formed during the subsequent disinfection process in a drinking water plant 39 41 effect of solution ph on dbp formation was evaluated after 3 d chlorination to simulate water distribution in pipelines as shown in fig 7 four major dbps were detected at ph 5 9 after iohexol ozonation followed by chlorination including chloroform chcl3 dichloroacetonitrile c2hcl2n nitrochloroform ccl3no2 and trichloroacetone c3h3cl3o the concentrations of chcl3 and c2hcl2n exhibited a decreasing followed by an increasing trend as the ph value increased from 5 to 9 the minimum total dbp formation happened at ph 7 however ccl3no2 the most commonly detected nitrogenated dbps in the chlorination process 42 exhibited an opposite trend and c3h3cl3o decreased with increasing ph value because c3h3cl3o is not stable under alkaline conditions and is prone to hydrolysis it was produced in lower amounts at ph 7 43 icms can be degraded to different extent during aopsto form inorganic iodine and organic iodide 44 ozone can oxidize i to io3 very quickly eq 23 45 which is stable nontoxic and is a desired sink of i in water 46 therefore no i dbps were detected in the solution in the subsequent chlorination process 23 i 3 o 3 i o 3 3 o 2 3 5 effect of bromide concentration on the formation of dbps after post chlorination fig 8 displays the effect of bromide concentration the formation of dbps after chlorination of ozone oxidized iohexol the formation of chcl3 c2hcl3 and chbr2cl remained relatively low and stable as bromide concentration increased from 10 to 200 μm however the concentrations of chbr3 and c2hcl2n increased with increasing bromine concentration while the concentrations of two detected i dbps chcl2i and chclbri exhibited an increasing and then decreasing trend the presence of br in the solution can react with hocl to form hobr 47 48 which is a strong oxidizing agent with oxidation power stronger than that of hocl 49 50 and can react with iohexol or its degradation intermediates with the reaction rate much higher than of hocl 51 therefore in the presence of br three more brominated trihalomethanes br thms chbr2cl chbr3 and chclbri were significantly formed fig 8 compared to the condition in the absence of br fig 7 in order to further analyze the contribution of bromine to thms the bromine incorporation factor bif was calculate according to eq 24 52 24 bif n 0 3 n chc a 3 n br n n 0 3 chc a 3 n br n where n represents the molar concentration of a br thm and a represents chlorine or iodine in a thm species the range of bif is 0 3 52 the larger the bif value the greater the contribution of bromine to thms indicating the greater the proportion of br thms in thms the change in bif is displayed in the inserted in fig 8 as the concentration of bromide increased from 10 to 200 μm the bif increasd from 0 58 to 1 86 implying that brominated dbps were preferentially produced while chlorinated dbps were inhibited in the presence of bromide in the subsequent chlorination after iohexol ozonation 53 4 conclusions this work highlighted the successful application of ozone to decompose iohexol iohoxl degradation during ozonation followed pseudo first order kinetics well oh played a major role in the iohexol degradation process which was confirmed by the quenching experiments using tba and methanol at 25 c the degradation rate of iohexol by ozonation increased with increasing solution ph and ozone concentration however the formation of dbps was significant under alkaline conditions and the minimum was reached at ph 7 which is good for the control of dbp formation in treating real source water in the presence of backgroud ions hco3 co3 2 cl and br all exhibited different extent of inhibitary effects on the degradation of iohexol as the br concentration increased the iohexol degradation efficiency decreased significantly which was due to the competetition of ozone with iohexol and resulted in enhancing dbp formation after post chlorination especailly br thms the bif was calculated and exhibited an increasing trend from 0 58 to 1 86 with increasing bromide concentration from 10 to 200 μm therefore the potential environmental risks of iohexol degradation in the presence of bromide during ozonation should be considered acknowledgements this study was supported by the natural science foundation of china grant
