2835,snow stores a significant amount of water in mountain regions the decrease of water storage in the snowpack can have relevant impacts on water supply for mountain and lowland areas that rely on snow melting in this work we modelled the snow water equivalent swe using daily snow depth hs data obtained from 19 historical hs measurement stations located in the southern european alps italy then we analysed the long term 1930 2020 variability of the monthly standardised swe index sswei and its links with climate change and large scale atmospheric forcings teleconnection indices we found a marked variability in monthly sswei with the lowermost values generally occurring in the last few decades 1991 2020 irrespective of elevation in this recent period highly negative values occurred at the snow season tails mostly in spring we found large scale atmospheric patterns north atlantic oscillation atlantic multi decadal oscillation and artic oscillation and precipitation to be interconnected with sswei oscillations although this relation changed after the 1980s especially at low and medium elevations this change occurred in correspondence of highly positive air temperature anomalies in the last decades we found increasing air temperature to be the main driver for the pronounced snow mass loss and persistent snow drought conditions keywords snow mountains standardised index teleconnection indices global warming drought data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the importance of snow as a seasonal water resource threatened by climate change is well acknowledged immerzeel et al 2010 huss et al 2017 li et al 2017 however snow is not only a water resource but it also plays a key role for sustaining ecological e g keller et al 2005 jonas et al 2008 freppaz et al 2018 and socioeconomic e g rixen et al 2011 beniston 2012 systems in mountains thus observing snow related variables and their temporal variations is pivotal for understanding the related processes and providing more reliable assessments of future changes beniston et al 2018 among the different observed snow related variables snow water equivalent swe plays a crucial role swe is the mathematical product of snow depth hs and the snowpack bulk density ρb representing the equivalent amount of liquid water stored in the snowpack fierz et al 2009 swe is critical for flood and drought prediction e g jörg hess et al 2015 vionnet et al 2020 hydropower management e g larue et al 2017 magnusson et al 2020 ecological monitoring e g pauli et al 2005 huss et al 2017 avalanche forecasting e g barfod et al 2013 hatchett et al 2017 and mountain aquifer recharge lucianetti et al 2017 despite the critical importance of swe fewer direct measurements are available for this variable than for hs e g sturm et al 2010 schöber et al 2016 since manual and automatic measurements of ρb require complex and costly procedures egli et al 2009 kinar and pomeroy 2015 therefore consecutive decades long series of measured swe are uncommon and geographically scattered jonas et al 2009 avanzi et al 2015 indirect swe measurements such as through remote sensing techniques can also be performed at various scales although issues exist related to their spatial resolution accuracy and sensitivity dozier et al 2016 schattan et al 2017 steiner et al 2018 smyth et al 2019 finally yet of primary importance for long term studies the available direct and indirect swe measurements series generally cover few decades which is short compared to several decades long hs data kinar and pomeroy 2015 beniston et al 2018 because of the reduced number of long term datasets there are only a few swe trend studies and most of them are focused on north america e g mote et al 2018 thakur et al 2020 elias et al 2021 in the european alps for the period 1981 2010 large scale gridded swe datasets showed weak nonsignificant decreases in contrast to the mostly negative swe trends found in the northern hemisphere mudryk et al 2015 few studies analysed decades long swe trends in switzerland finding no trends in the swiss alps for the period 1975 1992 rohrer et al 1994 and differently pointing out a general reduction of swe in the last six decades marty et al 2017 only one study was performed in the central italian alps bocchiola and diolaiuti 2010 finding that spring swe decreased between 1965 and 2007 differently from swe several studies investigated multiple decades long hs trends in the european alps including italy matiu et al 2021 and references therein reported hs data can be used to model swe two main model types exist for this purpose i empirical regression models erms and ii semiempirical models sms egli et al 2009 winkler et al 2021 erms derive swe from hs and a combination of date elevation and regional parameters e g jonas et al 2009 pistocchi 2016 guyennon et al 2019 although capable to adequately model single swe features e g mean peak and seasonal swe erms are not suitable for calculating daily swe from hs time series jonas et al 2009 winkler et al 2021 conversely sms are suitable for deriving swe at daily resolution from continuous hs series simulating individual snowpack layers and taking advantage of the use of simple densification concepts winkler et al 2021 however compared to more complicated physically based models pbms they can only model ρb and swe while pbms can also simulate snowpack features like energy fluxes mass changes due to wind drift grain types etc unfortunately pbms require as input at least local temperature and precipitation information de michele et al 2013 or climatological means hill et al 2019 highly limiting their application in mountainous areas egli et al 2009 thus in order to study long term swe changes using increasingly available decades long hs data series the use of sms represents the most effective approach long term standardised swe indices can be a useful tool for the analysis of long term swe changes and especially for investigating snow droughts swe deficits the use of normalised indices moving from absolute values to the frequency domain in terms of past estimated probability of occurrence i e wmo 2012 allows for a direct comparison of swe time series collected at different locations and possibly affected by local and regional factors in this framework snow droughts remain relatively unexplored compared to other drought types huning and aghakouchak 2020 and only few studies have taken into consideration snow information for drought characterisation e g staudinger et al 2014 hatchett and mcevoy 2018 zhang et al 2019 especially on the seasonal basis huning and aghakouchak 2020 this is particularly true for the italian alps and european alps in general where the temporal evolution of swe deficits remains virtually unknown due to the lack of specific studies further uncertainties exist on the relationships between snow variables and large scale atmospheric forcings indeed contrasting results have been reported regarding the behaviour of teleconnection indices and snow precipitation dynamics in the alps for instance in the european alps the north atlantic oscillation nao hurrell 1995 was found to i provide significant control upon snow variables and precipitation beniston 1997 beniston and jungo 2002 lópez moreno et al 2011 ii be only weakly and intermittently correlated to precipitation schmidli et al 2002 bartolini et al 2009 iii play a minor role on snow cover and precipitation dynamics durand et al 2009 bartolini et al 2010 similar results were found for the atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo kaplan et al 1998 zampieri et al 2013 nicolet et al 2016 2018 brugnara and maugeri 2019 and the artic oscillation ao li and wang 2003 bartolini et al 2009 2010 terzago et al 2013 based on the previous considerations in this study we aimed at unravelling the long term variability in the water resources stored in the snowpack across the italian alps to do this we i retrieved daily hs measurements from 19 long term weather stations distributed in the italian alps across an elevation range 750 2600 m a s l ii modelled daily swe using the most recent and advanced sm available δsnow model winkler et al 2021 iii calculated the monthly standardised snow water equivalent index sswei iv investigated the elevational trends of sswei v explored how sswei records are linked to climatic variables large scale air temperature and precipitation from reanalysis and selected teleconnection indices nao winter nao amo and ao in order to better understand the influence of climate change and large scale atmospheric forcings on the regional sswei dynamics 2 data and methods 2 1 study region the alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system in europe stretching with their arc shaped structure about 1 200 km across eight countries major rivers in europe such as the rhine rhone danube and po are fed by a network of tributaries originating in the alps whose significance for the regional water cycle is also expressed in the notion water tower of europe the italian alps roughly correspond to the southern european alps defined as the mountainous area south of the main alpine watershed brugnara and maugeri 2019 in this region the main climatic characteristic is the large influence of the mediterranean sea which generally implies higher temperatures than in the northern slope and higher orographically driven precipitation due to the greater water content of the air isotta et al 2014 brugnara and maugeri 2019 the alpine ecoregion in italy is a well defined combination of structural climatic and biogeographic features blasi et al 2014 in our study the geographical boundaries are those defined by the ismsa soiusa classification international standardized mountain subdivision of the alps suddivisione orografica internazionale unificata del sistema alpino marazzi 2005 fig 1 2 2 data series the analysed dataset consists of continuous daily measurements of snow depth hs retrieved from 19 manual and automatic stations located above 750 m a s l the largest part of the data derived from manual measurements the stations are mainly located in flat open areas in the valley floors or near dams all the stations cover the period encompassed between 1960 and 2020 elevation range 750 2600 m a s l among these stations 15 cover also the previous 30 year period 1930 1959 elevation range 864 2200 m a s l table 1 in this way the analysed stations are well distributed over different elevations and climatic regions in the italian south western alps north western alps and south eastern alps following soiusa fig 1 the data used in the present study were compiled by regional and provincial aineva avalanche services interregional association for coordination and documentation of snow and avalanche problems together with regional environmental protection agencies arpa piemonte arpa veneto regione autonoma valle d aosta meteotrentino italian meteorological society smi hydropower companies cva s p a enel s p a and ministry of public work hydrological annals data quality was firstly assessed by aineva which replaced below zero hs values and outliers with missing values in addition we further carefully checked the series in order to remove possible recording errors by applying a temporal consistency check to the hs station records we screened the series for jumps 40 cm up 30 cm up preceded by a zero and 20 cm down on two consecutive days we checked manually all the resulting values and replaced the recording errors with missing values several hundred events were visually checked and only few dozens were actually recording errors globally missing values affected approximately only 1 of the entire dataset with a maximum value of 3 2 for single series table 1 we filled the data gaps shorter than 3 days by linear regression while longer data gaps were left unchanged since the annual cycle of the snow water equivalent swe is shaped by snow accumulation and melting we decided to entirely exclude from the analyses the snow seasons presenting data gaps at the beginning i e november december january differently in case of data gaps not affecting the beginning of the snow season we excluded periods only after the missing values until the end of the snow season this step was necessary to prevent erroneous swe simulations by not taking into account data gaps during the crucial period of the build up of the seasonal snowpack more details in 2 3 swe modelling while avoiding the exclusion of entire snow seasons affected by some data gaps after the season beginning i e melting period further details about the management of data gaps in the analyses are reported in section 2 6 trend analysis regarding the homogeneity of the data a large effort was devoted by aineva to assess and eliminate inhomogeneities within the time series resulting from several non climatic factors that changed during the historical investigated period e g station relocations for instance in this work we chose only stations that were not known to be affected by relevant station relocations or other affecting factors beyond this applying appropriate homogeneity tests on long term hs data is not straightforward and still subjected to large research efforts e g marcolini et al 2017a marcolini et al 2019 differently from temperature and precipitation records auer et al 2007 for this reason we performed the assessment of potential inhomogeneities only manually thanks to the aineva effort for four stations cortina arabba tonale and cavia located at 1250 1630 1880 and 2100 m a s l respectively we retrieved measured swe values which we used to validate the δsnow model details in 2 3 swe modelling only two of them cortina and arabba are part of our long term hs dataset while the other two tonale and cavia are used only for validation purposes fig 1 table 1 these four stations were the only places across all our study area where biweekly or monthly swe measurements were performed jointly with daily hs measurements swe was measured by hydropower companies and aineva between 1983 and 2020 using layer and drill methods for the swe layer calculation the snow density ρb was measured for each individuated homogeneous layer by weighting a known volume of snow sampled horizontally valt et al 2012 described the statistical procedure adopted for the calculation of the ρb and the integration of the layers having a thickness lower than the coring tube diameter for the swe drill calculation a single vertical snow core was used berni and giancanelli 1966 valt 2019 verified that the differences between the two methods were within 5 2 3 swe modelling to model swe we used δsnow a new semiempirical multilayer model for simulating swe and ρb from a regular time series of hs winkler et al 2021 the model considers the change of hs as a proxy for the various processes altering ρb and swe δsnow i bases its dry snow densification function on newtonian viscosity ii provides a way to deal with small discrepancies between model and observation hs measurement errors iii takes into account unsteady compaction of underlying older snow layers due to overburden snow loads iv densifies snow layers from top to bottom during melting phases without automatically modelling mass loss due to runoff more details in winkler et al 2021 the model does not take into account snow drift compaction and mass changes due to rain on snow runoff during snowfalls wind drift little snowfalls sublimation and deposition δsnow can be used for estimating swe in high elevated areas with deep long lasting snowpacks as well as in valleys with shallow ephemeral snowpacks in the δsnow model seven parameters can be calibrated new snow density ρ 0 maximum possible snow density ρ max two viscosity parameters η 0 and k threshold deviation τ and two overburden parameters c ov and k ov to calibrate the model winkler et al 2021 used snow observations of 67 winters from 14 stations well distributed over different elevations and climatic regions of the european alps in addition the authors used data from 71 independent winters from 15 stations for validation in this work we used the calibration proposed by winkler et al 2021 tab s1 indeed the parameter setting suggested by the authors revealed to be optimal to model swe from daily hs time series recorded at stations located in alpine areas and with snow not older than an estimated 200 days regarding the latter the mean duration of snow season snow day hs 1 cm was 200 days at five stations all located above 2000 m a s l among these stations we used only one toggia 2200 m a s l table 1 for the long term trend analysis in the period 1930 2020 details in 2 4 sswei and spatial elevational patterns however cavia station which was used to validate the model details below is located at 2100 m a s l and had a mean snow season duration of ca 205 days therefore we also assessed the model s performance taking into account very long lasting snowpacks we obtained 650 pairs of hs and swe measurements from the stations used for δsnow validation winkler et al 2021 calibrated δsnow using only those sites and years where and when the respective values of the daily hs record matched the values of swe measurements in our study we used a threshold of 0 2 m as maximum hs discrepancy between daily value at the stations and measured hs at the swe measurement sites this step was necessary since the measurement of swe is a disruptive procedure thus swe and hs measurements could not always be taken exactly at the same place which introduced uncertainty cf lópez moreno et al 2020 the selected threshold allowed us to benefit of 501 observations for the validation we assessed the performance of the swe estimations through the analysis of the pearson correlation r mean error me mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse me mae and rmse are defined as follows 1 m e 1 n i 1 n s w e o b s s w e m o d 2 m a e 1 n i 1 n s w e o b s s w e m o d 3 r m s e i 1 n s w e o b s s w e m o d 2 n where sweobs and swemod are the observed and modelled swe respectively me mae and rmse are expressed in the same units of swe mm 2 4 sswei and spatial elevational patterns for the calculation of standardised indices at the monthly scale a theoretical distribution and a reference baseline have to be chosen we selected the 1961 1990 period as a reference baseline then we tested the fit of two different distribution functions lognormal and gamma e g jonas et al 2009 margulis et al 2016 to the monthly mean simulated swe data using the negative log likelihood criteria we found the best fit for our data with the gamma distribution therefore we fitted a gamma distribution for each month of the snow season at each station we defined the beginning and end of the snow season for each station as the first and last month having a minimum of 50 of monthly mean swe 0 over the chosen baseline then we calculated the standardised swe index sswei according to huning and aghakouchak 2020 to identify which correlations could be expected depending on horizontal and vertical distances between stations we performed a spatial analysis on sswei to do so we carried out pairwise correlations pearson between monthly sswei series from november to may only in this case the analysis was performed for the 1960 2020 period in order to have more pairs of stations all 19 stations for all the following analyses e g trends periodicity etc we used only the 15 stations with data in the period 1930 2020 for all analyses we selected the stations with at least 90 of the available months 2 5 climatic drivers and teleconnection indices to study the influence of air temperature and precipitation on sswei variability we used era5 land a reanalysis product derived by running the land component of era5 at increased resolution 9 km compared to 31 km and at hourly time scale dee et al 2011 muñoz sabater et al 2021 in our study we used the simulations from 1950 to 2020 selecting all the grid points falling into the region of investigation only the sectors where the stations were located delimited by the souisa classification fig 1 we produced monthly averages of mean daily temperature and cumulated total precipitation given the reduced amount of grid points we did not consider spatial or elevation differences thus obtaining a single output for each month in the region of investigation then we calculated the 2 m air temperature deviation from its long term mean 1961 90 for each month obtaining a region wide monthly air temperature anomaly at finally we calculated a monthly standard precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 considering a gamma distribution calibrated on each month over the 1961 1990 baseline cf romano et al 2021 we explored the possible relationships between sswei as well as at and spi and teleconnection patterns considering the following selected indices north atlantic oscillation nao and winter nao wnao hurrell 1995 atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo kaplan et al 1998 and artic oscillation ao li and wang 2003 2 6 trend analysis we performed the trend analysis on sswei in the period 1930 2020 using the non parametric mann kendall mk test kendall 1975 which is widely adopted to assess significant trends in hydro meteorological time series e g valt and cianfarra 2010 guyennon et al 2013 salerno et al 2015 in this study we applied the sequential mk test seqmk gerstengarbe and werner 1999 to monthly vectors to monitor the overall non stationarity of the time series we analysed the progressive normalised kendall s tau coefficient µ τ we treated the few missing values in the series with a stationary assumption thus preserving unchanged the values preceding the missing values finally we performed the trend analysis also on monthly at and spi in the period 1950 2020 2 7 analysis of periodicity we explored the possible periodic components of the monthly sswei by means of a time frequency wavelet analysis adopting the morlet transform unlike the classical fourier transform the wavelet transform allows a localisation of the signals in both frequency and time rather than in a simple frequency space the mathematical bases of this technique are given by grossmann and morlet 1984 and a complete description is given by torrence and compo 1998 moreover we investigated the non stationarity of the relationships between sswei and teleconnection indices using the wavelet coherence wtc the wtc is defined as the square of the cross spectrum normalised by the individual power spectra the wtc also allows finding high levels of significance even when the common power of the two series is low and thus it gives an accurate representation of the normalised covariance between the two time series torrence and webster 1999 guyennon et al 2014 3 results 3 1 model validation modelled swe had an overall r of 0 96 me of 6 3 mm mae of 39 9 mm and rmse of 56 2 mm indicating a rather good performance in the representation of the swe in our validation sites although in our case δsnow performed moderately worse than in winkler et al 2021 mae 21 9 mm rmse 30 8 mm we stress out the fact that we did not perform an ad hoc calibration for our sites considering the reduced number of hs swe pairs available in our study region in addition the elevation of our validation sites ranged from 1250 to 2100 m a s l while in winkler et al 2021 the elevation range of the calibration validation sites was between 590 and 1780 m a s l thus we expected a rather worse performance of the model considering the higher elevations and the longer snow seasons taken into consideration in our study indeed we obtained the best modelling performance at the lowermost station cortina 1250 m a s l mae 30 6 rmse 37 8 mm and the worst performance at the highermost one cavia 2100 m a s l mae 57 4 rmse 77 5 mm fig 2 finally winkler et al 2021 calibrated δsnow using only those sites and years where and when the respective values of the daily hs record matched the values of the biweekly measurements differently in our study we selected a threshold for maximum hs discrepancy between daily value at the stations and measured hs at the swe measurement sites of 0 2 m even though we used this threshold our overall modelling performance was in line with the performances of other modelling studies performed in alpine areas such as egli et al 2009 rmse 56 mm snowpack model jonas et al 2009 rmse 50 9 53 2 mm essery et al 2013 rmse 23 77 mm various thermodynamic snow models sturm et al 2010 mae 51 mm calibrated in guyennon et al 2019 pistocchi 2016 mae 50 6 mm calibrated in guyennon et al 2019 and guyennon et al 2019 mae 49 2 mm 3 2 elevation and spatial patterns of sswei mean monthly swe values and snow cover duration showed increasing values according to elevation fig 3 a table 1 as expected in particular we found three main elevation clusters low elevation 5 stations 750 1250 m a s l mean swe 61 mm mean max swe 80 mm snow cover duration january march medium elevation 8 stations 1251 1850 m a s l mean swe 141 mm mean max swe 215 mm snow cover duration december april high elevation 6 stations 1850 m a s l mean swe 290 mm mean max swe 476 mm snow cover duration november may in addition the sswei correlation analysis showed that correlation coefficients decreased with both horizontal and vertical distance although they remained high even for large distances fig 3b we found correlation coefficients equal to or higher than 0 7 for vertical distances of up to 600 m with less than 200 km horizontal distance considering these findings we averaged the individual station based sswei values and performed the trend analysis on the 15 long term stations 1930 2020 according to the three selected elevation bands 3 3 temporal variability and trends of sswei the temporal variability of sswei spi and at as a function of the three elevation bands is shown in fig 4 whereas the results of the seqmk test applied to these variables are shown in fig 5 in general we found the lowermost monthly sswei values to occur in the period 1991 2020 other interesting features of the sswei curves were the minima in the 1940s 1950s march may and the maxima in the 1960s november january and in the 1970s 1980s february may irrespective of the elevation all these minima and maxima were particularly evident in march low elevation march april medium elevation and march may high elevation for these months the maximum sswei value was reached in the time lapse 1971 1990 which was then followed by a minimum around the early 1990s after this minimum a partial recovery or stabilisation was experienced at all elevation bands although in general sswei remained negative until the end of the analysed time frame the low sswei values of the last 30 years caused the results of the seqmk test to exhibit the lowermost µ τ values in the 1991 2020 period for all months across all the elevation bands we found however a few exceptions such as march low elevation april medium elevation and may high elevation which showed comparably negative values in the 1940s 1950s evident were also the high µ τ values for sswei in almost all investigated months in the 1970s 1980s across the three elevation bands however due to the high year to year variability of the sswei records the corresponding µ τ records reached a 95 significance level only in a limited number of cases the temporal behaviour of spi showed a rather good agreement with the sswei s one across all elevation bands indicating a general interconnection between precipitation and swe dynamics however main divergence patterns between sswei and spi emerged for specific months across different time frames i in the 1960s january across all elevation bands showed positive sswei and negative spi and at ii in the 1970s 1980s april at medium and high elevation was characterised by positive sswei and negative spi and at iii in the period 1991 2020 march april medium elevation and november april may high elevation exhibited decidedly negative sswei from slightly negative to slightly positive spi and markedly positive at iv in the 2010s january and february at all elevations and march low elevation evidenced negative sswei from around zero to slightly positive spi and strongly positive at the divergences between sswei and spi also emerged from the analysis of the µ τ records specifically i in the 1960s january and february across all elevation bands evidenced µ τ values generally above zero for sswei and negative for spi and at ii in the 1970s 1980s april medium and high elevation exhibited µ τ values decidedly above zero for sswei and negative for spi and at iii in the period 1991 2020 november high elevation december medium and high elevation january low medium and high elevation and march medium and high elevation showed µ τ values decidedly below zero for sswei around zero or slightly negative for spi and markedly positive for at a clear divergence also emerged for may high elevation with a well negative µ τ for sswei and positive values for at µ τ and spi µ τ therefore the agreement between sswei and spi was lower mostly in the periods with strongest temperature anomaly and this was especially evident in the most recent period due to the very strong positive temperature trend in the last decades figure s1 shows the wavelet transformation of the average monthly sswei time series of the three elevation ranges this analysis did not give evidence of continuous periodic behaviour in any interval of the investigated period with most of the power spectral density contained in sporadic episodes of pluri annual variability 3 4 sswei relationships with teleconnection patterns the pearson correlation coefficients computed between the monthly teleconnection indices nao wnao ao and amo and sswei over the entire period 1930 2020 are shown in figure s2 correlations in figure s2 are performed on 7 year moving averaged data to highlight pluriannual response of sswei to climatic and teleconnection forcings nao wnao and ao showed significant negative correlations anticorrelation with sswei during the early snow season particularly in january considering all elevation bands differently amo significantly anticorrelated with sswei during the late snow season especially in march considering the three elevation bands these results highlight that higher lower nao wnao ao and amo values are linked to lower higher sswei values from the correlation analysis we selected the months with the highest correlation coefficients to be used in the wtc analysis we selected january for nao wnao and ao and march for the amo given the similar behaviour of nao and wnao and considering the higher correlation coefficients for wnao we applied the wtc only on wnao the results of the wtc analysis are reported in fig 6 the low and medium elevation bands had a similar behaviour for both wnao and ao looking at the pluri decadal variability the coherence with sswei was strong close to 1 until the 1980s then the signal became weaker and not significant except for ao at the medium elevations this break was followed by a coherence increase after 2000 displaying also a shift towards a decadal variability ao also showed some significant signals below the decadal time scale which vanished around the 1980s at the medium elevations looking at the pluri decadal variability the coherence between amo and sswei was strong until the end of the 1980s then it vanished we found no persistent significant signal for amo at low elevation differently from the low and medium elevation bands at the high elevations all teleconnection indices showed persistently strong coherence at the pluri decadal time scale however during the 1980s ao showed a shift from a pluri decadal to decadal variability and the vanishing of some significant pluri annual signals the pearson correlation coefficients computed between the monthly teleconnection indices and at and spi are shown in figure s2 for this analysis we discriminated between two sub periods 1950 1990 and 1991 2020 due to the step like change that occurred in at at the end of the 1980s beginning of the 1990s fig 4 in january nao wnao and ao were significantly and positively correlated with at in the period 1950 1990 while the correlation weakened in the sub period 1991 2020 the correlation vanished for ao differently we did not find significant correlations between nao wnao and ao and spi for january except for a significant negative correlation for ao in the period 1991 2020 in march at did not significantly correlate with amo both in 1950 1990 and 1991 2020 while spi showed a significant negative correlation in the period 1950 1990 4 discussion 4 1 variability of sswei our results show a marked variability in monthly sswei through the analysed period 1930 2020 previous studies on swe variability and trend in the european alps reported i a general reduction in february weaker and april stronger swe across the alpine chain in the period 1968 2012 marty et al 2017 as well as a spring swe decrease occurring between 1965 and 2007 in the italian alps bocchiola and diolaiuti 2010 ii weak nonsignificant swe decreases in the period 1981 2010 across the entire alpine chain mudryk et al 2015 iii no swe trends in the swiss alps for the period 1975 1992 rohrer et al 1994 the apparent disagreement among the previously presented research results including our findings are likely caused by the different periods and datasets considered by the authors for instance marty et al 2017 investigated a long term 1945 2012 alpine wide swe time series by calculating the relative february and april swe deviation from its long term mean 1961 90 for different stations across the alps their findings show several agreements with ours such as i in february lowermost values in the early 1990s and partial recovery stabilisation in the following decades highermost values in the 1970s 1980s and some kind of stationarity with relatively low magnitude oscillations in the previous decades ii in april lowermost values in the early 1990s with a following partial stabilisation highermost values in the 1970s 1980s and low values in the 1940s 1950s the most striking changes occurred in the period 1991 2020 that generally experienced record low sswei values across all elevation bands although we also found few low monthly sswei values in the 1940s 1950s it is worth noting though that these changes did no occurred gradually but rather following a sharp drop culminating in the early 1990s especially in spring the abrupt change in swe values between the end of the 1980s and the early 1990s was also measured in the observational swe data collected by marty et al 2017 across the european alps this evidence is also in agreement with the findings that other studies have reported showing a step like change for alpine hs occurring in the late 1980s early 1990s marty 2008 durand et al 2009 valt and cianfarra 2010 matiu et al 2021 our results showed that this drop was then followed by a partial stabilisation or even recovery although sswei values remained mostly negative until the end of the investigated period this is also in agreement with previous studies on snow cover in the alps reporting that the monthly mean snow covered area across the alpine chain has not decreased significantly since the step change hüsler et al 2014 however in an alpine wide view this temporal variability is also accompanied by a strong regional variability when considering hs matiu et al 2021 snow drought has been firstly defined as near or above average accumulated precipitation coinciding with below average swe at a point in time pederson et al 2011 some studies have distinguished between dry i e precipitation limited and i e temperature driven despite above normal precipitation snow droughts harpold et al 2017 hatchett and mcevoy 2018 in our work we consider all types of snow droughts without differentiating them in our study region unprecedented and persistent snow drought conditions occurred in the period 1991 2020 fig 7 particularly low swe values in the last two to three decades have been reported not only for the alps marty et al 2017 but also for other low to high mountainous areas of the world such as europe dong and menzel 2020 nedelcev and jenicek 2021 north america mote et al 2018 and asia kraaijenbrink et al 2021 finally in the last few decades several areas of the world emerged as hot spots for snow droughts including europe showing longer snow drought durations although high continental and regional variability exists huning and aghakouchak 2020 thus our evidence seems to be part of a world wide pattern rather than of a region specific one indicating recent persistent swe deficits 4 2 drivers of sswei variability sswei variability seemed to be generally interconnected to precipitation variability here analysed through the spi however this interconnection weakened in the period 1991 2020 especially at medium march april and high elevation november april may although also the low elevation band showed a divergent behaviour in the 2010s january march indeed negative sswei trends got decoupled from slightly negative to positive spi trends under the effect of strongly positive at trends the observed changes were likely caused by more frequent and more intense melt klein et al 2016 and by a shift from solid to liquid precipitation serquet et al 2011 nikolova et al 2013 both resulting from higher air temperatures during winter and spring beniston et al 2018 in addition during the early 1990s we found concomitant strong air temperature increases and slight to moderate precipitation decreases resulting in unprecedented negative sswei trends this regime shift mostly involving air temperature has been documented both at the alpine marty 2008 and global reid et al 2016 scales in addition our results clearly showed the importance of at variations in decoupling sswei from spi in other periods such as in the 1960s january all elevation bands and 1970s 1980s april medium and high elevation when positive sswei was associated to negative spi and at regarding the correlation between sswei and the investigated teleconnection indices we found high and significant negative coefficients across the entire period 1930 2020 considering the three elevation bands we found the strongest anticorrelations for nao wnao and ao to occur in january during the early snow season i e accumulation phase while for amo the strongest anticorrelation occurred in march late snow season i e melting phase these results are in agreement with a large body of literature indeed in the southern european alps in italy a common pattern seemed to emerge with snow and winter precipitation dynamics being negatively correlated with nao wnao maragno et al 2009 bocchiola and diolaiuti 2010 diolaiuti et al 2012 terzago et al 2013 brugnara and maugeri 2019 amo zampieri et al 2013 brugnara and maugeri 2019 and ao terzago et al 2013 similar results were found for nao and winter mass balance of glaciers carturan et al 2015 in addition other studies in the european alps have found nao to be negatively positively correlated with winter precipitation quadrelli et al 2001 lópez moreno et al 2011 temperature beniston 1997 beniston and jungo 2002 snow cover henderson and leathers 2010 and mass balance of glaciers reichert et al 2001 amo has also been reported to be anticorrelated with glacier mass balance huss et al 2010 however the wtc analysis showed changes breaks in coherence and shifts in time scale variability occurring mostly throughout the 1980s sometimes with the total vanishing of the coherence afterwards especially at low and medium elevations in the same period at skyrocketed spi remained more stable reaching the highest values and showing the most significant trends this occurrence further highlights the sensitivity of low and medium elevations towards climate changes marcolini et al 2017b where it is likely that the atmospheric warming occurring in the last decades has played an increasingly important role in driving swe marty et al 2017 and snow dynamics hock et al 2019 4 3 hydrological implications and research perspectives the decrease of water storage in the snowpack can potentially have dire implications for water supply in those communities that directly rely on snow melting ipcc 2019 with relevant regional and global ramifications also in downstream snow free areas huning and aghakouchak 2020 the magnitude of these implications will likely increase in the future for instance for the european alps at an elevation of 1500 m a s l it has been simulated a reduction in swe of up to 80 90 by the end of the century while the decrease has been projected to be more reduced 10 for elevations above 3000 m a s l rousselot et al 2012 steger et al 2013 schmucki et al 2015 thus human activities are being and will be even more influenced by the ongoing and anticipated changes with relevant impacts on water management laghari et al 2012 köplin et al 2014 regarding for instance water supply hydropower production and irrigation requirements barnett et al 2005 gaudard and romerio 2014 gaudard et al 2014 hill clarvis et al 2014 qin et al 2020 the 2021 2022 drought event that impacted and that is still impacting at the beginning of september 2022 the po river basin is a clear example of the implications of our findings preliminary data collected by the autorità di bacino distrettuale del fiume po district basin authority of the po river showed that winter 2021 2022 was characterised by a significant precipitation deficit spi3 constantly below 1 5 over several areas of the western and central italian alps the lack of solid precipitation during winter along with a persistent precipitation deficit during spring and summer spi3 1 5 and air temperatures above the seasonal means resulted in an unprecedented hydrological drought the po river discharge at the pontelagoscuro monitoring station was 60 with respect of the long term monthly average in march and 85 in july due to the very low discharge of several rivers not sustained by the spring snow melt the agricultural sector was particularly affected the drought event that impacted the po river basin in 2022 clearly shows that a better understanding of the snowpack dynamics can strongly support the management of the entire po basin both over short periods and over medium to long periods it is also worth noting the importance of estimating the historical swe time series in terms of standardised indices significant changes of the sswei point out significant changes in the average hydrological conditions indicating the range of a new normality that must be taken into account for implementing sound and effective mitigation measures and strategy plans in this framework the study of the emerging phenomenon known as snow drought will be more and more relevant cooper et al 2016 mote et al 2016 huning and aghakouchak 2020 hatchett et al 2022 even more important will be the understanding of the hydrometeorological processes that could cause snow droughts in order to evaluate their impacts on consumptive uses that rely on snowmelt derived runoff or ecological processes that depend on the presence of a snowpack hatchett and mcevoy 2018 in that perspective decision support could benefit from further investigations on the current response to teleconnection indices based on wider station networks 5 conclusions we assessed the long term 1930 2020 variability of monthly sswei across the italian alps and its links with climate change and large scale atmospheric forcings using modelled swe derived from daily hs data we found record low monthly sswei values to occur mainly in the last few decades 1991 2020 irrespective of elevation although some other negative sswei oscillations occurred during the investigated period lowermost values were experienced in the early 1990s and despite a partial recovery or stabilisation in the following years decades sswei remained generally negative until 2020 especially at the snow season tails we investigated the role of large scale atmospheric forcings teleconnection indices in driving these patterns finding that nao wnao amo and ao were anticorrelated with sswei during different phases of the snow season however strong changes breaks occurred in the relations between teleconnection indices and sswei after the 1980s especially at low and medium elevations we also looked at the relationships between climate drivers precipitation spi and air temperature at and sswei finding that sswei variability seemed to be generally interconnected to precipitation variability however this interconnection was lost mostly in the period 1991 2020 when highly positive at occurred therefore increasing air temperature has likely become predominant over the influence of large scale atmospheric forcings and precipitation variability in the recent decades we conclude that snow drought variability is an important indicator of climate change and that the unprecedented and persistent snow drought conditions

2835,snow stores a significant amount of water in mountain regions the decrease of water storage in the snowpack can have relevant impacts on water supply for mountain and lowland areas that rely on snow melting in this work we modelled the snow water equivalent swe using daily snow depth hs data obtained from 19 historical hs measurement stations located in the southern european alps italy then we analysed the long term 1930 2020 variability of the monthly standardised swe index sswei and its links with climate change and large scale atmospheric forcings teleconnection indices we found a marked variability in monthly sswei with the lowermost values generally occurring in the last few decades 1991 2020 irrespective of elevation in this recent period highly negative values occurred at the snow season tails mostly in spring we found large scale atmospheric patterns north atlantic oscillation atlantic multi decadal oscillation and artic oscillation and precipitation to be interconnected with sswei oscillations although this relation changed after the 1980s especially at low and medium elevations this change occurred in correspondence of highly positive air temperature anomalies in the last decades we found increasing air temperature to be the main driver for the pronounced snow mass loss and persistent snow drought conditions keywords snow mountains standardised index teleconnection indices global warming drought data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the importance of snow as a seasonal water resource threatened by climate change is well acknowledged immerzeel et al 2010 huss et al 2017 li et al 2017 however snow is not only a water resource but it also plays a key role for sustaining ecological e g keller et al 2005 jonas et al 2008 freppaz et al 2018 and socioeconomic e g rixen et al 2011 beniston 2012 systems in mountains thus observing snow related variables and their temporal variations is pivotal for understanding the related processes and providing more reliable assessments of future changes beniston et al 2018 among the different observed snow related variables snow water equivalent swe plays a crucial role swe is the mathematical product of snow depth hs and the snowpack bulk density ρb representing the equivalent amount of liquid water stored in the snowpack fierz et al 2009 swe is critical for flood and drought prediction e g jörg hess et al 2015 vionnet et al 2020 hydropower management e g larue et al 2017 magnusson et al 2020 ecological monitoring e g pauli et al 2005 huss et al 2017 avalanche forecasting e g barfod et al 2013 hatchett et al 2017 and mountain aquifer recharge lucianetti et al 2017 despite the critical importance of swe fewer direct measurements are available for this variable than for hs e g sturm et al 2010 schöber et al 2016 since manual and automatic measurements of ρb require complex and costly procedures egli et al 2009 kinar and pomeroy 2015 therefore consecutive decades long series of measured swe are uncommon and geographically scattered jonas et al 2009 avanzi et al 2015 indirect swe measurements such as through remote sensing techniques can also be performed at various scales although issues exist related to their spatial resolution accuracy and sensitivity dozier et al 2016 schattan et al 2017 steiner et al 2018 smyth et al 2019 finally yet of primary importance for long term studies the available direct and indirect swe measurements series generally cover few decades which is short compared to several decades long hs data kinar and pomeroy 2015 beniston et al 2018 because of the reduced number of long term datasets there are only a few swe trend studies and most of them are focused on north america e g mote et al 2018 thakur et al 2020 elias et al 2021 in the european alps for the period 1981 2010 large scale gridded swe datasets showed weak nonsignificant decreases in contrast to the mostly negative swe trends found in the northern hemisphere mudryk et al 2015 few studies analysed decades long swe trends in switzerland finding no trends in the swiss alps for the period 1975 1992 rohrer et al 1994 and differently pointing out a general reduction of swe in the last six decades marty et al 2017 only one study was performed in the central italian alps bocchiola and diolaiuti 2010 finding that spring swe decreased between 1965 and 2007 differently from swe several studies investigated multiple decades long hs trends in the european alps including italy matiu et al 2021 and references therein reported hs data can be used to model swe two main model types exist for this purpose i empirical regression models erms and ii semiempirical models sms egli et al 2009 winkler et al 2021 erms derive swe from hs and a combination of date elevation and regional parameters e g jonas et al 2009 pistocchi 2016 guyennon et al 2019 although capable to adequately model single swe features e g mean peak and seasonal swe erms are not suitable for calculating daily swe from hs time series jonas et al 2009 winkler et al 2021 conversely sms are suitable for deriving swe at daily resolution from continuous hs series simulating individual snowpack layers and taking advantage of the use of simple densification concepts winkler et al 2021 however compared to more complicated physically based models pbms they can only model ρb and swe while pbms can also simulate snowpack features like energy fluxes mass changes due to wind drift grain types etc unfortunately pbms require as input at least local temperature and precipitation information de michele et al 2013 or climatological means hill et al 2019 highly limiting their application in mountainous areas egli et al 2009 thus in order to study long term swe changes using increasingly available decades long hs data series the use of sms represents the most effective approach long term standardised swe indices can be a useful tool for the analysis of long term swe changes and especially for investigating snow droughts swe deficits the use of normalised indices moving from absolute values to the frequency domain in terms of past estimated probability of occurrence i e wmo 2012 allows for a direct comparison of swe time series collected at different locations and possibly affected by local and regional factors in this framework snow droughts remain relatively unexplored compared to other drought types huning and aghakouchak 2020 and only few studies have taken into consideration snow information for drought characterisation e g staudinger et al 2014 hatchett and mcevoy 2018 zhang et al 2019 especially on the seasonal basis huning and aghakouchak 2020 this is particularly true for the italian alps and european alps in general where the temporal evolution of swe deficits remains virtually unknown due to the lack of specific studies further uncertainties exist on the relationships between snow variables and large scale atmospheric forcings indeed contrasting results have been reported regarding the behaviour of teleconnection indices and snow precipitation dynamics in the alps for instance in the european alps the north atlantic oscillation nao hurrell 1995 was found to i provide significant control upon snow variables and precipitation beniston 1997 beniston and jungo 2002 lópez moreno et al 2011 ii be only weakly and intermittently correlated to precipitation schmidli et al 2002 bartolini et al 2009 iii play a minor role on snow cover and precipitation dynamics durand et al 2009 bartolini et al 2010 similar results were found for the atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo kaplan et al 1998 zampieri et al 2013 nicolet et al 2016 2018 brugnara and maugeri 2019 and the artic oscillation ao li and wang 2003 bartolini et al 2009 2010 terzago et al 2013 based on the previous considerations in this study we aimed at unravelling the long term variability in the water resources stored in the snowpack across the italian alps to do this we i retrieved daily hs measurements from 19 long term weather stations distributed in the italian alps across an elevation range 750 2600 m a s l ii modelled daily swe using the most recent and advanced sm available δsnow model winkler et al 2021 iii calculated the monthly standardised snow water equivalent index sswei iv investigated the elevational trends of sswei v explored how sswei records are linked to climatic variables large scale air temperature and precipitation from reanalysis and selected teleconnection indices nao winter nao amo and ao in order to better understand the influence of climate change and large scale atmospheric forcings on the regional sswei dynamics 2 data and methods 2 1 study region the alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system in europe stretching with their arc shaped structure about 1 200 km across eight countries major rivers in europe such as the rhine rhone danube and po are fed by a network of tributaries originating in the alps whose significance for the regional water cycle is also expressed in the notion water tower of europe the italian alps roughly correspond to the southern european alps defined as the mountainous area south of the main alpine watershed brugnara and maugeri 2019 in this region the main climatic characteristic is the large influence of the mediterranean sea which generally implies higher temperatures than in the northern slope and higher orographically driven precipitation due to the greater water content of the air isotta et al 2014 brugnara and maugeri 2019 the alpine ecoregion in italy is a well defined combination of structural climatic and biogeographic features blasi et al 2014 in our study the geographical boundaries are those defined by the ismsa soiusa classification international standardized mountain subdivision of the alps suddivisione orografica internazionale unificata del sistema alpino marazzi 2005 fig 1 2 2 data series the analysed dataset consists of continuous daily measurements of snow depth hs retrieved from 19 manual and automatic stations located above 750 m a s l the largest part of the data derived from manual measurements the stations are mainly located in flat open areas in the valley floors or near dams all the stations cover the period encompassed between 1960 and 2020 elevation range 750 2600 m a s l among these stations 15 cover also the previous 30 year period 1930 1959 elevation range 864 2200 m a s l table 1 in this way the analysed stations are well distributed over different elevations and climatic regions in the italian south western alps north western alps and south eastern alps following soiusa fig 1 the data used in the present study were compiled by regional and provincial aineva avalanche services interregional association for coordination and documentation of snow and avalanche problems together with regional environmental protection agencies arpa piemonte arpa veneto regione autonoma valle d aosta meteotrentino italian meteorological society smi hydropower companies cva s p a enel s p a and ministry of public work hydrological annals data quality was firstly assessed by aineva which replaced below zero hs values and outliers with missing values in addition we further carefully checked the series in order to remove possible recording errors by applying a temporal consistency check to the hs station records we screened the series for jumps 40 cm up 30 cm up preceded by a zero and 20 cm down on two consecutive days we checked manually all the resulting values and replaced the recording errors with missing values several hundred events were visually checked and only few dozens were actually recording errors globally missing values affected approximately only 1 of the entire dataset with a maximum value of 3 2 for single series table 1 we filled the data gaps shorter than 3 days by linear regression while longer data gaps were left unchanged since the annual cycle of the snow water equivalent swe is shaped by snow accumulation and melting we decided to entirely exclude from the analyses the snow seasons presenting data gaps at the beginning i e november december january differently in case of data gaps not affecting the beginning of the snow season we excluded periods only after the missing values until the end of the snow season this step was necessary to prevent erroneous swe simulations by not taking into account data gaps during the crucial period of the build up of the seasonal snowpack more details in 2 3 swe modelling while avoiding the exclusion of entire snow seasons affected by some data gaps after the season beginning i e melting period further details about the management of data gaps in the analyses are reported in section 2 6 trend analysis regarding the homogeneity of the data a large effort was devoted by aineva to assess and eliminate inhomogeneities within the time series resulting from several non climatic factors that changed during the historical investigated period e g station relocations for instance in this work we chose only stations that were not known to be affected by relevant station relocations or other affecting factors beyond this applying appropriate homogeneity tests on long term hs data is not straightforward and still subjected to large research efforts e g marcolini et al 2017a marcolini et al 2019 differently from temperature and precipitation records auer et al 2007 for this reason we performed the assessment of potential inhomogeneities only manually thanks to the aineva effort for four stations cortina arabba tonale and cavia located at 1250 1630 1880 and 2100 m a s l respectively we retrieved measured swe values which we used to validate the δsnow model details in 2 3 swe modelling only two of them cortina and arabba are part of our long term hs dataset while the other two tonale and cavia are used only for validation purposes fig 1 table 1 these four stations were the only places across all our study area where biweekly or monthly swe measurements were performed jointly with daily hs measurements swe was measured by hydropower companies and aineva between 1983 and 2020 using layer and drill methods for the swe layer calculation the snow density ρb was measured for each individuated homogeneous layer by weighting a known volume of snow sampled horizontally valt et al 2012 described the statistical procedure adopted for the calculation of the ρb and the integration of the layers having a thickness lower than the coring tube diameter for the swe drill calculation a single vertical snow core was used berni and giancanelli 1966 valt 2019 verified that the differences between the two methods were within 5 2 3 swe modelling to model swe we used δsnow a new semiempirical multilayer model for simulating swe and ρb from a regular time series of hs winkler et al 2021 the model considers the change of hs as a proxy for the various processes altering ρb and swe δsnow i bases its dry snow densification function on newtonian viscosity ii provides a way to deal with small discrepancies between model and observation hs measurement errors iii takes into account unsteady compaction of underlying older snow layers due to overburden snow loads iv densifies snow layers from top to bottom during melting phases without automatically modelling mass loss due to runoff more details in winkler et al 2021 the model does not take into account snow drift compaction and mass changes due to rain on snow runoff during snowfalls wind drift little snowfalls sublimation and deposition δsnow can be used for estimating swe in high elevated areas with deep long lasting snowpacks as well as in valleys with shallow ephemeral snowpacks in the δsnow model seven parameters can be calibrated new snow density ρ 0 maximum possible snow density ρ max two viscosity parameters η 0 and k threshold deviation τ and two overburden parameters c ov and k ov to calibrate the model winkler et al 2021 used snow observations of 67 winters from 14 stations well distributed over different elevations and climatic regions of the european alps in addition the authors used data from 71 independent winters from 15 stations for validation in this work we used the calibration proposed by winkler et al 2021 tab s1 indeed the parameter setting suggested by the authors revealed to be optimal to model swe from daily hs time series recorded at stations located in alpine areas and with snow not older than an estimated 200 days regarding the latter the mean duration of snow season snow day hs 1 cm was 200 days at five stations all located above 2000 m a s l among these stations we used only one toggia 2200 m a s l table 1 for the long term trend analysis in the period 1930 2020 details in 2 4 sswei and spatial elevational patterns however cavia station which was used to validate the model details below is located at 2100 m a s l and had a mean snow season duration of ca 205 days therefore we also assessed the model s performance taking into account very long lasting snowpacks we obtained 650 pairs of hs and swe measurements from the stations used for δsnow validation winkler et al 2021 calibrated δsnow using only those sites and years where and when the respective values of the daily hs record matched the values of swe measurements in our study we used a threshold of 0 2 m as maximum hs discrepancy between daily value at the stations and measured hs at the swe measurement sites this step was necessary since the measurement of swe is a disruptive procedure thus swe and hs measurements could not always be taken exactly at the same place which introduced uncertainty cf lópez moreno et al 2020 the selected threshold allowed us to benefit of 501 observations for the validation we assessed the performance of the swe estimations through the analysis of the pearson correlation r mean error me mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse me mae and rmse are defined as follows 1 m e 1 n i 1 n s w e o b s s w e m o d 2 m a e 1 n i 1 n s w e o b s s w e m o d 3 r m s e i 1 n s w e o b s s w e m o d 2 n where sweobs and swemod are the observed and modelled swe respectively me mae and rmse are expressed in the same units of swe mm 2 4 sswei and spatial elevational patterns for the calculation of standardised indices at the monthly scale a theoretical distribution and a reference baseline have to be chosen we selected the 1961 1990 period as a reference baseline then we tested the fit of two different distribution functions lognormal and gamma e g jonas et al 2009 margulis et al 2016 to the monthly mean simulated swe data using the negative log likelihood criteria we found the best fit for our data with the gamma distribution therefore we fitted a gamma distribution for each month of the snow season at each station we defined the beginning and end of the snow season for each station as the first and last month having a minimum of 50 of monthly mean swe 0 over the chosen baseline then we calculated the standardised swe index sswei according to huning and aghakouchak 2020 to identify which correlations could be expected depending on horizontal and vertical distances between stations we performed a spatial analysis on sswei to do so we carried out pairwise correlations pearson between monthly sswei series from november to may only in this case the analysis was performed for the 1960 2020 period in order to have more pairs of stations all 19 stations for all the following analyses e g trends periodicity etc we used only the 15 stations with data in the period 1930 2020 for all analyses we selected the stations with at least 90 of the available months 2 5 climatic drivers and teleconnection indices to study the influence of air temperature and precipitation on sswei variability we used era5 land a reanalysis product derived by running the land component of era5 at increased resolution 9 km compared to 31 km and at hourly time scale dee et al 2011 muñoz sabater et al 2021 in our study we used the simulations from 1950 to 2020 selecting all the grid points falling into the region of investigation only the sectors where the stations were located delimited by the souisa classification fig 1 we produced monthly averages of mean daily temperature and cumulated total precipitation given the reduced amount of grid points we did not consider spatial or elevation differences thus obtaining a single output for each month in the region of investigation then we calculated the 2 m air temperature deviation from its long term mean 1961 90 for each month obtaining a region wide monthly air temperature anomaly at finally we calculated a monthly standard precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 considering a gamma distribution calibrated on each month over the 1961 1990 baseline cf romano et al 2021 we explored the possible relationships between sswei as well as at and spi and teleconnection patterns considering the following selected indices north atlantic oscillation nao and winter nao wnao hurrell 1995 atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo kaplan et al 1998 and artic oscillation ao li and wang 2003 2 6 trend analysis we performed the trend analysis on sswei in the period 1930 2020 using the non parametric mann kendall mk test kendall 1975 which is widely adopted to assess significant trends in hydro meteorological time series e g valt and cianfarra 2010 guyennon et al 2013 salerno et al 2015 in this study we applied the sequential mk test seqmk gerstengarbe and werner 1999 to monthly vectors to monitor the overall non stationarity of the time series we analysed the progressive normalised kendall s tau coefficient µ τ we treated the few missing values in the series with a stationary assumption thus preserving unchanged the values preceding the missing values finally we performed the trend analysis also on monthly at and spi in the period 1950 2020 2 7 analysis of periodicity we explored the possible periodic components of the monthly sswei by means of a time frequency wavelet analysis adopting the morlet transform unlike the classical fourier transform the wavelet transform allows a localisation of the signals in both frequency and time rather than in a simple frequency space the mathematical bases of this technique are given by grossmann and morlet 1984 and a complete description is given by torrence and compo 1998 moreover we investigated the non stationarity of the relationships between sswei and teleconnection indices using the wavelet coherence wtc the wtc is defined as the square of the cross spectrum normalised by the individual power spectra the wtc also allows finding high levels of significance even when the common power of the two series is low and thus it gives an accurate representation of the normalised covariance between the two time series torrence and webster 1999 guyennon et al 2014 3 results 3 1 model validation modelled swe had an overall r of 0 96 me of 6 3 mm mae of 39 9 mm and rmse of 56 2 mm indicating a rather good performance in the representation of the swe in our validation sites although in our case δsnow performed moderately worse than in winkler et al 2021 mae 21 9 mm rmse 30 8 mm we stress out the fact that we did not perform an ad hoc calibration for our sites considering the reduced number of hs swe pairs available in our study region in addition the elevation of our validation sites ranged from 1250 to 2100 m a s l while in winkler et al 2021 the elevation range of the calibration validation sites was between 590 and 1780 m a s l thus we expected a rather worse performance of the model considering the higher elevations and the longer snow seasons taken into consideration in our study indeed we obtained the best modelling performance at the lowermost station cortina 1250 m a s l mae 30 6 rmse 37 8 mm and the worst performance at the highermost one cavia 2100 m a s l mae 57 4 rmse 77 5 mm fig 2 finally winkler et al 2021 calibrated δsnow using only those sites and years where and when the respective values of the daily hs record matched the values of the biweekly measurements differently in our study we selected a threshold for maximum hs discrepancy between daily value at the stations and measured hs at the swe measurement sites of 0 2 m even though we used this threshold our overall modelling performance was in line with the performances of other modelling studies performed in alpine areas such as egli et al 2009 rmse 56 mm snowpack model jonas et al 2009 rmse 50 9 53 2 mm essery et al 2013 rmse 23 77 mm various thermodynamic snow models sturm et al 2010 mae 51 mm

and snow cover duration showed increasing values according to elevation fig 3 a table 1 as expected in particular we found three main elevation clusters low elevation 5 stations 750 1250 m a s l mean swe 61 mm mean max swe 80 mm snow cover duration january march medium elevation 8 stations 1251 1850 m a s l mean swe 141 mm mean max swe 215 mm snow cover duration december april high elevation 6 stations 1850 m a s l mean swe 290 mm mean max swe 476 mm snow cover duration november may in addition the sswei correlation analysis showed that correlation coefficients decreased with both horizontal and vertical distance although they remained high even for large distances fig 3b we found correlation coefficients equal to or higher than 0 7 for vertical distances of up to 600 m with less than 200 km horizontal distance considering these findings we averaged the individual station based sswei values and performed the trend analysis on the 15 long term stations 1930 2020 according to the three selected elevation bands 3 3 temporal variability and trends of sswei the temporal variability of sswei spi and at as a function of the three elevation bands is shown in fig 4 whereas the results of the seqmk test applied to these variables are shown in fig 5 in general we found the lowermost monthly sswei values to occur in the period 1991 2020 other interesting features of the sswei curves were the minima in the 1940s 1950s march may and the maxima in the 1960s november january and in the 1970s 1980s february may irrespective of the elevation all these minima and maxima were particularly evident in march low elevation march april medium elevation and march may high elevation for these months the maximum sswei value was reached in the time lapse 1971 1990 which was then followed by a minimum around the early 1990s after this minimum a partial recovery or stabilisation was experienced at all elevation bands although in general sswei remained negative until the end of the analysed time frame the low sswei values of the last 30 years caused the results of the seqmk test to exhibit the lowermost µ τ values in the 1991 2020 period for all months across all the elevation bands we found however a few exceptions such as march low elevation april medium elevation and may high elevation which showed comparably negative values in the 1940s 1950s evident were also the high µ τ values for sswei in almost all investigated months in the 1970s 1980s across the three elevation bands however due to the high year to year variability of the sswei records the corresponding µ τ records reached a 95 significance level only in a limited number of cases the temporal behaviour of spi showed a rather good agreement with the sswei s one across all elevation bands indicating a general interconnection between precipitation and swe dynamics however main divergence patterns between sswei and spi emerged for specific months across different time frames i in the 1960s january across all elevation bands showed positive sswei and negative spi and at ii in the 1970s 1980s april at medium and high elevation was characterised by positive sswei and negative spi and at iii in the period 1991 2020 march april medium elevation and november april may high elevation exhibited decidedly negative sswei from slightly negative to slightly positive spi and markedly positive at iv in the 2010s january and february at all elevations and march low elevation evidenced negative sswei from around zero to slightly positive spi and strongly positive at the divergences between sswei and spi also emerged from the analysis of the µ τ records specifically i in the 1960s january and february across all elevation bands evidenced µ τ values generally above zero for sswei and negative for spi and at ii in the 1970s 1980s april medium and high elevation exhibited µ τ values decidedly above zero for sswei and negative for spi and at iii in the period 1991 2020 november high elevation december medium and high elevation january low medium and high elevation and march medium and high elevation showed µ τ values decidedly below zero for sswei around zero or slightly negative for spi and markedly positive for at a clear divergence also emerged for may high elevation with a well negative µ τ for sswei and positive values for at µ τ and spi µ τ therefore the agreement between sswei and spi was lower mostly in the periods with strongest temperature anomaly and this was especially evident in the most recent period due to the very strong positive temperature trend in the last decades figure s1 shows the wavelet transformation of the average monthly sswei time series of the three elevation ranges this analysis did not give evidence of continuous periodic behaviour in any interval of the investigated period with most of the power spectral density contained in sporadic episodes of pluri annual variability 3 4 sswei relationships with teleconnection patterns the pearson correlation coefficients computed between the monthly teleconnection indices nao wnao ao and amo and sswei over the entire period 1930 2020 are shown in figure s2 correlations in figure s2 are performed on 7 year moving averaged data to highlight pluriannual response of sswei to climatic and teleconnection forcings nao wnao and ao showed significant negative correlations anticorrelation with sswei during the early snow season particularly in january considering all elevation bands differently amo significantly anticorrelated with sswei during the late snow season especially in march considering the three elevation bands these results highlight that higher lower nao wnao ao and amo values are linked to lower higher sswei values from the correlation analysis we selected the months with the highest correlation coefficients to be used in the wtc analysis we selected january for nao wnao and ao and march for the amo given the similar behaviour of nao and wnao and considering the higher correlation coefficients for wnao we applied the wtc only on wnao the results of the wtc analysis are reported in fig 6 the low and medium elevation bands had a similar behaviour for both wnao and ao looking at the pluri decadal variability the coherence with sswei was strong close to 1 until the 1980s then the signal became weaker and not significant except for ao at the medium elevations this break was followed by a coherence increase after 2000 displaying also a shift towards a decadal variability ao also showed some significant signals below the decadal time scale which vanished around the 1980s at the medium elevations looking at the pluri decadal variability the coherence between amo and sswei was strong until the end of the 1980s then it vanished we found no persistent significant signal for amo at low elevation differently from the low and medium elevation bands at the high elevations all teleconnection indices showed persistently strong coherence at the pluri decadal time scale however during the 1980s ao showed a shift from a pluri decadal to decadal variability and the vanishing of some significant pluri annual signals the pearson correlation coefficients computed between the monthly teleconnection indices and at and spi are shown in figure s2 for this analysis we discriminated between two sub periods 1950 1990 and 1991 2020 due to the step like change that occurred in at at the end of the 1980s beginning of the 1990s fig 4 in january nao wnao and ao were significantly and positively correlated with at in the period 1950 1990 while the correlation weakened in the sub period 1991 2020 the correlation vanished for ao differently we did not find significant correlations between nao wnao and ao and spi for january except for a significant negative correlation for ao in the period 1991 2020 in march at did not significantly correlate with amo both in 1950 1990 and 1991 2020 while spi showed a significant negative correlation in the period 1950 1990 4 discussion 4 1 variability of sswei our results show a marked variability in monthly sswei through the analysed period 1930 2020 previous studies on swe variability and trend in the european alps reported i a general reduction in february weaker and april stronger swe across the alpine chain in the period 1968 2012 marty et al 2017 as well as a spring swe decrease occurring between 1965 and 2007 in the italian alps bocchiola and diolaiuti 2010 ii weak nonsignificant swe decreases in the period 1981 2010 across the entire alpine chain mudryk et al 2015 iii no swe trends in the swiss alps for the period 1975 1992 rohrer et al 1994 the apparent disagreement among the previously presented research results including our findings are likely caused by the different periods and datasets considered by the authors for instance marty et al 2017 investigated a long term 1945 2012 alpine wide swe time series by calculating the relative february and april swe deviation from its long term mean 1961 90 for different stations across the alps their findings show several agreements with ours such as i in february lowermost values in the early 1990s and partial recovery stabilisation in the following decades highermost values in the 1970s 1980s and some kind of stationarity with relatively low magnitude oscillations in the previous decades ii in april lowermost values in the early 1990s with a following partial stabilisation highermost values in the 1970s 1980s and low values in the 1940s 1950s the most striking changes occurred in the period 1991 2020 that generally experienced record low sswei values across all elevation bands although we also found few low monthly sswei values in the 1940s 1950s it is worth noting though that these changes did no occurred gradually but rather following a sharp drop culminating in the early 1990s especially in spring the abrupt change in swe values between the end of the 1980s and the early 1990s was also measured in the observational swe data collected by marty et al 2017 across the european alps this evidence is also in agreement with the findings that other studies have reported showing a step like change for alpine hs occurring in the late 1980s early 1990s marty 2008 durand et al 2009 valt and cianfarra 2010 matiu et al 2021 our results showed that this drop was then followed by a partial stabilisation or even recovery although sswei values remained mostly negative until the end of the investigated period this is also in agreement with previous studies on snow cover in the alps reporting that the monthly mean snow covered area across the alpine chain has not decreased significantly since the step change hüsler et al 2014 however in an alpine wide view this temporal variability is also accompanied by a strong regional variability when considering hs matiu et al 2021 snow drought has been firstly defined as near or above average accumulated precipitation coinciding with below average swe at a point in time pederson et al 2011 some studies have distinguished between dry i e precipitation limited and i e temperature driven despite above normal precipitation snow droughts harpold et al 2017 hatchett and mcevoy 2018 in our work we consider all types of snow droughts without differentiating them in our study region unprecedented and persistent snow drought conditions occurred in the period 1991 2020 fig 7 particularly low swe values in the last two to three decades have been reported not only for the alps marty et al 2017 but also for other low to high mountainous areas of the world such as europe dong and menzel 2020 nedelcev and jenicek 2021 north america mote et al 2018 and asia kraaijenbrink et al 2021 finally in the last few decades several areas of the world emerged as hot spots for snow droughts including europe showing longer snow drought durations although high continental and regional variability exists huning and aghakouchak 2020 thus our evidence seems to be part of a world wide pattern rather than of a region specific one indicating recent persistent swe deficits 4 2 drivers of sswei variability sswei variability seemed to be generally interconnected to precipitation variability here analysed through the spi however this interconnection weakened in the period 1991 2020 especially at medium march april and high elevation november april may although also the low elevation band showed a divergent behaviour in the 2010s january march indeed negative sswei trends got decoupled from slightly negative to positive spi trends under the effect of strongly positive at trends the observed changes were likely caused by more frequent and more intense melt klein et al 2016 and by a shift from solid to liquid precipitation serquet et al 2011 nikolova et al 2013 both resulting from higher air temperatures during winter and spring beniston et al 2018 in addition during the early 1990s we found concomitant strong air temperature increases and slight to moderate precipitation decreases resulting in unprecedented negative sswei trends this regime shift mostly involving air temperature has been documented both at the alpine marty 2008 and global reid et al 2016 scales in addition our results clearly showed the importance of at variations in decoupling sswei from spi in other periods such as in the 1960s january all elevation bands and 1970s 1980s april medium and high elevation when positive sswei was associated to negative spi and at regarding the correlation between sswei and the investigated teleconnection indices we found high and significant negative coefficients across the entire period 1930 2020 considering the three elevation bands we found the strongest anticorrelations for nao wnao and ao to occur in january during the early snow season i e accumulation phase while for amo the strongest anticorrelation occurred in march late snow season i e melting phase these results are in agreement with a large body of literature indeed in the southern european alps in italy a common pattern seemed to emerge with snow and winter precipitation dynamics being negatively correlated with nao wnao maragno et al 2009 bocchiola and diolaiuti 2010 diolaiuti et al 2012 terzago et al 2013 brugnara and maugeri 2019 amo zampieri et al 2013 brugnara and maugeri 2019 and ao terzago et al 2013 similar results were found for nao and winter mass balance of glaciers carturan et al 2015 in addition other studies in the european alps have found nao to be negatively positively correlated with winter precipitation quadrelli et al 2001 lópez moreno et al 2011 temperature beniston 1997 beniston and jungo 2002 snow cover henderson and leathers 2010 and mass balance of glaciers reichert et al 2001 amo has also been reported to be anticorrelated with glacier mass balance huss et al 2010 however the wtc analysis showed changes breaks in coherence and shifts in time scale variability occurring mostly throughout the 1980s sometimes with the total vanishing of the coherence afterwards especially at low and medium elevations in the same period at skyrocketed spi remained more stable reaching the highest values and showing the most significant trends this occurrence further highlights the sensitivity of low and medium elevations towards climate changes marcolini et al 2017b where it is likely that the atmospheric warming occurring in the last decades has played an increasingly important role in driving swe marty et al 2017 and snow dynamics hock et al 2019 4 3 hydrological implications and research perspectives the decrease of water storage in the snowpack can potentially have dire implications for water supply in those communities that directly rely on snow melting ipcc 2019 with relevant regional and global ramifications also in downstream snow free areas huning and aghakouchak 2020 the magnitude of these implications will likely increase in the future for instance for the european alps at an elevation of 1500 m a s l it has been simulated a reduction in swe of up to 80 90 by the end of the century while the decrease has been projected to be more reduced 10 for elevations above 3000 m a s l rousselot et al 2012 steger et al 2013 schmucki et al 2015 thus human activities are being and will be even more influenced by the ongoing and anticipated changes with relevant impacts on water management laghari et al 2012 köplin et al 2014 regarding for instance water supply hydropower production and irrigation requirements barnett et al 2005 gaudard and romerio 2014 gaudard et al 2014 hill clarvis et al 2014 qin et al 2020 the 2021 2022 drought event that impacted and that is still impacting at the beginning of september 2022 the po river basin is a clear example of the implications of our findings preliminary data collected by the autorità di bacino distrettuale del fiume po district basin authority of the po river showed that winter 2021 2022 was characterised by a significant precipitation deficit spi3 constantly below 1 5 over several areas of the western and central italian alps the lack of solid precipitation during winter along with a persistent precipitation deficit during spring and summer spi3 1 5 and air temperatures above the seasonal means resulted in an unprecedented hydrological drought the po river discharge at the pontelagoscuro monitoring station was 60 with respect of the long term monthly average in march and 85 in july due to the very low discharge of several rivers not sustained by the spring snow melt the agricultural sector was particularly affected the drought event that impacted the po river basin in 2022 clearly shows that a better understanding of the snowpack dynamics can strongly support the management of the entire po basin both over short periods and over medium to long periods it is also worth noting the importance of estimating the historical swe time series in terms of standardised indices significant changes of the sswei point out significant changes in the average hydrological conditions indicating the range of a new normality that must be taken into account for implementing sound and effective mitigation measures and strategy plans in this framework the study of the emerging phenomenon known as snow drought will be more and more relevant cooper et al 2016 mote et al 2016 huning and aghakouchak 2020 hatchett et al 2022 even more important will be the understanding of the hydrometeorological processes that could cause snow droughts in order to evaluate their impacts on consumptive uses that rely on snowmelt derived runoff or ecological processes that depend on the presence of a snowpack hatchett and mcevoy 2018 in that perspective decision support could benefit from further investigations on the current response to teleconnection indices based on wider station networks 5 conclusions we assessed the long term 1930 2020 variability of monthly sswei across the italian alps and its links with climate change and large scale atmospheric forcings using modelled swe derived from daily hs data we found record low monthly sswei values to occur mainly in the last few decades 1991 2020 irrespective of elevation although some other negative sswei oscillations occurred during the investigated period lowermost values were experienced in the early 1990s and despite a partial recovery or stabilisation in the following years decades sswei remained generally negative until 2020 especially at the snow season tails we investigated the role of large scale atmospheric forcings teleconnection indices in driving these patterns finding that nao wnao amo and ao were anticorrelated with sswei during different phases of the snow season however strong changes breaks occurred in the relations between teleconnection indices and sswei after the 1980s especially at low and medium elevations we also looked at the relationships between climate drivers precipitation spi and air temperature at and sswei finding that sswei variability seemed to be generally interconnected to precipitation variability however this interconnection was lost mostly in the period 1991 2020 when highly positive at occurred therefore increasing air temperature has likely become predominant over the influence of large scale atmospheric forcings and precipitation variability in the recent decades we conclude that snow drought variability is an important indicator of climate change and that the unprecedented and persistent snow drought conditions

2836,understanding the long term fate and transport of radiocesium 137cs through porous and fractured aquifers is critical for the risk assessment of nuclear accidents in particular characterizing 137cs transport below a dam storing potable water is critical for assessing the risk of 137cs migration in this study a 2d cross sectional aquifer model was developed based on paldang reservoir in south korea and transport of desorbed 137cs beneath a dam was investigated systematically various scenarios investigated 137cs transport within the reported ranges of distribution coefficient kd and local temperature conditions basal heat flow and reservoir bottom temperature affecting the 137cs desorption rate and hydrogeologic heterogeneity hydraulic conductivity and fracture networks the characteristics of the 137cs plume represented by the average plume concentration and the migration rate of the mass center were assessed and the health risk of chronic exposure for humans was predicted in base case k 8 64 10 2 m day and kd 10 ml g approximately 0 06 of initially released 137cs was transported downstream over 300 years the maximum migration rate was 5 1 10 4 m day and a maximum annual radioactive dose was 4 5 msv y after 230 years the notable effect of kd on the migration rate 5 1 10 5 9 9 10 4 m day and annual dose 9 1 10 11 130 msv y indicates that the kd is a critical parameter that controls the transport of 137cs in the subsurface aquifer the effect of temperature on 137cs transport was relatively insignificant but it still had a noticeable effect especially on the desorption rate in addition 50 realizations of heterogeneous k and kd were generated to evaluate the influence of physical and chemical heterogeneity on 137cs transport the migration rate and annual dose of 137cs plume showed large variability when k and kd were correlated finally 137cs transport was evaluated in fractured aquifers and assessed the importance of fracture orientation and connectivity keywords radiocesium 137cs transport dam heterogeneity fractured aquifer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the industrial use of nuclear energy has grown considerably over the past decades while safety concerns related to radioactive contamination have been raised menyah and wolde rufael 2010 toth and rogner 2006 wittneben 2012 many previous studies have investigated various scenarios related to the fate and transport of radionuclides in the environment to develop proper remediation technologies and conduct risk assessments of released radionuclides bugai et al 2012 caron et al 2007 monte et al 2005 ohtsuka et al 1988 rockhold et al 2012 among the various radionuclides that can be released from nuclear reactors cesium 137 137cs is particular concern because it can severely contaminate surrounding water resources due to its high solubility and long half life 30 17 years buesseler et al 2011 due to the increase in public concern after the fukushima disaster in japan risk assessment protocols to allow the systematic cleanup of 137cs contamination have been actively proposed in korea kim et al 2016 moon 2020 park 2012 park et al 2020 one of the promising cleanup processes includes immediate 137cs remediation from surface water resources by spraying effective and abundant natural adsorbents e g illite hwang et al 2021 kitajima et al 2012 tsuruoka et al 2013 fig 1 a the natural adsorbents settle down while adsorbing 137cs dissolved in water and then sink to the bottom of the surface water resources without proper removal of settled 137cs sorbed adsorbents 137cs may desorb and subsequently remobilize in the subsurface environment causing secondary contamination to adjacent groundwater and surface water systems previous studies have demonstrated that such desorption processes could cause the remobilization of 137cs from natural sediments to surrounding environments e g surface water and groundwater systems smith and comans 1996 standring et al 2002 takata et al 2015 especially dams and reservoirs can trap large amounts of contaminated sediments for a long period of time yamada et al 2015 zheleznyak et al 2015 pinder et al 2005 reported that aged 137cs in sediments from contaminated reservoirs in south carolina usa were remobilized after the addition of competing cations however the fate and transport of desorbed 137cs in groundwater systems have not yet been comprehensively addressed in particular the risk for human health associated with the fate and transport of desorbed 137cs below a dam was not understood which is critical for a risk assessment to assess the fate of remobilized 137cs through the subsurface aquifer adsorption processes and the radioactive decay for 137cs must be considered ashraf et al 2014 medved and cerny 2019 palágyi and štamberg 2011 the retardation caused by adsorption was generally investigated by implementing the distribution coefficient kd of 137cs which is experimentally shown to be very sensitive to aquifer materials and groundwater chemistry elejalde et al 2000 konishi et al 1988 mollah and ullah 1998 soederlund et al 2014 steefel et al 2003 in addition hydrogeologic features such as local heat flow geologic heterogeneity and fracture networks governing dissolved solute behavior have also been the subject of many previous studies in recent decades schwartz 2012 silveira et al 2013 viswanathan et al 2003 wang et al 2010a yang et al 2008 these studies focusing on the migration of radionuclides through the aquifer were conducted to assess the safety of current or future nuclear facilities for example testoni et al 2015 investigated the transport of radionuclides including 90sr and 137cs in shallow groundwater of the italian nuclear site in saluuggia and reported the increasing effect of adsorption with the depth and the distance similarly cao et al 2017 developed a regional radionuclide transport model at a potential repository site in northwestern china and conducted the sensitivity analyses of 137cs transport with varying permeability distribution coefficient and diffusion coefficient in consideration of hydrogeologic conditions including the faults and fractures despite the increasing concern about 137cs contamination previous studies have not focused on the long term contamination of 137cs in groundwater systems because of its high sorption capability in soil and unsaturated environments given that the fate and transport of desorbed 137cs below a dam can potentially be critical for the 137cs remobilization this study aims to evaluate the long term fate and transport of 137cs through an aquifer below a dam the potential secondary contamination of 137cs in the aquifer was studied with various scenarios kd values non isothermal effects influencing the 137cs desorption and heterogeneous and fractured aquifers after assuming the desorption of 137cs from settled natural adsorbents by doing so the characteristics of the 137cs plume were comprehensively assessed and subsequently the amount of 137cs discharged downstream of the reservoir was quantified to evaluate the human health risk due to chronic exposure 2 model description fig 1a illustrates the study scenario showing the situation where the potable surface water reservoir is contaminated from the fall out of 137cs the 137cs contaminated reservoir can be remediated by spraying natural adsorbents using either airplanes or drones here 137cs and adsorbents are represented by purple and green circles respectively the sprayed adsorbents initially float and adsorb dissolved 137cs and eventually sink to the bottom of the reservoir due to gravity without proper treatment e g dredging the 137cs contaminated adsorbents would stay at the reservoir bottom for a long period while desorbing 137cs then the desorbed 137cs would cause the secondary contamination to adjacent sedimentary or fractured aquifers and may subsequently be released to downstream surface water therefore it is essential to understand the fate and transport of desorbed 137cs in subsurface aquifers below a dam 2 1 groundwater flow to simulate the process of 137cs transport via groundwater seepage beneath artificial or natural reservoirs a 2d cross sectional aquifer model was developed fig 1b the model setup is based on the paldang reservoir which is the main water resource of the seoul metropolitan city in the republic of korea fig 1a the model dimension are x 100 m and z 25 m with a size of grid block to be δx δz 1 m fig 1b the geologic formations adjacent to the paldang reservoir are precambrian metamorphic rocks primarily consisting of biotite gneiss and mica schist the hydraulic conductivity k was uniformly assigned to 8 64 10 2 m day for the base case referring to zucchi et al 2017 who calculated the k of faulted mica schist to be between 4 32 10 1 and 4 32 10 5 m day through laboratory scale column tests the anisotropy ratio k v k h of the aquifer was assumed to be 0 1 and the porosity was set to 0 2 zucchi et al 2017 in addition considering that the cutoff wall is composed of a mixture of cement and bentonite its k and porosity were assigned as 8 64 10 5 m day and 0 1 respectively philip 2001 historical changes in surface water level at the paldang reservoir since 1980 were acquired from the korean water resources management information system https www wamis go kr since the soyanggang reservoir and chungju reservoir which are located upstream of paldang reservoir mainly control the water level the average level of the paldang reservoir has been maintained at approximately 21 84 m for the last 40 years with variations from 17 3 to 22 4 m in this study the reservoir depth to the upstream bed was assumed to be 22 m while the downstream depth of the dam was 2 m the corresponding constant pressure and temperature conditions were assigned to the upper left and right boundaries of the model fig 1b the artificial barrier or dam which maintains water storage at the upper stream is located at the center of the top boundary as a no flow condition the horizontal length of its foundation is set to be 24 m while the depth of the cutoff wall is 10 m a constant head condition was assigned to the lateral boundaries the head gradient between the left and right boundaries was set to 0 2 considering a large difference in the surface water level between the upper and downstream the bottom boundary was assigned to a no flow condition assuming the presence of a low permeable bedrock formation additionally all boundaries have constant temperature conditions but several scenarios are conducted with various reservoir temperature and base heat flow conditions which will be described in section 4 model scenarios 2 2 desorption and transport of dissolved 137cs the amount of 137cs desorbed from the deposited adsorbents is an important factor influencing the 137cs redistribution in the aquifer to estimate the amount of 137cs deposited on the reservoir bottom in the situation of severe contamination from a nuclear disaster the 137cs deposition data from the 2011 fukushima disaster were investigated https ramap jmc or jp map measured data on april 29 2011 indicated that the spatial area covering approximately 184 km2 was severely contaminated with a range from 3 0 106 to 1 47 107 bq m2 kato et al 2019 reconstructed a fall out map of accident derived 137cs based on a comparison of the 137cs deposition densities with the airborne monitoring surveys and reported that 32 tbq of 137cs was deposited in rivers and lakes considering the measured 137cs concentration the initial amount of deposited 137cs in the present study was set to 9 95 g at the reservoir assuming that 32 tbq of 137cs contaminated an area of 43 87 km2 which is equivalent to the size of the paldang reservoir watershed according to 137cs desorption measurements by wang et al 2010b and liu et al 2003b the time and amount of desorbing 137cs are largely influenced by the chemical properties e g ph temperature other competitive cations and the type of adsorbent of the surrounding environment for example approximately 70 of 133cs were desorbed from synthetic zeolites with 10 1 m hcl depending on the exchangeable cation concentration and degree of weathering on clay minerals miura et al 2018 murota et al 2016 also performed laboratory experiments on the kinetic 133cs desorption using fukushima soils and reported that up to 60 of 137cs could be desorbed over 140 days in 10 3 m kcl media in the present study 133cs desorption batch experiments were conducted for 1 year using naturally abundant illite in korea known to have high cs adsorption properties first the powdered illite was injected into a conical batch containing 130 and 13 000 μg l of 133cs solution and reacted in an orbital shaker at 130 rpm for 24 h to produce 133cs sorbed illite after the reaction the 133cs sorbed illite was separated from the solution by centrifugation at 3 500 rpm for 30 min and dried in an oven on 22gw jeio tech at 40 c for 3 days then 20 ml of distilled water was injected into the dried batches and they were reacted for 1 year to desorb the 133cs from illite after 1 year the concentration of desorbed 133cs was analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms x series thermo and found out that 12 27 at 130 μg l and 48 20 at 13 000 μg l of 133cs were desorbed from illite based on these experiments 1 49 g desorption rate 15 of 137cs was assumed to be desorbed from the deposited adsorbents at the reservoir bottom over 1 year purple grid blocks in fig 1b to simulate the transport of desorbed 137cs through the subsurface aquifer the decay constant λ and kd of 137cs should be determined for the radioactive decay and adsorption in this study the first order decay law was applied based on the half life 30 17 years of 137cs additionally because of the wide range of kd reported in numerous experimental studies elejalde et al 2000 konishi et al 1988 krupka et al 1999 lieser and steinkopff 1989 mollah and ullah 1998 soederlund et al 2014 steefel et al 2003 vilks and yang 2018 the reported kd values and their experimental conditions experiment type mica contents ph cation exchange capacity and dissolved cs concentrations were summarized comprehensively in table s1 their statistics are shown in table 1 where the reported kd values showed a large standard deviation for example kd ranges from 7 ml g measured from sandy carbonate soils at the u s department of energy s hanford site routson et al 1981 to 7 610 ml g measured in carbonate soils containing more than 50 clay collected from the hanford site serne and legore 1996 such a wide range of kd can greatly influence 137cs retardation leading to large variabilities in the migration rate and concentration of 137cs plumes ashraf et al 2014 in the base case simulation a kd of 10 ml g was selected considering high 137cs contaminated soils from hanford site which revealed a kd range from 2 1 to 22 ml g rockhold et al 2012 the diffusion coefficient of 137cs was set to 6 0 10 8 m2 s but the effect of diffusion on the transport of 137cs is expected to be low due to the relatively low diffusion coefficient atkinson and nickerson 1988 finally in this study the suite of tough2 eos7r software was employed to simulate the non isothermal reactive radioactive decay and retardation transport of desorbed 137cs through the subsurface aquifer oldenburg and pruess 1995 pruess 1991 3 governing equations in this study the suite of tough2 software which is based on the integral finite difference method was employed pruess 1991 the general conservation equations of tough2 consist of balances between mass accumulation and flux and source terms 1 d dt v n m κ d v γ n f κ n d γ v n q κ d v in the integration vn m3 and γn m2 indicate volume and surface area respectively and the index κ corresponds to the fluid components water and radionuclide and heat the mass accumulation term m in eq 1 is given by 2 m κ ϕ β 1 nph s β ρ β x β κ where ϕ is the porosity ρ kg m3 is the water density x is the mass fraction since the study assumed a fully saturated single phase model fully saturated aquifer phase β is water with the unity of saturation s in addition the flux term f in eq 1 consists of the advective and dispersive flux terms 3 f κ β 1 x β κ ρ β u β ρ β ϕ τ 0 τ β d x β κ the first term on the right hand side of eq 3 is the flux term which accounts for the advective mass flux arising from darcy flux the magnitude of the darcy velocity u m s is calculated from darcy s law 4 u k p ρ g μ here k is permeability m2 μ is viscosity pa s p is the pressure gradient pa m and g is the vector of gravitational acceleration m s2 the second term on the right hand side of eq 3 is the dispersive term where τ0τ is the tortuosity factor and d m2 s is the molecular diffusion coefficient for τ0τ the millington and quirk model was applied to calculate the tortuosity dependent on the saturation falta et al 1989 jury et al 1983 5 τ 0 τ ϕ 1 3 s 10 3 finally q kg m3 on the right side of eq 1 represents either a sink or a source to simulate the fate and transport of 137cs the equation of state for eos7r was adapted oldenburg and pruess 1995 the eos7r is capable of simulating diffusive and advective mass transport radioactive decay and adsorption of radionuclides the radioactive decay is given by 6 d dt m l l n 2 t 1 2 m l where m l kg m3 is the radionuclide mass per unit volume in subdomain l and t1 2 s is the half life the adsorption of radionuclides onto solid grains is calculated as reversible instantaneous linear sorption and the mass accumulation term in eq 2 including the effect of adsorption then becomes 8 m κ ϕ β 1 nph s β ρ β x β κ 1 ϕ ρ r ρ w x κ k d w κ where ρ r kg m3 is the density of the rock and kd ml g is the distribution coefficient for a radionuclide the heat flow is governed by conduction and convection including the sensible and latent heat effects the energy balance equation for heat

investigation of 137cs transport various scenarios were considered as summarized in table 2 the base case case 1b was a homogeneous case k 8 64 10 2 m day with a kd value of 10 ml g cases 1a 1f were designed to evaluate the effect of varying kd from 5 to 50 ml g representing the 137cs adsorption capacity of various geologic media cases 2a 2d represent the effects of reservoir temperature and geothermal gradient on 137cs transport at the paldang reservoir the reservoir bottom temperature was reported to vary from 26 c in august to 2 c in february fig s1 na and park 2005 and the terrestrial heat flow adjacent to paldang reservoir was 70 mw m2 fig s2 song et al 2006 such terrestrial heat flow and seasonal variability in reservoir bottom temperature could impact aquifer temperature resulting in changes in groundwater velocity smith and chapman 1983 in addition 137cs could be desorbed with different rates depending on the reservoir bottom and aquifer temperatures from a column experiment conducted by liu et al 2003a it was reported that the desorbed 137cs concentration decreased from 0 05 μmol l to approximately 0 03 μmol l with decreasing temperature from 35 to 15 in this regard the effect of seasonal reservoir temperature ranging from the lowest 2 c to the highest 26 c was evaluated case 2a to case 2d with corresponding 137cs desorption rate 5 20 in consideration of the decrease in 137cs desorption at low temperatures in cases 3a 3d the effect of subsurface heterogeneity e g hydraulic conductivity k was evaluated the k heterogeneities at a subsurface aquifer significantly affect contaminant transport bellin et al 1992 gelhar and axness 1983 michael and khan 2016 sudicky et al 2010 in addition to the physical k heterogeneity remarkable adsorption kd heterogeneity has been reported in various aquifer media boggs et al 1992 viswanathan et al 2003 and significant impacts of both k and kd heterogeneity on solute transport have been reported barber 1994 bosma et al 1993 qin et al 2013 for example for aquifer media with clay minerals a negative relationship exists between k and kd clay minerals have high kd while representing low k robin et al 1991 investigated spatial variabilities between k and kd of strontium at borden canada and found a weak but important negative correlation in this study spatially correlated k fields were generated through the sequential gaussian based function proposed by dietrich and newsam 1997 the spatial correlation between k and kd for 137cs was calculated from the spherical grain model eq 1 proposed by garabedian 1987 who assumed a negative correlation between the adsorption properties of the aquifer and grain sizes 10 d k d d l n k h k d 2 in case 4 the influence of fracture networks on 137cs transport was evaluated dams are typically constructed above granite based hard rocks which often have fracture networks xiang et al 2015 conducted hydrogeological modeling at xiaolangdi dam and noted that faults crossing the dam s foundation have a significant influence on seepage as seen subsurface fracture networks can serve as unexpected pathways for 137cs to investigate the effects of rock fractures on 137cs transport discrete fracture networks dfns were constructed based on borehole data collected from a field site approximately 7 km away from the paldang reservoir and the probability distributions of fracture aperture and fracture orientation were quantified from borehole data because the borehole data did not provide information on the fracture length the proportional relationship l b between the fracture aperture b and length l was assumed based on field observations that indicated a positive correlation baghbanan and jing 2007 de dreuzy et al 2001 hatton et al 1994 kang et al 2020 renshaw and park 1997 vermilye and scholz 1995 specifically the fracture lengths were assumed to be 103 times larger than their aperture size such that l 10 3 b the prefactor of 10 3 is chosen considering that the fracture length is often observed in meter scale while the aperture size is typically in submillimeter scale then the generated 10 dfns were upscaled to corresponding continuum based k fields using the technique proposed by oda 1985 the upscaling method is based on the crack tensor theory and calculates the volume averaged permeability tensors considering the geometrical aspects of fractures such as fracture size aperture and orientation the upscaling approach has been proved to be accurate when enough randomly oriented and interconnected fractures exist in each grid which is the case of this study agada et al 2017 barla et al 2000 lee et al 1995 nejadi et al 2015 the mean k 8 64 10 2 m day of individual realization in continuum based fn was equivalent to the k of previous cases with an anisotropic ratio kv kh of 0 1 and the kd was set to 10 ml g table 2 finally the health risk for humans due to desorbed 137cs was assessed in all the scenarios based on both the 137cs radioactivity and the effective dose coefficient of 137cs for humans here the effective dose coefficient was determined from the guidance on radiological exposure and dose coefficients of various radionuclides recommended by the international commission on radiological protection icrp icrp 2007 the annual radioactive dose dn for potentially exposed humans in the nth year was calculated after assuming that an adult consumes 600 kg of water yr gleick 1996 11 d n r e 600 x i f i f i where r 3 215 1015 bq kg is the radioactivity of 137cs bunting 1975 e 1 3 10 5 msv bq is the effective dose coefficient of 137cs for humans and xi and fi are the mass fraction of 137cs and flow rate kg yr of discharged groundwater in the nth year respectively from the ith grid block at the downstream surface bed the effective dose limit for public exposure 1 0 msv yr recommended by icrp was used to evaluate the calculated radioactive dose 5 results and discussion 5 1 base case fig 2 a b show the contours of the simulated hydraulic head and groundwater velocity the gray and white squares at the upper center indicate the barrier and cutoff wall respectively and the arrowed lines represent streamlines of the simulated groundwater flow due to the 20 m head difference between upstream and downstream curved streamlines are formed in the subsurface around the cutoff wall however at depths greater than 15 m groundwater flows almost horizontally indicating that the effect of the cutoff wall is highlighted only at shallow depths the groundwater velocity is approximately 0 28 m day immediately below the cutoff wall but rapidly decreases with depth at the bottom of the reservoir the groundwater velocity decreases to 0 04 m day the evolution of the 137cs plume at designated times of 50 100 150 and 200 years is shown in fig 3 a d in fig 3a purple grid blocks indicate deposited 137cs attached adsorbents here a total of 1 49 g 137cs 15 of 9 95 g were released over one year see section 2 3 for details to analyze the migration of the 137cs plume quantitatively the mass centers in the 137cs plume were delineated with gray circles every 10 years after 50 years the frontal margin of the 137cs plume reached the bottom of the cutoff wall while the mass center moved to a depth of approximately 3 77 m fig 3a at this time the migration rate of the 137cs plume estimated from the moving mass center was 2 81 10 4 m day and the average 137cs concentration was 1 2 102 kbq l calculated based on grid blocks with a 137cs concentration greater than 0 1 kbq l after 100 years because of the high groundwater velocity e g 0 28 m day immediately below the cutoff wall the 137cs plume thinned and followed a narrow preferential flow path fig 3b the mass center was still positioned at the upstream of the dam but the migration rate was approximately 1 5 times faster than the one at 50 years the 137cs concentration rapidly decreased 23 kbq l due to radioactive decay and dispersion at 150 years the front of the 137cs plume actively discharged to the downstream surface bed fig 3c the mass center deepened to 7 87 m at 170 years and the maximum migration rate appeared to be 5 07 10 4 m day when the mass center of the 137cs plume was at the cutoff wall fig 4 a shows the 137cs concentrations discharged at the downstream surface bed shown as green grid blocks in fig 1b compared to the regulation value of 0 1 kbq l purple area which was established for drinking water protection by the korean ministry of food and drug safety https www mfds go kr in fig 4b the red and blue symbols represent the total amount of adsorbed and dissolved 137cs respectively the green line with triangle symbols indicates the amount of cumulative discharged 137cs g to the downstream surface bed and the purple line represents the annual radioactive dose of discharged 137cs msv y after 1 year when the 137cs desorption was completed the adsorbed and dissolved amounts of 137cs were approximately 1 43 g and 1 38 10 2 g respectively then both the adsorbed and dissolved amounts of 137cs continuously decreased owing to radioactive decay the transported 137cs arrived at the downstream surface bed after approximately 80 years and the cumulative amount of discharged 137cs at 300 years was 8 56 10 4 g approximately 0 06 of the initially released amount 1 49 g despite the relatively low kd 10 ml g of 137cs adsorption caused significant retardation of 137cs the annual radioactive dose for 137cs purple line exceeded the public dose limit 1 0 msv y at 160 years and reached a maximum of 4 52 msv y at 230 years this result highlights the potential risk of secondary contamination through 137cs transport below a dam 5 2 effects of kd on 137cs transport fig 5 a shows the migration rate m d of the 137cs plume at various kd values 5 10 20 30 40 and 50 the migration rates of the 137cs plume at the designated times were calculated based on the mass center of the 137cs plume the size of the purple circles and annotated numbers indicate the average concentration kbq l of the 137cs plume the average concentration of the 137cs plume decreased rapidly because of the decay adsorption dispersion and discharge as the 137cs plume migrated downstream fig 5a in addition the maximum migration rates of 137cs plumes are marked with yellow stars for cases 1a and 1b the cumulative discharged 137cs g and annual radioactive dose msv y at the downstream surface bed are plotted in fig 5b with a green dotted line indicating the public dose limit proposed by icrp 1 0 msv y the kd had major effects on 137cs fate and transport at 50 years the migration rate of 137cs plume in case 1a 8 96 10 4 m day was approximately 3 2 times faster than that in case 1b 2 81 10 4 m day due to the difference in kd case 1a 5 ml g and case 1b 10 ml g however the average 137cs concentration 115 5 kbq l in case 1a was lower than that 120 4 kbq l in case 1b which indicates that the front of the plume in case 1a had already reached the downstream surface bed and discharged the maximum migration rates of the 137cs plume in cases 1a and 1b occurred at 80 and 170 years respectively yellow stars in fig 5a fig 5c and 5d show the contours of the 137cs plume in cases 1a and 1b respectively when the plume attained the maximum migration rate in case 1a the mass center reached the cut off wall at 80 years and the concentration of the 137cs plume was high fig 5c however in case 1b as kd increased it took 170 years until the mass center of the 137cs plume reached the cut off and the concentration significantly decreased fig 5d from case 1c to 1f the migration rates of the 137cs plume at 50 years logarithmically decreased from 8 96 10 4 to 3 47 10 5 m day due to the significant retardation of the 137cs plume in cases 1c 1f the migration rate did not reach the maximum within 300 years and the average 137cs concentration of the plume at 50 years decreased from 104 6 to 73 2 kbq l in fig 5b the cumulative discharged 137cs 1 81 10 2 g in case 1a was approximately 21 times greater than that in case 1b 8 56 10 4 g and approximately 22 000 times greater than that in case 1c 8 15 10 7 g the calculated annual radioactive dose in case 1a exceeded the public dose limit 1 0 msv y in 60 years and reached the maximum 129 8 msv y in 130 years which is approximately 29 times greater than that in case 1b base case due to the high kd values in cases 1c 1f most 137cs were adsorbed to the media before reaching the downstream stream bed therefore the annual dose became less than the public dose limit 1 0 msv y the strong sensitivity of 137cs breakthrough curves relative to kd values highlights the importance of accurately characterizing kd 5 3 effects of reservoir temperature local heat flow and desorption rate variations in the spatial temperature distribution of the aquifer change the density and viscosity of water which affect the groundwater velocity in addition as mentioned in section 4 the temperature at the reservoir bottom affects the desorption rate of 137cs which determines the releasing amount of desorbed 137cs fig 6 a shows the migration rate and average concentration of the 137cs plume with changing reservoir bottom temperature from 2 to 26 c and related desorption rates 5 20 with a fixed basal heat flow of 70 mw m2 table 2 the overall difference in the migration rate of the 137cs plume was distinct due to the variations in aquifer temperature fig s3 in case 2a representing a relatively warm season 26 c the aquifer temperature decreased the density 997 76 kg m3 and viscosity 9 03 10 7 m2 s of shallow groundwater and consequently the maximum migration rate 5 58 10 4 m day of the 137cs plume occurred at 150 years fig 6a however in case 2d representing a relatively cold season 2 c the maximum migration rate 3 68 10 4 m day occurred at 240 years the variability in the migration rate of 137cs plumes indicates that temperature effects should be considered to properly assess the long term migration of 137cs and the associated environmental risks moreover the aquifer temperature affects the 137cs desorption from 137cs contaminated adsorbents deposited at the reservoir bottom the amount of desorbed 137cs decreases as the temperature decreases for example the average concentration of the 137cs plume in case 2a desorption rate 20 was 148 5 kbq l at 50 years which decreased to 88 9 kbq l in case 2d desorption rate 5 for a relatively cold aquifer both a low desorption rate and slow groundwater velocity reduce the spread of the 137cs plume fig s3 in fig 6b the amount of cumulative discharged 137cs and annual radioactive dose in cases 2a 2d are plotted the amount of discharged 137cs in cases 2a 2d were 2 61 10 3 9 87 10 4 1 91 10 4 and 2 84 10 5 g after 300 years respectively reflecting the effect of groundwater velocity and desorption rate under different aquifer temperatures the calculated annual radioactive dose in cases 2a 2c exceeded the public dose limit of 1 0 msv y at 130 160 and 220 years and the maximum annual dose was about 13 9 msv y 200 years 5 24 msv y 220 years and 1 27 msv y 250 years respectively however in case 2d the maximum annual dose was approximately 2 54 10 1 msv y 280 years not reaching the public dose limit overall the non isothermal effects on 137cs plume migration were relatively low compared to the effect of kd figs 5 and 6 but they still had substantial effects on the risk of annual radioactive dose fig 6b 5 4 effects of aquifer heterogeneity on 137cs transport fig 7 a shows a representative realization of a heterogeneous k field generated through the sequential gaussian based function proposed by dietrich and newsam 1997 the mean k was equal to that in the base case 8 64 10 2 m day and the variance of ln k was set to 0 9 table 2 meerschaert et al 2013 the horizontal and vertical integral scales were set to 1 0 and 0 1 respectively to represent anisotropic heterogeneity structures in case 3a kd was set to 10 ml g without correlating with heterogeneous k however in case 3b kd varied as a function of k the spatial map of kd calculated using eq 1 is shown in fig 7b and the relationship between k and kd is shown in fig s4 in cases 3c and 3d the mean k was set to 4 32 10 2 m day with adjusted kd 14 ml g and correlated heterogeneous kd respectively fig 8 a d show the migration rates of the 137cs plume calculated from 50 realizations of cases 3a 3d the black lines represent the arithmetic means and the red and pink dotted lines indicate 80 and 95 confidence intervals respectively the mean 137cs migration rates in cases 3a 3d generally increased with time but the migration rates in cases 3a and 3b were approximately 2 5 5 5 times faster than those in cases 3c and 3d due to the difference between average k case 3a 8 64 10 2 m day and case 3c 4 32 10 2 m day and kd case 3a 10 ml g and case 3c 14 ml g table2 the maximum mean migration rate indicated by stars appeared at 250 years in case 3a 2 78 10 4 m day and case 3b 1 88 10 4 m day but the maximum rates in cases 3c and 3d were not reached even after 300 years on investigating individual realization in case 3a the 137cs migration rates showed consistent parabolic trends fig 8a but those in case 3b showed more irregular and wide variations fig 8b the range of confidence intervals in case 3b was also wider than that in case 3a suggesting that the correlated k and kd increased the complexity of 137cs transport in case 3c as the average k reduced by half both the migration rate and its variability decreased fig 8c the mean migration rates of the 137cs plume in cases 3b and 3d reduced by approximately 32 and 24 relative to cases 3a and 3c respectively indicating that an increased kd at low k heterogeneity has a profound effect on 137cs transport in fig 9 a d the annual radioactive doses of discharged 137cs in 50 realizations of cases 3a 3d are plotted where the probability densities of realizations are represented by purple contours the arithmetic means and confidence intervals 80 and 95 are represented by black red dotted and pink dotted lines respectively the lines with purple symbols indicate the average amount of cumulative discharged 137cs at the downstream surface bed similar to the trends of the migration rates fig 8a d the mean annual dose in case 3b was lower than that in case 3a while the range of the confidence intervals slightly increased owing to the effect of correlated k and kd in cases 3a and 3b the mean annual dose reached a maximum of 4 87 10 1 msv y 240 years and 2 75 10 1 msv y 220 years respectively however in cases 3c and 3d an annual dose of only up to 2 89 10 5 and 2 10 10 5 msv y respectively was discharged at 300 years due to the lower 137cs migration rate the probability densities represented by purple contours in fig 9a d appear to have a wide variation the wide variability in probability densities indicates that the behavior of the 137cs plume was primarily governed by local k heterogeneity around the bottom of the cutoff wall fig s5 which is the major flow pathway for the 137cs plume 5 5 effects of fracture network on 137cs transport in case 4 10 realizations delineating discrete fracture networks dfns were developed see section 4 for details of the dfn generation to better resolve fractures the total number of grid blocks was increased to 40 000 with the size of δx and δz set to 0 25 m in addition the cut off wall had the same position and hydraulic properties e g porosity k and kd as in the base case table 2 fig 10 a d show four representative realizations 1 3 5 and 9 of continuum based 2d fractured aquifers obtained by upscaling the dfns using the method of oda 1985 all 10 realizations are shown in fig s6a j case 4 the black arrows with annotated numbers indicate major fractures that could serve as potential pathways for the 137cs plume additionally the corresponding contours of the simulated 137cs plume were delineated over 300 years with the annotated number showing the spatial distribution of the 137cs plume fig 10e h as shown in fig 10a d the distribution and connectivity of fractures were distinctly different even though 10 realizations were developed based on the same fracture statistics the fractures in fn 1 were developed densely at the upstream of the cut off wall fig 10a but those in fn 3 were concentrated downstream fig 10b because of such difference the 137cs plume migrated downstream in fn 1 fig 10e but stagnated upstream in fn 3 fig 10f specifically in fn 1 fractures i and ii at the upstream were oriented below the cut off wall and intersected fractures iii and iv which extended to downstream surface bed fig 10a through these connected fractures the 137cs plume could be effectively transported downstream fig 10e in fn 3 most fractures were distributed at the downstream aquifer and there were no fractures that could serve as a major pathway for the 137cs plume from the upstream reservoir bottom fig 10b without preferential fracture pathways the migration of the 137cs plume was considerably retarded fig 10f in both fn 5 fig 10c and fn 9 fig 10d the fractures were distributed relatively uniformly and randomly throughout the model domain but the fracture orientation and connectivity varied greatly between realizations in fn 5 fractures i ii and iii at the upstream were inclined in the opposite direction to the cut off wall and intersected fractures iv v and vi which extended to the basement formation consequently the 137cs plume preferentially migrated to the basement formation and was not able to efficiently reach downstream fig 10g however in fn 9 fracture networks connect upstream and downstream efficiently and enabled fracture vii to serve as the primary preferential pathway for the 137cs plume fig 10h highlights the importance of fracture orientation and connectivity the simulated migration rates of the 137cs plume for fn 1 10 are plotted in fig 11 a where the annotated numbers indicate the average concentration kbq l of the 137cs plume for the maximum fn 3 and minimum fn 9 cases the migration rate in fn 9 light blue line was notably high 1 08 10 4 m day owing to the well connected fracture network from upstream to downstream the long migration distance of the 137cs plume increased the contact area with the surrounding aquifer media and consequently the concentration of the 137cs plume decreased due to increased sorption in fn 3 orange line the migration rate of the 137cs plume was approximately 3 27 10 5 m day at 50 years and decreased continuously owing to the small contact area the 137cs plume was concentrated upstream in fig 11b the cumulative discharged 137cs g dotted lines and the calculated annual radioactive doses msv y solid lines at downstream surface bed are plotted the cumulative discharged 137cs was the highest 1 98 10 8 g in fn 1 and the lowest 3 55 10 16 g in fn 3 in all realizations the maximum annual radioactive dose was lower than the public dose limit of 1 0 msv y the highest dose was 3 25 10 4 msv y in fn 1 at 300 years the predicted annual dose at downstream surface bed was primarily influenced by the structure of the fracture network for example in fn 9 the migration rate of the 137cs plume was the highest but the radioactive dose was not the highest because the fractures serving as primary pathways for the 137cs plume did not extend to the downstream surface bed fig 10h instead in fn 1 where the fracture was directly connected to the downstream surface bed the radioactive dose was the highest highlighting the importance of fracture orientation and connectivity 5 6 comparative influence of major parameters on 137cs fate and transport the simulation results of the 137cs plume migration in cases 1 4 are summarized in table 3 and the effects of the key parameters on 137cs transport are summarized in fig 12 a d as kd varied from 5 to 50 ml g in cases 1a f fig 12a the maximum migration rate of the 137cs plume and annual dose showed notable decreases in addition the average plume concentration at 50 years decreased with an increasing kd except in case 1a where some of the 137cs plume was discharged to downstream surface bed the effect of temperature conditions in cases 2a d was relatively small fig 12b the maximum migration rates of the 137cs plume increased modestly when the reservoir temperature increased from 2 to 26 c additionally due to the reduced desorption rates at cold temperatures both maximum annual dose and average plume concentrations decreased in cases 3a d the effect of k and kd heterogeneity was evaluated with 50 realizations fig 12c considering the coupled k and kd heterogeneity cases 3b and 3d the maximum migration rates of the 137cs plume and annual dose showed wide variability interestingly the mean of maximum migration rate also decreased in case 3b and 3d indicating that the 137cs plume can be potentially delayed by heterogeneous kd the average plume concentrations increased as the mean k decreased case 3a and 3c but decreased when heterogeneous kd was considered case 3b and 3d finally in case 4 10 realizations of dfns were considered to assess the effects of fracture networks on the transport of the 137cs plume fig 12d although the migration rates up to 1 08 10 4 m day and annual dose up to 3 25 10 4 msv y were relatively low compared to other cases the average plume concentrations 1 073 6 690 7 kbq l showed significant variations owing to the importance of fracture connectivity and orientation overall the simulation results indicate that kd is the most critical parameter controlling the transport of the 137cs plume and demonstrate the importance of k and its correlation with kd although relatively less critical reduced desorption rate at low temperature conditions can also potentially decrease the risk the results in cases 1 and 2 clearly show a proportional trend between the maximum migration rate of 137cs plume and the annual radioactive dose of discharged 137cs under the dominant effect of kd therefore it is possible to predict the annual dose of discharged 137cs by calculating the initial behavior of the 137cs plume however in case 3 the proportional trend is reduced by heterogeneity and in case 4 the characteristic behavior of the 137cs plume depending on fracture geometries makes it difficult to predict the fate of 137cs and highlights the importance of uncertainty quantification these results emphasize the need for countermeasures in early stages such as the installation of additional barriers with high kd the dredge of settling adsorbent and periodic respread of adsorbent during the reservoir remediation process after radiation accidents however credibility of numerical modeling technique is highly dependent on the precision of transport parameters and grid accuracy measured from in situ field experiments allahyari et al 2020 brand et al 1991 luckey and stephens 1987 to evaluate the sensitivity analysis of grid effect additional simulations were conducted with a grid block size of δx δz 0 5 m for all scenarios in case 1 and case 2 and some representative scenarios 14 and 40 in case 3 table s2 although the grid effect was not significant compared to the effects of other parameters mainly discussed in the study figs s8 s9 s10 considering simplified grid models and relevant variables site specific field investigations should be conducted to characterize the uncertainties associated with hydrogeologic geochemical and engineering properties e g hydraulic conductivity characteristics of the cutoff wall head gradient of the aquifer 137cs desorption rate relationship of k and kd and distribution of fracture networks in addition it is necessary to verify the effect of relevant parameters longitudinal and transverse dispersivities change in sorption characteristic with temperature and water level changes over time that were not considered due to the limitations of the model on the 137cs transport for site application verification and validation procedures must be conducted with field and laboratory investigations including the quantitative characterization of important parameters affecting 137cs fate and transport additionally the effects of more complex processes such as the chemical reactions of 137cs and colloid facilitated transport should be considered in future studies 6 conclusion in this study the subsurface behavior of desorbed 137cs and the potential risks for secondary contamination were evaluated the model properties are based on the geological features representing paldang reservoir adjacent to seoul metropolitan city to evaluate the migration properties of 137cs plume and associated human health risk comprehensively various scenarios including a wide range of kd temperature effects reservoir bottom temperature and basal heat flow heterogeneity effects k variability and correlation between k and kd and fractured aquifer properties were investigated the model results indicate that kd is the dominant factor that determines 137cs fate and transport but the effects of temperature also affect the overall plume concentration furthermore k heterogeneity especially the fracture networks leads to significant uncertainties in 137cs transport and associated health risks highlighting the importance of accurately characterizing subsurface fracture distribution the comprehensive numerical assessment of 137cs fate and transport and the estimation of annual radioactive dose elucidated the risk associated with long term secondary contamination through an aquifer below a dam this study shows that the secondary contamination of desorbed 137cs could cause contamination levels above the public dose limit set by the icrp even after long periods of time however given that the study assumed extreme events e g nuclear disasters the assessment of potential human health risks will be greatly affected by uncertainties due to aquifer heterogeneity or fracture network geometry these properties should be assessed as a part of the post accidental radiation safety analyses credit authorship contribution statement jaehyun lee conceptualization methodology software investigation data

2836,understanding the long term fate and transport of radiocesium 137cs through porous and fractured aquifers is critical for the risk assessment of nuclear accidents in particular characterizing 137cs transport below a dam storing potable water is critical for assessing the risk of 137cs migration in this study a 2d cross sectional aquifer model was developed based on paldang reservoir in south korea and transport of desorbed 137cs beneath a dam was investigated systematically various scenarios investigated 137cs transport within the reported ranges of distribution coefficient kd and local temperature conditions basal heat flow and reservoir bottom temperature affecting the 137cs desorption rate and hydrogeologic heterogeneity hydraulic conductivity and fracture networks the characteristics of the 137cs plume represented by the average plume concentration and the migration rate of the mass center were assessed and the health risk of chronic exposure for humans was predicted in base case k 8 64 10 2 m day and kd 10 ml g approximately 0 06 of initially released 137cs was transported downstream over 300 years the maximum migration rate was 5 1 10 4 m day and a maximum annual radioactive dose was 4 5 msv y after 230 years the notable effect of kd on the migration rate 5 1 10 5 9 9 10 4 m day and annual dose 9 1 10 11 130 msv y indicates that the kd is a critical parameter that controls the transport of 137cs in the subsurface aquifer the effect of temperature on 137cs transport was relatively insignificant but it still had a noticeable effect especially on the desorption rate in addition 50 realizations of heterogeneous k and kd were generated to evaluate the influence of physical and chemical heterogeneity on 137cs transport the migration rate and annual dose of 137cs plume showed large variability when k and kd were correlated finally 137cs transport was evaluated in fractured aquifers and assessed the importance of fracture orientation and connectivity keywords radiocesium 137cs transport dam heterogeneity fractured aquifer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the industrial use of nuclear energy has grown considerably over the past decades while safety concerns related to radioactive contamination have been raised menyah and wolde rufael 2010 toth and rogner 2006 wittneben 2012 many previous studies have investigated various scenarios related to the fate and transport of radionuclides in the environment to develop proper remediation technologies and conduct risk assessments of released radionuclides bugai et al 2012 caron et al 2007 monte et al 2005 ohtsuka et al 1988 rockhold et al 2012 among the various radionuclides that can be released from nuclear reactors cesium 137 137cs is particular concern because it can severely contaminate surrounding water resources due to its high solubility and long half life 30 17 years buesseler et al 2011 due to the increase in public concern after the fukushima disaster in japan risk assessment protocols to allow the systematic cleanup of 137cs contamination have been actively proposed in korea kim et al 2016 moon 2020 park 2012 park et al 2020 one of the promising cleanup processes includes immediate 137cs remediation from surface water resources by spraying effective and abundant natural adsorbents e g illite hwang et al 2021 kitajima et al 2012 tsuruoka et al 2013 fig 1 a the natural adsorbents settle down while adsorbing 137cs dissolved in water and then sink to the bottom of the surface water resources without proper removal of settled 137cs sorbed adsorbents 137cs may desorb and subsequently remobilize in the subsurface environment causing secondary contamination to adjacent groundwater and surface water systems previous studies have demonstrated that such desorption processes could cause the remobilization of 137cs from natural sediments to surrounding environments e g surface water and groundwater systems smith and comans 1996 standring et al 2002 takata et al 2015 especially dams and reservoirs can trap large amounts of contaminated sediments for a long period of time yamada et al 2015 zheleznyak et al 2015 pinder et al 2005 reported that aged 137cs in sediments from contaminated reservoirs in south carolina usa were remobilized after the addition of competing cations however the fate and transport of desorbed 137cs in groundwater systems have not yet been comprehensively addressed in particular the risk for human health associated with the fate and transport of desorbed 137cs below a dam was not understood which is critical for a risk assessment to assess the fate of remobilized 137cs through the subsurface aquifer adsorption processes and the radioactive decay for 137cs must be considered ashraf et al 2014 medved and cerny 2019 palágyi and štamberg 2011 the retardation caused by adsorption was generally investigated by implementing the distribution coefficient kd of 137cs which is experimentally shown to be very sensitive to aquifer materials and groundwater chemistry elejalde et al 2000 konishi et al 1988 mollah and ullah 1998 soederlund et al 2014 steefel et al 2003 in addition hydrogeologic features such as local heat flow geologic heterogeneity and fracture networks governing dissolved solute behavior have also been the subject of many previous studies in recent decades schwartz 2012 silveira et al 2013 viswanathan et al 2003 wang et al 2010a yang et al 2008 these studies focusing on the migration of radionuclides through the aquifer were conducted to assess the safety of current or future nuclear facilities for example testoni et al 2015 investigated the transport of radionuclides including 90sr and 137cs in shallow groundwater of the italian nuclear site in saluuggia and reported the increasing effect of adsorption with the depth and the distance similarly cao et al 2017 developed a regional radionuclide transport model at a potential repository site in northwestern china and conducted the sensitivity analyses of 137cs transport with varying permeability distribution coefficient and diffusion coefficient in consideration of hydrogeologic conditions including the faults and fractures despite the increasing concern about 137cs contamination previous studies have not focused on the long term contamination of 137cs in groundwater systems because of its high sorption capability in soil and unsaturated environments given that the fate and transport of desorbed 137cs below a dam can potentially be critical for the 137cs remobilization this study aims to evaluate the long term fate and transport of 137cs through an aquifer below a dam the potential secondary contamination of 137cs in the aquifer was studied with various scenarios kd values non isothermal effects influencing the 137cs desorption and heterogeneous and fractured aquifers after assuming the desorption of 137cs from settled natural adsorbents by doing so the characteristics of the 137cs plume were comprehensively assessed and subsequently the amount of 137cs discharged downstream of the reservoir was quantified to evaluate the human health risk due to chronic exposure 2 model description fig 1a illustrates the study scenario showing the situation where the potable surface water reservoir is contaminated from the fall out of 137cs the 137cs contaminated reservoir can be remediated by spraying natural adsorbents using either airplanes or drones here 137cs and adsorbents are represented by purple and green circles respectively the sprayed adsorbents initially float and adsorb dissolved 137cs and eventually sink to the bottom of the reservoir due to gravity without proper treatment e g dredging the 137cs contaminated adsorbents would stay at the reservoir bottom for a long period while desorbing 137cs then the desorbed 137cs would cause the secondary contamination to adjacent sedimentary or fractured aquifers and may subsequently be released to downstream surface water therefore it is essential to understand the fate and transport of desorbed 137cs in subsurface aquifers below a dam 2 1 groundwater flow to simulate the process of 137cs transport via groundwater seepage beneath artificial or natural reservoirs a 2d cross sectional aquifer model was developed fig 1b the model setup is based on the paldang reservoir which is the main water resource of the seoul metropolitan city in the republic of korea fig 1a the model dimension are x 100 m and z 25 m with a size of grid block to be δx δz 1 m fig 1b the geologic formations adjacent to the paldang reservoir are precambrian metamorphic rocks primarily consisting of biotite gneiss and mica schist the hydraulic conductivity k was uniformly assigned to 8 64 10 2 m day for the base case referring to zucchi et al 2017 who calculated the k of faulted mica schist to be between 4 32 10 1 and 4 32 10 5 m day through laboratory scale column tests the anisotropy ratio k v k h of the aquifer was assumed to be 0 1 and the porosity was set to 0 2 zucchi et al 2017 in addition considering that the cutoff wall is composed of a mixture of cement and bentonite its k and porosity were assigned as 8 64 10 5 m day and 0 1 respectively philip 2001 historical changes in surface water level at the paldang reservoir since 1980 were acquired from the korean water resources management information system https www wamis go kr since the soyanggang reservoir and chungju reservoir which are located upstream of paldang reservoir mainly control the water level the average level of the paldang reservoir has been maintained at approximately 21 84 m for the last 40 years with variations from 17 3 to 22 4 m in this study the reservoir depth to the upstream bed was assumed to be 22 m while the downstream depth of the dam was 2 m the corresponding constant pressure and temperature conditions were assigned to the upper left and right boundaries of the model fig 1b the artificial barrier or dam which maintains water storage at the upper stream is located at the center of the top boundary as a no flow condition the horizontal length of its foundation is set to be 24 m while the depth of the cutoff wall is 10 m a constant head condition was assigned to the lateral boundaries the head gradient between the left and right boundaries was set to 0 2 considering a large difference in the surface water level between the upper and downstream the bottom boundary was assigned to a no flow condition assuming the presence of a low permeable bedrock formation additionally all boundaries have constant temperature conditions but several scenarios are conducted with various reservoir temperature and base heat flow conditions which will be described in section 4 model scenarios 2 2 desorption and transport of dissolved 137cs the amount of 137cs desorbed from the deposited adsorbents is an important factor influencing the 137cs redistribution in the aquifer to estimate the amount of 137cs deposited on the reservoir bottom in the situation of severe contamination from a nuclear disaster the 137cs deposition data from the 2011 fukushima disaster were investigated https ramap jmc or jp map measured data on april 29 2011 indicated that the spatial area covering approximately 184 km2 was severely contaminated with a range from 3 0 106 to 1 47 107 bq m2 kato et al 2019 reconstructed a fall out map of accident derived 137cs based on a comparison of the 137cs deposition densities with the airborne monitoring surveys and reported that 32 tbq of 137cs was deposited in rivers and lakes considering the measured 137cs concentration the initial amount of deposited 137cs in the present study was set to 9 95 g at the reservoir assuming that 32 tbq of 137cs contaminated an area of 43 87 km2 which is equivalent to the size of the paldang reservoir watershed according to 137cs desorption measurements by wang et al 2010b and liu et al 2003b the time and amount of desorbing 137cs are largely influenced by the chemical properties e g ph temperature other competitive cations and the type of adsorbent of the surrounding environment for example approximately 70 of 133cs were desorbed from synthetic zeolites with 10 1 m hcl depending on the exchangeable cation concentration and degree of weathering on clay minerals miura et al 2018 murota et al 2016 also performed laboratory experiments on the kinetic 133cs desorption using fukushima soils and reported that up to 60 of 137cs could be desorbed over 140 days in 10 3 m kcl media in the present study 133cs desorption batch experiments were conducted for 1 year using naturally abundant illite in korea known to have high cs adsorption properties first the powdered illite was injected into a conical batch containing 130 and 13 000 μg l of 133cs solution and reacted in an orbital shaker at 130 rpm for 24 h to produce 133cs sorbed illite after the reaction the 133cs sorbed illite was separated from the solution by centrifugation at 3 500 rpm for 30 min and dried in an oven on 22gw jeio tech at 40 c for 3 days then 20 ml of distilled water was injected into the dried batches and they were reacted for 1 year to desorb the 133cs from illite after 1 year the concentration of desorbed 133cs was analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms x series thermo and found out that 12 27 at 130 μg l and 48 20 at 13 000 μg l of 133cs were desorbed from illite based on these experiments 1 49 g desorption rate 15 of 137cs was assumed to be desorbed from the deposited adsorbents at the reservoir bottom over 1 year purple grid blocks in fig 1b to simulate the transport of desorbed 137cs through the subsurface aquifer the decay constant λ and kd of 137cs should be determined for the radioactive decay and adsorption in this study the first order decay law was applied based on the half life 30 17 years of 137cs additionally because of the wide range of kd reported in numerous experimental studies elejalde et al 2000 konishi et al 1988 krupka et al 1999 lieser and steinkopff 1989 mollah and ullah 1998 soederlund et al 2014 steefel et al 2003 vilks and yang 2018 the reported kd values and their experimental conditions experiment type mica contents ph cation exchange capacity and dissolved cs concentrations were summarized comprehensively in table s1 their statistics are shown in table 1 where the reported kd values showed a large standard deviation for example kd ranges from 7 ml g measured from sandy carbonate soils at the u s department of energy s hanford site routson et al 1981 to 7 610 ml g measured in carbonate soils containing more than 50 clay collected from the hanford site serne and legore 1996 such a wide range of kd can greatly influence 137cs retardation leading to large variabilities in the migration rate and concentration of 137cs plumes ashraf et al 2014 in the base case simulation a kd of 10 ml g was selected considering high 137cs contaminated soils from hanford site which revealed a kd range from 2 1 to 22 ml g rockhold et al 2012 the diffusion coefficient of 137cs was set to 6 0 10 8 m2 s but the effect of diffusion on the transport of 137cs is expected to be low due to the relatively low diffusion coefficient atkinson and nickerson 1988 finally in this study the suite of tough2 eos7r software was employed to simulate the non isothermal reactive radioactive decay and retardation transport of desorbed 137cs through the subsurface aquifer oldenburg and pruess 1995 pruess 1991 3 governing equations in this study the suite of tough2 software which is based on the integral finite difference method was employed pruess 1991 the general conservation equations of tough2 consist of balances between mass accumulation and flux and source terms 1 d dt v n m κ d v γ n f κ n d γ v n q κ d v in the integration vn m3 and γn m2 indicate volume and surface area respectively and the index κ corresponds to the fluid components water and radionuclide and heat the mass accumulation term m in eq 1 is given by 2 m κ ϕ β 1 nph s β ρ β x β κ where ϕ is the porosity ρ kg m3 is the water density x is the mass fraction since the study assumed a fully saturated single phase model fully saturated aquifer phase β is water with the unity of saturation s in addition the flux term f in eq 1 consists of the advective and dispersive flux terms 3 f κ β 1 x β κ ρ β u β ρ β ϕ τ 0 τ β d x β κ the first term on the right hand side of eq 3 is the flux term which accounts for the advective mass flux arising from darcy flux the magnitude of the darcy velocity u m s is calculated from darcy s law 4 u k p ρ g μ here k is permeability m2 μ is viscosity pa s p is the pressure gradient pa m and g is the vector of gravitational acceleration m s2 the second term on the right hand side of eq 3 is the dispersive term where τ0τ is the tortuosity factor and d m2 s is the molecular diffusion coefficient for τ0τ the millington and quirk model was applied to calculate the tortuosity dependent on the saturation falta et al 1989 jury et al 1983 5 τ 0 τ ϕ 1 3 s 10 3 finally q kg m3 on the right side of eq 1 represents either a sink or a source to simulate the fate and transport of 137cs the equation of state for eos7r was adapted oldenburg and pruess 1995 the eos7r is capable of simulating diffusive and advective mass transport radioactive decay and adsorption of radionuclides the radioactive decay is given by 6 d dt m l l n 2 t 1 2 m l where m l kg m3 is the radionuclide mass per unit volume in subdomain l and t1 2 s is the half life the adsorption of radionuclides onto solid grains is calculated as reversible instantaneous linear sorption and the mass accumulation term in eq 2 including the effect of adsorption then becomes 8 m κ ϕ β 1 nph s β ρ β x β κ 1 ϕ ρ r ρ w x κ k d w κ where ρ r kg m3 is the density of the rock and kd ml g is the distribution coefficient for a radionuclide the heat flow is governed by conduction and convection including the sensible and latent heat effects the energy balance equation for heat accumulation j m3 and heat flux j m2s is given below 9 d dt v n 1 ϕ ρ r c r t ϕ β s β ρ β u β d v γ n λ t β h β ρ β u β n d γ v n q d v where ρ r kg m3 and c r j kg c are the density and specific heat

investigation of 137cs transport various scenarios were considered as summarized in table 2 the base case case 1b was a homogeneous case k 8 64 10 2 m day with a kd value of 10 ml g cases 1a 1f were designed to evaluate the effect of varying kd from 5 to 50 ml g representing the 137cs adsorption capacity of various geologic media cases 2a 2d represent the effects of reservoir temperature and geothermal gradient on 137cs transport at the paldang reservoir the reservoir bottom temperature was reported to vary from 26 c in august to 2 c in february fig s1 na and park 2005 and the terrestrial heat flow adjacent to paldang reservoir was 70 mw m2 fig s2 song et al 2006 such terrestrial heat flow and seasonal variability in reservoir bottom temperature could impact aquifer temperature resulting in changes in groundwater velocity smith and chapman 1983 in addition 137cs could be desorbed with different rates depending on the reservoir bottom and aquifer temperatures from a column experiment conducted by liu et al 2003a it was reported that the desorbed 137cs concentration decreased from 0 05 μmol l to approximately 0 03 μmol l with decreasing temperature from 35 to 15 in this regard the effect of seasonal reservoir temperature ranging from the lowest 2 c to the highest 26 c was evaluated case 2a to case 2d with corresponding 137cs desorption rate 5 20 in consideration of the decrease in 137cs desorption at low temperatures in cases 3a 3d the effect of subsurface heterogeneity e g hydraulic conductivity k was evaluated the k heterogeneities at a subsurface aquifer significantly affect contaminant transport bellin et al 1992 gelhar and axness 1983 michael and khan 2016 sudicky et al 2010 in addition to the physical k heterogeneity remarkable adsorption kd heterogeneity has been reported in various aquifer media boggs et al 1992 viswanathan et al 2003 and significant impacts of both k and kd heterogeneity on solute transport have been reported barber 1994 bosma et al 1993 qin et al 2013 for example for aquifer media with clay minerals a negative relationship exists between k and kd clay minerals have high kd while representing low k robin et al 1991 investigated spatial variabilities between k and kd of strontium at borden canada and found a weak but important negative correlation in this study spatially correlated k fields were generated through the sequential gaussian based function proposed by dietrich and newsam 1997 the spatial correlation between k and kd for 137cs was calculated from the spherical grain model eq 1 proposed by garabedian 1987 who assumed a negative correlation between the adsorption properties of the aquifer and grain sizes 10 d k d d l n k h k d 2 in case 4 the influence of fracture networks on 137cs transport was evaluated dams are typically constructed above granite based hard rocks which often have fracture networks xiang et al 2015 conducted hydrogeological modeling at xiaolangdi dam and noted that faults crossing the dam s foundation have a significant influence on seepage as seen subsurface fracture networks can serve as unexpected pathways for 137cs to investigate the effects of rock fractures on 137cs transport discrete fracture networks dfns were constructed based on borehole data collected from a field site approximately 7 km away from the paldang reservoir and the probability distributions of fracture aperture and fracture orientation were quantified from borehole data because the borehole data did not provide information on the fracture length the proportional relationship l b between the fracture aperture b and length l was assumed based on field observations that indicated a positive correlation baghbanan and jing 2007 de dreuzy et al 2001 hatton et al 1994 kang et al 2020 renshaw and park 1997 vermilye and scholz 1995 specifically the fracture lengths were assumed to be 103 times larger than their aperture size such that l 10 3 b the prefactor of 10 3 is chosen considering that the fracture length is often observed in meter scale while the aperture size is typically in submillimeter scale then the generated 10 dfns were upscaled to corresponding continuum based k fields using the technique proposed by oda 1985 the upscaling method is based on the crack tensor theory and calculates the volume averaged permeability tensors considering the geometrical aspects of fractures such as fracture size aperture and orientation the upscaling approach has been proved to be accurate when enough randomly oriented and interconnected fractures exist in each grid which is the case of this study agada et al 2017 barla et al 2000 lee et al 1995 nejadi et al 2015 the mean k 8 64 10 2 m day of individual realization in continuum based fn was equivalent to the k of previous cases with an anisotropic ratio kv kh of 0 1 and the kd was set to 10 ml g table 2 finally the health risk for humans due to desorbed 137cs was assessed in all the scenarios based on both the 137cs radioactivity and the effective dose coefficient of 137cs for humans here the effective dose coefficient was determined from the guidance on radiological exposure and dose coefficients of various radionuclides recommended by the international commission on radiological protection icrp icrp 2007 the annual radioactive dose dn for potentially exposed humans in the nth year was calculated after assuming that an adult consumes 600 kg of water yr gleick 1996 11 d n r e 600 x i f i f i where r 3 215 1015 bq kg is the radioactivity of 137cs bunting 1975 e 1 3 10 5 msv bq is the effective dose coefficient of 137cs for humans and xi and fi are the mass fraction of 137cs and flow rate kg yr of discharged groundwater in the nth year respectively from the ith grid block at the downstream surface bed the effective dose limit for public exposure 1 0 msv yr recommended by icrp was used to evaluate the calculated radioactive dose 5 results and discussion 5 1 base case fig 2 a b show the contours of the simulated hydraulic head and groundwater velocity the gray and white squares at the upper center indicate the barrier and cutoff wall respectively and the arrowed lines represent streamlines of the simulated groundwater flow due to the 20 m head difference between upstream and downstream curved streamlines are formed in the subsurface around the cutoff wall however at depths greater than 15 m groundwater flows almost horizontally indicating that the effect of the cutoff wall is highlighted only at shallow depths the groundwater velocity is approximately 0 28 m day immediately below the cutoff wall but rapidly decreases with depth at the bottom of the reservoir the groundwater velocity decreases to 0 04 m day the evolution of the 137cs plume at designated times of 50 100 150 and 200 years is shown in fig 3 a d in fig 3a purple grid blocks indicate deposited 137cs attached adsorbents here a total of 1 49 g 137cs 15 of 9 95 g were released over one year see section 2 3 for details to analyze the migration of the 137cs plume quantitatively the mass centers in the 137cs plume were delineated with gray circles every 10 years after 50 years the frontal margin of the 137cs plume reached the bottom of the cutoff wall while the mass center moved to a depth of approximately 3 77 m fig 3a at this time the migration rate of the 137cs plume estimated from the moving mass center was 2 81 10 4 m day and the average 137cs concentration was 1 2 102 kbq l calculated based on grid blocks with a 137cs concentration greater than 0 1 kbq l after 100 years because of the high groundwater velocity e g 0 28 m day immediately below the cutoff wall the 137cs plume thinned and followed a narrow preferential flow path fig 3b the mass center was still positioned at the upstream of the dam but the migration rate was approximately 1 5 times faster than the one at 50 years the 137cs concentration rapidly decreased 23 kbq l due to radioactive decay and dispersion at 150 years the front of the 137cs plume actively discharged to the downstream surface bed fig 3c the mass center deepened to 7 87 m at 170 years and the maximum migration rate appeared to be 5 07 10 4 m day when the mass center of the 137cs plume was at the cutoff wall fig 4 a shows the 137cs concentrations discharged at the downstream surface bed shown as green grid blocks in fig 1b compared to the regulation value of 0 1 kbq l purple area which was established for drinking water protection by the korean ministry of food and drug safety https www mfds go kr in fig 4b the red and blue symbols represent the total amount of adsorbed and dissolved 137cs respectively the green line with triangle symbols indicates the amount of cumulative discharged 137cs g to the downstream surface bed and the purple line represents the annual radioactive dose of discharged 137cs msv y after 1 year when the 137cs desorption was completed the adsorbed and dissolved amounts of 137cs were approximately 1 43 g and 1 38 10 2 g respectively then both the adsorbed and dissolved amounts of 137cs continuously decreased owing to radioactive decay the transported 137cs arrived at the downstream surface bed after approximately 80 years and the cumulative amount of discharged 137cs at 300 years was 8 56 10 4 g approximately 0 06 of the initially released amount 1 49 g despite the relatively low kd 10 ml g of 137cs adsorption caused significant retardation of 137cs the annual radioactive dose for 137cs purple line exceeded the public dose limit 1 0 msv y at 160 years and reached a maximum of 4 52 msv y at 230 years this result highlights the potential risk of secondary contamination through 137cs transport below a dam 5 2 effects of kd on 137cs transport fig 5 a shows the migration rate m d of the 137cs plume at various kd values 5 10 20 30 40 and 50 the migration rates of the 137cs plume at the designated times were calculated based on the mass center of the 137cs plume the size of the purple circles and annotated numbers indicate the average concentration kbq l of the 137cs plume the average concentration of the 137cs plume decreased rapidly because of the decay adsorption dispersion and discharge as the 137cs plume migrated downstream fig 5a in addition the maximum migration rates of 137cs plumes are marked with yellow stars for cases 1a and 1b the cumulative discharged 137cs g and annual radioactive dose msv y at the downstream surface bed are plotted in fig 5b with a green dotted line indicating the public dose limit proposed by icrp 1 0 msv y the kd had major effects on 137cs fate and transport at 50 years the migration rate of 137cs plume in case 1a 8 96 10 4 m day was approximately 3 2 times faster than that in case 1b 2 81 10 4 m day due to the difference in kd case 1a 5 ml g and case 1b 10 ml g however the average 137cs concentration 115 5 kbq l in case 1a was lower than that 120 4 kbq l in case 1b which indicates that the front of the plume in case 1a had already reached the downstream surface bed and discharged the maximum migration rates of the 137cs plume in cases 1a and 1b occurred at 80 and 170 years respectively yellow stars in fig 5a fig 5c and 5d show the contours of the 137cs plume in cases 1a and 1b respectively when the plume attained the maximum migration rate in case 1a the mass center reached the cut off wall at 80 years and the concentration of the 137cs plume was high fig 5c however in case 1b as kd increased it took 170 years until the mass center of the 137cs plume reached the cut off and the concentration significantly decreased fig 5d from case 1c to 1f the migration rates of the 137cs plume at 50 years logarithmically decreased from 8 96 10 4 to 3 47 10 5 m day due to the significant retardation of the 137cs plume in cases 1c 1f the migration rate did not reach the maximum within 300 years and the average 137cs concentration of the plume at 50 years decreased from 104 6 to 73 2 kbq l in fig 5b the cumulative discharged 137cs 1 81 10 2 g in case 1a was approximately 21 times greater than that in case 1b 8 56 10 4 g and approximately 22 000 times greater than that in case 1c 8 15 10 7 g the calculated annual radioactive dose in case 1a exceeded the public dose limit 1 0 msv y in 60 years and reached the maximum 129 8 msv y in 130 years which is approximately 29 times greater than that in case 1b base case due to the high kd values in cases 1c 1f most 137cs were adsorbed to the media before reaching the downstream stream bed therefore the annual dose became less than the public dose limit 1 0 msv y the strong sensitivity of 137cs breakthrough curves relative to kd values highlights the importance of accurately characterizing kd 5 3 effects of reservoir temperature local heat flow and desorption rate variations in the spatial temperature distribution of the aquifer change the density and viscosity of water which affect the groundwater velocity in addition as mentioned in section 4 the temperature at the reservoir bottom affects the desorption rate of 137cs which determines the releasing amount of desorbed 137cs fig 6 a shows the migration rate and average concentration of the 137cs plume with changing reservoir bottom temperature from 2 to 26 c and related desorption rates 5 20 with a fixed basal heat flow of 70 mw m2 table 2 the overall difference in the migration rate of the 137cs plume was distinct due to the variations in aquifer temperature fig s3 in case 2a representing a relatively warm season 26 c the aquifer temperature decreased the density 997 76 kg m3 and viscosity 9 03 10 7 m2 s of shallow groundwater and consequently the maximum migration rate 5 58 10 4 m day of the 137cs plume occurred at 150 years fig 6a however in case 2d representing a relatively cold season 2 c the maximum migration rate 3 68 10 4 m day occurred at 240 years the variability in the migration rate of 137cs plumes indicates that temperature effects should be considered to properly assess the long term migration of 137cs and the associated environmental risks moreover the aquifer temperature affects the 137cs desorption from 137cs contaminated adsorbents deposited at the reservoir bottom the amount of desorbed 137cs decreases as the temperature decreases for example the average concentration of the 137cs plume in case 2a desorption rate 20 was 148 5 kbq l at 50 years which decreased to 88 9 kbq l in case 2d desorption rate 5 for a relatively cold aquifer both a low desorption rate and slow groundwater velocity reduce the spread of the 137cs plume fig s3 in fig 6b the amount of cumulative discharged 137cs and annual radioactive dose in cases 2a 2d are plotted the amount of discharged 137cs in cases 2a 2d were 2 61 10 3 9 87 10 4 1 91 10 4 and 2 84 10 5 g after 300 years respectively reflecting the effect of groundwater velocity and desorption rate under different aquifer temperatures the calculated annual radioactive dose in cases 2a 2c exceeded the public dose limit of 1 0 msv y at 130 160 and 220 years and the maximum annual dose was about 13 9 msv y 200 years 5 24 msv y 220 years and 1 27 msv y 250 years respectively however in case 2d the maximum annual dose was approximately 2 54 10 1 msv y 280 years not reaching the public dose limit overall the non isothermal effects on 137cs plume migration were relatively low compared to the effect of kd figs 5 and 6 but they still had substantial effects on the risk of annual radioactive dose fig 6b 5 4 effects of aquifer heterogeneity on 137cs transport fig 7 a shows a representative realization of a heterogeneous k field generated through the sequential gaussian based function proposed by dietrich and newsam 1997 the mean k was equal to that in the base case 8 64 10 2 m day and the variance of ln k was set to 0 9 table 2 meerschaert et al 2013 the horizontal and vertical integral scales were set to 1 0 and 0 1 respectively to represent anisotropic heterogeneity structures in case 3a kd was set to 10 ml g without correlating with heterogeneous k however in case 3b kd varied as a function of k the spatial map of kd calculated using eq 1 is shown in fig 7b and the relationship between k and kd is shown in fig s4 in cases 3c and 3d the mean k was set to 4 32 10 2 m day with adjusted kd 14 ml g and correlated heterogeneous kd respectively fig 8 a d show the migration rates of the 137cs plume calculated from 50 realizations of cases 3a 3d the black lines represent the arithmetic means and the red and pink dotted lines indicate 80 and 95 confidence intervals respectively the mean 137cs migration rates in cases 3a 3d generally increased with time but the migration rates in cases 3a and 3b were approximately 2 5 5 5 times faster than those in cases 3c and 3d due to the difference between average k case 3a 8 64 10 2 m day and case 3c 4 32 10 2 m day and kd case 3a 10 ml g and case 3c 14 ml g table2 the maximum mean migration rate indicated by stars appeared at 250 years in case 3a 2 78 10 4 m day and case 3b 1 88 10 4 m day but the maximum rates in cases 3c and 3d were not reached even after 300 years on investigating individual realization in case 3a the 137cs migration rates showed consistent parabolic trends fig 8a but those in case 3b showed more irregular and wide variations fig 8b the range of confidence intervals in case 3b was also wider than that in case 3a suggesting that the correlated k and kd increased the complexity of 137cs transport in case 3c as the average k reduced by half both the migration rate and its variability decreased fig 8c the mean migration rates of the 137cs plume in cases 3b and 3d reduced by approximately 32 and 24 relative to cases 3a and 3c respectively indicating that an increased kd at low k heterogeneity has a profound effect on 137cs transport in fig 9 a d the annual radioactive doses of discharged 137cs in 50 realizations of cases 3a 3d are plotted where the probability densities of realizations are represented by purple contours the arithmetic means and confidence intervals 80 and 95 are represented by black red dotted and pink dotted lines respectively the lines with purple symbols indicate the average amount of cumulative discharged 137cs at the downstream surface bed similar to the trends of the migration rates fig 8a d the mean annual dose in case 3b was lower than that in case 3a while the range of the confidence intervals slightly increased owing to the effect of correlated k and kd in cases 3a and 3b the mean annual dose reached a maximum of 4 87 10 1 msv y 240 years and 2 75 10 1 msv y 220 years respectively however in cases 3c and 3d an annual dose of only up to 2 89 10 5 and 2 10 10 5 msv y respectively was discharged at 300 years due to the lower 137cs migration rate the probability densities represented by purple contours in fig 9a d appear to have a wide variation the wide variability in probability densities indicates that the behavior of the 137cs plume was primarily governed by local k heterogeneity around the bottom of the cutoff wall fig s5 which is the major flow pathway for the 137cs plume 5 5 effects of fracture network on 137cs transport in case 4 10 realizations delineating discrete fracture networks dfns were developed see section 4 for details of the dfn generation to better resolve fractures the total number of grid blocks was increased to 40 000 with the size of δx and δz set to 0 25 m in addition the cut off wall had the same position and hydraulic properties e g porosity k and kd as in the base case table 2 fig 10 a d show four representative realizations 1 3 5 and 9 of continuum based 2d fractured aquifers obtained by upscaling the dfns using the method of oda 1985 all 10 realizations are shown in fig s6a j case 4 the black arrows with annotated numbers indicate major fractures that could serve as potential pathways for the 137cs plume additionally the corresponding contours of the simulated 137cs plume were delineated over 300 years with the annotated number showing the spatial distribution of the 137cs plume fig 10e h as shown in fig 10a d the distribution and connectivity of fractures were distinctly different even though 10 realizations were developed based on the same fracture statistics the fractures in fn 1 were developed densely at the upstream of the cut off wall fig 10a but those in fn 3 were concentrated downstream fig 10b because of such difference the 137cs plume migrated downstream in fn 1 fig 10e but stagnated upstream in fn 3 fig 10f specifically in fn 1 fractures i and ii at the upstream were oriented below the cut off wall and intersected fractures iii and iv which extended to downstream surface bed fig 10a through these connected fractures the 137cs plume could be effectively transported downstream fig 10e in fn 3 most fractures were distributed at the downstream aquifer and there were no fractures that could serve as a major pathway for the 137cs plume from the upstream reservoir bottom fig 10b without preferential fracture pathways the migration of the 137cs plume was considerably retarded fig 10f in both fn 5 fig 10c and fn 9 fig 10d the fractures were distributed relatively uniformly and randomly throughout the model domain but the fracture orientation and connectivity varied greatly between realizations in fn 5 fractures i ii and iii at the upstream were inclined in the opposite direction to the cut off wall and intersected fractures iv v and vi which extended to the basement formation consequently the 137cs plume preferentially migrated to the basement formation and was not able to efficiently reach downstream fig 10g however in fn 9 fracture networks connect upstream and downstream efficiently and enabled fracture vii to serve as the primary preferential pathway for the 137cs plume fig 10h highlights the importance of fracture orientation and connectivity the simulated migration rates of the 137cs plume for fn 1 10 are plotted in fig 11 a where the annotated numbers indicate the average concentration kbq l of the 137cs plume for the maximum fn 3 and minimum fn 9 cases the migration rate in fn 9 light blue line was notably high 1 08 10 4 m day owing to the well connected fracture network from upstream to downstream the long migration distance of the 137cs plume increased the contact area with the surrounding aquifer media and consequently the concentration of the 137cs plume decreased due to increased sorption in fn 3 orange line the migration rate of the 137cs plume was approximately 3 27 10 5 m day at 50 years and decreased continuously owing to the small contact area the 137cs plume was concentrated upstream in fig 11b the cumulative discharged 137cs g dotted lines and the calculated annual radioactive doses msv y solid lines at downstream surface bed are plotted the cumulative discharged 137cs was the highest 1 98 10 8 g in fn 1 and the lowest 3 55 10 16 g in fn 3 in all realizations the maximum annual radioactive dose was lower than the public dose limit of 1 0 msv y the highest dose was 3 25 10 4 msv y in fn 1 at 300 years the predicted annual dose at downstream surface bed was primarily influenced by the structure of the fracture network for example in fn 9 the migration rate of the 137cs plume was the highest but the radioactive dose was not the highest because the fractures serving as primary pathways for the 137cs plume did not extend to the downstream surface bed fig 10h instead in fn 1 where the fracture was directly connected to the downstream surface bed the radioactive dose was the highest highlighting the importance of fracture orientation and connectivity 5 6 comparative influence of major parameters on 137cs fate and transport the simulation results of the 137cs plume migration in cases 1 4 are summarized in table 3 and the effects of the key parameters on 137cs transport are summarized in fig 12 a d as kd varied from 5 to 50 ml g in cases 1a f fig 12a the maximum migration rate of the 137cs plume and annual dose showed notable decreases in addition the average plume concentration at 50 years decreased with an increasing kd except in case 1a where some of the 137cs plume was discharged to downstream surface bed the effect of temperature conditions in cases 2a d was relatively small fig 12b the maximum migration rates of the 137cs plume increased modestly when the reservoir temperature increased from 2 to 26 c additionally due to the reduced desorption rates at cold temperatures both maximum annual dose and average plume concentrations decreased in cases 3a d the effect of k and kd heterogeneity was evaluated with 50 realizations fig 12c considering the coupled k and kd heterogeneity cases 3b and 3d the maximum migration rates of the 137cs plume and annual dose showed wide variability interestingly the mean of maximum migration rate also decreased in case 3b and 3d indicating that the 137cs plume can be potentially delayed by heterogeneous kd the average plume concentrations increased as the mean k decreased case 3a and 3c but decreased when heterogeneous kd was considered case 3b and 3d finally in case 4 10 realizations of dfns were considered to assess the effects of fracture networks on the transport of the 137cs plume fig 12d although the migration rates up to 1 08 10 4 m day and annual dose up to 3 25 10 4 msv y were relatively low compared to other cases the average plume concentrations 1 073 6 690 7 kbq l showed significant variations owing to the importance of fracture connectivity and orientation overall the simulation results indicate that kd is the most critical parameter controlling the transport of the 137cs plume and demonstrate the importance of k and its correlation with kd although relatively less critical reduced desorption rate at low temperature conditions can also potentially decrease the risk the results in cases 1 and 2 clearly show a proportional trend between the maximum migration rate of 137cs plume and the annual radioactive dose of discharged 137cs under the dominant effect of kd therefore it is possible to predict the annual dose of discharged 137cs by calculating the initial behavior of the 137cs plume however in case 3 the proportional trend is reduced by heterogeneity and in case 4 the characteristic behavior of the 137cs plume depending on fracture geometries makes it difficult to predict the fate of 137cs and highlights the importance of uncertainty quantification these results emphasize the need for countermeasures in early stages such as the installation of additional barriers with high kd the dredge of settling adsorbent and periodic respread of adsorbent during the reservoir remediation process after radiation accidents however credibility of numerical modeling technique is highly dependent on the precision of transport parameters and grid accuracy measured from in situ field experiments allahyari et al 2020 brand et al 1991 luckey and stephens 1987 to evaluate the sensitivity analysis of grid effect additional simulations were conducted with a grid block size of δx δz 0 5 m for all scenarios in case 1 and case 2 and some representative scenarios 14 and 40 in case 3 table s2 although the grid effect was not significant compared to the effects of other parameters mainly discussed in the study figs s8 s9 s10 considering simplified grid models and relevant variables site specific field investigations should be conducted to characterize the uncertainties associated with hydrogeologic geochemical and engineering properties e g hydraulic conductivity characteristics of the cutoff wall head gradient of the aquifer 137cs desorption rate relationship of k and kd and distribution of fracture networks in addition it is necessary to verify the effect of relevant parameters longitudinal and transverse dispersivities change in sorption characteristic with temperature and water level changes over time that were not considered due to the limitations of the model on the 137cs transport for site application verification and validation procedures must be conducted with field and laboratory investigations including the quantitative characterization of important parameters affecting 137cs fate and transport additionally the effects of more complex processes such as the chemical reactions of 137cs and colloid facilitated transport should be considered in future studies 6 conclusion in this study the subsurface behavior of desorbed 137cs and the potential risks for secondary contamination were evaluated the model properties are based on the geological features representing paldang reservoir adjacent to seoul metropolitan city to evaluate the migration properties of 137cs plume and associated human health risk comprehensively various scenarios including a wide range of kd temperature effects reservoir bottom temperature and basal heat flow heterogeneity effects k variability and correlation between k and kd and fractured aquifer properties were investigated the model results indicate that kd is the dominant factor that determines 137cs fate and transport but the effects of temperature also affect the overall plume concentration furthermore k heterogeneity especially the fracture networks leads to significant uncertainties in 137cs transport and associated health risks highlighting the importance of accurately characterizing subsurface fracture distribution the comprehensive numerical assessment of 137cs fate and transport and the estimation of annual radioactive dose elucidated the risk associated with long term secondary contamination through an aquifer below a dam this study shows that the secondary contamination of desorbed 137cs could cause contamination levels above the public dose limit set by the icrp even after long periods of time however given that the study assumed extreme events e g nuclear disasters the assessment of potential human health risks will be greatly affected by uncertainties due to aquifer heterogeneity or fracture network geometry these properties should be assessed as a part of the post accidental radiation safety analyses credit authorship contribution statement jaehyun lee conceptualization methodology software investigation data

2837,this paper aims to review parameters model techniques validation methods in groundwater potential field according to statistics there are three major model groups used to establish groundwater potential maps the first model group is a statistic group including multi criteria decision making analytic hierarchy process frequency ratio evidence belief function and weights of evidence the second model group includes machine learning models such as random forest logistic regression boosted regression tree and support vector machine the final group is the hybrid ensemble models in groundwater potential mapping studies 41 thematic layers affect the potential of groundwater however hydrological researchers have frequently used eight factors in groundwater potential studies geology slope land use soil type drainage density lineament density altitude rainfall most previous studies on groundwater potential have used a combination of geographic information system remote sensing and machine learning techniques to design the groundwater potential in regions of interest data sources are commonly applied to groundwater potential mapping including satellite borehole and geophysical data the accuracy of groundwater potential maps produced by common machine learning models ranges from 50 0 to 90 1 while that produced by common statistical models ranges between 59 0 and 90 3 interestingly hybrid ensemble models accuracy interval ranges from 71 0 to 92 0 therefore the review suggests that statistical algorithms and machine learning techniques should be combined and thematic layers should be increasingly used in mapping groundwater potential maps to achieve high efficiency keywords groundwater potential models geographic information system remote sensing machine learning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is vital for the existence of all life on earth and an essential component of several manufacturing operations in a nation in recent decades freshwater shortages in many regions have demanded research on the sustainable use of water resources chen et al 2020 cheng et al 2019 hou et al 2020 zehtabiyan rezaie et al 2019 based on the effects of weather elements and human activities on these resources the intricate process of climate change has caused widespread drought in many areas of the world dai 2013 rising sea levels have led to salinity intrusion in soil and groundwater in desert and coastal regions chotpantarat et al 2020 howard et al 2010 sae ju et al 2020 shah et al 2001 simultaneously population growth agricultural expansion urbanization and modern industrial activities have created an increasingly large need for freshwater chotpantarat and thamrongsrisakul 2021 francis 2011 mcdonald et al 2011 wilson et al 2006 to reduce freshwater shortages the exploitation and sustainable use of water resources have garnered increasing attention particularly with regard to groundwater the development of groundwater potential gwp maps is becoming increasingly important in many scientific fields and nations chaminé et al 2015 in particular groundwater mapping provides suitable locations for drilling groundwater wells for the purpose of water resource management and agricultural activities ahmed and sajjad 2018 elbeih 2015 simultaneously a groundwater map can reveal the gwp zones of a given region constantly advancing remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis technology has played a vital role in groundwater hydrology in recent decades gis is an appropriate tool for solving the spatial attribute problems in many environmental science fields tiankao and chotpantarat 2018 waiyasusri and chotpantarat 2020 waiyasusri et al 2016 particularly hydrology and hydrogeology the information rs provides for the earth s surface facilitates gwp research in many regions that do not have available data and complex topography chotpantarat et al 2015 konkul et al 2014 in recent years several groundwater studies have utilized rs and gis technology to map gwp zones in their areas of interest some scientists adiat et al 2012 oh et al 2011 oikonomidis et al 2015 ozdemir 2011a have used statistical models such as multi criteria decision analysis mcda analytic hierarchy process ahp frequency ratio fr model evidence belief function ebf and weights of evidence woe other researchers have applied machine learning approaches to analyze calculate and map the gwp zone naghibi et al 2019 ozdemir 2011b rahmati et al 2016 2018 machine learning models are often used in groundwater studies including random forest rf logistic regression lr model boosted regression tree brt and support vector machine svm the purpose of these models is to delineate areas with large groundwater reserves to exploit and reasonably use groundwater although some attempts have been made to develop these models for assessing the gwp for a given region the accuracy of the models is different díaz alcaide and martínez santos 2019 therefore the consideration of gwp mapping models has a significant role in determining the successful location of groundwater wells this not only helps establish wells but also guides the sustainable use of groundwater resources the present paper mainly deals with the following i definition of groundwater potential ii input parameters in groundwater potential studies iii model techniques iv validation techniques and v current status and challenges for groundwater potential mapping research in the future 2 definition of groundwater potential previous literature reviews indicate that the definition of gwp is a general concept depending on the purpose of each research some researchers andermann et al 2012 fischer et al 2003 rodell et al 2007 yeh et al 2006 have focused on groundwater storage while others batte et al 2008 janakarajan and moench 2006 nampak et al 2014 have analyzed the groundwater yield in an area from a storage perspective gwp is defined as the total amount of water in aquifers that can be stored for a long time kebede 2013 considering the yield gwp is the quantity of groundwater that may be extracted from a groundwater aquifer without surpassing the long term recharge or the chemical and physical integrity of the basin greer 2008 in addition to the above aspects groundwater quality is also used to delineate gwp zones for different purposes hounsinou 2020 considered the extent of saline intrusion of seawater to set the gwp boundaries dhar et al 2015 defined the gwp zones by overlaying the gwp and groundwater quality indexes consequently the definition of gwp is not a specific concept to use uniformly worldwide the usage of groundwater storage or yield to define gwp remains controversial because they ignore factors such as groundwater quality aquifer properties sensitivity contamination and its intended use the definition of gwp based on the knowledge of the authors can be stated as follows groundwater potential is the volume of groundwater that can be withdrawn from an aquifer for a particular purpose without affecting the groundwater yield and groundwater quality of an aquifer 3 number of publications in groundwater potential field the study area statistics around the world provide hydrologists with a general picture of gwp research it shows the level of interest in groundwater reserves in different parts of the world it is the basis for international organizations to select and implement projects related to the conservation of global groundwater resources in this section information regarding the number of research papers on gwp and other parameters is presented the content includes information about the number of national studies the information given in fig 1 was collected from two reliable sources namely scopus and web of science with keywords groundwater potential year applied by the title abstract and keywords search functions a total of 872 and 707 articles were found in scopus and web of science in this field from 2010 to 2020 respectively overall the number of articles related to gwp map research has remarkably increased in this period fig 1 with 87 countries of interest according to authors fig 2 fig 2 also shows the level of interest by hydrologists regarding gwp worldwide over the past decade india iran and nigeria had a high number of publications in this research field only a small number of relevant studies have been conducted in the rest of the countries fig 2 fig 3 shows the top 10 journals of scopus and web of science systems selected by authors for publication between 2010 and 2020 in which environmental earth sciences and arabian journal of geosciences had the highest publication 4 parameters model techniques and validation in groundwater potential studies the dataset related to this study is compiled from two sources namely scopus and web of science and conducted as shown in fig 4 the first step involves searching the literature a total of 872 publications on scopus and 707 publications on web of science are related to gwp the second step is cross referencing literature between the two systems using doi and the title of papers a total of 1085 publications were found in the gwp field from 2010 to 2020 the third step is the calculation of the number of representative samples using slovin s formula marendra and tangahu 2020 eq 1 1 n n 1 n e 2 where n is the total of 1085 publications e is the error margin 0 1 and n is the number of representative samples the fourth step is setting the dataset a total of 91 publications are selected for this study based on the citation index from high to low table 1 the final step is reviewing the content on parameters models and validation techniques this step is the most time consuming procedure in the research process 4 1 input parameters in groundwater potential studies gwp studies are generally developed on the basis of climate geology hydrology land cover topography and aquifer related data a total of 41 input parameters are related to the identification of groundwater rich areas fig 5 the number of input parameters necessary to establish the gwp map is different in each study this number ranges from 2 to 17 parameters input parameters are the required information of a gwp model these parameters provide databases related to gwp and are the basis for model application the frequency of input parameters used in gwp studies is depicted in fig 5 these data are usually extracted from conventional data existing maps remote sensing and survey eight common factors including geology slope land use soil type drainage density dd fault lineament density altitude and rainfall with a usage frequency larger than 50 are available in gwp studies during 2010 2020 4 1 1 topographic related parameters topographic related parameters are factors that describe the topographical features of a study area the frequently used topographic parameters in gwp research include the following slope slope aspect altitude topographic wetness index twi slope length curvature plan curvature profile curvature stream power index sediment transport index geomorphology distance to roads convergence index relative slope position terrain ruggedness index flow direction and relief furthermore five topographic related parameters namely slope slope aspect altitude twi and slope length were widely utilized in most gwp studies fig 5 slope controls the percolation of water into the soil ali et al 2015 magesh et al 2012 proved that a gentle slope means that surface water has less residence time on the ground this leads to water having more time to seep into the ground whereas a high slope increases flow speed and erosion and therefore rainwater does not have sufficient time to infiltrate areas with low slopes have negative surface runoff and positive percolation rates whereas areas with high slopes usually have high amounts of soil runoff and fast meteoric water evacuation by direct hitting water or rainfall adiat et al 2012 concluded that groundwater recharge depends on the surface flow velocity and vertical percolation controlled by slope degree naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 indicated that the slope aspect also affects hydrological processes because it determines rainfall direction moisture plant growth and snow melting tahmassebipoor et al 2016 determined that groundwater is often limited at high altitudes and abundant at low elevations rahmati et al 2016 applied twi to measure the amount of runoff accumulation at any place in a basin gwp partly explains a strong inverse correlation between the twi index and groundwater yield naghibi et al 2017a indicated that the possibility of soil loss also impacts gwp which is calculated on the basis of slope length gwp is also high when the slop length value is low overall topographic related parameters control permeability surface flow direction and number of precipitations seeping into the soil in the last decade the growth of the aerospace industry has greatly contributed to many scientific fields digital elevation models dems are useful for determining the topography of a certain area agarwal and garg 2016 pradhan et al 2020 rajasekhar et al 2019 dem is usually taken from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm arkoprovo et al 2012 nanda et al 2017 prasad et al 2020 or aster sensors mosavi et al 2020 sachdeva and kumar 2020 waikar and nilawar 2014 and stored in a raster format topographic data are normally extracted from digital elevation information 4 1 2 geological related parameters geological related parameters are commonly accepted to govern the potential of groundwater in gwp mapping studies distance to faults geology lineaments lineament density and relative permeability factors are classified among the geological group ozdemir 2011b among these factors geology is the first aspect chosen by researchers in building a gwp model followed by lineament density fig 5 this selection is understandable because differences in lithologies structure folds and faults result in changes in the strength and permeability of soil and rock ozdemir 2011b geology plays a significant role in finding water underground this factor has been mentioned in many groundwater studies from a geological perspective groundwater exists in the fractures and voids of consolidated rock as well as in the porosity of unconsolidated sediment therefore gwp research considers the water retention condition of the geological features such as weathered products source rocks and unconsolidated or consolidated sediments xie et al 2014 according to termeh et al 2019 hydraulic conductivity porosity and groundwater flow of an aquifer are dominated by lithology features assatse et al 2016 pointed out that unconsolidated sediment rocks usually have large gaps facilitating the existence and movement of water areas of unconsolidated sediment rock have high gwp in addition some consolidated sediment rocks are also deemed beneficial for groundwater storage consolidated sediment rocks are normally sandstone and limestone assatse et al 2016 in contrast some rock types such as metamorphic rock and volcanic rocks are not generally considered adequate materials for good gwp thus geological structure determines the existence of groundwater in a given region to collect geological data most groundwater studies have utilized field surveys bagyaraj et al 2019 or are based on a geologic map zabihi et al 2016 in addition to geological features lineaments are also a preferential option in gwp studies lineaments which are surficial expressions of faults are an expression of underlying geological structures additionally lineaments occur in the forms of fractures lithological limits and fault zones on the ground lineaments often appear in mountainous areas or straight coastlines adiat et al 2012 martha et al 2013 rahmati et al 2015 veeraswamy 2020 in the past lineaments were usually extracted from geology and topography maps moore and waltz 1983 o leary et al 1976 however more recently the development of space science and aerial data such as radar landsat etm enhanced thematic mapper and aster dem digital elevation model has allowed the collection of lineaments from satellite photographs das et al 2018 hashim et al 2013 mwaniki et al 2015 akinluyi et al 2018 demonstrated that gwp is influenced by lineaments elements belonging to lineaments such as foliation fractures and faults are commonly used to find suitable groundwater exploitation locations the factors related to lineament such as distance to faults and lineament density represent the relationship between surface and subsurface water flow through water mobility and infiltration termeh et al 2019 abdalla 2012 argued that the occurrence of faults is a good condition for groundwater recharge especially in hard rock locations indeed the fractures joints and lineaments act as a conduit which strengthens the connection between surface water and groundwater a fault zone can act as a conduit for vertical subsurface flow or as a barrier for horizontal flow thus making gwp poor bense and person 2006 lineament density reflects the groundwater phenomenon under the earth s surface high lineament density corresponds to high secondary porosity haridas et al 1998 hence aquifers and aquitards are quickly recharged through water infiltration concurrently groundwater movement and retention may be calculated via lineament density as such lineament data are used as an indispensable part of finding water potential underground the first lineament data were explored in a groundwater study carried out by lattman and parizek 1964 subsequently many researchers have applied this approach to complex terrain areas abijith et al 2020 al ruzouq et al 2019 ali et al 2015 ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 kamali maskooni et al 2020 4 1 3 hydrological related parameters hydrological related parameters play a vital role in delineating gwp zones of a given region river density distance to rivers drainage dd distance to drainage and net recharge are hydrological related parameters in gwp among these parameters dd and distance to rivers were more commonly used than other hydrological factors fig 5 rahmati et al 2016 reported that gwp groundwater recharge and hydrogeological systems are affected by hydrological parameters high groundwater productivity is rarely found in low river density areas that are far from rivers streams and surface water chen et al 2018 indicated that surface water sources are the primary recharging sources which affect the formation capability of groundwater springs in addition to river related factors drainage related factors also affect the gwp of an area dd represents the drainage capacity of a basin based on the length of water flow bagyaraj et al 2013 martínez santos and renard 2020 singh et al 2013 dd represents residence times of groundwater das 2019 where a high dd implies a large water loss capability and vice versa arkoprovo et al 2012 dd is expressed by the presence of flows on the earth s surface such as rivers and streams the numbers of rivers are often distributed more in delta regions than in hill regions mukherjee et al 2012 dd has been directly designated as gwp the greater this value the higher the gwp nasir et al 2018 according to strahler 1964 dd is calculated by the overall length of rivers and outflows in a given locality divided by the total surface area of the locality according to moglen et al 1998 source rock and climate features determine the shape of stream systems areas with a hydrology system with short and scattered rivers have a high gwp and vice versa ghosh et al 2016 observed the inverse correlation of dd and permeability the zones of high dd are associated with decreased permeability and significant surface runoff therefore the gwp in these zones is low the length factor of river and flow systems directly affects the dd of a region in addition to the length of the flow system other factors also impact dd including lithology runoff vegetation cover and infiltration therefore dd is a necessary element in groundwater studies konkul et al 2014 it is regarded as an index of groundwater recharge gupta and srivastava 2010 mandal et al 2016 mosavi et al 2020 thapa et al 2018 similar to the slope dd is usually extracted from dem data typically aster gde and srtm 1 arc second global satellite images with a spatial resolution of 30 m using arcgis 10 5 software bagyaraj et al 2013 ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 waikar and nilawar 2014 4 1 4 climatic related parameters climatic related parameters play a significant role in groundwater formation in the last decade gwp models have considered precipitation and surface temperature as determining factors in the gwp in a study area elewa and qaddah 2011 mallick et al 2015 razandi et al 2015 shekhar and pandey 2015 rainfall is a significant factor affecting groundwater recharge mukherjee et al 2012 owor et al 2009 shekhar and pandey 2015 and its occurrence gumma and pavelic 2013 mosavi et al 2020 mukherjee et al 2012 nguyen et al 2020 pham et al 2019 in a study area in some hydrological studies abijith et al 2020 klongvessa et al 2018 martínez santos and renard 2020 razandi et al 2015 suganthi et al 2013 thapa et al 2018 rainfall is also a factor that influences the recharge capacity of an area precipitation contributes a large amount of water to aquifers and aquitards through subsurface infiltration systems as the rainfall increases the groundwater level also rises chotpantarat et al 2014 shekhar and pandey 2015 the groundwater recharge potential is generally higher in the rainy season than in the dry season thus increasing groundwater level konkul et al 2014 wisittammasri and chotpantarat 2016 this finding shows that precipitation is the water supply source for groundwater agarwal and garg 2016 in addition to the precipitation factor mallick et al 2015 also utilized the surface temperature factor in the gwp study they assumed that the heat signatures of the earth s surface help discover gwp based on specific heat for example dry soil has a lower heat capacity than saturated soil the surface temperature was usually calculated from satellite imagery mallick et al 2015 4 1 5 land cover related parameters land use soil type soil depth and ndvi are assigned to the land cover related group in the present study fig 5 reveals that land use and soil type are the two commonly used land cover factors by hydrologists in the past decade land use describes the various land use units of humans on the earth s surface which presents the domination of recharge rate and groundwater usage chen et al 2018 therefore land use plays a major role in groundwater exploitation and usage bagyaraj et al 2019 dar et al 2010 mandal et al 2016 mukherjee et al 2012 waikar and nilawar 2014 zones affected by urbanization and agricultural activities often require the exploitation of large amounts of groundwater odeh et al 2019 other zones such as forests and water bodies are rarely intervened by humans lone et al 2013 consequently human interference directly affects groundwater storage and recharge capacity chen et al 2018 reported that each land use type has a difference in water permeability built up hard rock and bare land areas have lower permeability than vegetation areas each land use type impacts groundwater retention differently based on evapotranspiration soil erosion and runoff chotpantarat and boonkaewwan 2018 saravanan et al 2018 the land use factor is routinely developed through aerial imagery and field surveys avtar et al 2010 basavaraj and nijagunappa 2011 magesh et al 2012 mandal et al 2016 shekhar and pandey 2015 soil type directly affects groundwater infiltration sun et al 2018 and is a necessary part of defining groundwater recharge oh et al 2011 mollinedo et al 2015 reported that a region s water holding capacity depends on the type texture and depth of soil díaz alcaide and martínez santos 2019 indicated that gravelly and sandy soils are high percolation materials whereas silty and clayey soils allow the least infiltration meanwhile moderate infiltration is related to loamy soils and fine sand soil data are typically collected from available soil maps prepared by the land management department of a nation agarwal and garg 2016 kumar et al 2016 oh et al 2011 pinto et al 2017 ndvi is also an indicator used in forecasting groundwater storage and aquifer production of a study area chen et al 2018 naghibi et al 2017b nampak et al 2014 areas with a high ndvi index reflect better gwp than those with a low ndvi index nampak et al 2014 ndvi data are usually computed from satellite imagery sources in previous studies 4 1 6 aquifer related parameters in addition to geological related factors for the formation of consolidated unconsolidated aquifers the other characteristics of aquifers such as aquifer thickness aquifer resistivity artesian pressure groundwater depth and groundwater quality also influence gwp in the groundwater study the thickness of an aquifer also aids in defining potential zones which is demonstrated through the thickness of weathered materials razandi et al 2015 shekhar and pandey 2015 indicated that areas with thick weathering have more groundwater than those with thin weathering because groundwater is prevalent at the base of the weathered zone wherein rocks have broken down into sand size and large fragments in addition to aquifer thickness aquifer resistivity is also used to determine gwp in some studies aizebeokhai et al 2010 jha et al 2010 muchingami et al 2012 a high resistivity value indicates low gwp and vice versa muchingami et al 2012 from the viewpoint of the aquifer classification confined unconfined artesian pressure is also a decisive factor in determining potential locations of groundwater the confined aquifers occur in wide and thick permeable formations with low artesian pressure which yields low amounts of groundwater whereas the aquifer systems occur in thin permeable formations with high pressure thus yielding appreciable amounts of groundwater da lio et al 2013 groundwater depth is also one of the key indicators in determining the gwp of a well or borehole location a large groundwater depth results in a large gwp machiwal et al 2011 in addition groundwater quality reflects the gwp of an area oikonomidis et al 2015 used nitrate concentration in groundwater and gwp index to delineate gwp and non gwp zones for domestic uses in central greece in the region of thessaly their results indicated that groundwater in the karst area has good storage and low nitrate concentration considering a good gwp zone by contrast groundwater in the agricultural activity regions with high nitrate concentration is considered a poor gwp zone despite its high yield gopinath et al 2019 indicated that the intrusion of seawater in eastern coastal india increases dissolved mineral concentrations such as sodium and chloride in aquifers due to intensive pumping rates this phenomenon reduces gwp in areas facing seawater intrusion problems furthermore chotpantarat et al 2020 used hydrochemical characteristics including the stable isotopes 18o and 2h to assess the origin of the groundwater and applied principal component analysis to determine sources of nitrate contamination in phetchaburi province thailand their result showed that nitrate concentration mainly originated from the agricultural regions reducing the gwp area in this region boonkaewwan et al 2021 investigated the mechanisms of arsenic as release in coastal alluvial aquifers in rayong province thailand they found that arsenite as3 is mainly released in the deep coastal aquifer groundwater due to reducing conditions thus groundwater treatment is necessary for some areas before drinking as previously mentioned in addition to the groundwater quantity the assessment of the gwp area should also consider groundwater quality 4 2 model techniques approximately 59 of the 91 publications table 1 used a model or method to develop and assess gwp the remaining 31 used two or more models the current study classified the models into three main groups statistical machine learning and hybrid ensemble models fig 6 the model categorization was complicated and many revisions were made until the final categorization was realized this categorization was subjective and based on expert judgment fig 6 shows the information regarding the popularity of models used in 91 publications the database of this study revealed the use of 60 models from 2010 to 2020 the figure is considerably large models mcda ahp fr ebf woe are the models with the most occurrences in the statistical group while rf lr brt svm models are used a lot in machine learning group in this section the study looks into the characteristics and roles of these popular models 4 2 1 common statistical models 4 2 1 1 multi criteria decision analysis analytical hierarchy process mcda ahp model mcdm ahp is a model that uses associated factors to assess a problem saha 2017 the related factors are assigned a weight corresponding to their importance in observing issues kumar et al 2016 the mcdm ahp analyzes the weight of related factors to the main variable the variables in this model are compared considering their effect on each other on a scale of 1 9 the mcdm ahp model aids hydrogeologists in identifying and decentralizing groundwater influencing factors in the gwp field the advantages of this method lie in its fast results and minimal errors in choosing well locations in addition the mcdm ahp model permits the modification of the factor weight to satisfy different areas however the mcdm ahp model depends on the opinion of experts in setting the criteria weight thus the model result is subjective singh et al 2018 the mcdm ahp model is often combined with gis tools verifying the geographical regions that agree with gwp conditions the mcdm ahp model is typically used to evaluate gwp comprising the following four steps step 1 establishing the factors related to the gwp and creating an important hierarchy for factors step 2 classifying and comparing the factors influencing groundwater step 3 calculating the weighted value of the influencing factors step 4 validating the consistency of the pair comparisons in the mcdm ahp influence factors are combined into an indicator to evaluate outputs andualem and demeke 2019 in recent years hydrological studies have commonly applied the mcdm ahp model elmahdy and mohamed 2014 delineated gwp zones using the ahp model in the al dhaid area united arab emirates the model was successful in integrating thematic layers and assessing their weights selvam et al 2015 created gwp and recharged zones in the tuticorin districts of tamil nadu india using the mcdm technique the variables used included soil precipitation slope drainage lithology land use and lineaments where lithology and land use were integrated with the highest weight jenifer and jha 2017 used the mcda ahp model for mapping gwp zones in the state of tamil nadu of india based on the assigned weights of thematic layers according to the suggestion of experts the ahp model provided accurate predictions the groundwater yield was applied to test the validity of the ahp model andualem and demeke 2019 incorporated the mcdm technique and gis technology to delineate the gwp zones in upper blue nile basin ethiopia the thematic layers were assigned on the basis of the standardization with effective potential the results indicated that gwp was categorized into the following five zones excellent very good moderate poor and very poor potential fields simultaneously arabameri et al 2019 found that the ahp model was more effective than the random forest model by using yield data and thematic layers to assess gwp 4 2 1 2 frequency ratio fr model the fr model is applied mainly in landslide research this model is utilized to assess and predict the landslide locations in a given region choi et al 2012 jaafari et al 2014 pradhan 2010 in recent years some hydrogeologists have used the fr model to research groundwater resources falah et al 2017 guru et al 2017 mousavi et al 2017 termeh et al 2019 the fr model is a bivariate statistical algorithm used to compute the occurrence probability rate of a factor razandi et al 2015 thus the fr ratio is the rate of non occurrence or occurrence of a given characteristic regarding advantages the fr is a simple method used to compute the probabilistic connection between the environmental factors and gwp this method helps discover the spatial correlations between gwp and environmental factors and simplifies the quantification and comprehension of each environmental factor by the model the fr model is directly employed in a gis oh et al 2011 and its outcomes are uncomplicated falah et al 2017 however the fr model depends on the technique related elements the adjustment of input parameters will impact the output map oh et al 2011 in reality the construction of the fr model is conducted on the basis of the observed interactions between each groundwater conditioning factor and the distribution of groundwater well spring sites in the last decade many studies have conducted gwp maps utilizing the fr model ozdemir 2011b discovered that the fr model was better estimators than weights of evidence woe and logistic regression lr in mapping gwp in the sultan mountains turkey oh et al 2011 used the fr model to create the gwp map in the area of pohang city korea they surveyed 83 well locations the well points at 55 locations were used for training the model and the well points at 28 locations were selected for the model test the training cases were utilized to predict the groundwater appearance availability based on thematic layers including soil lineament geology and topography data their result indicated that soil texture had the most impact on gwp whereas ground elevation had the least impact razandi et al 2015 compared the efficiency of the fr ahp and gradient boosted decision tree dt models in varamin plain iran with the areas under the curves aucs of 77 55 73 47 and 65 08 respectively guru et al 2017 applied the fr to explore the impact of six factors i e dd lineament density geology slope geomorphology and land use on groundwater level the prediction rate of the fr model was 77 23 according to razavi termeh et al 2020 the fr model was used to create the groundwater spring potential map in alborz iran they surveyed 339 springs springs at 238 locations were used for training the model and springs at 101 locations were selected for the model test the training cases were utilized to predict the groundwater appearance availability based on thematic layers including land cover lithology dd fault density topographic wetness index plan curvature slope direction altitude soil precipitation distance from the river distance from the fault profile curvature slope length and slope angle 4 2 1 3 evidential belief function ebf model the ebf is a bivariate statistic model based on the combination rule to determine spatial integration naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 the structure of an ebf model includes degree of plausibility pls degree of uncertainty unc degree of disbelief dis and degree of belief bel nampak et al 2014 the pls and bel are respectively upper and lower levels of belief with a basic probability assignment function the unc is equal to pls bel which is a lack of understanding evidence of a proposition the dis is a value of 1 pls that ranges from 0 to 1 which is the belief of a false proposition the relative flexibility of ebf is used in the gwp study to admit uncertainty of spring occurrence from the available evidence naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 however the fr requires a considerable amount of information to reduce uncertainty recent gwp projects indicate that the ebf provides a reasonable solution for conceptual methods oh et al 2011 applied the ebf model to investigate groundwater productivity at langat basin area malaysia the input database included the potential of 12 environmental factors rainfall soil ndvi land use lineament density lithology dd twi spi curvature slope and elevation the main goal was to delineate groundwater productivity zonation and demonstrate the value of the ebf model naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 compared the performance of the ebf to that of the boosted regression tree brt cart random forest rf and glm models using land use lithology fault density river density distance to faults distance to rivers twi spi slope length profile curvature plan curvature elevation slope aspect and slope angle as the environmental factors to map gwp in chaharmahal e bakhtiari province iran the assessment output indicated that the performance of the ebf was the lowest among the models tahmassebipoor et al 2016 investigated the gwp with the ebf and woe approaches the input factors were utilized as precipitation lineament density slope percent twi curvature elevation dd soil texture distance from river land use and lithology the result showed that the auc of the ebf and woe was 83 7 and 78 2 respectively kordestani et al 2019 simulated gwp in chaharmahal e bakhtiari province iran by combining the ebf and the brt namely the ebf brt model the inputs included topographical and hydrogeological factors the results revealed that the ebf brt was more accurate than the ebf in another research project termeh et al 2019 compared the anfis ga genetic algorithm anfis bbo anfis sa simulated annealing fr ebf and entropy models for predicting gwp in booshehr plain iran they concluded that the anfis ga had superior performance to other models 4 2 1 4 weights of evidence woe model the woe technique is a method that uses phenomena and events to prove a hypothesis al abadi 2015 falah et al 2017 oikonomidis et al 2015 ozdemir 2011a this method evaluates the weight of variables based on the probability of a phenomenon or event occurring on each variable this model is derived from the weight of evidence method used in bayesian statistics in gwp studies the woe estimates the weight for the absence or presence of each subclass of environmental factors based on the absence or presence of representative parameters such as groundwater yield and spring well borehole occurrence within a given region al abadi 2015 falah et al 2017 oikonomidis et al 2015 tahmassebipoor et al 2016 the advantages and disadvantages of the woe lists are as follows on the one hand the woe helps eliminate the subjectivity of weight and easily sets up the gwp maps on the other hand the woe depends on the number of conditioning variables to set the weight of evidence and require the independence of data input tahmassebipoor et al 2016 therefore a requirement for studies using the woe is to determine the accurate number of input variables which helps obtain the correct weight of variables in the model while researching groundwater productivity potential mapping lee et al 2012 analyzed the correlation of hydrogeological factors with specific capacity spc and transmissivity t data spc and t were collected at 83 and 81 well locations in pohang city south korea respectively spc and t data were subdivided in a 70 30 ratio to train and validate the output they concluded that the woe model s accuracy was 71 20 the map was generated by the woe model with relatively accurate groundwater resource exploration al abadi 2015 applied the woe model to demarcate gwp in the missan and wasit governorates iraq this study utilized data from 143 borehole locations and eight variables affecting gwp including depth of borehole aquifer type distance to faults distance to roads lu geology slope and altitude the results of the gwp map were divided into areas with very high potential 15 areas with high potential 23 areas with medium potential 32 and areas with low potential 30 falah et al 2017 investigated the capabilities of the woe gam fr and si with different combinations of land use soil lithology distance to faults fault density topographic wetness index distance to rivers dd slope aspect slope angle plan curvature altitude and 6439 springs to predict gwp in lorestan province iran their results showed that the accuracy of the gwp delineation map from the woe was lower than that of other models chen et al 2018 developed a novel ensemble woe with lr and functional tree models to map groundwater spring potential in shaanxi province of china they found that the ensemble model is more satisfactory compared with individual models falah and zeinivand 2019 applied the woe model to compare it with an fr model in the assessment of groundwater distribution in lorestan province iran they used 212 springs in which 140 springs were training datasets and 72 springs were test data their output data showed that the predictions of the woe model are less accurate than those of the fr model 4 2 2 common machine learning models 4 2 2 1 random forest rf model the random forest rf is a predictive model that uses many dts to forecast the appearance of an event in which each dt is generated from resampling in 2001 breiman 2001 was the first author to apply the rf algorithm to classify his data then the rf was further developed and utilized in many science fields according to rodriguez galiano et al 2014 regression trees and classification trees could be considered part of the rf model a regression tree mission involves determining the limitation characteristics and conditions for the formation of a node in a dt while the function of the classification tree is to classify the data that have not been previously categorized into appropriate groups or classes the rf model yields very high accuracy results but does not show the operating algorithms because of the complex structure of this model rodriguez galiano et al 2014 the output of rf can be classification or regression the rf has pros and cons compared with other machine learning models regarding advantages the rf can work with complex data decrease the overfitting and variance issues and is remarkably stable meanwhile the disadvantages of the rf lie in its large and powerful computer resource requirement long training process and its assignment of the number of variables and trees in the model in the area of gwp with the rf zabihi et al 2016 assessed two gwp maps created with rf and mars for boujnordm north khorasan iran fourteen explanatory factors and 234 spring locations including 176 cases were applied to train the model and 58 locations were employed to create the gwp the result showed that the auc of rf is lower than the auc of mars similarly golkarian et al 2018 compared the rf c 50 and mars in forecasting gwp in mashhad razavi khorasan province iran the input variables were lithology land use faults density rivers density distance to faults distance to rivers slope length twi profile curvature plan curvature slope angle slope aspect and elevation their outcome indicated that the rf had an accuracy lower than mars and higher than the c5 0 naghibi et al 2018 compared the knn ann pda qda lda support vector machine svm mars brt and rf models for gwp assessment in iran lithology land use fault density river density distance from faults distance from rivers twi spi slope length slope curvature plan curvature slope aspect and altitude were utilized as the input factors of these models they indicated that the rf was the best among all models in mapping gpw and four factors with the most impact on gwp included profile curvature plan curvature slope and elevation naghibi et al 2019 simulated gwp by using the rf cart brt ebftm and rtf they used 13 input factors including lithology land use fault density distance from faults river density distance from rivers twi slope length profile curvature plan curvature altitude slope aspect and slope angle and 273 spring locations they concluded that the ebftm had the highest performance followed by the rf pham et al 2019 indicated that the rf was a useful model for predicting groundwater spring potential hence the maps created by this model could be advantageous for groundwater resource exploration and management 4 2 2 2 logistic regression lr model the lr model is commonly used in research on water issue prediction this model has recently been developed in other groundwater related areas such as ground subsidence oh et al 2011 and potential groundwater springs nampak et al 2014 ozdemir 2011a rahmati et al 2018 the lr is a regression model that finds the correlation between independent and dependent parameters to create the coefficient nguyen et al 2020 the result of the lr is only 0 or 1 binary model the lr is helpful in gwp studies to predict groundwater absence or presence via spring non spring specific yield parameters similar to other machine learning models the lr has the advantages of simplicity and linearity and is reliable in data training the disadvantage of the lr is easily gotten overfitting as the number of features is higher than that of observation additionally the lr requires the dependent variable that must be the discrete number set and cannot process non linear problems ozdemir 2011a created a groundwater spring potential map gwsp for the sultan mountains turkey integrating an lr model with the gis environment the validation of the research surveyed 440 springs and 17 spring related variables the authors reported that this was the first study on gwp using an lr approach to identify potential regions of groundwater the coefficient of 17 spring related variables was calculated using the binary lr method the results show that the lr model is a suitable tool to estimate gwsp in a given region nampak et al 2014 compared the lr and the ebf in predicting gwp in malaysia s langat river catchment they considered precipitation soil type ndvi land use lineament density lithology dd twi spi curvature slope and elevation as input factors and concluded that the ebf outperformed the lr rahmati et al 2018 used the lr with the dt to map gwp in khorasan province iran and compared it with the svm and c4 5 models the inputs to the models were ci slope tpi twi rsp stream density distance from stream lithology distance to fault aspect and elevation the results indicated that the lr had the highest auc value followed by the svm and c4 5 models zandi et al 2016 applied the lr to map gwp they used 38 springs to train the model with mean precipitation land use relative fault density fault distance petrology and slope after the training the output map was tested through the auc value they concluded that the lr was an effective model in mapping gwp from the results land use was the environmental factor that impact the highest on gwp martínez santos and renard 2020 successfully demonstrated the efficiency of the lr model in the bauole sub catchment mali using precipitation land use soil ndvi twi slope dd lithology proximity to surface water lineament density and lineaments and 1848 borehole yields 4 2 2 3 boosted regression tree brt model the brt is a combination model between the boosting method and the dt algorithm the brt operates by combining and fitting many dts based on the boosting method to improve the predictive performance the output of brt is an average model from many approximate rules but boosting is conducted in a stepwise procedure nampak et al 2014 the application of brt in gwp mapping is compatible with classification and regression of a spring non spring location or groundwater yield in a given region mousavi et al 2017 naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 nampak et al 2014 considering its advantages and disadvantages the brt can work with numerical and categorical data reduce overfitting and optimize the different loss functions however the real time database process of the brt is long because of the large number of trees and the output can be outliers naghibi et al 2016 compared the performance of the brt to that of the cart rf and ebftm in the spatial modeling of gwp they used 864 spring locations to train and validate these models according to the rate of 70 30 the input factors included fault density dd land use geology distance to faults distance to rivers profile curvature plan curvature slope length twi altitude slope aspect and slope degree their result showed that the brt was a good model in predicting gwp with an auc value of 0 898 mousavi et al 2017 used the brt and the fr to delineate gwp zones in the mashhad plain iran lithology land use fault density river density distance to rivers distance from faults twi slope length profile curvature plan curvature elevation slope aspect and slope degree were applied as input factors both models demonstrated satisfactory performances their results showed that twi had the largest impact on predicting gwp followed by elevation and distance to rivers al abadi 2017 compared the brt with fr and the ant miner algorithm in assessing gwp in the euphrates river basin iraq the slope profile curvature plain curvature twi spi distance to rivers distance to faults altitude lithology and aquifer type were used as the input data of these models the result indicated that the gwp map from the ant miner algorithm was more accurate than that from the brt and the fr kim et al 2019 investigated the capabilities of the brt rf and lr in predicting specific capacity and transmissivity of groundwater productivity in the okcheon gun south korea by using the inputs of plan curvature convergence index tri depth of groundwater distance from channel network distance to faults lineament density drainage basin slope length twi valley depth relative slope soil type land use and geology their results showed that applying the brt rf and lr with specific capacity and transmissivity had high accuracy 4 2 2 4 support vector machine svm model the svm is a statistical learning model for regression and classification tasks to determine a hyperplane for training data rahmati et al 2018 the svm comprises sigmoid kernels radial basis function polynomial and linear rahmati et al 2018 in the gwp the svm considers the environmental factors as the variable and the validation factors groundwater yield specific capacity and spring non spring as the class label the optimal separating hyperplane helps classify the training data into subsets or classes 1 1 lee et al 2018 naghibi et al 2017a 2018 sameen et al 2019 the advantage of the svm lies in its effective operation in high dimensional spaces and in cases where the number of samples is lower than that of dimensions however the svm underperforms when the dataset is large and the noise is substantial naghibi et al 2017a tested four different svm models along with the random forest genetic algorithm optimized rfga and the rf to create the gwp maps in ardebil province iran the environmental factors included lithology land use faults density distance to faults rivers density distance from rivers twi spi profile curvature plan curvature slope aspect slope angle and elevation svml yielded the best result among different svms however the performance of all svm models was lower than the rf and the rfga lee et al 2018 compared the ann and svm for gwp prediction in boryeong city korea they used 27 hydrogeological factors to predict groundwater yield and spc their results revealed that the ann was better than the svm in performance however the svm was proposed as a time effective gwp tool guzman et al 2019 investigated gw for agricultural activities in the southeastern usa they considered evapotranspiration precipitation and groundwater level data as model input their results concluded that the svr was better than the ann sameen et al 2019 applied the rf svm ann dt slrf and voted ann rf to map gwp the applied data included geology profile curvature twi sti spi elevation aspect slope curvature plan curvature distance to stream land use and tri and 85 wells with different groundwater yields to train and test these models the comparison between the rf svm ann dt self learning random forest slrf and voted ann rf for gwp mapping indicated that the slrf was the most suitable model panahi et al 2020 applied the svm with grid search and genetic algorithms to forecast gwp in the ajloun and jerash provinces jordan the models were applied to improve the predictive performance in gwp using environmental factors including ndvi lithology land use rainfall distance to faults slope length soil type spi distance to drainage twi curvature altitude aspect and slope angle their results indicated that applying the svm with the genetic algorithm demonstrated more accuracy than the svm with the grid search 4 2 3 hybrid ensemble models the evolution of computer science gis and remote sensing has helped models overcome the disadvantages and improve predictive performance combined or hybrid models have commonly been used in gwp studies in recent years the combination of statistical methods and machine learning not only solves data problems but also boosts the predictive productivity of gwp additionally the integration of parametric and nonparametric structures from different sources of knowledge is a strong point of the hybrid ensemble models this finding has been demonstrated in many recent gwp studies using hybrid ensemble models khosravi et al 2018 delineated gwp zones in the koohdasht nourabad plain in iran by integrating anfis with metaheuristic optimization algorithms they used lithology soil type rainfall land use distance from river distance from fault tri twi spi plan curvature elevation and slope as input data iwo de fa pso and ba algorithms were applied to optimize the anfis their result revealed that the anfis de demonstrated the best model performance termeh et al 2019 proposed a combination between sa bbo and ga techniques and anfis to optimize the gwp map the relevant input factors include land use soil rainfall lithology distance to rivers fault density distance to faults dd twi profile curvature plan curvature slope length slope aspect slope angle and altitude a total of 339 wells were divided with a scale of 70 30 to train and validate these models the ga was found to be superior to the sa and bbo method as combined with anfis for improving the performance of the gwp map these models also indicated that rainfall soil and land use were important factors for gwp in the booshehr plain iran pham et al 2019 investigated the gwp in the vadodara district india by developing hybrid models based on decision stump ds rf mb and bg their database included 34 groundwater wells slope soil land use lithology river density precipitation twi plan curvature aspect slope and altitude they also integrated ds with other models to classify the different ensemble learners their result indicated that the dataset with a scale of 50 50 is superior to other ratios and the performance of all hybrid models was satisfactory singh et al 2020 created a hybrid model based on catastrophe theory ct and ahp to analyze the space of gwp in the west bengal state india their result removed the major limitation of the catastrophe theory in quantitative factors the accuracy of this hybrid model was 77 nguyen et al 2020 developed four ensemble models using lr with cascade generalization random subspace bagging and dagging to map the gwp in dak lak province vietnam they used 12 geo environmental factors such as geology land use soil river density precipitation flow direction twi sti curvature slope elevation and aspect and the groundwater yield of 195 well locations as input data their result revealed that the auc value of ensemble models was higher than that of the single lr model in which the lr dagging demonstrated the best performance 4 3 validation 4 3 1 validation related parameters the past studies machiwal et al 2011 naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 rajaveni et al 2017 razandi et al 2015 have applied the groundwater measurement parameters such as specific yield sy specific storage ss non spring spring occurrence and groundwater level to delineate the gwp zones of a given region uliana 2005 stated that specific storage ss is the volume of water released from a unit volume of a confined aquifer for a unit 1 m or 1 ft drop in piezometric head and specific yield sy is the volume of water that can yield by gravity drainage from a unit volume of an unconfined aquifer for a unit drop 1 m or 1 ft in water level this quantity is equivalent to the effective porosity kresic 2010 indicated that spring is a location where groundwater is discharged to the land surface by gravity and water pressure the groundwater level is the level of saturated water in soil or rock observed in a well borehole maggirwar and umrikar 2011 these parameters are crucial for classifying the gwp levels of a given area the gwp studies from 2010 to 2020 have used different parameters depending on reality conditions and approaches to develop and assess the models machiwal et al 2011 indicated that the high gwp is associated with a large groundwater yield specifically the areas with good gwp have a groundwater yield larger than 5 m3 h the areas with medium gwp have groundwater yield ranging from 1 m3 h to 5 m3 h and those with low gwp have a groundwater yield of less than 1 m3 h razandi et al 2015 conducted a study in the varamin plain iran and found that wells with groundwater yield of more than 40 m3 h are known as locations with good groundwater productivity ozdemir 2011b used the non spring spring occurrence to determine the gwp levels in aksehir turkey locations with spring occurrence were reported to have good groundwater productivity non spring spring occurrence was also used in the research by naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 to delineate gwp zones in the chaharmahal e bakhtiari province iran their result revealed that springs rarely occur in regions with low gwp rajaveni et al 2017 indicated that the groundwater level in a well borehole also represents gwp at a location they found that areas with low gwp have large groundwater fluctuations while areas with high gwp have low groundwater fluctuations mukherjee et al 2012 observed data on groundwater levels to verify the gwp map in kachchh district india 4 3 2 validation technique validation is a crucial step in assessing gwp models validation testing generally verifies forecast performance rajaee et al 2019 indicated that the predicted results increasingly improved algorithm development in models has increased aided by the evolution of gis rs machine learning technologies díaz alcaide and martínez santos 2019 also argued that the reason for the increased predictive efficiency is the use of an increased number of variables in gwp mapping according to statistics from the study dataset 91 publications four main techniques used by hydrogeologists in groundwater research to check the accuracy of a groundwater map in their area of interest are as follows receiver operating characteristic roc statistical evaluation measures kappa index and root mean square error table 2 among these techniques the roc is mostly used in gwp studies with model performance evaluation the choice of the groundwater map validation technique depends on the preference of the operator performance evaluation results for common models in this study are shown in fig 7 5 current status and challenges for groundwater potential mapping research in the future this review provides an overview of factors pertaining to gwp mapping from model thematic layers algorithms and their accuracy a gwp map must present the potential areas of groundwater elmahdy and mohamed 2014 hydrogeologists usually delineate their potential maps into five levels very high high moderate poor and very poor potential regions kumar et al 2014 mukherjee et al 2012 pham et al 2019 according to the statistics of this review there are eight topical map layers commonly used by hydrogeologists geology slope land use soil type drainage density lineament density altitude rainfall another consideration of gwp map is the data source for mapping thematic layers for data sources to create thematic layers two main sources have been commonly employed satellite data and hydrogeological data today the development of rs technology has provided a large amount of data on the earth s surface and weather information facilitating map creation within a shorter time than that required for field data collection díaz alcaide and martínez santos 2019 thus although rs data are effective scientists must have a wide and in depth knowledge of rs oikonomidis et al 2015 some satellites with high resolution provide high quality images however this makes the images cost intensive making their use unfeasible another disadvantage of rs data is that satellite images only provide coverage information information of objects present under cloud cover and treetops is not considered this requires hydrogeologists to combine information from the field such as the borehole well and hydrogeological data with rs field parameters can provide what rs data cannot for example well productivity data cannot be collected from satellite images additionally field data always provide a high degree of confidence and validity however the collection of borehole well and hydrogeological data is time and labor consuming according to current statistics there are several approaches to establish a gwp map these methods can be divided into three groups statistical machine learning hybrid ensemble techniques the common statistical techniques include mcda ahp fr ebf and woe models the features of the statistical models are easy to implement a gwp map their observed variables do not require more than that of machine learning models in some cases several authors have only used the weights of the affected variables of groundwater ignoring the map s accuracy gaur et al 2011 ghosh et al 2016 murmu et al 2019 singh et al 2013 recently machine learning models have been used extensively by hydrogeologists the common machine learning models include rf lr brt and svm big data are required to train and test the machine learning models martínez santos and renard 2020 from basic machine learning and statistical models hydrogeologists have developed advanced models aimed at creating more accurate gwp maps such as the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis differential evolution de model khosravi et al 2018 random forest rf decision strump ds pham et al 2019 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis genetic algorithm ga termeh et al 2019 and logistic regression lr dagging dlr nguyen et al 2020 an integral part of any gwp study is the validation step das 2019 statistically receiver operating characteristic roc statistical evaluation measures kappa index and root mean square error are four main techniques used to evaluate a gwp map statistical evaluation measures kappa index and root mean square error are often used to check the accuracy of statistical models while the auc technique is often used to check the accuracy of machine learning models and several statistical models generally the effectiveness of the common statistical models ranges from approximately 59 0 to 90 3 while the accuracy of gwp maps produced by common machine learning models goes from 50 0 to 90 1 strikingly a higher accuracy interval 71 0 92 0 was shown in the hybrid ensemble models fig 7 in addition some authors have combined the auc technique with specificity sensitivity negative predictive value and the positive predictive value nguyen et al 2020 ozdemir 2011b pham et al 2019 the complex changes in climatic conditions and an increase in the demand for clean water pose many challenges for hydrogeologists with regard to groundwater use and planning in reality hydrogeologists have conducted extensive researches and pursued various methods and approaches to create the most suitable gwp map for their regions of interest in the past decade however gwp mapping research is still characterized by a number of limitations and challenges that need to be addressed in the future thus far researchers have not found the optimal models required to map the gwp of different areas around the world there are two reasons for this the difference between regions in natural conditions and social characteristics and the discrepancy in the input data therefore it is difficult to conclude which model is the most accurate simultaneously the constant changes in climatic conditions runoff factors land use coefficients and population growth directly affect the gwp of a certain region posing great difficulties for hydrogeologists in mapping gwp to address these challenges future research should focus on the following aspects first studies must focus on improving the quality and quantity of the input database to ensure the reliability of gwp maps at the same time stronger emphasis must be placed on using satellite images with high resolution to improve the accuracy of classification which will lead to the improved accuracy of the forecast results third maps should be created based on a combination of machine learning and statistical models fourth researchers need to apply different approaches for each research region to acquire the most suitable research model finally three dimensional models should be used to obtain an overview of the groundwater system 6 conclusions this paper provides an overview of the development of gwp studies around the world academically this has great significance the application of different groundwater influencing models and factors affecting groundwater recharge contributes to groundwater management and exploitation in areas of interest especially in areas with complex and complicated topography the gwp map also provides a general visualization of the underground water potential through which the groundwater parameters such as reserves and yields can be determined significant changes in geographic information technology and rs combined with the application of algorithms have significantly helped formulate groundwater research models over the last decade statistical and machine learning techniques are two major model groups used extensively in gwp research the review also indicates that satellite imagery and the borehole well and hydrological data share data sources commonly used to create potential influencing variables we propose that statistical algorithms and machine learning techniques should be combined and conditioning factors should be increasingly used in mapping gwp maps to achieve high efficiency declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

improved the earlier draft to this article 
2837,this paper aims to review parameters model techniques validation methods in groundwater potential field according to statistics there are three major model groups used to establish groundwater potential maps the first model group is a statistic group including multi criteria decision making analytic hierarchy process frequency ratio evidence belief function and weights of evidence the second model group includes machine learning models such as random forest logistic regression boosted regression tree and support vector machine the final group is the hybrid ensemble models in groundwater potential mapping studies 41 thematic layers affect the potential of groundwater however hydrological researchers have frequently used eight factors in groundwater potential studies geology slope land use soil type drainage density lineament density altitude rainfall most previous studies on groundwater potential have used a combination of geographic information system remote sensing and machine learning techniques to design the groundwater potential in regions of interest data sources are commonly applied to groundwater potential mapping including satellite borehole and geophysical data the accuracy of groundwater potential maps produced by common machine learning models ranges from 50 0 to 90 1 while that produced by common statistical models ranges between 59 0 and 90 3 interestingly hybrid ensemble models accuracy interval ranges from 71 0 to 92 0 therefore the review suggests that statistical algorithms and machine learning techniques should be combined and thematic layers should be increasingly used in mapping groundwater potential maps to achieve high efficiency keywords groundwater potential models geographic information system remote sensing machine learning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is vital for the existence of all life on earth and an essential component of several manufacturing operations in a nation in recent decades freshwater shortages in many regions have demanded research on the sustainable use of water resources chen et al 2020 cheng et al 2019 hou et al 2020 zehtabiyan rezaie et al 2019 based on the effects of weather elements and human activities on these resources the intricate process of climate change has caused widespread drought in many areas of the world dai 2013 rising sea levels have led to salinity intrusion in soil and groundwater in desert and coastal regions chotpantarat et al 2020 howard et al 2010 sae ju et al 2020 shah et al 2001 simultaneously population growth agricultural expansion urbanization and modern industrial activities have created an increasingly large need for freshwater chotpantarat and thamrongsrisakul 2021 francis 2011 mcdonald et al 2011 wilson et al 2006 to reduce freshwater shortages the exploitation and sustainable use of water resources have garnered increasing attention particularly with regard to groundwater the development of groundwater potential gwp maps is becoming increasingly important in many scientific fields and nations chaminé et al 2015 in particular groundwater mapping provides suitable locations for drilling groundwater wells for the purpose of water resource management and agricultural activities ahmed and sajjad 2018 elbeih 2015 simultaneously a groundwater map can reveal the gwp zones of a given region constantly advancing remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis technology has played a vital role in groundwater hydrology in recent decades gis is an appropriate tool for solving the spatial attribute problems in many environmental science fields tiankao and chotpantarat 2018 waiyasusri and chotpantarat 2020 waiyasusri et al 2016 particularly hydrology and hydrogeology the information rs provides for the earth s surface facilitates gwp research in many regions that do not have available data and complex topography chotpantarat et al 2015 konkul et al 2014 in recent years several groundwater studies have utilized rs and gis technology to map gwp zones in their areas of interest some scientists adiat et al 2012 oh et al 2011 oikonomidis et al 2015 ozdemir 2011a have used statistical models such as multi criteria decision analysis mcda analytic hierarchy process ahp frequency ratio fr model evidence belief function ebf and weights of evidence woe other researchers have applied machine learning approaches to analyze calculate and map the gwp zone naghibi et al 2019 ozdemir 2011b rahmati et al 2016 2018 machine learning models are often used in groundwater studies including random forest rf logistic regression lr model boosted regression tree brt and support vector machine svm the purpose of these models is to delineate areas with large groundwater reserves to exploit and reasonably use groundwater although some attempts have been made to develop these models for assessing the gwp for a given region the accuracy of the models is different díaz alcaide and martínez santos 2019 therefore the consideration of gwp mapping models has a significant role in determining the successful location of groundwater wells this not only helps establish wells but also guides the sustainable use of groundwater resources the present paper mainly deals with the following i definition of groundwater potential ii input parameters in groundwater potential studies iii model techniques iv validation techniques and v current status and challenges for groundwater potential mapping research in the future 2 definition of groundwater potential previous literature reviews indicate that the definition of gwp is a general concept depending on the purpose of each research some researchers andermann et al 2012 fischer et al 2003 rodell et al 2007 yeh et al 2006 have focused on groundwater storage while others batte et al 2008 janakarajan and moench 2006 nampak et al 2014 have analyzed the groundwater yield in an area from a storage perspective gwp is defined as the total amount of water in aquifers that can be stored for a long time kebede 2013 considering the yield gwp is the quantity of groundwater that may be extracted from a groundwater aquifer without surpassing the long term recharge or the chemical and physical integrity of the basin greer 2008 in addition to the above aspects groundwater quality is also used to delineate gwp zones for different purposes hounsinou 2020 considered the extent of saline intrusion of seawater to set the gwp boundaries dhar et al 2015 defined the gwp zones by overlaying the gwp and groundwater quality indexes consequently the definition of gwp is not a specific concept to use uniformly worldwide the usage of groundwater storage or yield to define gwp remains controversial because they ignore factors such as groundwater quality aquifer properties sensitivity contamination and its intended use the definition of gwp based on the knowledge of the authors can be stated as follows groundwater potential is the volume of groundwater that can be withdrawn from an aquifer for a particular purpose without affecting the groundwater yield and groundwater quality of an aquifer 3 number of publications in groundwater potential field the study area statistics around the world provide hydrologists with a general picture of gwp research it shows the level of interest in groundwater reserves in different parts of the world it is the basis for international organizations to select and implement projects related to the conservation of global groundwater resources in this section information regarding the number of research papers on gwp and other parameters is presented the content includes information about the number of national studies the information given in fig 1 was collected from two reliable sources namely scopus and web of science with keywords groundwater potential year applied by the title abstract and keywords search functions a total of 872 and 707 articles were found in scopus and web of science in this field from 2010 to 2020 respectively overall the number of articles related to gwp map research has remarkably increased in this period fig 1 with 87 countries of interest according to authors fig 2 fig 2 also shows the level of interest by hydrologists regarding gwp worldwide over the past decade india iran and nigeria had a high number of publications in this research field only a small number of relevant studies have been conducted in the rest of the countries fig 2 fig 3 shows the top 10 journals of scopus and web of science systems selected by authors for publication between 2010 and 2020 in which environmental earth sciences and arabian journal of geosciences had the highest publication 4 parameters model techniques and validation in groundwater potential studies the dataset related to this study is compiled from two sources namely scopus and web of science and conducted as shown in fig 4 the first step involves searching the literature a total of 872 publications on scopus and 707 publications on web of science are related to gwp the second step is cross referencing literature between the two systems using doi and the title of papers a total of 1085 publications were found in the gwp field from 2010 to 2020 the third step is the calculation of the number of representative samples using slovin s formula marendra and tangahu 2020 eq 1 1 n n 1 n e 2 where n is the total of 1085 publications e is the error margin 0 1 and n is the number of representative samples the fourth step is setting the dataset a total of 91 publications are selected for this study based on the citation index from high to low table 1 the final step is reviewing the content on parameters models and validation techniques this step is the most time consuming procedure in the research process 4 1 input parameters in groundwater potential studies gwp studies are generally developed on the basis of climate geology hydrology land cover topography and aquifer related data a total of 41 input parameters are related to the identification of groundwater rich areas fig 5 the number of input parameters necessary to establish the gwp map is different in each study this number ranges from 2 to 17 parameters input parameters are the required information of a gwp model these parameters provide databases related to gwp and are the basis for model application the frequency of input parameters used in gwp studies is depicted in fig 5 these data are usually extracted from conventional data existing maps remote sensing and survey eight common factors including geology slope land use soil type drainage density dd fault lineament density altitude and rainfall with a usage frequency larger than 50 are available in gwp studies during 2010 2020 4 1 1 topographic related parameters topographic related parameters are factors that describe the topographical features of a study area the frequently used topographic parameters in gwp research include the following slope slope aspect altitude topographic wetness index twi slope length curvature plan curvature profile curvature stream power index sediment transport index geomorphology distance to roads convergence index relative slope position terrain ruggedness index flow direction and relief furthermore five topographic related parameters namely slope slope aspect altitude twi and slope length were widely utilized in most gwp studies fig 5 slope controls the percolation of water into the soil ali et al 2015 magesh et al 2012 proved that a gentle slope means that surface water has less residence time on the ground this leads to water having more time to seep into the ground whereas a high slope increases flow speed and erosion and therefore rainwater does not have sufficient time to infiltrate areas with low slopes have negative surface runoff and positive percolation rates whereas areas with high slopes usually have high amounts of soil runoff and fast meteoric water evacuation by direct hitting water or rainfall adiat et al 2012 concluded that groundwater recharge depends on the surface flow velocity and vertical percolation controlled by slope degree naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 indicated that the slope aspect also affects hydrological processes because it determines rainfall direction moisture plant growth and snow melting tahmassebipoor et al 2016 determined that groundwater is often limited at high altitudes and abundant at low elevations rahmati et al 2016 applied twi to measure the amount of runoff accumulation at any place in a basin gwp partly explains a strong inverse correlation between the twi index and groundwater yield naghibi et al 2017a indicated that the possibility of soil loss also impacts gwp which is calculated on the basis of slope length gwp is also high when the slop length value is low overall topographic related parameters control permeability surface flow direction and number of precipitations seeping into the soil in the last decade the growth of the aerospace industry has greatly contributed to many scientific fields digital elevation models dems are useful for determining the topography of a certain area agarwal and garg 2016 pradhan et al 2020 rajasekhar et al 2019 dem is usually taken from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm arkoprovo et al 2012 nanda et al 2017 prasad et al 2020 or aster sensors mosavi et al 2020 sachdeva and kumar 2020 waikar and nilawar 2014 and stored in a raster format topographic data are normally extracted from digital elevation information 4 1 2 geological related parameters geological related parameters are commonly accepted to govern the potential of groundwater in gwp mapping studies distance to faults geology lineaments lineament density and relative permeability factors are classified among the geological group ozdemir 2011b among these factors geology is the first aspect chosen by researchers in building a gwp model followed by lineament density fig 5 this selection is understandable because differences in lithologies structure folds and faults result in changes in the strength and permeability of soil and rock ozdemir 2011b geology plays a significant role in finding water underground this factor has been mentioned in many groundwater studies from a geological perspective groundwater exists in the fractures and voids of consolidated rock as well as in the porosity of unconsolidated sediment therefore gwp research considers the water retention condition of the geological features such as weathered products source rocks and unconsolidated or consolidated sediments xie et al 2014 according to termeh et al 2019 hydraulic conductivity porosity and groundwater flow of an aquifer are dominated by lithology features assatse et al 2016 pointed out that unconsolidated sediment rocks usually have large gaps facilitating the existence and movement of water areas of unconsolidated sediment rock have high gwp in addition some consolidated sediment rocks are also deemed beneficial for groundwater storage consolidated sediment rocks are normally sandstone and limestone assatse et al 2016 in contrast some rock types such as metamorphic rock and volcanic rocks are not generally considered adequate materials for good gwp thus geological structure determines the existence of groundwater in a given region to collect geological data most groundwater studies have utilized field surveys bagyaraj et al 2019 or are based on a geologic map zabihi et al 2016 in addition to geological features lineaments are also a preferential option in gwp studies lineaments which are surficial expressions of faults are an expression of underlying geological structures additionally lineaments occur in the forms of fractures lithological limits and fault zones on the ground lineaments often appear in mountainous areas or straight coastlines adiat et al 2012 martha et al 2013 rahmati et al 2015 veeraswamy 2020 in the past lineaments were usually extracted from geology and topography maps moore and waltz 1983 o leary et al 1976 however more recently the development of space science and aerial data such as radar landsat etm enhanced thematic mapper and aster dem digital elevation model has allowed the collection of lineaments from satellite photographs das et al 2018 hashim et al 2013 mwaniki et al 2015 akinluyi et al 2018 demonstrated that gwp is influenced by lineaments elements belonging to lineaments such as foliation fractures and faults are commonly used to find suitable groundwater exploitation locations the factors related to lineament such as distance to faults and lineament density represent the relationship between surface and subsurface water flow through water mobility and infiltration termeh et al 2019 abdalla 2012 argued that the occurrence of faults is a good condition for groundwater recharge especially in hard rock locations indeed the fractures joints and lineaments act as a conduit which strengthens the connection between surface water and groundwater a fault zone can act as a conduit for vertical subsurface flow or as a barrier for horizontal flow thus making gwp poor bense and person 2006 lineament density reflects the groundwater phenomenon under the earth s surface high lineament density corresponds to high secondary porosity haridas et al 1998 hence aquifers and aquitards are quickly recharged through water infiltration concurrently groundwater movement and retention may be calculated via lineament density as such lineament data are used as an indispensable part of finding water potential underground the first lineament data were explored in a groundwater study carried out by lattman and parizek 1964 subsequently many researchers have applied this approach to complex terrain areas abijith et al 2020 al ruzouq et al 2019 ali et al 2015 ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 kamali maskooni et al 2020 4 1 3 hydrological related parameters hydrological related parameters play a vital role in delineating gwp zones of a given region river density distance to rivers drainage dd distance to drainage and net recharge are hydrological related parameters in gwp among these parameters dd and distance to rivers were more commonly used than other hydrological factors fig 5 rahmati et al 2016 reported that gwp groundwater recharge and hydrogeological systems are affected by hydrological parameters high groundwater productivity is rarely found in low river density areas that are far from rivers streams and surface water chen et al 2018 indicated that surface water sources are the primary recharging sources which affect the formation capability of groundwater springs in addition to river related factors drainage related factors also affect the gwp of an area dd represents the drainage capacity of a basin based on the length of water flow bagyaraj et al 2013 martínez santos and renard 2020 singh et al 2013 dd represents residence times of groundwater das 2019 where a high dd implies a large water loss capability and vice versa arkoprovo et al 2012 dd is expressed by the presence of flows on the earth s surface such as rivers and streams the numbers of rivers are often distributed more in delta regions than in hill regions mukherjee et al 2012 dd has been directly designated as gwp the greater this value the higher the gwp nasir et al 2018 according to strahler 1964 dd is calculated by the overall length of rivers and outflows in a given locality divided by the total surface area of the locality according to moglen et al 1998 source rock and climate features determine the shape of stream systems areas with a hydrology system with short and scattered rivers have a high gwp and vice versa ghosh et al 2016 observed the inverse correlation of dd and permeability the zones of high dd are associated with decreased permeability and significant surface runoff therefore the gwp in these zones is low the length factor of river and flow systems directly affects the dd of a region in addition to the length of the flow system other factors also impact dd including lithology runoff vegetation cover and infiltration therefore dd is a necessary element in groundwater studies konkul et al 2014 it is regarded as an index of groundwater recharge gupta and srivastava 2010 mandal et al 2016 mosavi et al 2020 thapa et al 2018 similar to the slope dd is usually extracted from dem data typically aster gde and srtm 1 arc second global satellite images with a spatial resolution of 30 m using arcgis 10 5 software bagyaraj et al 2013 ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 waikar and nilawar 2014 4 1 4 climatic related parameters climatic related parameters play a significant role in groundwater formation in the last decade gwp models have considered precipitation and surface temperature as determining factors in the gwp in a study area elewa and qaddah 2011 mallick et al 2015 razandi et al 2015 shekhar and pandey 2015 rainfall is a significant factor affecting groundwater recharge mukherjee et al 2012 owor et al 2009 shekhar and pandey 2015 and its occurrence gumma and pavelic 2013 mosavi et al 2020 mukherjee et al 2012 nguyen et al 2020 pham et al 2019 in a study area in some hydrological studies abijith et al 2020 klongvessa et al 2018 martínez santos and renard 2020 razandi et al 2015 suganthi et al 2013 thapa et al 2018 rainfall is also a factor that influences the recharge capacity of an area precipitation contributes a large amount of water to aquifers and aquitards through subsurface infiltration systems as the rainfall increases the groundwater level also rises chotpantarat et al 2014 shekhar and pandey 2015 the groundwater recharge potential is generally higher in the rainy season than in the dry season thus increasing groundwater level konkul et al 2014 wisittammasri and chotpantarat 2016 this finding shows that precipitation is the water supply source for groundwater agarwal and garg 2016 in addition to the precipitation factor mallick et al 2015 also utilized the surface temperature factor in the gwp study they assumed that the heat signatures of the earth s surface help discover gwp based on specific heat for example dry soil has a lower heat capacity than saturated soil the surface temperature was usually calculated from satellite imagery mallick et al 2015 4 1 5 land cover related parameters land use soil type soil depth and ndvi are assigned to the land cover related group in the present study fig 5 reveals that land use and soil type are the two commonly used land cover factors by hydrologists in the past decade land use describes the various land use units of humans on the earth s surface which presents the domination of recharge rate and groundwater usage chen et al 2018 therefore land use plays a major role in groundwater exploitation and usage bagyaraj et al 2019 dar et al 2010 mandal et al 2016 mukherjee et al 2012 waikar and nilawar 2014 zones affected by urbanization and agricultural activities often require the exploitation of large amounts of groundwater odeh et al 2019 other zones such as forests and water bodies are rarely intervened by humans lone et al 2013 consequently human interference directly affects groundwater storage and recharge capacity chen et al 2018 reported that each land use type has a difference in water permeability built up hard rock and bare land areas have lower permeability than vegetation areas each land use type impacts groundwater retention differently based on evapotranspiration soil erosion and runoff chotpantarat and boonkaewwan 2018 saravanan et al 2018 the land use factor is routinely developed through aerial imagery and field surveys avtar et al 2010 basavaraj and nijagunappa 2011 magesh et al 2012 mandal et al 2016 shekhar and pandey 2015 soil type directly affects groundwater infiltration sun et al 2018 and is a necessary part of defining groundwater recharge oh et al 2011 mollinedo et al 2015 reported that a region s water holding capacity depends on the type texture and depth of soil díaz alcaide and martínez santos 2019 indicated that gravelly and sandy soils are high percolation materials whereas silty and clayey soils allow the least infiltration meanwhile moderate infiltration is related to loamy soils and fine sand soil data are typically collected from available soil maps prepared by the land management department of a nation agarwal and garg 2016 kumar et al 2016 oh et al 2011 pinto et al 2017 ndvi is also an indicator used in forecasting groundwater storage and aquifer production of a study area chen et al 2018 naghibi et al 2017b nampak et al 2014 areas with a high ndvi index reflect better gwp than those with a low ndvi index nampak et al 2014 ndvi data are usually computed from satellite imagery sources in previous studies 4 1 6 aquifer related parameters in addition to geological related factors for the formation of consolidated unconsolidated aquifers the other characteristics of aquifers such as aquifer thickness aquifer resistivity artesian pressure groundwater depth and groundwater quality also influence gwp in the groundwater study the thickness of an aquifer also aids in defining potential zones which is demonstrated through the thickness of weathered materials razandi et al 2015 shekhar and pandey 2015 indicated that areas with thick weathering have more groundwater than those with thin weathering because groundwater is prevalent at the base of the weathered zone wherein rocks have broken down into sand size and large fragments in addition to aquifer thickness aquifer resistivity is also used to determine gwp in some studies aizebeokhai et al 2010 jha et al 2010 muchingami et al 2012 a high resistivity value indicates low gwp and vice versa muchingami et al 2012 from the viewpoint of the aquifer classification confined unconfined artesian pressure is also a decisive factor in determining potential locations of groundwater the confined aquifers occur in wide and thick permeable formations with low artesian pressure which yields low amounts of groundwater whereas the aquifer systems occur in thin permeable formations with high pressure thus yielding appreciable amounts of groundwater da lio et al 2013 groundwater depth is also one of the key indicators in determining the gwp of a well or borehole location a large groundwater depth results in a large gwp machiwal et al 2011 in addition groundwater quality reflects the gwp of an area oikonomidis et al 2015 used nitrate concentration in groundwater and gwp index to delineate gwp and non gwp zones for domestic uses in central greece in the region of thessaly their results indicated that groundwater in the karst area has good storage and low nitrate concentration considering a good gwp zone by contrast groundwater in the agricultural activity regions with high nitrate concentration is considered a poor gwp zone despite its high yield gopinath et al 2019 indicated that the intrusion of seawater in eastern coastal india increases dissolved mineral concentrations such as sodium and chloride in aquifers due to intensive pumping rates this phenomenon reduces gwp in areas facing seawater intrusion problems furthermore chotpantarat et al 2020 used hydrochemical characteristics including the stable isotopes 18o and 2h to assess the origin of the groundwater and applied principal component analysis to determine sources of nitrate contamination in phetchaburi province thailand their result showed that nitrate concentration mainly originated from the agricultural regions reducing the gwp area in this region boonkaewwan et al 2021 investigated the mechanisms of arsenic as release in coastal alluvial aquifers in rayong province thailand they found that arsenite as3 is mainly released in the deep coastal aquifer groundwater due to reducing conditions thus groundwater treatment is necessary for some areas before drinking as previously mentioned in addition to the groundwater quantity the assessment of the gwp area should also consider groundwater quality 4 2 model techniques approximately 59 of the 91 publications table 1 used a model or method to develop and assess gwp the remaining 31 used two or more models the current study classified the models into three main groups statistical machine learning and hybrid ensemble models fig 6 the model categorization was complicated and many revisions were made until the final categorization was realized this categorization was subjective and based on expert judgment fig 6 shows the information regarding the popularity of models used in 91 publications the database of this study revealed the use of 60 models from 2010 to 2020 the figure is considerably large models mcda ahp fr ebf woe are the models with the most occurrences in the statistical group while rf lr brt svm models are used a lot in machine learning group in this section the study looks into the characteristics and roles of these popular models 4 2 1 common statistical models 4 2 1 1 multi criteria decision analysis analytical hierarchy process mcda ahp model mcdm ahp is a model that uses associated factors to assess a problem saha 2017 the related factors are assigned a weight corresponding to their importance in observing issues kumar et al 2016 the mcdm ahp analyzes the weight of related factors to the main variable the variables in this model are compared considering their effect on each other on a scale of 1 9 the mcdm ahp model aids hydrogeologists in identifying and decentralizing groundwater influencing factors in the gwp field the advantages of this method lie in its fast results and minimal errors in choosing well locations in addition the mcdm ahp model permits the modification of the factor weight to satisfy different areas however the mcdm ahp model depends on the opinion of experts in setting the criteria weight thus the model result is subjective singh et al 2018 the mcdm ahp model is often combined with gis tools verifying the geographical regions that agree with gwp conditions the mcdm ahp model is typically used to evaluate gwp comprising the following four steps step 1 establishing the factors related to the gwp and creating an important hierarchy for factors step 2 classifying and comparing the factors influencing groundwater step 3 calculating the weighted value of the influencing factors step 4 validating the consistency of the pair comparisons in the mcdm ahp influence factors are combined into an indicator to evaluate outputs andualem and demeke 2019 in recent years hydrological studies have commonly applied the mcdm ahp model elmahdy and mohamed 2014 delineated gwp zones using the ahp model in the al dhaid area united arab emirates the model was successful in integrating thematic layers and assessing their weights selvam et al 2015 created gwp and recharged zones in the tuticorin districts of tamil nadu india using the mcdm technique the variables used included soil precipitation slope drainage lithology land use and lineaments where lithology and land use were integrated with the highest weight jenifer and jha 2017 used the mcda ahp model for mapping gwp zones in the state of tamil nadu of india based on the assigned weights of thematic layers according to the suggestion of experts the ahp model provided accurate predictions the groundwater yield was applied to test the validity of the ahp model andualem and demeke 2019 incorporated the mcdm technique and gis technology to delineate the gwp zones in upper blue nile basin ethiopia the thematic layers were assigned on the basis of the standardization with effective potential the results indicated that gwp was categorized into the following five zones excellent very good moderate poor and very poor potential fields simultaneously arabameri et al 2019 found that the ahp model was more effective than the random forest model by using yield data and thematic layers to assess gwp 4 2 1 2 frequency ratio fr model the fr model is applied mainly in landslide research this model is utilized to assess and predict the landslide locations in a given region choi et al 2012 jaafari et al 2014 pradhan 2010 in recent years some hydrogeologists have used the fr model to research groundwater resources falah et al 2017 guru et al 2017 mousavi et al 2017 termeh et al 2019 the fr model is a bivariate statistical algorithm used to compute the occurrence probability rate of a factor razandi et al 2015 thus the fr ratio is the rate of non occurrence or occurrence of a given characteristic regarding advantages the fr is a simple method used to compute the probabilistic connection between the environmental factors and gwp this method helps discover the spatial correlations between gwp and environmental factors and simplifies the quantification and comprehension of each environmental factor by the model the fr model is directly employed in a gis oh et al 2011 and its outcomes are uncomplicated falah et al 2017 however the fr model depends on the technique related elements the adjustment of input parameters will impact the output map oh et al 2011 in reality the construction of the fr model is conducted on the basis of the observed interactions between each groundwater conditioning factor and the distribution of groundwater well spring sites in the last decade many studies have conducted gwp maps utilizing the fr model ozdemir 2011b discovered that the fr model was better estimators than weights of evidence woe and logistic regression lr in mapping gwp in the sultan mountains turkey oh et al 2011 used the fr model to create the gwp map in the area of pohang city korea they surveyed 83 well locations the well points at 55 locations were used for training the model and the well points at 28 locations were selected for the model test the training cases were utilized to predict the groundwater appearance availability based on thematic layers including soil lineament geology and topography data their result indicated that soil texture had the most impact on gwp whereas ground elevation had the least impact razandi et al 2015 compared the efficiency of the fr ahp and gradient boosted decision tree dt models in varamin plain iran with the areas under the curves aucs of 77 55 73 47 and 65 08 respectively guru et al 2017 applied the fr to explore the impact of six factors i e dd lineament density geology slope geomorphology and land use on groundwater level the prediction rate of the fr model was 77 23 according to razavi termeh et al 2020 the fr model was used to create the groundwater spring potential map in alborz iran they surveyed 339 springs springs at 238 locations were used for training the model and springs at 101 locations were selected for the model test the training cases were utilized to predict the groundwater appearance availability based on thematic layers including land cover lithology dd fault density topographic wetness index plan curvature slope direction altitude soil precipitation distance from the river distance from the fault profile curvature slope length and slope angle 4 2 1 3 evidential belief function ebf model the ebf is a bivariate statistic model based on the combination rule to determine spatial integration naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 the structure of an ebf model includes degree of plausibility pls degree of uncertainty unc degree of disbelief dis and degree of belief bel nampak et al 2014 the pls and bel are respectively upper and lower levels of belief with a basic probability assignment function the unc is equal to pls bel which is a lack of understanding evidence of a proposition the dis is a value of 1 pls that ranges from 0 to 1 which is the belief of a false proposition the relative flexibility of ebf is used in the gwp study to admit uncertainty of spring occurrence from the available evidence naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 however the fr requires a considerable amount of information to reduce uncertainty recent gwp projects indicate that the ebf provides a reasonable solution for conceptual methods oh et al 2011 applied the ebf model to investigate groundwater productivity at langat basin area malaysia the input database included the potential of 12 environmental factors rainfall soil ndvi land use lineament density lithology dd twi spi curvature slope and elevation the main goal was to delineate groundwater productivity zonation and demonstrate the value of the ebf model naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 compared the performance of the ebf to that of the boosted regression tree brt cart random forest rf and glm models using land use lithology fault density river density distance to faults distance to rivers twi spi slope length profile curvature plan curvature elevation slope aspect and slope angle as the environmental factors to map gwp in chaharmahal e bakhtiari province iran the assessment output indicated that the performance of the ebf was the lowest among the models tahmassebipoor et al 2016 investigated the gwp with the ebf and woe approaches the input factors were utilized as precipitation lineament density slope percent twi curvature elevation dd soil texture distance from river land use and lithology the result showed that the auc of the ebf and woe was 83 7 and 78 2 respectively kordestani et al 2019 simulated gwp in chaharmahal e bakhtiari province iran by combining the ebf and the brt namely the ebf brt model the inputs included topographical and hydrogeological factors the results revealed that the ebf brt was more accurate than the ebf in another research project termeh et al 2019 compared the anfis ga genetic algorithm anfis bbo anfis sa simulated annealing fr ebf and entropy models for predicting gwp in booshehr plain iran they concluded that the anfis ga had superior performance to other models 4 2 1 4 weights of evidence woe model the woe technique is a method that uses phenomena and events to prove a hypothesis al abadi 2015 falah et al 2017 oikonomidis et al 2015 ozdemir 2011a this method evaluates the weight of variables based on the probability of a phenomenon or event occurring on each variable this model is derived from the weight of evidence method used in bayesian statistics in gwp studies the woe estimates the weight for the absence or presence of each subclass of environmental factors based on the absence or presence of representative parameters such as groundwater yield and spring well borehole occurrence within a given region al abadi 2015 falah et al 2017 oikonomidis et al 2015 tahmassebipoor et al 2016 the advantages and disadvantages of the woe lists are as follows on the one hand the woe helps eliminate the subjectivity of weight and easily sets up the gwp maps on the other hand the woe depends on the number of conditioning variables to set the weight of evidence and require the independence of data input tahmassebipoor et al 2016 therefore a requirement for studies using the woe is to determine the accurate number of input variables which helps obtain the correct weight of variables in the model while researching groundwater productivity potential mapping lee et al 2012 analyzed the correlation of hydrogeological factors with specific capacity spc and transmissivity t data spc and t were collected at 83 and 81 well locations in pohang city south korea respectively spc and t data were subdivided in a 70 30 ratio to train and validate the output they concluded that the woe model s accuracy was 71 20 the map was generated by the woe model with relatively accurate groundwater resource exploration al abadi 2015 applied the woe model to demarcate gwp in the missan and wasit governorates iraq this study utilized data from 143 borehole locations and eight variables affecting gwp including depth of borehole aquifer type distance to faults distance to roads lu geology slope and altitude the results of the gwp map were divided into areas with very high potential 15 areas with high potential 23 areas with medium potential 32 and areas with low potential 30 falah et al 2017 investigated the capabilities of the woe gam fr and si with different combinations of land use soil lithology distance to faults fault density topographic wetness index distance to rivers dd slope aspect slope angle plan curvature altitude and 6439 springs to predict gwp in lorestan province iran their results showed that the accuracy of the gwp delineation map from the woe was lower than that of other models chen et al 2018 developed a novel ensemble woe with lr and functional tree models to map groundwater spring potential in shaanxi province of china they found that the ensemble model is more satisfactory compared with individual models falah and zeinivand 2019 applied the woe model to compare it with an fr model in the assessment of groundwater distribution in lorestan province iran they used 212 springs in which 140 springs were training datasets and 72 springs were test data their output data showed that the predictions of the woe model are less accurate than those of the fr model 4 2 2 common machine learning models 4 2 2 1 random forest rf model the random forest rf is a predictive model that uses many dts to forecast the appearance of an event in which each dt is generated from resampling in 2001 breiman 2001 was the first author to apply the rf algorithm to classify his data then the rf was further developed and utilized in many science fields according to rodriguez galiano et al 2014 regression trees and classification trees could be considered part of the rf model a regression tree mission involves determining the limitation characteristics and conditions for the formation of a node in a dt while the function of the classification tree is to classify the data that have not been previously categorized into appropriate groups or classes the rf model yields very high accuracy results but does not show the operating algorithms because of the complex structure of this model rodriguez galiano et al 2014 the output of rf can be classification or regression the rf has pros and cons compared with other machine learning models regarding advantages the rf can work with complex data decrease the overfitting and variance issues and is remarkably stable meanwhile the disadvantages of the rf lie in its large and powerful computer resource requirement long training process and its assignment of the number of variables and trees in the model in the area of gwp with the rf zabihi et al 2016 assessed two gwp maps created with rf and mars for boujnordm north khorasan iran fourteen explanatory factors and 234 spring locations including 176 cases were applied to train the model and 58 locations were employed to create the gwp the result showed that the auc of rf is lower than the auc of mars similarly golkarian et al 2018 compared the rf c 50 and mars in forecasting gwp in mashhad razavi khorasan province iran the input variables were lithology land use faults density rivers density distance to faults distance to rivers slope length twi profile curvature plan curvature slope angle slope aspect and elevation their outcome indicated that the rf had an accuracy lower than mars and higher than the c5 0 naghibi et al 2018 compared the knn ann pda qda lda support vector machine svm mars brt and rf models for gwp assessment in iran lithology land use fault density river density distance from faults distance from rivers twi spi slope length slope curvature plan curvature slope aspect and altitude were utilized as the input factors of these models they indicated that the rf was the best among all models in mapping gpw and four factors with the most impact on gwp included profile curvature plan curvature slope and elevation naghibi et al 2019 simulated gwp by using the rf cart brt ebftm and rtf they used 13 input factors including lithology land use fault density distance from faults river density distance from rivers twi slope length profile curvature plan curvature altitude slope aspect and slope angle and 273 spring locations they concluded that the ebftm had the highest performance followed by the rf pham et al 2019 indicated that the rf was a useful model for predicting groundwater spring potential hence the maps created by this model could be advantageous for groundwater resource exploration and management 4 2 2 2 logistic regression lr model the lr model is commonly used in research on water issue prediction this model has recently been developed in other groundwater related areas such as ground subsidence oh et al 2011 and potential groundwater springs nampak et al 2014 ozdemir 2011a rahmati et al 2018 the lr is a regression model that finds the correlation between independent and dependent parameters to create the coefficient nguyen et al 2020 the result of the lr is only 0 or 1 binary model the lr is helpful in gwp studies to predict groundwater absence or presence via spring non spring specific yield parameters similar to other machine learning models the lr has the advantages of simplicity and linearity and is reliable in data training the disadvantage of the lr is easily gotten overfitting as the number of features is higher than that of observation additionally the lr requires the dependent variable that must be the discrete number set and cannot process non linear problems ozdemir 2011a created a groundwater spring potential map gwsp for the sultan mountains turkey integrating an lr model with the gis environment the validation of the research surveyed 440 springs and 17 spring related variables the authors reported that this was the first study on gwp using an lr approach to identify potential regions of groundwater the coefficient of 17 spring related variables was calculated using the binary lr method the results show that the lr model is a suitable tool to estimate gwsp in a given region nampak et al 2014 compared the lr and the ebf in predicting gwp in malaysia s langat river catchment they considered precipitation soil type ndvi land use lineament density lithology dd twi spi curvature slope and elevation as input factors and concluded that the ebf outperformed the lr rahmati et al 2018 used the lr with the dt to map gwp in khorasan province iran and compared it with the svm and c4 5 models the inputs to the models were ci slope tpi twi rsp stream density distance from stream lithology distance to fault aspect and elevation the results indicated that the lr had the highest auc value followed by the svm and c4 5 models zandi et al 2016 applied the lr to map gwp they used 38 springs to train the model with mean precipitation land use relative fault density fault distance petrology and slope after the training the output map was tested through the auc value they concluded that the lr was an effective model in mapping gwp from the results land use was the environmental factor that impact the highest on gwp martínez santos and renard 2020 successfully demonstrated the efficiency of the lr model in the bauole sub catchment mali using precipitation land use soil ndvi twi slope dd lithology proximity to surface water lineament density and lineaments and 1848 borehole yields 4 2 2 3 boosted regression tree brt model the brt is a combination model between the boosting method and the dt algorithm the brt operates by combining and fitting many dts based on the boosting method to improve the predictive performance the output of brt is an average model from many approximate rules but boosting is conducted in a stepwise procedure nampak et al 2014 the application of brt in gwp mapping is compatible with classification and regression of a spring non spring location or groundwater yield in a given region mousavi et al 2017 naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 nampak et al 2014 considering its advantages and disadvantages the brt can work with numerical and categorical data reduce overfitting and optimize the different loss functions however the real time database process of the brt is long because of the large number of trees and the output can be outliers naghibi et al 2016 compared the performance of the brt to that of the cart rf and ebftm in the spatial modeling of gwp they used 864 spring locations to train and validate these models according to the rate of 70 30 the input factors included fault density dd land use geology distance to faults distance to rivers profile curvature plan curvature slope length twi altitude slope aspect and slope degree their result showed that the brt was a good model in predicting gwp with an auc value of 0 898 mousavi et al 2017 used the brt and the fr to delineate gwp zones in the mashhad plain iran lithology land use fault density river density distance to rivers distance from faults twi slope length profile curvature plan curvature elevation slope aspect and slope degree were applied as input factors both models demonstrated satisfactory performances their results showed that twi had the largest impact on predicting gwp followed by elevation and distance to rivers al abadi 2017 compared the brt with fr and the ant miner algorithm in assessing gwp in the euphrates river basin iraq the slope profile curvature plain curvature twi spi distance to rivers distance to faults altitude lithology and aquifer type were used as the input data of these models the result indicated that the gwp map from the ant miner algorithm was more accurate than that from the brt and the fr kim et al 2019 investigated the capabilities of the brt rf and lr in predicting specific capacity and transmissivity of groundwater productivity in the okcheon gun south korea by using the inputs of plan curvature convergence index tri depth of groundwater distance from channel network distance to faults lineament density drainage basin slope length twi valley depth relative slope soil type land use and geology their results showed that applying the brt rf and lr with specific capacity and transmissivity had high accuracy 4 2 2 4 support vector machine svm model the svm is a statistical learning model for regression and classification tasks to determine a hyperplane for training data rahmati et al 2018 the svm comprises sigmoid kernels radial basis function polynomial and linear rahmati et al 2018 in the gwp the svm considers the environmental factors as the variable and the validation factors groundwater yield specific capacity and spring non spring as the class label the optimal separating hyperplane helps classify the training data into subsets or classes 1 1 lee et al 2018 naghibi et al 2017a 2018 sameen et al 2019 the advantage of the svm lies in its effective operation in high dimensional spaces and in cases where the number of samples is lower than that of dimensions however the svm underperforms when the dataset is large and the noise is substantial naghibi et al 2017a tested four different svm models along with the random forest genetic algorithm optimized rfga and the rf to create the gwp maps in ardebil province iran the environmental factors included lithology land use faults density distance to faults rivers density distance from rivers twi spi profile curvature plan curvature slope aspect slope angle and elevation svml yielded the best result among different svms however the performance of all svm models was lower than the rf and the rfga lee et al 2018 compared the ann and svm for gwp prediction in boryeong city korea they used 27 hydrogeological factors to predict groundwater yield and spc their results revealed that the ann was better than the svm in performance however the svm was proposed as a time effective gwp tool guzman et al 2019 investigated gw for agricultural activities in the southeastern usa they considered evapotranspiration precipitation and groundwater level data as model input their results concluded that the svr was better than the ann sameen et al 2019 applied the rf svm ann dt slrf and voted ann rf to map gwp the applied data included geology profile curvature twi sti spi elevation aspect slope curvature plan curvature distance to stream land use and tri and 85 wells with different groundwater yields to train and test these models the comparison between the rf svm ann dt self learning random forest slrf and voted ann rf for gwp mapping indicated that the slrf was the most suitable model panahi et al 2020 applied the svm with grid search and genetic algorithms to forecast gwp in the ajloun and jerash provinces jordan the models were applied to improve the predictive performance in gwp using environmental factors including ndvi lithology land use rainfall distance to faults slope length soil type spi distance to drainage twi curvature altitude aspect and slope angle their results indicated that applying the svm with the genetic algorithm demonstrated more accuracy than the svm with the grid search 4 2 3 hybrid ensemble models the evolution of computer science gis and remote sensing has helped models overcome the disadvantages and improve predictive performance combined or hybrid models have commonly been used in gwp studies in recent years the combination of statistical methods and machine learning not only solves data problems but also boosts the predictive productivity of gwp additionally the integration of parametric and nonparametric structures from different sources of knowledge is a strong point of the hybrid ensemble models this finding has been demonstrated in many recent gwp studies using hybrid ensemble models khosravi et al 2018 delineated gwp zones in the koohdasht nourabad plain in iran by integrating anfis with metaheuristic optimization algorithms they used lithology soil type rainfall land use distance from river distance from fault tri twi spi plan curvature elevation and slope as input data iwo de fa pso and ba algorithms were applied to optimize the anfis their result revealed that the anfis de demonstrated the best model performance termeh et al 2019 proposed a combination between sa bbo and ga techniques and anfis to optimize the gwp map the relevant input factors include land use soil rainfall lithology distance to rivers fault density distance to faults dd twi profile curvature plan curvature slope length slope aspect slope angle and altitude a total of 339 wells were divided with a scale of 70 30 to train and validate these models the ga was found to be superior to the sa and bbo method as combined with anfis for improving the performance of the gwp map these models also indicated that rainfall soil and land use were important factors for gwp in the booshehr plain iran pham et al 2019 investigated the gwp in the vadodara district india by developing hybrid models based on decision stump ds rf mb and bg their database included 34 groundwater wells slope soil land use lithology river density precipitation twi plan curvature aspect slope and altitude they also integrated ds with other models to classify the different ensemble learners their result indicated that the dataset with a scale of 50 50 is superior to other ratios and the performance of all hybrid models was satisfactory singh et al 2020 created a hybrid model based on catastrophe theory ct and ahp to analyze the space of gwp in the west bengal state india their result removed the major limitation of the catastrophe theory in quantitative factors the accuracy of this hybrid model was 77 nguyen et al 2020 developed four ensemble models using lr with cascade generalization random subspace bagging and dagging to map the gwp in dak lak province vietnam they used 12 geo environmental factors such as geology land use soil river density precipitation flow direction twi sti curvature slope elevation and aspect and the groundwater yield of 195 well locations as input data their result revealed that the auc value of ensemble models was higher than that of the single lr model in which the lr dagging demonstrated the best performance 4 3 validation 4 3 1 validation related parameters the past studies machiwal et al 2011 naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 rajaveni et al 2017 razandi et al 2015 have applied the groundwater measurement parameters such as specific yield sy specific storage ss non spring spring occurrence and groundwater level to delineate the gwp zones of a given region uliana 2005 stated that specific storage ss is the volume of water released from a unit volume of a confined aquifer for a unit 1 m or 1 ft drop in piezometric head and specific yield sy is the volume of water that can yield by gravity drainage from a unit volume of an unconfined aquifer for a unit drop 1 m or 1 ft in water level this quantity is equivalent to the effective porosity kresic 2010 indicated that spring is a location where groundwater is discharged to the land surface by gravity and water pressure the groundwater level is the level of saturated water in soil or rock observed in a well borehole maggirwar and umrikar 2011 these parameters are crucial for classifying the gwp levels of a given area the gwp studies from 2010 to 2020 have used different parameters depending on reality conditions and approaches to develop and assess the models machiwal et al 2011 indicated that the high gwp is associated with a large groundwater yield specifically the areas with good gwp have a groundwater yield larger than 5 m3 h the areas with medium gwp have groundwater yield ranging from 1 m3 h to 5 m3 h and those with low gwp have a groundwater yield of less than 1 m3 h razandi et al 2015 conducted a study in the varamin plain iran and found that wells with groundwater yield of more than 40 m3 h are known as locations with good groundwater productivity ozdemir 2011b used the non spring spring occurrence to determine the gwp levels in aksehir turkey locations with spring occurrence were reported to have good groundwater productivity non spring spring occurrence was also used in the research by naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 to delineate gwp zones in the chaharmahal e bakhtiari province iran their result revealed that springs rarely occur in regions with low gwp rajaveni et al 2017 indicated that the groundwater level in a well borehole also represents gwp at a location they found that areas with low gwp have large groundwater fluctuations while areas with high gwp have low groundwater fluctuations mukherjee et al 2012 observed data on groundwater levels to verify the gwp map in kachchh district india 4 3 2 validation technique validation is a crucial step in assessing gwp models validation testing generally verifies forecast performance rajaee et al 2019 indicated that the predicted results increasingly improved algorithm development in models has increased aided by the evolution of gis rs machine learning technologies díaz alcaide and martínez santos 2019 also argued that the reason for the increased predictive efficiency is the use of an increased number of variables in gwp mapping according to statistics from the study dataset 91 publications four main techniques used by hydrogeologists in groundwater research to check the accuracy of a groundwater map in their area of interest are as follows receiver operating characteristic roc statistical evaluation measures kappa index and root mean square error table 2 among these techniques the roc is mostly used in gwp studies with model performance evaluation the choice of the groundwater map validation technique depends on the preference of the operator performance evaluation results for common models in this study are shown in fig 7 5 current status and challenges for groundwater potential mapping research in the future this review provides an overview of factors pertaining to gwp mapping from model thematic layers algorithms and their accuracy a gwp map must present the potential areas of groundwater elmahdy and mohamed 2014 hydrogeologists usually delineate their potential maps into five levels very high high moderate poor and very poor potential regions kumar et al 2014 mukherjee et al 2012 pham et al 2019 according to the statistics of this review there are eight topical map layers commonly used by hydrogeologists geology slope land use soil type drainage density lineament density altitude rainfall another consideration of gwp map is the data source for mapping thematic layers for data sources to create thematic layers two main sources have been commonly employed satellite data and hydrogeological data today the development of rs technology has provided a large amount of data on the earth s surface and weather information facilitating map creation within a shorter time than that required for field data collection díaz alcaide and martínez santos 2019 thus although rs data are effective scientists must have a wide and in depth knowledge of rs oikonomidis et al 2015 some satellites with high resolution provide high quality images however this makes the images cost intensive making their use unfeasible another disadvantage of rs data is that satellite images only provide coverage information information of objects present under cloud cover and treetops is not considered this requires hydrogeologists to combine information from the field such as the borehole well and hydrogeological data with rs field parameters can provide what rs data cannot for example well productivity data cannot be collected from satellite images additionally field data always provide a high degree of confidence and validity however the collection of borehole well and hydrogeological data is time and labor consuming according to current statistics there are several approaches to establish a gwp map these methods can be divided into three groups statistical machine learning hybrid ensemble techniques the common statistical techniques include mcda ahp fr ebf and woe models the features of the statistical models are easy to implement a gwp map their observed variables do not require more than that of machine learning models in some cases several authors have only used the weights of the affected variables of groundwater ignoring the map s accuracy gaur et al 2011 ghosh et al 2016 murmu et al 2019 singh et al 2013 recently machine learning models have been used extensively by hydrogeologists the common machine learning models include rf lr brt and svm big data are required to train and test the machine learning models martínez santos and renard 2020 from basic machine learning and statistical models hydrogeologists have developed advanced models aimed at creating more accurate gwp maps such as the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis differential evolution de model khosravi et al 2018 random forest rf decision strump ds pham et al 2019 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis genetic algorithm ga termeh et al 2019 and logistic regression lr dagging dlr nguyen et al 2020 an integral part of any gwp study is the validation step das 2019 statistically receiver operating characteristic roc statistical evaluation measures kappa index and root mean square error are four main techniques used to evaluate a gwp map statistical evaluation measures kappa index and root mean square error are often used to check the accuracy of statistical models while the auc technique is often used to check the accuracy of machine learning models and several statistical models generally the effectiveness of the common statistical models ranges from approximately 59 0 to 90 3 while the accuracy of gwp maps produced by common machine learning models goes from 50 0 to 90 1 strikingly a higher accuracy interval 71 0 92 0 was shown in the hybrid ensemble models fig 7 in addition some authors have combined the auc technique with specificity sensitivity negative predictive value and the positive predictive value nguyen et al 2020 ozdemir 2011b pham et al 2019 the complex changes in climatic conditions and an increase in the demand for clean water pose many challenges for hydrogeologists with regard to groundwater use and planning in reality hydrogeologists have conducted extensive researches and pursued various methods and approaches to create the most suitable gwp map for their regions of interest in the past decade however gwp mapping research is still characterized by a number of limitations and challenges that need to be addressed in the future thus far researchers have not found the optimal models required to map the gwp of different areas around the world there are two reasons for this the difference between regions in natural conditions and social characteristics and the discrepancy in the input data therefore it is difficult to conclude which model is the most accurate simultaneously the constant changes in climatic conditions runoff factors land use coefficients and population growth directly affect the gwp of a certain region posing great difficulties for hydrogeologists in mapping gwp to address these challenges future research should focus on the following aspects first studies must focus on improving the quality and quantity of the input database to ensure the reliability of gwp maps at the same time stronger emphasis must be placed on using satellite images with high resolution to improve the accuracy of classification which will lead to the improved accuracy of the forecast results third maps should be created based on a combination of machine learning and statistical models fourth researchers need to apply different approaches for each research region to acquire the most suitable research model finally three dimensional models should be used to obtain an overview of the groundwater system 6 conclusions this paper provides an overview of the development of gwp studies around the world academically this has great significance the application of different groundwater influencing models and factors affecting groundwater recharge contributes to groundwater management and exploitation in areas of interest especially in areas with complex and complicated topography the gwp map also provides a general visualization of the underground water potential through which the groundwater parameters such as reserves and yields can be determined significant changes in geographic information technology and rs combined with the application of algorithms have significantly helped formulate groundwater research models over the last decade statistical and machine learning techniques are two major model groups used extensively in gwp research the review also indicates that satellite imagery and the borehole well and hydrological data share data sources commonly used to create potential influencing variables we propose that statistical algorithms and machine learning techniques should be combined and conditioning factors should be increasingly used in mapping gwp maps to achieve high efficiency declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

2838,a combination of in situ climatic variables and remote sensing data could provide dynamic information that facilitates to get effective dryness or wetness situations for planetary ecosystems thus the traditional standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei was revisited by drought index di using satellite soil moisture data and land surface evapotranspiration from penman monteith leuning version 2 pml v2 datasets to assess the dryness over 2417 station s grid points in china di was compared with the self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi spei and composite drought index cdi for three major land cover classes croplands grasslands and forests area the independent evaluation was carried out using sun induced chlorophyll fluorescence vegetation photosynthesis and normalized difference vegetation index datasets including crop yield results exhibited that di performance was comparable with cdi than scpdsi and spei to capture the impact of drought on vegetation photosynthesis vegetation productivity assessed by ndvi was significantly affected by dryness in the northern and southern part of china using di cdi and scpdsi and compared to spei di displayed a positive correlation with wheat maize and rice yield revisited drought index showed significant results for vegetation productivity but still necessitate future work to improve di for agricultural drought research keywords productivity ndvi droughts crop yield pml v2 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought is a complex and typical natural hazard caused by water deficit that comes with serious impacts on agriculture forestry the environment and water supply in different areas of the globe dai 2011 ma and fu 2006 prugh et al 2018 seddon et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 low agricultural crop prediction is strongly associated with meteorological and hydrological droughts caused by consistent above average temperatures and reduced precipitation and streamflows that eventually causes soil moisture and increased vegetative stress cunha et al 2015 dai 2013 kallis 2008 otkin et al 2016 ray et al 2018 under global warming most regions exhibit a decrease in agriculture yield which leads to a food shortage for a continuously growing population dai 2013 leng and hall 2020 sun et al 2019 yu et al 2018 for instance in different parts of china summer and winter droughts affect almost thirty million people yuan et al 2015 and 48 reduction in winter wheat zhang et al 2012 thus for better planning management and disaster prevention it is suggested that more studies should focus on drought behavior and its utter impacts there are different types of droughts which are categorized based on a shift in land and atmosphere variables for example precipitation insufficiency is usually associated with meteorological drought a deficiency in runoff is recognized as hydrological drought and low soil moisture is characterized as agricultural drought faiz et al 2022 mishra and singh 2010 palmer 1965 van loon 2015 vergni 2004 due to the complexity of drought termination and onset time evaluation of drought events intensity and duration are difficult to calculate therefore different indices are proposed to estimate the dryness and wetness using different land and atmospheric variables and methods faiz et al 2021 eslamian et al 2017 hao singh 2015 zargar et al 2011 up to now more than 100 drought indices have been developed to characterize droughts zargar et al 2011 however each index has its own limitations for example self calibrated palmer drought severity index scpdsi is strongly influenced by different factors e g temperature standardized precipitation index spi uses precipitation p data only and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei is based on climatic water balance p pet potential evapotranspiration the scpdsi has a complex calculation method while spi has a simpler calculation approach but significantly ignores warming conditions dai 2011 mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2010 zargar et al 2011 contrarily spei considers the multi scaler property of spi and sensitivity of scpdsi by taking pet into account vicente serrano et al 2010 however spei may not reflect the actual association between dry wet variation and vegetation ecosystem as it does not fully considers the land surface conditions jiang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a likewise remotely sensed indicators are developed using the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and land surface temperature data for large scale drought monitoring gutman 1990 kogan 1995 mcvicar and jupp 1998 peters et al 2002 tucker et al 1986 wang et al 2011 but these indices have different time lag between vegetation response and drought events cloud contamination and missing data which limits their capability to assess the response of vegetation conditions for drought monitoring ji and peters 2003 saleska et al 2007 williamson et al 2013 several researchers have reformulated previously developed drought indices according to regional geographical and climatological conditions faiz et al 2021 jiao et al 2019 wang et al 2020 won et al 2020 for instance wang et al 2019 modified spei by adding runoff data using the same calculation principles as spei faiz et al 2022 integrated three meteorological drought indices named it composite drought index cdi to assess the meteorological and agricultural drought characteristics wang et al 2020 developed a drought index based on the copula function using streamflow data likewise won et al 2020 used the copula function to integrate meteorological drought indices constructing a new drought index is usually accomplished by considering soil and hydro meteorological factors despite large research on drought indices there are still inconsistencies while capturing the drought events for instance when assessing the impact of drought on agriculture soil moisture may not be a primary concern because abnormal meteorological conditions elevate the soil moisture deficiency resulting in a damage to vegetation and inhibit photosynthesis in addition the calculation method and data availability also limit the assessment accuracy for example pet has an important role in regulating water deficit because it represents the atmospheric capability to attain water vapor from soil moisture lake water terrestrial precipitation and runoff however pet does not show actual soil water storage feng and fu 2013 milly and dunne 2016 contrarily actual evapotranspiration aet is atmospheric water content from vegetation surfaces vegetation transpiration and soil fisher et al 2017 ma et al 2021 wang and dickinson 2012 thus efforts are still needed to construct a drought index that can capture upcoming drought events and may endorse our understanding of agricultural drought processes by taking the limitations of datasets and a calculation framework frequent drought events in china since the late 1990s have caused massive economic losses china feeds approximately 22 of the world population severe drought events in different parts of china especially the northern southwest and eastern regions are a constant threat for the crop growth therefore in this study an effort has been made to reformulate a drought index di using soil moisture deficiency and climatic water balance by exploiting aet a simplified form of soil moisture balance model is used for generalizing climate impacts on available water for vegetation in different agro climatic zones of china the main objectives of this study are 1 reformulation of the traditional drought index to assess dryness conditions 2 dryness trend assessment based on different drought indices 3 di validation against crop yield photosynthesis data and prior drought events the primary objective is to understand how droughts respond to vegetation in different agro climatic zones 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and datasets china has a complex landscape with a massive land area of 9 63 106 km2 located in east asia fig 1 there are four main plateaus the yun gui the loess inner mongolia qinghai tibet and three major plains middle lower yangtze northeast china and north china the landscape of china can be divided into six types of land use such as construction land desert forest grassland shrubs and cropland cropland constitutes about 23 36 while forest and grasslands are 17 97 and 23 97 of the total land area wan et al 2018 cropland is mostly distributed in middle lower yangtze northeastern north china plains loess plateau western qinghai tibet plateau and the eastern inner mongolia plateau and south of the yangtze river is covered with grassland the forest area is distributed in the southern middle lower yangtze plain yun gui plateau changbai mountain and the greater khingan mountains the monthly precipitation comes from the climate meteorological forcing dataset cmfd he et al 2020 is used from 2003 to 2018 for analyzing the drought behavior in the cmfd in situ station data reanalysis datasets and remote sensing products are used based on the fusion technique he et al 2020 cmfd has already been tested and used in many hydro climatological studies faiz et al 2022 ma et al 2019 sun et al 2017 wu et al 2019 ma and zhang 2022 secondly aet is acquired from penman monteith leuning version 2 pml v2 product this dataset is driven by modis leaf area index emissivity albedo and gldas 2 1 meteorological forcing zhang et al 2019b plm v2 aet has improved accuracy in estimating evapotranspiration and is validated with a wide range of eddy covariance measured data plm v2 aet is a summation of vegetation transpiration direct soil evaporation and the evaporation of intercepted rainfall from vegetation then for calculating the soil moisture deficiency global land evaporation amsterdam model soil moisture data gleam sm is used martens et al 2017 sm has a daily temporal and spatial resolution of 0 25 of the topsoil layers 0 to 10 cm furthermore available water capacity awc is obtained from previous published studies yu et al 2020 zhou et al 2005 and https globalchange bnu edu cn research soilwd jsp to calculate soil moisture deficiency ndvi is a vegetation index that can be employed to assess the effect of drought on vegetation a ndvi value larger than 0 6 generally represents dense vegetation while values ranging from 0 2 to 0 5 are often showed in senescing crops shrubs and grasslands in this study the ndvi dataset is acquired from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis https appeears earthdatacloud nasa gov at 250 m spatial resolution 16 days mod13q1 006 to analyze the vegetation change during drought periods mod13q1 006 provides pixel basis ndvi vegetation layers for analysis mod13q1 006 is used without any supplementary radiometric or geometric corrections furthermore the sun induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif dataset is downloaded from https s5p troposif noveltis fr data access for validation purposes sif is a remote sensing dataset global ozone monitoring instrument 2 used for drought impacts phenology and vegetation production studies kimm et al 2021 yoshida et al 2015 sif is the reemitted energy by a photosynthetic light reaction system vegetation photosynthesis is a key process of vegetation yield and growth the decrease in photosynthesis could reflect water stress to plants due to physiological damage the decrease in crop yield by drought impacts under global warming is a constant concern in scientific communities thus drought indices validation against crop yield could reflect its better performance evaluation for the study area for this purpose crop yield data maize wheat and rice for different provinces are collected from china agriculture statistical report and china agriculture yearbook 3 methods 3 1 drought index di di is calculated using the spei formulation spei is based on the difference between p and pet pet was calculated with penman monteith formula defined by fao zotarelli et al 2010 the basic equation of spei is as follows d i p i p e t i where water deficit is di while pi and peti are precipitation and potential evapotranspiration respectively we replace pet with soil moisture deficiency sd and aet based on the fao bucket approach soil moisture balance model to better understand the interaction between plant available water and climate allen et al 1998 this simple approach could be a useful tool to assess the linkage between vegetation to water availability by adding other variables di becomes d i x d i x p x y a e t x s d x 1 where d i x is moisture departure px total precipitation at the current month y 1 for a one month lag y 2 for a two month lag and so on aetx current month x actual evapotranspiration and sd x 1 previous month soil moisture deficiency soil moisture deficiency is calculated based on available water capacity awc and soil moisture sm the soil moisture deficiency can also be calculated with total and radially available water the soil texture measurements for total and radially available water can be found in tables 19 and 22 of fao56 manual allen et al 1998 in eq 1 p is taken from the previous month 1 month lag to get the legacy effects for the available water source the normalization of dix is done by the same process as spei dix at one month scale is used to calculate dryness and wetness over the area dix has the same basic feature as spei thus it can be calculated at any time scale 3 2 scpdsi pdsi is calculated based on the water balance approach using potential evapotranspiration precipitation and soil moisture dai 2011 palmer 1965 wells et al 2004 modified pdsi to scpdsi using historical climatic data for different locations instead of duration factors and climatic characteristics scpdsi dataset is globally available at 0 5 resolution from 1901 to 2020 https crudata uea ac uk cru data drought global in this study scpdsi is extracted from 2001 to 2018 on a monthly scale for validation purposes scpdsi value less than 1 0 is taken as dryness for a specific location 3 3 spei spei is calculated based on vicente serrano et al 2010 approach for this purpose monthly p and pet data set is used to calculate spei pet is calculated based on penman monteith equation allen et al 2006 for comparison purposes spei is calculated at one and three month scales for the whole study area the main equation of spei is the same as equation 1 log logistic probability density function is used to fit d i time series on different time scales 3 4 cdi cdi is an integration of three meteorological drought indices that were used to assess meteorological and agricultural droughts faiz et al 2022 cdi is easy to calculate and has good performance to assess dryness and wetness conditions in this study cdi is used to compare with other indices to examine its performance against a single feature drought index the detailed calculation procedure can be found in faiz et al 2022 the main equation of cdi is as follows cdi a r a i m b w b a i c p a e t p aet where a b c are the coefficients modified rainfall anomaly index raim the water balance anomaly index wbai h ansel et al 2016 h ansel et al 2019 the calssifcation of drought all drought indices used in this study are presented in table 1 3 5 statistical analysis the spearman rank correlation coefficient is used to assess the performance of drought indices a modified mann kendall trend test is applied to assess the dryness and wetness trend over the study area hamed and rao 1998 sif and crop yield datasets standardization is done in minitab software to represent crop yield and photosynthesis anomalies 4 results 4 1 dryness identification and trend di was employed with other indices scpdsi cdi and spei3 to identify the dryness and wetness over china figs 2 3 di cdi and scpdsi were calculated on a monthly scale while spei was measured on a 3 month scale to capture agricultural drought di showed good applicability to capture dryness and wetness for 2010 2011 and 2015 which is also reported by china flood and drought disaster bulletin cfddb di successfully identified dryness in the year 2010 and 2011 during the summer season spei3 scpdsi cdi and di had a similar spatial distribution of dryness this showed that di had good accuracy to capture dryness over the study area for example in may 2010 and 2011 di well captured drought month in yunan province as cdi di also identified dryness in inner mongolia heilongjiang north china and southwest china and continuous drought in inner mongolia in may june july mjj in 2011 furthermore it was observed that di was more sensitive than scpdsi to drought recovery in mjj the dryness was maximum in different parts of the study area but during the rainy months the wetting pattern starts to increase conversely cdi showed more dryness than wetness compared to di to validate the dryness ndvi was also calculated for the year 2015 fig 3 and then a comparison was made among drought indices ndvi showed medium vegetation ndvi 0 2 to 0 5 in inner mongolia xinjiang shandong and heibei beijing and tianjin districts di and cdi vigorously captured dryness in these districts while scpdsi showed wetness patterns in these districts at most of the station s grid points the fact that xinjiang is far from the ocean and almost remote from humid air classifying it as the driest area in the region is a good example for preceding statement di and cdi also captured dryness in xinjiang while scpdsi showed some dried station s grid points overall the results compared with cfddb scpdsi cdi and spei3 suggested that di has good applicability and accuracy to reflect dryness over the study area fig 4 showed the drought trends from 2003 to 2018 in china di monitored a significantly drier trend p 0 05 in chongqing sichuan zhejiang and hubei while most of the region showed a non significant p 0 05 dryness trend and some station s grid points showed a wetness trend in north china east china and northeast china to the contrary cdi and spei3 showed a significant and non significant wet trend in most of the study areas similar to di the station s grid points quantity was larger than di scpdsi showed a large area with a drying trend compared to di the di was calculated based on soil moisture deficiency and actual evapotranspiration while spei3 was only based on precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and scpdsi using fixed soil surface characteristics parameters the inclusion of soil moisture deficiency and actual evapotranspiration for each location made di more comprehensive to assess the wetness and dryness over the study area while in cdi calculation meteorological drought indices have 80 contribution compared to the moisture index this might be a reason it acts similar to display dryness and wetness trend as spei 4 2 response of different vegetation types to dryness fig 5 represented the response of drought indices di cdi scpdsi and spei3 to ndvi summer season ndvi was examined with indices for all randomly selected station grid points the response of different vegetation types grasslands croplands was different with drought indices grassland is mostly distributed in southwest northwest and north china and croplands are distributed in southwest south north and northeast china the results exhibited that summer drought reduced the grassland and cropland ndvi for instance drought indices showed a similar pattern to lower ndvi in sichuan and shandong provinces while in heilongjiang the indices showed a different scenario in 2010 summer indices showed drought while the ndvi touched the value 0 5 which showed the high greenness for that grid point heilongjiang is a frosty cold region and usually farming starts in the end of april the low value of ndvi in may 2010 indicates that there may be clouds water or water from freezing soil due to increase of temperature in shandong province august 2010 showed wetness and ndvi was also high and it decrease in may 2011 and drought indices also showed dryness a similar pattern was observed in sichuan province overall all the indices showed satisfactory responses to ndvi but cdi was a little good in heilongjiang province fig 6 showed the correlation between drought indices and the sif dataset over the study area during the growing season indices showed a positive correlation with sif indicating that sif immediately reacts to water stress results exhibited that di showed a large number of cropland pixels with a positive correlation compared to cdi scpdsi and spei3 di showed a maximum correlation coefficient of 0 42 cdi spei3 0 41 scpdsi 0 39 in the northeast southwest and east region di was well correlated with sif while scpdsi and spei3 failed to capture a positive correlation at most of the pixels in case of tree cover and grasslands di has the maximum number of pixels while cdi is less than di but higher than scpdsi and spei3 this showed that di may be an appropriate option to monitor vegetation photosynthesis anomalies compared to other drought indices where other indices have a negative correlation with sif 4 3 di vs crop yield anomalies crop yield anomalies were used to assess the performance of di cdi spei3 and scpdsi over the study area for this purpose three major crop yield rice maize and wheat datasets were used to assess their anomalies during the analysis it was observed that the crops were highly sensitive to water stress due to different drought events di showed a positive correlation coefficient with maize yield anomalies in the northeast rice in central china and wheat in north and southwest china but some regions east and southwest for wheat showed a negative correlation for rice yield anomalies two regions out of three showed a negative correlation but the range was less than other indices cdi performance with yield anomalies was comparable with di in most cases di showed a higher value of correlation coefficient than others fig 7 5 discussion we compared di with cdi spei and scpdsi to assess their performance in monitoring drought over different vegetation types in the study area di showed similar performance compared to cdi but better than spei and scpdsi in monitoring drought in cropland and grasslands several studies found that natural climate is the key factor behind vegetation growth chen et al 2020 dubovyk et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 thus spei was revisited based on soil moisture deficiency actual evapotranspiration and precipitation by di spei is only focused on pet which is insufficient to represent surface water processes tu et al 2012 zargar et al 2011 in the evapotranspiration theoretical formula potential evapotranspiration is related to atmospheric state variables atmospheric water content and radiation energy thus in sufficient water supply terms potential evapotranspiration can only reflect atmospheric water demand conversely actual evapotranspiration is closely related to actual water budget using soil evapotranspiration and vegetation transpiration mechanisms thus di was reformulated to get better land surface conditions for monitoring dryness over the area di showed significant advantages over spei and scpdsi when compared over the study area figs 2 3 5 and 6 reveal that di performed similar to cdi but better than scpdsi and di to capture drought events and vegetation response to drought in most of the study areas however di has some inherent limitations in its application like the accuracy of satellite soil moisture data used to calculate the soil moisture deficiency might impact its performance the soil moisture dataset is only the surface soil moisture up to 0 10 cm depth and actual soil moisture might not be the same thus a real time dataset is needed to assess di s actual accuracy for example we found that di has a negative relationship with rice and wheat yield in some areas this might be due to a strong ecological environment structure in these regions because a strong ecological environment had strong resistance to dryness change drought effect vegetation types differently we examine summer ndvi and drought indices and found that summer drought has reduced summer ndvi of croplands grasslands and even forests in northeast east and north china the continuous drought poses a large economic and ecological environmental threat to these regions the drought decreases the forest ndvi as well even though forests are more resilient to drought stress more access to groundwater due to deeper roots furthermore di did not perform well with sif in the north china region this is because the yellow river is widely spread in this region and low chances of dryness due to irrigation drought indices were correlated with sif in maize growing region to eliminate the impact of irrigation and found that di well correlated with sif in chongqing province which showed that sif significantly decrease indicating that impact of drought on vegetation photosynthesis the second reason for the low correlation coefficient of sif might be the uncertainty of the sif data product joiner et al 2013 in sif dataset a data driven approach is used which might be a problem for low accuracy of the dataset therefore care must be taken when using the results of sif dataset because of its potential dependency on climate data presently each drought index has limitations that can be related to the dataset geographical conditions and theoretical background and cannot be used confidently to achieve the whole research objectives to exemplify the palmer index which is a great milestone in drought index development history is designed to assess drought in semi arid climate regions but in other climatic conditions it has greater uncertainty heim 2002 yang et al 2017 used spei scpdsi and other different drought indices and found that each index performs differently in a different climate di was constructed with a soil moisture dataset and actual evapotranspiration thus its comparison with spei and scpdsi showed different results in different climatic zones a negative correlation with crop yield in some regions revealed that the inclusion of actual soil moisture is required to capture the dryness in these regions and to re evaluate di performance this uncertainty may also be related to the coarse resolution of yield data prior studies also disclosed a poor correlation between crop yield and drought indices mokhtar et al 2022 prabnakorn et al 2018 there is a complicated process between the response of the crop to water stress and biomass allocation the irrigation practices can also influence crop yield pang et al 2010 thus it is extremely important to consider the crop growth process and agricultural management for the performance evaluation of drought indices 6 conclusions in this study the traditional spei equation was revisited using soil moisture deficiency and actual evapotranspiration to assess its performance for different vegetation for comparison purposes cdi scpdsi and spei were also used over all the 2417 station s grid cells revisited drought index di has good applicability in monitoring dryness over the study area than scpdsi and traditional spei di was found suitable to assess drought impact on sif vegetation photosynthesis in main cropland regions in addition di performance was satisfactory in monitoring and capturing crop yield anomalies the di showed a positive correlation with maize and rice yield but cdi presented a much better correlation than di we also used approximated ndvi to examine the dryness impacts on vegetation productivity the results showed that the northern part of china is significantly affected by droughts the analysis further highlighted that the summer dryness captured by drought indices had a large impact on different types of vegetation productivity likewise the addition of soil moisture information could have a good reference to improve drought monitoring capability in a different environment di presents different behavior in various regions which might be due to the diversity of crop phenology for future work there is still a need to assess di performance at multiple time scales to use it for agricultural drought drought validation is a continuous issue due to its complexity therefore the application of di for key agricultural drought impact palaces could provide more weight to its evaluation credit authorship contribution statement muhammad abrar faiz methodology investigation formal analysis data curation

leuning version 2 pml v2 datasets to assess the dryness over 2417 station s grid points in china di was compared with the self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi spei and composite drought index cdi for three major land cover classes croplands grasslands and forests area the independent evaluation was carried out using sun induced chlorophyll fluorescence vegetation photosynthesis and normalized difference vegetation index datasets including crop yield results exhibited that di performance was comparable with cdi than scpdsi and spei to capture the impact of drought on vegetation photosynthesis vegetation productivity assessed by ndvi was significantly affected by dryness in the northern and southern part of china using di cdi and scpdsi and compared to spei di displayed a positive correlation with wheat maize and rice yield revisited drought index showed significant results for vegetation productivity but still necessitate future work to improve di for agricultural drought research keywords productivity ndvi droughts crop yield pml v2 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought is a complex and typical natural hazard caused by water deficit that comes with serious impacts on agriculture forestry the environment and water supply in different areas of the globe dai 2011 ma and fu 2006 prugh et al 2018 seddon et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 low agricultural crop prediction is strongly associated with meteorological and hydrological droughts caused by consistent above average temperatures and reduced precipitation and streamflows that eventually causes soil moisture and increased vegetative stress cunha et al 2015 dai 2013 kallis 2008 otkin et al 2016 ray et al 2018 under global warming most regions exhibit a decrease in agriculture yield which leads to a food shortage for a continuously growing population dai 2013 leng and hall 2020 sun et al 2019 yu et al 2018 for instance in different parts of china summer and winter droughts affect almost thirty million people yuan et al 2015 and 48 reduction in winter wheat zhang et al 2012 thus for better planning management and disaster prevention it is suggested that more studies should focus on drought behavior and its utter impacts there are different types of droughts which are categorized based on a shift in land and atmosphere variables for example precipitation insufficiency is usually associated with meteorological drought a deficiency in runoff is recognized as hydrological drought and low soil moisture is characterized as agricultural drought faiz et al 2022 mishra and singh 2010 palmer 1965 van loon 2015 vergni 2004 due to the complexity of drought termination and onset time evaluation of drought events intensity and duration are difficult to calculate therefore different indices are proposed to estimate the dryness and wetness using different land and atmospheric variables and methods faiz et al 2021 eslamian et al 2017 hao singh 2015 zargar et al 2011 up to now more than 100 drought indices have been developed to characterize droughts zargar et al 2011 however each index has its own limitations for example self calibrated palmer drought severity index scpdsi is strongly influenced by different factors e g temperature standardized precipitation index spi uses precipitation p data only and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei is based on climatic water balance p pet potential evapotranspiration the scpdsi has a complex calculation method while spi has a simpler calculation approach but significantly ignores warming conditions dai 2011 mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2010 zargar et al 2011 contrarily spei considers the multi scaler property of spi and sensitivity of scpdsi by taking pet into account vicente serrano et al 2010 however spei may not reflect the actual association between dry wet variation and vegetation ecosystem as it does not fully considers the land surface conditions jiang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a likewise remotely sensed indicators are developed using the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and land surface temperature data for large scale drought monitoring gutman 1990 kogan 1995 mcvicar and jupp 1998 peters et al 2002 tucker et al 1986 wang et al 2011 but these indices have different time lag between vegetation response and drought events cloud contamination and missing data which limits their capability to assess the response of vegetation conditions for drought monitoring ji and peters 2003 saleska et al 2007 williamson et al 2013 several researchers have reformulated previously developed drought indices according to regional geographical and climatological conditions faiz et al 2021 jiao et al 2019 wang et al 2020 won et al 2020 for instance wang et al 2019 modified spei by adding runoff data using the same calculation principles as spei faiz et al 2022 integrated three meteorological drought indices named it composite drought index cdi to assess the meteorological and agricultural drought characteristics wang et al 2020 developed a drought index based on the copula function using streamflow data likewise won et al 2020 used the copula function to integrate meteorological drought indices constructing a new drought index is usually accomplished by considering soil and hydro meteorological factors despite large research on drought indices there are still inconsistencies while capturing the drought events for instance when assessing the impact of drought on agriculture soil moisture may not be a primary concern because abnormal meteorological conditions elevate the soil moisture deficiency resulting in a damage to vegetation and inhibit photosynthesis in addition the calculation method and data availability also limit the assessment accuracy for example pet has an important role in regulating water deficit because it represents the atmospheric capability to attain water vapor from soil moisture lake water terrestrial precipitation and runoff however pet does not show actual soil water storage feng and fu 2013 milly and dunne 2016 contrarily actual evapotranspiration aet is atmospheric water content from vegetation surfaces vegetation transpiration and soil fisher et al 2017 ma et al 2021 wang and dickinson 2012 thus efforts are still needed to construct a drought index that can capture upcoming drought events and may endorse our understanding of agricultural drought processes by taking the limitations of datasets and a calculation framework frequent drought events in china since the late 1990s have caused massive economic losses china feeds approximately 22 of the world population severe drought events in different parts of china especially the northern southwest and eastern regions are a constant threat for the crop growth therefore in this study an effort has been made to reformulate a drought index di using soil moisture deficiency and climatic water balance by exploiting aet a simplified form of soil moisture balance model is used for generalizing climate impacts on available water for vegetation in different agro climatic zones of china the main objectives of this study are 1 reformulation of the traditional drought index to assess dryness conditions 2 dryness trend assessment based on different drought indices 3 di validation against crop yield photosynthesis data and prior drought events the primary objective is to understand how droughts respond to vegetation in different agro climatic zones 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and datasets china has a complex landscape with a massive land area of 9 63 106 km2 located in east asia fig 1 there are four main plateaus the yun gui the loess inner mongolia qinghai tibet and three major plains middle lower yangtze northeast china and north china the landscape of china can be divided into six types of land use such as construction land desert forest grassland shrubs and cropland cropland constitutes about 23 36 while forest and grasslands are 17 97 and 23 97 of the total land area wan et al 2018 cropland is mostly distributed in middle lower yangtze northeastern north china plains loess plateau western qinghai tibet plateau and the eastern inner mongolia plateau and south of the yangtze river is covered with grassland the forest area is distributed in the southern middle lower yangtze plain yun gui plateau changbai mountain and the greater khingan mountains the monthly precipitation comes from the climate meteorological forcing dataset cmfd he et al 2020 is used from 2003 to 2018 for analyzing the drought behavior in the cmfd in situ station data reanalysis datasets and remote sensing products are used based on the fusion technique he et al 2020 cmfd has already been tested and used in many hydro climatological studies faiz et al 2022 ma et al 2019 sun et al 2017 wu et al 2019 ma and zhang 2022 secondly aet is acquired from penman monteith leuning version 2 pml v2 product this dataset is driven by modis leaf area index emissivity albedo and gldas 2 1 meteorological forcing zhang et al 2019b plm v2 aet has improved accuracy in estimating evapotranspiration and is validated with a wide range of eddy covariance measured data plm v2 aet is a summation of vegetation transpiration direct soil evaporation and the evaporation of intercepted rainfall from vegetation then for calculating the soil moisture deficiency global land evaporation amsterdam model soil moisture data gleam sm is used martens et al 2017 sm has a daily temporal and spatial resolution of 0 25 of the topsoil layers 0 to 10 cm furthermore available water capacity awc is obtained from previous published studies yu et al 2020 zhou et al 2005 and https globalchange bnu edu cn research soilwd jsp to calculate soil moisture deficiency ndvi is a vegetation index that can be employed to assess the effect of drought on vegetation a ndvi value larger than 0 6 generally represents dense vegetation while values ranging from 0 2 to 0 5 are often showed in senescing crops shrubs and grasslands in this study the ndvi dataset is acquired from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis https appeears earthdatacloud nasa gov at 250 m spatial resolution 16 days mod13q1 006 to analyze the vegetation change during drought periods mod13q1 006 provides pixel basis ndvi vegetation layers for analysis mod13q1 006 is used without any supplementary radiometric or geometric corrections furthermore the sun induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif dataset is downloaded from https s5p troposif noveltis fr data access for validation purposes sif is a remote sensing dataset global ozone monitoring instrument 2 used for drought impacts phenology and vegetation production studies kimm et al 2021 yoshida et al 2015 sif is the reemitted energy by a photosynthetic light reaction system vegetation photosynthesis is a key process of vegetation yield and growth the decrease in photosynthesis could reflect water stress to plants due to physiological damage the decrease in crop yield by drought impacts under global warming is a constant concern in scientific communities thus drought indices validation against crop yield could reflect its better performance evaluation for the study area for this purpose crop yield data maize wheat and rice for different provinces are collected from china agriculture statistical report and china agriculture yearbook 3 methods 3 1 drought index di di is calculated using the spei formulation spei is based on the difference between p and pet pet was calculated with penman monteith formula defined by fao zotarelli et al 2010 the basic equation of spei is as follows d i p i p e t i where water deficit is di while pi and peti are precipitation and potential evapotranspiration respectively we replace pet with soil moisture deficiency sd and aet based on the fao bucket approach soil moisture balance model to better understand the interaction between plant available water and climate allen et al 1998 this simple approach could be a useful tool to assess the linkage between vegetation to water availability by adding other variables di becomes d i x d i x p x y a e t x s d x 1 where d i x is moisture departure px total precipitation at the current month y 1 for a one month lag y 2 for a two month lag and so on aetx current month x actual evapotranspiration and sd x 1 previous month soil moisture deficiency soil moisture deficiency is calculated based on available water capacity awc and soil moisture sm the soil moisture deficiency can also be calculated with total and radially available water the soil texture measurements for total and radially available water can be found in tables 19 and 22 of fao56 manual allen et al 1998 in eq 1 p is taken from the previous month 1 month lag to get the legacy effects for the available water source the normalization of dix is done by the same process as spei dix at one month scale is used to calculate dryness and wetness over the area dix has the same basic feature as spei thus it can be calculated at any time scale 3 2 scpdsi pdsi is calculated based on the water balance approach using potential evapotranspiration precipitation and soil moisture dai 2011 palmer 1965 wells et al 2004 modified pdsi to scpdsi using historical climatic data for different locations instead of duration factors and climatic characteristics scpdsi dataset is globally available at 0 5 resolution from 1901 to 2020 https crudata uea ac uk cru data drought global in this study scpdsi is extracted from 2001 to 2018 on a monthly scale for validation purposes scpdsi value less than 1 0 is taken as dryness for a specific location 3 3 spei spei is calculated based on vicente serrano et al 2010 approach for this purpose monthly p and pet data set is used to calculate spei pet is calculated based on penman monteith equation allen et al 2006 for comparison purposes spei is calculated at one and three month scales for the whole study area the main equation of spei is the same as equation 1 log logistic probability density function is used to fit d i time series on different time scales 3 4 cdi cdi is an integration of three meteorological drought indices that were used to assess meteorological and agricultural droughts faiz et al 2022 cdi is easy to calculate and has good performance to assess dryness and wetness conditions in this study cdi is used to compare with other indices to examine its performance against a single feature drought index the detailed calculation procedure can be found in faiz et al 2022 the main equation of cdi is as follows cdi a r a i m b w b a i c p a e t p aet where a b c are the coefficients modified rainfall anomaly index raim the water balance anomaly index wbai h ansel et al 2016 h ansel et al 2019 the calssifcation of drought all drought indices used in this study are presented in table 1 3 5 statistical analysis the spearman rank correlation coefficient is used to assess the performance of drought indices a modified mann kendall trend test is applied to assess the dryness and wetness trend over the study area hamed and rao 1998 sif and crop yield datasets standardization is done in minitab software to represent crop yield and photosynthesis anomalies 4 results 4 1 dryness identification and trend di was employed with other indices scpdsi cdi and spei3 to identify the dryness and wetness over china figs 2 3 di cdi and scpdsi were calculated on a monthly scale while spei was measured on a 3 month scale to capture agricultural drought di showed good applicability to capture dryness and wetness for 2010 2011 and 2015 which is also reported by china flood and drought disaster bulletin cfddb di successfully identified dryness in the year 2010 and 2011 during the summer season spei3 scpdsi cdi and di had a similar spatial distribution of dryness this showed that di had good accuracy to capture dryness over the study area for example in may 2010 and 2011 di well captured drought month in yunan province as cdi di also identified dryness in inner mongolia heilongjiang north china and southwest china and continuous drought in inner mongolia in may june july mjj in 2011 furthermore it was observed that di was more sensitive than scpdsi to drought recovery in mjj the dryness was maximum in different parts of the study area but during the rainy months the wetting pattern starts to increase conversely cdi showed more dryness than wetness compared to di to validate the dryness ndvi was also calculated for the year 2015 fig 3 and then a comparison was made among drought indices ndvi showed medium vegetation ndvi 0 2 to 0 5 in inner mongolia xinjiang shandong and heibei beijing and tianjin districts di and cdi vigorously captured dryness in these districts while scpdsi showed wetness patterns in these districts at most of the station s grid points the fact that xinjiang is far from the ocean and almost remote from humid air classifying it as the driest area in the region is a good example for preceding statement di and cdi also captured dryness in xinjiang while scpdsi showed some dried station s grid points overall the results compared with cfddb scpdsi cdi and spei3 suggested that di has good applicability and accuracy to reflect dryness over the study area fig 4 showed the drought trends from 2003 to 2018 in china di monitored a significantly drier trend p 0 05 in chongqing sichuan zhejiang and hubei while most of the region showed a non significant p 0 05 dryness trend and some station s grid points showed a wetness trend in north china east china and northeast china to the contrary cdi and spei3 showed a significant and non significant wet trend in most of the study areas similar to di the station s grid points quantity was larger than di scpdsi showed a large area with a drying trend compared to di the di was calculated based on soil moisture deficiency and actual evapotranspiration while spei3 was only based on precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and scpdsi using fixed soil surface characteristics parameters the inclusion of soil moisture deficiency and actual evapotranspiration for each location made di more comprehensive to assess the wetness and dryness over the study area while in cdi calculation meteorological drought indices have 80 contribution compared to the moisture index this might be a reason it acts similar to display dryness and wetness trend as spei 4 2 response of different vegetation types to dryness fig 5 represented the response of drought indices di cdi scpdsi and spei3 to ndvi summer season ndvi was examined with indices for all randomly selected station grid points the response of different vegetation types grasslands croplands was different with drought indices grassland is mostly distributed in southwest northwest and north china and croplands are distributed in southwest south north and northeast china the results exhibited that summer drought reduced the grassland and cropland ndvi for instance drought indices showed a similar pattern to lower ndvi in sichuan and shandong provinces while in heilongjiang the indices showed a different scenario in 2010 summer indices showed drought while the ndvi touched the value 0 5 which showed the high greenness for that grid point heilongjiang is a frosty cold region and usually farming starts in the end of april the low value of ndvi in may 2010 indicates that there may be clouds water or water from freezing soil due to increase of temperature in shandong province august 2010 showed wetness and ndvi was also high and it decrease in may 2011 and drought indices also showed dryness a similar pattern was observed in sichuan province overall all the indices showed satisfactory responses to ndvi but cdi was a little good in heilongjiang province fig 6 showed the correlation between drought indices and the sif dataset over the study area during the growing season indices showed a positive correlation with sif indicating that sif immediately reacts to water stress results exhibited that di showed a large number of cropland pixels with a positive correlation compared to cdi scpdsi and spei3 di showed a maximum correlation coefficient of 0 42 cdi spei3 0 41 scpdsi 0 39 in the northeast southwest and east region di was well correlated with sif while scpdsi and spei3 failed to capture a positive correlation at most of the pixels in case of tree cover and grasslands di has the maximum number of pixels while cdi is less than di but higher than scpdsi and spei3 this showed that di may be an appropriate option to monitor vegetation photosynthesis anomalies compared to other drought indices where other indices have a negative correlation with sif 4 3 di vs crop yield anomalies crop yield anomalies were used to assess the performance of di cdi spei3 and scpdsi over the study area for this purpose three major crop yield rice maize and wheat datasets were used to assess their anomalies during the analysis it was observed that the crops were highly sensitive to water stress due to different drought events di showed a positive correlation coefficient with maize yield anomalies in the northeast rice in central china and wheat in north and southwest china but some regions east and southwest for wheat showed a negative correlation for rice yield anomalies two regions out of three showed a negative correlation but the range was less than other indices cdi performance with yield anomalies was comparable with di in most cases di showed a higher value of correlation coefficient than others fig 7 5 discussion we compared di with cdi spei and scpdsi to assess their performance in monitoring drought over different vegetation types in the study area di showed similar performance compared to cdi but better than spei and scpdsi in monitoring drought in cropland and grasslands several studies found that natural climate is the key factor behind vegetation growth chen et al 2020 dubovyk et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 thus spei was revisited based on soil moisture deficiency actual evapotranspiration and precipitation by di spei is only focused on pet which is insufficient to represent surface water processes tu et al 2012 zargar et al 2011 in the evapotranspiration theoretical formula potential evapotranspiration is related to atmospheric state variables atmospheric water content and radiation energy thus in sufficient water supply terms potential evapotranspiration can only reflect atmospheric water demand conversely actual evapotranspiration is closely related to actual water budget using soil evapotranspiration and vegetation transpiration mechanisms thus di was reformulated to get better land surface conditions for monitoring dryness over the area di showed significant advantages over spei and scpdsi when compared over the study area figs 2 3 5 and 6 reveal that di performed similar to cdi but better than scpdsi and di to capture drought events and vegetation response to drought in most of the study areas however di has some inherent limitations in its application like the accuracy of satellite soil moisture data used to calculate the soil moisture deficiency might impact its performance the soil moisture dataset is only the surface soil moisture up to 0 10 cm depth and actual soil moisture might not be the same thus a real time dataset is needed to assess di s actual accuracy for example we found that di has a negative relationship with rice and wheat yield in some areas this might be due to a strong ecological environment structure in these regions because a strong ecological environment had strong resistance to dryness change drought effect vegetation types differently we examine summer ndvi and drought indices and found that summer drought has reduced summer ndvi of croplands grasslands and even forests in northeast east and north china the continuous drought poses a large economic and ecological environmental threat to these regions the drought decreases the forest ndvi as well even though forests are more resilient to drought stress more access to groundwater due to deeper roots furthermore di did not perform well with sif in the north china region this is because the yellow river is widely spread in this region and low chances of dryness due to irrigation drought indices were correlated with sif in maize growing region to eliminate the impact of irrigation and found that di well correlated with sif in chongqing province which showed that sif significantly decrease indicating that impact of drought on vegetation photosynthesis the second reason for the low correlation coefficient of sif might be the uncertainty of the sif data product joiner et al 2013 in sif dataset a data driven approach is used which might be a problem for low accuracy of the dataset therefore care must be taken when using the results of sif dataset because of its potential dependency on climate data presently each drought index has limitations that can be related to the dataset geographical conditions and theoretical background and cannot be used confidently to achieve the whole research objectives to exemplify the palmer index which is a great milestone in drought index development history is designed to assess drought in semi arid climate regions but in other climatic conditions it has greater uncertainty heim 2002 yang et al 2017 used spei scpdsi and other different drought indices and found that each index performs differently in a different climate di was constructed with a soil moisture dataset and actual evapotranspiration thus its comparison with spei and scpdsi showed different results in different climatic zones a negative correlation with crop yield in some regions revealed that the inclusion of actual soil moisture is required to capture the dryness in these regions and to re evaluate di performance this uncertainty may also be related to the coarse resolution of yield data prior studies also disclosed a poor correlation between crop yield and drought indices mokhtar et al 2022 prabnakorn et al 2018 there is a complicated process between the response of the crop to water stress and biomass allocation the irrigation practices can also influence crop yield pang et al 2010 thus it is extremely important to consider the crop growth process and agricultural management for the performance evaluation of drought indices 6 conclusions in this study the traditional spei equation was revisited using soil moisture deficiency and actual evapotranspiration to assess its performance for different vegetation for comparison purposes cdi scpdsi and spei were also used over all the 2417 station s grid cells revisited drought index di has good applicability in monitoring dryness over the study area than scpdsi and traditional spei di was found suitable to assess drought impact on sif vegetation photosynthesis in main cropland regions in addition di performance was satisfactory in monitoring and capturing crop yield anomalies the di showed a positive correlation with maize and rice yield but cdi presented a much better correlation than di we also used approximated ndvi to examine the dryness impacts on vegetation productivity the results showed that the northern part of china is significantly affected by droughts the analysis further highlighted that the summer dryness captured by drought indices had a large impact on different types of vegetation productivity likewise the addition of soil moisture information could have a good reference to improve drought monitoring capability in a different environment di presents different behavior in various regions which might be due to the diversity of crop phenology for future work there is still a need to assess di performance at multiple time scales to use it for agricultural drought drought validation is a continuous issue due to its complexity therefore the application of di for key agricultural drought impact palaces could provide more weight to its evaluation credit authorship contribution statement muhammad abrar faiz methodology investigation formal analysis data curation

2839,this study develops an integrated framework to guide the monitoring network optimization and duration selection for solute transport in heterogeneous sand tank experiments the method is designed based on entropy and data worth analysis numerical models are applied to approach prior observation datasets and to support optimization analysis several candidate monitoring locations are synthetically assumed in numerical models entropy analysis considers local scale heterogeneity in experiment and identifies stable monitoring locations through extracting maximum information and

the proposed framework results show that the optimized monitoring network can accurately characterize the distribution of contaminant plumes in 3d domains and provides estimation of key flow and transport parameters e g hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity with the extension of experiment time the total information of monitoring network is maximized while the uncertainty of key parameters is minimized the recommended experimental duration is the time by which both joint entropy and parameter variation coefficients are stabilized our developed methodology can be used as a flexible and powerful tool to design more complex transport experiments at different spatiotemporal scales keywords experimental design entropy analysis data worth maximum information minimum redundancy heterogeneity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction efficient and cost effective laboratory tracer experiments are valuable tools in understanding and identifying flow and transport processes aksoy and guney 2010 neuman et al 2012 yang et al 2014 hou et al 2019 soil columns and sand tanks are the most common tracer experiments they are often utilized to investigate solute conservative and reactive transport and hydraulic properties porro et al 1993 lu et al 2010 sanchez vila et al 2010 ma et al 2021a for example these experiments are also used to understand the absorption mechanism of radionuclides voutilainen et al 2019 trinchero et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 heavy metals xiao et al 2017 cao et al 2021 non aqueous phase liquids illangasekare et al 2000 farthing et al 2012 and explore the effect of sediment heterogeneity on hydrological processes illangasekare et al 1990 soltanian et al 2015a dai et al 2019 as well as the behaviors of parameter scale dependency molinari et al 2015 soltanian et al 2015b zhang et al 2021 hydrogeological data obtained through these experiments can be applied for development of numerical models sanchez vila et al 2006 chen et al 2021 which provide a deeper understanding of potential risks associated with contaminant plume migration within groundwater systems fiori and de barros 2015 dai et al 2020 optimizing the cost and the time investments is crucial for designing successful tank experiments ruan and illangasekare 1999 ni et al 2009 koehler et al 2019 to capture the hydrological and geochemical dynamics in great detail many sampling events must be performed at different times various data types including electrical conductivity pressure temperature and ion concentrations can be continuously monitored using automatic sensors huang et al 1995 inoue et al 2000 in addition laboratory analysis could be performed on extracted pore water samples kim et al 2004 the monitoring cost could be prohibitive depending on the number of samples detection indexes and accuracy the optimum number of monitoring locations used to take samples is one of the most significant uncertainties associated with laboratory scale experiments dausman et al 2010 on one hand sparse monitoring locations could lead to a lack data adversely affecting the interpretation of experimental results on the other hand increasing number of monitoring locations could significantly increase the monitoring costs frequent sampling may also impact pore water velocity in the sediment tank particularly in experiments with many monitoring locations this leads to inaccurate representation of plume shape and dynamics due to velocity disturbance a similar problem is expected in experiments with automatic sensors because such sensors prohibit flow and may change the hydraulic gradient danquigny et al 2004 thus it is essential to design efficient and accurate monitoring networks that characterize and identify transport processes using a given number of monitoring locations in the absence of experimental data numerical models could be used as an alternative method for approaching the prior observation datasets to support optimal analysis fatkhutdinov and stefan 2018 gharasoo et al 2019 as a data acquisition system a crucial objective of monitoring network design is to maximize observation data while minimizing the number of monitoring locations tsintikidis et al 2002 keum and coulibaly 2017 several design approaches such as information theory samuel et al 2011 sreeparvathy and srinivas 2020 statistical methods burn and goulter 1991 camara et al 2020 and spatial interpolation techniques goovaerts 2000 ohmer et al 2019 have been tested for this purpose mishra and coulibaly 2009 conducted a comprehensive review of commonly used optimization methods they concluded that the entropy based approach is one of the most attractive options as they directly define information and quantify uncertainty alfonso et al 2010a the term entropy is from basic thermodynamic and was extended to information theory by shannon 1948 the entropy based approach performs well in measuring the information amount associated with a specific system it has been widely applied in optimizing and evaluating hydrometric networks including streamflow alfonso et al 2012 leach et al 2015 precipitation volkmann et al 2010 chebbi et al 2011 water quality mogheir et al 2009 banik et al 2017 and soil moisture networks kornelsen and coulibaly 2015 various entropy related indicators such as joint entropy total correlation and mutual information were subsequently introduced for network optimization design markus et al 2003 xu et al 2017 with joint entropy and total correlation representing information amount and redundancy the optimal design can be formulated from pareto solutions by a greedy algorithm on this basis li et al 2012 introduced the maximum information and minimum redundancy mimr criterion samuel et al 2013 proposed the dual entropy multi objective optimization demo framework detailed and extensive application examples of entropy based methods can be found in the review of keum et al 2017 observation information is usually used to identify flow and transport parameters or serve as a basis for developing numerical models in some cases the benefit of information to the experimental objectives is more important than the information amount de barros et al 2012 fahle et al 2015 the ability of data to minimize model predictive uncertainty are quantified by the data worth engelhardt et al 2013 de barros and fiori 2021 a monitoring network can more effectively reduce the model prediction uncertainty while increasing the data worth thus another meaningful objective of monitoring network optimization is to maximize data worth moore and doherty 2006 introduced the data worth evaluation method based on linear uncertainty analysis which later was expanded by christensen and doherty 2008 in their proposed approach the model prediction uncertainty is estimated using direct propagation of uncertainties generated by the incomplete knowledge of model parameters the relative contribution to the uncertainty is gained by assuming that the system state response is adequately linear over a wide range of model parameters dausman et al 2010 used this evaluation method to compare the relative worth of temperature and salinity concentration further they estimated important observation locations for a tracer which can constrain uncertainty caused by a change in stress on the system wöhling et al 2016 extended the method by introducing a genetic algorithm they incorporated multiple observation locations and successfully enhanced the efficiency of global optimization vilhelmsen and ferre 2018 further extended the approach to optimize the number of selected observations targeting multiple forecasts this study focuses on developing an optimization framework for experimental design that considers both information amount and data worth it guided the monitoring network optimization and selection of experiment duration for solute transport experiments in heterogeneous sediments several candidate monitoring locations cmls are assumed in the experimental media numerical models are developed to obtain approximate observation datasets at cmls to support optimization analysis the entropy analysis quantifies the information amount the cml set containing the maximum information is obtained based on the mimr optimization criterion an evaluation metric of data worth is established to quantify the importance of each cml the worth of observation data is assessed by comparing uncertainty differences caused by the inclusion of such data cmls with high data worth are selected and preserved based on data worth analysis thus the optimized monitoring network comprises cmls with sufficient information or higher data worth moreover the sensitivity analysis of the total information and prediction uncertainty to time can provide a suggestion for determining duration of the experiment the paper is organized as follows the experimental design framework is described in section 2 section 3 introduces the related theory including entropy theory mimr optimization and data worth evaluation algorithm a lab scale 3d tracer experiment is presented as an application example to illustrate the proposed method in section 4 section 5 discusses the results of entropy and data worth analysis and presents the optimized monitoring network and suggested experiment duration finally the conclusions are generalized in section 6 2 experimental design framework fig 1 presents a schematic overview of the proposed experimental design framework the framework consists of the following seven steps 1 determine basic experiment information including experimental media facies types and their spatial distribution mean and variance of hydraulic conductivity k for each facies type boundary conditions initial condition and tracer injection information 2 set up cmls in the experimental media 3 conduct entropy analysis to obtain optimized monitoring location set with maximizing information 4 conduct data worth analysis to obtain optimized monitoring locations with high data worth 5 obtain optimized monitoring network 6 conduct sensitivity analysis to investigate the influence of experiment time on total information and parameter uncertainty and 7 select the time when maximum information and minimum parameter uncertainty are reached simultaneously as the experimental duration the media is assumed to be composed of multiple facies types e g clay silt sand and gravel with a known spatial structure artificial media filling in sand tank experiment will cause local heterogeneity in the same facies type which is difficult to avoid or predict in entropy analysis a group of k fields realizations with local heterogeneity are constructed based on the statistical parameters e g mean and variance of k numerical models are developed integrating each realization to collect target data at cmls then monitoring network optimization is conducted based on the mimr criterion solved by a greedy selection algorithm a set of optimized monitoring locations are obtained through entropy analysis optimization results may vary slightly when reconstructing a new group of realizations therefore it is recommended to repeat entropy analysis several times and select the cmls with a high probability as optimized monitoring locations enhancing the robustness of the experimental design the data worth analysis is designed as a process of inverse parameter estimation based on observation data the premise of data worth quantification is to develop a numerical model that represents the transport experiment in the early stage of data worth analysis a numerical model based on credible prior parameters is developed to approximate the solute transport process some key parameters in solute transport experiments are selected as target parameters to be estimated then observation data at each cml is used as a sole calibration dataset to reduce the uncertainty of estimation parameters the reduced value of the uncertainty is regarded as a quantitative index of data worth finally the cmls with high data worth are selected as the optimized monitoring locations 3 methodology 3 1 entropy theory entropy is a quantitative measure of the information amount or uncertainty for a system which has derived several related concepts such as marginal entropy joint entropy mutual information and total correlation li et al 2012 marginal entropy represents the amount of information content retained by a random variable x x 1 x 2 x 3 x n defined as follows 1 h x i 1 n p x i log 2 p x i where p xi is the occurrence probability of outcome xi and n denotes the number of possible elementary events in the design framework x is the collection of target data e g temperature concentration or related derivative indicators obtained by multiple numerical simulations realizations at a specific cml and xi is the result of a single numerical simulation therefore x reflects the sensitivity of the cml to realization changes sensitive cmls contain more information and thus have greater marginal entropy in the following application example xi is set as the sum of concentrations observed at a cml to capture the dynamic characteristics of solute breakthrough for the standard sigmoid breakthrough curves the concentration represents a point on the curve while the sum of concentrations represents the area of curve therefore compared with concentration the sum of concentrations has advantage in reflecting the continuous variation characteristics of breakthrough curves the joint entropy is the total information conveyed by several variables cmls for a multivariate case x 1 x 2 x n with joint probability p x i x j xk the joint entropy h x 1 x 2 xn can be expressed as 2 h x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n 1 j 1 n 2 k 1 n n p x i x j x k log 2 p x i x j x k mutual information also known as transformation t is the information measure shared by the two cmls representing the information amount of a cml e g x 1 that can be inferred from the knowledge of another cml e g x 2 the mutual information is written as 3 t x 1 x 2 i 1 n 1 j 1 n 2 p x i x j log 2 p x i x j p x i p x j total correlation c quantifies the amount of duplicated redundant information among several cmls e g x 1 x 2 xn given by 4 c x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n h x i h x 1 x 2 x n where c x 1 x 2 xn denotes the total correlation of n cmls fig 2 presents the entropy term of a three variable dataset three cmls x y and z the size of each circle represents the amount of marginal entropy the total area occupied by two or three circles is the joint entropy the area where two circles overlap represents mutual information for multivariate cases the sum of first order and second order duplication corresponds to the total correlation the calculation of entropy terms focuses on the occurrence probability of data rather than the data value therefore the discretization or coarsening of datasets is a prerequisite for calculating entropy terms which helps to eliminate differences between approximate data the histogram method and mathematical floor function are widely used for data discretization birgé and rozenholc 2006 shimazaki and shinomoto 2007 the histogram method requires a subjective setting of bin number which is sensitive to the results of entropy terms although some optimal bin size estimators are available based on different optimization criteria there is not yet a convincing answer about which method is correct entirely the mathematical floor function avoids the subjectivity of bin size to some extent expressed as follows ruddell and kumar 2009 alfonso et al 2010b 5 x f a x a 1 2 where represents the floor function x and xf denote the initial and converted data respectively thus the dataset collected at cmls can be converted to their nearest lowest integer multiple of a discretization constant a li et al 2012 introduced an empirical selection method based on trial and error for parameter a which will be presented in section 5 1 3 2 mimr optimization monitoring network optimization is designated as an iterative selection process based on the mimr criterion the optimized locations will be selected one by one from the cmls and finally form a set with maximum overall information maximum transinformation and minimum redundant information the objective function of mimr contains three terms including joint entropy h mutual information t and total correlation c expressed as follows li et al 2012 6 max mimr λ 1 h x s 1 x s k t x s 1 x s k x u 1 x u m λ 2 c x s 1 x s k where s and u denote the selected and unselected cml sets respectively and k and m are the numbers of selected and unselected cmls λ 1 and λ 2 represent the information redundancy trade off weights satisfying λ 1 λ 2 1 as wang et al 2018 proposed in the design framework λ 1 and λ 2 are set as 0 8 and 0 2 respectively the greedy selection algorithm solves the optimization problem in eq 6 li et al 2012 the ratio coefficient rc is set as the threshold for triggering the termination condition 7 rc h x s 1 x s k x u 1 x u m h x s 1 x s k the rc determines the number of optimized monitoring locations through entropy analysis discussed in the following application example the mimr optimization consists of the following steps 1 identify the cml with maximum marginal entropy as the first monitoring location in s 2 select the subsequent optimal cml from u by the mimr criterion 3 update s and u sets 4 repeat step 2 and 3 until the termination condition is triggered a global mimr optimization can satisfy the task of a 2d monitoring network optimization for a 3d monitoring network it may result in a layer with few or no monitoring locations which is usually not desired by researchers this phenomenon is because in laboratory scale experiments the cml that contains more information tends to be concentrated in a limited number of layers a suggested and effective way is to transform the 3d monitoring network optimization into multiple 2d optimizations by conducting mimr optimization at each layer 3 3 data worth evaluation algorithm experiment observations can be used as calibration dataset to constraint parameters used in the model pham and tsai 2015 the contribution of observation data to reducing parameter uncertainty is regarded as a quantitative index of data worth let a n 1 vector p contain a set of parameters employed by a model the linear model behavior is assumed so that model outputs can be directly associated with these parameters through the sensitivity matrix x the vector c representing measurements of system state can be written as 8 c x p ε where the vector îµ denotes the measurement noise with a multi gaussian probability distribution dausman et al 2010 developed a bayesian formulation of linear predictive uncertainty given by 9 a p a p a p x t xa p x t a ε 1 x a p where a p and a p are pre calibration and posterior covariance matrix of p respectively the second term on the right hand side of the equation represents the reduction in parameter uncertainty caused by the inclusion of extra data in a calibration dataset in the design framework observation data at each cml is considered a sole calibration dataset to calculate the posterior covariance matrix the predunc and predvar program in the pest suites of utilities doherty 2015 are used to calculate the values and covariance matrix of estimation parameters the k th diagonal elements of a p and a p are the pre calibration variance σ k 2 1 and posterior variance σ k 2 2 of the k th parameter respectively the relative reduction in the variance of the k th parameter can be represented as 10 r k σ k 2 1 σ k 2 2 σ k 2 1 the cumulative variance reduction r can then be computed as follows 11 r k 1 n r k where n denotes the number of estimation parameters the r is used as an evaluation index to quantify the data worth of each cml and to optimize the monitoring networks 4 application 4 1 experimental basic description a lab scale 3d solute transport experiment is used as an application example to illustrate the proposed experimental method the heterogeneous structure of experiment media refers to the sedimentary architecture observed in the middle of the nen river northeast china a preliminary geological survey has been carried out there so some hydraulic parameters are available ma et al 2021b a 3d geological profile that comprises medium sand fine sand silty sand and clay is presented in fig 3 a we simplify the sediment into three facies types to reduce the structural complexity the transition probability based indicator geostatistical simulation was used to develop a heterogeneity model that preserved the original volume proportion and mean length of facies types the heterogeneous distribution follows a transition probability function defined as follows dai et al 2007 12 t io h ϕ p o δ io p o e h ϕ λ i where tio denotes the transition probability from facies i to facies o h ϕ is the lag distance in the ϕ direction po is the volume proportion of facies o δio denotes the kronecker delta and λ i is the indicator correlation scale the parameters above can be obtained based on geological statistics of known profiles the developed heterogeneous model was scaled down to 2 0 1 0 0 6 m as shown in fig 3b this model is assumed as experimental heterogeneous media and can be divided into six layers of 10 cm thickness with different facies distributions fig 3c a 3d flow and solute transport model is sequentially established to obtain observation datasets used to support entropy and data worth analysis the model domain is uniformly discretized into a 10 5 10 cm mesh identical to the indicator data for three facies types in fig 3c sodium chloride nacl solution as a conservative tracer is continuously injected into the heterogeneous media the injection source is located at the center of end section x 0 m shown as a square with a side length of 40 cm fig 3b which helps capture the spreading and dispersion behavior in the y and z directions the simulation time and time step are preliminarily assumed as ten days and one day respectively the finite difference groundwater flow model gwf and the generalized control volume finite difference groundwater transport model gwt in the modflow 6 hughes et al 2017 langevin et al 2017 are used for the flow and solute transport simulation respectively the basic settings for modflow 6 are shown in table 1 two constant head boundaries with a hydraulic head difference of 10 cm are implemented to the left and right ends of the model x 0 m and x 2 m the other sides of the domain are assumed as no flow boundaries the hydraulic heads at constant head boundaries exceed the thickness 60 cm of the heterogeneity model ensuring that the entire media domain remains saturated the k and porosity values n within each facies are laboratory measured values through the sample analysis several cmls are preconfigured in the numerical model to support subsequent optimization analysis the researcher can freely determine the number and distribution of cmls increasing the number of cmls help identify more essential monitoring locations however this process may be computationally expensive fig 4 shows the assumed distribution of cmls at the l th layer in this example all cmls are numbered in the form of layer row column for instance the cml in the second row and third column of the first layer is 1 2 3 each layer of the media contains 15 cmls a total of 90 cmls arranged in a regular matrix with three rows and five columns 4 2 realization preparation for entropy analysis considering the unavoidable local heterogeneity caused by manual operation in the media filling process we assume that the ln k of the same facies type follows a gaussian distribution note that in the design framework the selection of methods for constructing heterogeneous k fields realizations is not constrained one way is presented below for reference in modflow 6 the k of each mesh can be assigned independently the heterogeneous k field can be constructed by setting a modified coefficient δ for each mesh 13 k j δ i j k i j 14 δ i s exp g i s g i n m s c i where i and j denote the facies type and mesh number respectively k j denotes modified k in mesh j δ i j is modified coefficient for facies type i in mesh j k i j is the mean of k for facies type i in mesh j table 1 s denotes spatial coordinate m s 0 is the constant mean a l 2 norm exponential covariance function of facies type i for two arbitrary spatial coordinates s s x s y s z and s s x s y s z is used 15 c i s s σ g i 2 exp s x s x λ x i 2 s y s y λ y i 2 s z s z λ z i 2 where σ g i 2 denotes the variance of facies type i λ x i λ y i and λ z i represents the correlation lengths along the x y and z directions respectively σ g i 2 can be approximated by statistical analysis of k measurements and is assumed to be 0 05 for all facies types in this example we consider each facies type with a correlation length of λ d i 0 5 l d i where d denotes the direction x y or z l d i is the mean length of facies type i fig 3c along the d direction the λ x i λ y i and λ z i are 0 21 m 0 1 m and 0 07 m for clay 0 15 m 0 08 m and 0 06 m for silty sand and 0 23 m 0 12 m and 0 08 m for fine sand respectively the karhunen loève expansion kle is used to parameterize the g i s as expressed by zhang and lu 2004 16 g i s m s j 1 ξ j γ i j β i j s where γ i j and β i j s denote eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance function respectively ξ j represent the kle coefficients following the standard normal distribution thus many realizations can be generated by changing the kle coefficients in this example 1000 realizations are prepared for subsequent entropy analysis 4 3 estimation parameters for data worth analysis the premise of data worth analysis is to develop a reasonable approximate numerical model based on credible prior parameters to represent the general characteristics of the solute transport process an optional method is to develop a numerical model using a specific realization generated in section 4 2 the disadvantage of this method is that the inverse result is an equivalent parameter if a heterogeneity related parameter e g k is selected as the estimator increasing the difficulty of identifying the inversion accuracy another convenient and effective way is to average out the local heterogeneity of each facies type therefore we developed a prior numerical model using the mean of heterogeneous parameters in this example table 1 data worth is a quantitative index reflecting the contribution of a dataset to reduce the parameter uncertainty it is indirectly influenced by estimation parameters thus selecting the parameters of interest in the experiment as estimation parameters can usually obtain a satisfactory monitoring network for the conservative experiment in this example the k dominating the solute advection transport and the î characterizing the hydrodynamic dispersion are chosen as estimation parameters the setting information of estimation parameters is presented in table 2 5 result and discussion 5 1 optimization based on entropy analysis the sum of concentrations observed at each cml is set as target data to capture the dynamic characteristics of solute breakthrough a dataset consists of several target data obtained by numerical calculations using multiple realizations the first step in mimr optimization fig 1 is to determine parameter a in eq 5 used to discrete datasets the spatial variability of the dataset in each cml should be consistent before and after discretization li et al 2012 therefore the standard deviations of datasets are calculated and used to identify an appropriate parameter a as presented in fig 5 small values of a fail to effectively eliminate differences between approximate data weakening variability differences at all cmls fig 5a on the other hand an over large value of a will significantly reduce the information content as illustrated in fig 5c the marginal entropies at many cmls with information reduce to 0 which causes an inaccurate representation of the dataset variability fig 5b corresponds to a relatively appropriate value of 0 6 for parameter a determined through trial and error one can see that not only are all cmls distinguishable and informative but the spatial variability of the dataset is well preserved the mimr optimization results are influenced by the realizations employed in numerical models fig 1 multiple mimr optimizations based on different groups of realization can enhance the robustness of the optimization design computation costs increase with the number of groups and the number of realizations in each group therefore the second step in mimr optimization is to determine the number of realizations for single mimr optimization we calculated the mean marginal entropy at all cmls with increasing the number of realizations as shown in fig 6 generally entropy increases rapidly in the early stages and immediately reaches a constant value the curve constantly oscillates but the amplitude decreases gradually with the number of realizations given the progressively fewer benefits and increased computation burden afterward 400 realizations are set as a group to conduct single mimr optimization in this example the mimr optimization was conducted at each layer to make optimized monitoring locations keep uniform distribution the third step in mimr optimization is to determine parameter rc in eq 7 which is the threshold for triggering the termination condition of the mimr the rc directly impacts the number of optimized monitoring locations as presented in fig 7 the number of monitoring locations increases slowly when rc 0 75 and rapidly when rc 0 75 it indicates that 1 a few crucial cmls contain most of the information in each layer 2 many cmls contain little information or their information is duplicated with that of crucial cmls a significant total correlation thus the rc can be used to adjust the number of monitoring locations the critical value of 0 75 is selected for parameter rc in this example the last step is to conduct mimr optimization multiple times 100 in this example using different realization groups each optimization can obtain a set of optimized monitoring locations we calculated the probability of each cml appearing in the optimized location sets as shown in fig 8 the occurrence probability reflects cmls excellence and stability for different mimr optimization in various realizations the low probability means that the cml has the potential to be the optimized monitoring location in only a few cases the cmls with a probability close to 100 are the best choice when the required monitoring locations are small the number of cmls in fig 8 is different at each layer consistent with fig 7 in the range of rc 0 75 it may correspond to the concentration distribution of each layer that is tracer plumes are concentrated in layers 3 and 4 while rarely present in layers 1 and 6 in this example the cmls with an occurrence probability of above 50 are preserved as optimized monitoring locations and used to form the final monitoring network 5 2 optimization based on data worth analysis the first step in data worth calculation fig 1 is to obtain observation data in each cml by the prior numerical model fig 9 illustrates the solute transport behavior in the heterogeneous model using normalized breakthrough curves btcs the hydrogeological heterogeneity of sediments and the location of the tracer injection source significantly affect the shape of btcs fernandez garcia et al 2005 btcs mostly reach a final constant value by ten days the proportions of btcs in layers 1 to 6 are stabilized at 93 93 87 73 73 and 93 respectively btcs mainly show a final constant value below 0 4 while only 6 of them are greater than 0 6 some cmls such as 1 3 4 and 6 3 3 fail to capture the tracer concentration change and a majority of them are concentrated in layers 1 and 6 the various btcs representing concentration responses are the basis for quantifying the data worth of cmls the second step in data worth calculation is to calculate the variance changes r k of estimation parameters table 2 by incorporating observation data at each cml into the calibration dataset the observation data is the modeled concentration at the corresponding cml see fig 9 the r k is calculated by eq 10 and presented in fig 10 one can see that fig 10 comprises 540 grids with the same size corresponding to the impact of 90 sets of observation data on reducing the relative variances of the six estimation parameters shown on the left hand side of the grid the grid color reflects the degree of variance reduction where the value of 1 means that the estimation parameter is possibly identifiable by observation data and 0 means that such data does not contribute to parameter identification cmls typically provide different benefits in r k of each parameter reflecting the sensitivity difference of estimation parameters to the concentration response the grid with blue color indicates that the concentration response at such cml has a negligible impact on the corresponding estimation parameter the data worth of each cml can be evaluated by six connected grids representing the r k of the six parameters which provides a relatively intuitive view of the spatial distribution of cmls with high data worth the high worth cmls i e red grids compose 8 of the total these locations are vertically accumulated in layers 2 4 and 5 which is likely to be influenced by the spatial location of the tracer injection source moreover high worth cmls show apparent regularity in the horizontal direction particularly in rows 1 and 2 composing 93 of the total even though the data worth of cmls is related to the observed concentration response it is not entirely determined by the degree of concentration change the btcs support this opinion in fig 9 for example almost all btcs that fail to capture concentration response correspond to low worth cmls i e blue grids and some btcs stabilized at high concentrations e g 2 2 1 4 2 1 also correspond to low worth cmls the last step is to calculate the data worth r and select high worth cmls as optimized monitoring locations the r is calculated by eq 11 and presented in fig 11 one can see that 38 cmls accounting for 42 of the total are listed in fig 11 while the remaining cmls are of no data worth the proportion in each layer is relatively uniform 13 2 10 5 18 4 18 4 21 1 and 18 4 respectively 2 2 3 is the most important cml with an r of 5 99 and 3 2 1 ranks 38th with an r of 0 05 according to fig 11 optimized monitoring locations can be selected from top to bottom when the required monitoring locations are small in this example all cmls with data worth are preserved as optimized monitoring locations and used to form the final monitoring network 5 3 optimized monitoring network and experimental duration the final monitoring network consists of 47 optimized monitoring locations obtained by entropy and data worth analysis as shown in fig 12 among them 15 monitoring locations accounting for only 32 of the total are the mutual optimization results of entropy and data worth analysis it indicates that most monitoring locations cannot simultaneously have both high data worth and large information content confirming the necessity and effectiveness of the integration of entropy and data worth analysis the proportion of monitoring locations in each layer is uniform 12 9 14 9 19 1 19 1 19 1 and 14 9 respectively the hierarchical optimization in entropy analysis for 3d networks may contribute significantly to this result the monitoring locations in clay silty sand and fine sand are 53 2 27 7 and 19 1 respectively this result is affected by multiple factors such as the location of cmls volume proportion of each facies type and facies distribution structure thus it is quite difficult to quantify the relationship between facies type and optimized monitoring network although the capability of monitoring networks to characterize the shape of contaminant plumes is not the focus of the optimization design it is useful and of interest to some studies therefore the plumes were reconstructed using 47 optimized monitoring locations by the natural neighborhood interpolation method an arbitrary realization section 4 2 is used to compare simulated plumes with interpolated plumes as presented in fig 13 we selected the tenth day as the comparison time because the plume shape and distribution barely changed afterward fig 9 the form of plumes is highly irregular reflecting how media heterogeneity controls the solute transport behavior facies type with low k e g clay blocks the plume migration in layers 4 and 5 the blocked flow in the horizontal direction enhances the vertical migration of the solute thus under the combined impact of low k facies and vertical dispersion contaminant plumes can even be observed in layers 1 and 6 further the connected facies with high k e g fine sand forms a fast advection channel providing the primary migration pathways for the plume layers 2 and 3 the channel allows the tracer to migrate rapidly out of the heterogeneous sediments avoiding the local expansion of the plume in general the optimized monitoring network can capture the plumes shape and solute transport pathways in each layer another topic of interest is how to select a cost effective experimental duration experiment time determines the size of observation data which directly impacts entropy and data worth analysis we conducted the sensitivity analysis of joint entropy and uncertainty of estimation parameters to experiment time based on the optimized monitoring network variation of the joint entropy and variation coefficients of parameters under different experiment times is presented in fig 14 both entropy and variation coefficients are mean values calculated based on a group of realizations one can see that the joint entropy increases with time and finally tends to a constant value of about 6 5 the variation coefficients decrease with time and eventually stabilize at 0 0 12 due to the local heterogeneity of the same facies type in the realization the variation coefficients of some estimation parameters cannot approach zero day 5 is the earliest time when total information tends to the maximum and uncertainty tends to the minimum this result is affected by the simulated time step that represents the frequency of data acquisition to some extent monitoring frequency may interest some researchers but it is beyond the discussion scope of this study given the progressively fewer benefits and increased time cost five days is recommended as experimental duration in this example based on the optimized monitoring network and suggested experimental duration we calculated the values and standard deviations of estimation parameters table 2 in 100 realizations as shown in fig 15 the mean of estimated values for each parameter is 5 7e 3 0 76 11 6 0 053 1e 2 and 1 5e 3 respectively the former three values represent the effective k of each facies type similar to the mean value in table 1 the mean of standard deviations for each parameter is small enough indicating 8 5e 4 2 1e 2 2 8e 1 1 1e 2 7 7e 4 and 1 9e 4 respectively most estimation parameters can be estimated as accurately as expected confirming the rationality of the optimized monitoring network and experimental duration 6 summary and conclusions the study develops an integrated experimental design framework with entropy and data worth analysis to guide the monitoring network optimization and experiment duration selection for solute transport experiments in heterogeneous sediments entropy analysis considers the unavoidable local heterogeneity in the actual experiment and identifies a stable cml set with maximum information through multiple mimr optimizations data worth analysis quantifies the ability of observation data to reduce the uncertainty of key parameters and determine the cmls with highest worth the final monitoring network comprises optimized monitoring locations obtained based on entropy and data worth analysis the recommended experimental duration is the earliest time when total information of the monitoring network reaches the maximum and parameter uncertainty approaches the minimum the proposed design method is presented in detail through a lab scale 3d tracer experiment where 47 optimized monitoring locations are selected from 90 cmls and the experimental duration is five days discretization constant a the number of realizations for mimr optimization and ratio coefficient rc have significant influence on entropy analysis results the appropriate parameter a can be determined by trial and error very small or over large values of a lead to the distortion of spatial variability of original dataset and thereby unrepresentative analysis results the stability and computation cost of a single mimr optimization increase with the number of realizations the rc can be used to adjust the number of optimized monitoring locations the location number increases rapidly when rc is more than a specific critical value the application example shows how to determine the abovementioned parameters multiple mimr optimizations can significantly enhance the robustness of entropy analysis cmls with a probability of more than 50 are recommended to be preserved as optimized monitoring locations data worth analysis relies on a reasonable approximate numerical model that preserves the main characteristics of the experimental parameters the data worth is related to the concentration response but not determined by the degree of concentration variation estimation parameters have a significant influence on the results of data worth analysis therefore key parameters in the experiment are suggested as estimation parameters the proportion of cmls with data worth is generally small and the high worth cmls are even less than 10 in the example the ranking of cmls provides convenience and flexibility for selecting optimized monitoring locations the optimized monitoring network can provide sufficient information with high data worth it not only characterizes the distribution of contaminant plumes with high performance but promotes an accurate estimation of flow and transport parameters with the extension of experiment time the total information of the monitoring network increases to the maximum while the uncertainty of estimation parameters decreases to the minimum the suggested experimental duration is the critical value when the total information is stable and the parameter uncertainty is reduced effectively the proposed framework can be transferred from the presented lab scale example

heterogeneity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction efficient and cost effective laboratory tracer experiments are valuable tools in understanding and identifying flow and transport processes aksoy and guney 2010 neuman et al 2012 yang et al 2014 hou et al 2019 soil columns and sand tanks are the most common tracer experiments they are often utilized to investigate solute conservative and reactive transport and hydraulic properties porro et al 1993 lu et al 2010 sanchez vila et al 2010 ma et al 2021a for example these experiments are also used to understand the absorption mechanism of radionuclides voutilainen et al 2019 trinchero et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 heavy metals xiao et al 2017 cao et al 2021 non aqueous phase liquids illangasekare et al 2000 farthing et al 2012 and explore the effect of sediment heterogeneity on hydrological processes illangasekare et al 1990 soltanian et al 2015a dai et al 2019 as well as the behaviors of parameter scale dependency molinari et al 2015 soltanian et al 2015b zhang et al 2021 hydrogeological data obtained through these experiments can be applied for development of numerical models sanchez vila et al 2006 chen et al 2021 which provide a deeper understanding of potential risks associated with contaminant plume migration within groundwater systems fiori and de barros 2015 dai et al 2020 optimizing the cost and the time investments is crucial for designing successful tank experiments ruan and illangasekare 1999 ni et al 2009 koehler et al 2019 to capture the hydrological and geochemical dynamics in great detail many sampling events must be performed at different times various data types including electrical conductivity pressure temperature and ion concentrations can be continuously monitored using automatic sensors huang et al 1995 inoue et al 2000 in addition laboratory analysis could be performed on extracted pore water samples kim et al 2004 the monitoring cost could be prohibitive depending on the number of samples detection indexes and accuracy the optimum number of monitoring locations used to take samples is one of the most significant uncertainties associated with laboratory scale experiments dausman et al 2010 on one hand sparse monitoring locations could lead to a lack data adversely affecting the interpretation of experimental results on the other hand increasing number of monitoring locations could significantly increase the monitoring costs frequent sampling may also impact pore water velocity in the sediment tank particularly in experiments with many monitoring locations this leads to inaccurate representation of plume shape and dynamics due to velocity disturbance a similar problem is expected in experiments with automatic sensors because such sensors prohibit flow and may change the hydraulic gradient danquigny et al 2004 thus it is essential to design efficient and accurate monitoring networks that characterize and identify transport processes using a given number of monitoring locations in the absence of experimental data numerical models could be used as an alternative method for approaching the prior observation datasets to support optimal analysis fatkhutdinov and stefan 2018 gharasoo et al 2019 as a data acquisition system a crucial objective of monitoring network design is to maximize observation data while minimizing the number of monitoring locations tsintikidis et al 2002 keum and coulibaly 2017 several design approaches such as information theory samuel et al 2011 sreeparvathy and srinivas 2020 statistical methods burn and goulter 1991 camara et al 2020 and spatial interpolation techniques goovaerts 2000 ohmer et al 2019 have been tested for this purpose mishra and coulibaly 2009 conducted a comprehensive review of commonly used optimization methods they concluded that the entropy based approach is one of the most attractive options as they directly define information and quantify uncertainty alfonso et al 2010a the term entropy is from basic thermodynamic and was extended to information theory by shannon 1948 the entropy based approach performs well in measuring the information amount associated with a specific system it has been widely applied in optimizing and evaluating hydrometric networks including streamflow alfonso et al 2012 leach et al 2015 precipitation volkmann et al 2010 chebbi et al 2011 water quality mogheir et al 2009 banik et al 2017 and soil moisture networks kornelsen and coulibaly 2015 various entropy related indicators such as joint entropy total correlation and mutual information were subsequently introduced for network optimization design markus et al 2003 xu et al 2017 with joint entropy and total correlation representing information amount and redundancy the optimal design can be formulated from pareto solutions by a greedy algorithm on this basis li et al 2012 introduced the maximum information and minimum redundancy mimr criterion samuel et al 2013 proposed the dual entropy multi objective optimization demo framework detailed and extensive application examples of entropy based methods can be found in the review of keum et al 2017 observation information is usually used to identify flow and transport parameters or serve as a basis for developing numerical models in some cases the benefit of information to the experimental objectives is more important than the information amount de barros et al 2012 fahle et al 2015 the ability of data to minimize model predictive uncertainty are quantified by the data worth engelhardt et al 2013 de barros and fiori 2021 a monitoring network can more effectively reduce the model prediction uncertainty while increasing the data worth thus another meaningful objective of monitoring network optimization is to maximize data worth moore and doherty 2006 introduced the data worth evaluation method based on linear uncertainty analysis which later was expanded by christensen and doherty 2008 in their proposed approach the model prediction uncertainty is estimated using direct propagation of uncertainties generated by the incomplete knowledge of model parameters the relative contribution to the uncertainty is gained by assuming that the system state response is adequately linear over a wide range of model parameters dausman et al 2010 used this evaluation method to compare the relative worth of temperature and salinity concentration further they estimated important observation locations for a tracer which can constrain uncertainty caused by a change in stress on the system wöhling et al 2016 extended the method by introducing a genetic algorithm they incorporated multiple observation locations and successfully enhanced the efficiency of global optimization vilhelmsen and ferre 2018 further extended the approach to optimize the number of selected observations targeting multiple forecasts this study focuses on developing an optimization framework for experimental design that considers both information amount and data worth it guided the monitoring network optimization and selection of experiment duration for solute transport experiments in heterogeneous sediments several candidate monitoring locations cmls are assumed in the experimental media numerical models are developed to obtain approximate observation datasets at cmls to support optimization analysis the entropy analysis quantifies the information amount the cml set containing the maximum information is obtained based on the mimr optimization criterion an evaluation metric of data worth is established to quantify the importance of each cml the worth of observation data is assessed by comparing uncertainty differences caused by the inclusion of such data cmls with high data worth are selected and preserved based on data worth analysis thus the optimized monitoring network comprises cmls with sufficient information or higher data worth moreover the sensitivity analysis of the total information and prediction uncertainty to time can provide a suggestion for determining duration of the experiment the paper is organized as follows the experimental design framework is described in section 2 section 3 introduces the related theory including entropy theory mimr optimization and data worth evaluation algorithm a lab scale 3d tracer experiment is presented as an application example to illustrate the proposed method in section 4 section 5 discusses the results of entropy and data worth analysis and presents the optimized monitoring network and suggested experiment duration finally the conclusions are generalized in section 6 2 experimental design framework fig 1 presents a schematic overview of the proposed experimental design framework the framework consists of the following seven steps 1 determine basic experiment information including experimental media facies types and their spatial distribution mean and variance of hydraulic conductivity k for each facies type boundary conditions initial condition and tracer injection information 2 set up cmls in the experimental media 3 conduct entropy analysis to obtain optimized monitoring location set with maximizing information 4 conduct data worth analysis to obtain optimized monitoring locations with high data worth 5 obtain optimized monitoring network 6 conduct sensitivity analysis to investigate the influence of experiment time on total information and parameter uncertainty and 7 select the time when maximum information and minimum parameter uncertainty are reached simultaneously as the experimental duration the media is assumed to be composed of multiple facies types e g clay silt sand and gravel with a known spatial structure artificial media filling in sand tank experiment will cause local heterogeneity in the same facies type which is difficult to avoid or predict in entropy analysis a group of k fields realizations with local heterogeneity are constructed based on the statistical parameters e g mean and variance of k numerical models are developed integrating each realization to collect target data at cmls then monitoring network optimization is conducted based on the mimr criterion solved by a greedy selection algorithm a set of optimized monitoring locations are obtained through entropy analysis optimization results may vary slightly when reconstructing a new group of realizations therefore it is recommended to repeat entropy analysis several times and select the cmls with a high probability as optimized monitoring locations enhancing the robustness of the experimental design the data worth analysis is designed as a process of inverse parameter estimation based on observation data the premise of data worth quantification is to develop a numerical model that represents the transport experiment in the early stage of data worth analysis a numerical model based on credible prior parameters is developed to approximate the solute transport process some key parameters in solute transport experiments are selected as target parameters to be estimated then observation data at each cml is used as a sole calibration dataset to reduce the uncertainty of estimation parameters the reduced value of the uncertainty is regarded as a quantitative index of data worth finally the cmls with high data worth are selected as the optimized monitoring locations 3 methodology 3 1 entropy theory entropy is a quantitative measure of the information amount or uncertainty for a system which has derived several related concepts such as marginal entropy joint entropy mutual information and total correlation li et al 2012 marginal entropy represents the amount of information content retained by a random variable x x 1 x 2 x 3 x n defined as follows 1 h x i 1 n p x i log 2 p x i where p xi is the occurrence probability of outcome xi and n denotes the number of possible elementary events in the design framework x is the collection of target data e g temperature concentration or related derivative indicators obtained by multiple numerical simulations realizations at a specific cml and xi is the result of a single numerical simulation therefore x reflects the sensitivity of the cml to realization changes sensitive cmls contain more information and thus have greater marginal entropy in the following application example xi is set as the sum of concentrations observed at a cml to capture the dynamic characteristics of solute breakthrough for the standard sigmoid breakthrough curves the concentration represents a point on the curve while the sum of concentrations represents the area of curve therefore compared with concentration the sum of concentrations has advantage in reflecting the continuous variation characteristics of breakthrough curves the joint entropy is the total information conveyed by several variables cmls for a multivariate case x 1 x 2 x n with joint probability p x i x j xk the joint entropy h x 1 x 2 xn can be expressed as 2 h x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n 1 j 1 n 2 k 1 n n p x i x j x k log 2 p x i x j x k mutual information also known as transformation t is the information measure shared by the two cmls representing the information amount of a cml e g x 1 that can be inferred from the knowledge of another cml e g x 2 the mutual information is written as 3 t x 1 x 2 i 1 n 1 j 1 n 2 p x i x j log 2 p x i x j p x i p x j total correlation c quantifies the amount of duplicated redundant information among several cmls e g x 1 x 2 xn given by 4 c x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n h x i h x 1 x 2 x n where c x 1 x 2 xn denotes the total correlation of n cmls fig 2 presents the entropy term of a three variable dataset three cmls x y and z the size of each circle represents the amount of marginal entropy the total area occupied by two or three circles is the joint entropy the area where two circles overlap represents mutual information for multivariate cases the sum of first order and second order duplication corresponds to the total correlation the calculation of entropy terms focuses on the occurrence probability of data rather than the data value therefore the discretization or coarsening of datasets is a prerequisite for calculating entropy terms which helps to eliminate differences between approximate data the histogram method and mathematical floor function are widely used for data discretization birgé and rozenholc 2006 shimazaki and shinomoto 2007 the histogram method requires a subjective setting of bin number which is sensitive to the results of entropy terms although some optimal bin size estimators are available based on different optimization criteria there is not yet a convincing answer about which method is correct entirely the mathematical floor function avoids the subjectivity of bin size to some extent expressed as follows ruddell and kumar 2009 alfonso et al 2010b 5 x f a x a 1 2 where represents the floor function x and xf denote the initial and converted data respectively thus the dataset collected at cmls can be converted to their nearest lowest integer multiple of a discretization constant a li et al 2012 introduced an empirical selection method based on trial and error for parameter a which will be presented in section 5 1 3 2 mimr optimization monitoring network optimization is designated as an iterative selection process based on the mimr criterion the optimized locations will be selected one by one from the cmls and finally form a set with maximum overall information maximum transinformation and minimum redundant information the objective function of mimr contains three terms including joint entropy h mutual information t and total correlation c expressed as follows li et al 2012 6 max mimr λ 1 h x s 1 x s k t x s 1 x s k x u 1 x u m λ 2 c x s 1 x s k where s and u denote the selected and unselected cml sets respectively and k and m are the numbers of selected and unselected cmls λ 1 and λ 2 represent the information redundancy trade off weights satisfying λ 1 λ 2 1 as wang et al 2018 proposed in the design framework λ 1 and λ 2 are set as 0 8 and 0 2 respectively the greedy selection algorithm solves the optimization problem in eq 6 li et al 2012 the ratio coefficient rc is set as the threshold for triggering the termination condition 7 rc h x s 1 x s k x u 1 x u m h x s 1 x s k the rc determines the number of optimized monitoring locations through entropy analysis discussed in the following application example the mimr optimization consists of the following steps 1 identify the cml with maximum marginal entropy as the first monitoring location in s 2 select the subsequent optimal cml from u by the mimr criterion 3 update s and u sets 4 repeat step 2 and 3 until the termination condition is triggered a global mimr optimization can satisfy the task of a 2d monitoring network optimization for a 3d monitoring network it may result in a layer with few or no monitoring locations which is usually not desired by researchers this phenomenon is because in laboratory scale experiments the cml that contains more information tends to be concentrated in a limited number of layers a suggested and effective way is to transform the 3d monitoring network optimization into multiple 2d optimizations by conducting mimr optimization at each layer 3 3 data worth evaluation algorithm experiment observations can be used as calibration dataset to constraint parameters used in the model pham and tsai 2015 the contribution of observation data to reducing parameter uncertainty is regarded as a quantitative index of data worth let a n 1 vector p contain a set of parameters employed by a model the linear model behavior is assumed so that model outputs can be directly associated with these parameters through the sensitivity matrix x the vector c representing measurements of system state can be written as 8 c x p ε where the vector îµ denotes the measurement noise with a multi gaussian probability distribution dausman et al 2010 developed a bayesian formulation of linear predictive uncertainty given by 9 a p a p a p x t xa p x t a ε 1 x a p where a p and a p are pre calibration and posterior covariance matrix of p respectively the second term on the right hand side of the equation represents the reduction in parameter uncertainty caused by the inclusion of extra data in a calibration dataset in the design framework observation data at each cml is considered a sole calibration dataset to calculate the posterior covariance matrix the predunc and predvar program in the pest suites of utilities doherty 2015 are used to calculate the values and covariance matrix of estimation parameters the k th diagonal elements of a p and a p are the pre calibration variance σ k 2 1 and posterior variance σ k 2 2 of the k th parameter respectively the relative reduction in the variance of the k th parameter can be represented as 10 r k σ k 2 1 σ k 2 2 σ k 2 1 the cumulative variance reduction r can then be computed as follows 11 r k 1 n r k where n denotes the number of estimation parameters the r is used as an evaluation index to quantify the data worth of each cml and to optimize the monitoring networks 4 application 4 1 experimental basic description a lab scale 3d solute transport experiment is used as an application example to illustrate the proposed experimental method the heterogeneous structure of experiment media refers to the sedimentary architecture observed in the middle of the nen river northeast china a preliminary geological survey has been carried out there so some hydraulic parameters are available ma et al 2021b a 3d geological profile that comprises medium sand fine sand silty sand and clay is presented in fig 3 a we simplify the sediment into three facies types to reduce the structural complexity the transition probability based indicator geostatistical simulation was used to develop a heterogeneity model that preserved the original volume proportion and mean length of facies types the heterogeneous distribution follows a transition probability function defined as follows dai et al 2007 12 t io h ϕ p o δ io p o e h ϕ λ i where tio denotes the transition probability from facies i to facies o h ϕ is the lag distance in the ϕ direction po is the volume proportion of facies o δio denotes the kronecker delta and λ i is the indicator correlation scale the parameters above can be obtained based on geological statistics of known profiles the developed heterogeneous model was scaled down to 2 0 1 0 0 6 m as shown in fig 3b this model is assumed as experimental heterogeneous media and can be divided into six layers of 10 cm thickness with different facies distributions fig 3c a 3d flow and solute transport model is sequentially established to obtain observation datasets used to support entropy and data worth analysis the model domain is uniformly discretized into a 10 5 10 cm mesh identical to the indicator data for three facies types in fig 3c sodium chloride nacl solution as a conservative tracer is continuously injected into the heterogeneous media the injection source is located at the center of end section x 0 m shown as a square with a side length of 40 cm fig 3b which helps capture the spreading and dispersion behavior in the y and z directions the simulation time and time step are preliminarily assumed as ten days and one day respectively the finite difference groundwater flow model gwf and the generalized control volume finite difference groundwater transport model gwt in the modflow 6 hughes et al 2017 langevin et al 2017 are used for the flow and solute transport simulation respectively the basic settings for modflow 6 are shown in table 1 two constant head boundaries with a hydraulic head difference of 10 cm are implemented to the left and right ends of the model x 0 m and x 2 m the other sides of the domain are assumed as no flow boundaries the hydraulic heads at constant head boundaries exceed the thickness 60 cm of the heterogeneity model ensuring that the entire media domain remains saturated the k and porosity values n within each facies are laboratory measured values through the sample analysis several cmls are preconfigured in the numerical model to support subsequent optimization analysis the researcher can freely determine the number and distribution of cmls increasing the number of cmls help identify more essential monitoring locations however this process may be computationally expensive fig 4 shows the assumed distribution of cmls at the l th layer in this example all cmls are numbered in the form of layer row column for instance the cml in the second row and third column of the first layer is 1 2 3 each layer of the media contains 15 cmls a total of 90 cmls arranged in a regular matrix with three rows and five columns 4 2 realization preparation for entropy analysis considering the unavoidable local heterogeneity caused by manual operation in the media filling process we assume that the ln k of the same facies type follows a gaussian distribution note that in the design framework the selection of methods for constructing heterogeneous k fields realizations is not constrained one way is presented below for reference in modflow 6 the k of each mesh can be assigned independently the heterogeneous k field can be constructed by setting a modified coefficient δ for each mesh 13 k j δ i j k i j 14 δ i s exp g i s g i n m s c i where i and j denote the facies type and mesh number respectively k j denotes modified k in mesh j δ i j is modified coefficient for facies type i in mesh j k i j is the mean of k for facies type i in mesh j table 1 s denotes spatial coordinate m s 0 is the constant mean a l 2 norm exponential covariance function of facies type i for two arbitrary spatial coordinates s s x s y s z and s s x s y s z is used 15 c i s s σ g i 2 exp s x s x λ x i 2 s y s y λ y i 2 s z s z λ z i 2 where σ g i 2 denotes the variance of facies type i λ x i λ y i and λ z i represents the correlation lengths along the x y and z directions respectively σ g i 2 can be approximated by statistical analysis of k measurements and is assumed to be 0 05 for all facies types in this example we consider each facies type with a correlation length of λ d i 0 5 l d i where d denotes the direction x y or z l d i is the mean length of facies type i fig 3c along the d direction the λ x i λ y i and λ z i are 0 21 m 0 1 m and 0 07 m for clay 0 15 m 0 08 m and 0 06 m for silty sand and 0 23 m 0 12 m and 0 08 m for fine sand respectively the karhunen loève expansion kle is used to parameterize the g i s as expressed by zhang and lu 2004 16 g i s m s j 1 ξ j γ i j β i j s where γ i j and β i j s denote eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance function respectively ξ j represent the kle coefficients following the standard normal distribution thus many realizations can be generated by changing the kle coefficients in this example 1000 realizations are prepared for subsequent entropy analysis 4 3 estimation parameters for data worth analysis the premise of data worth analysis is to develop a reasonable approximate numerical model based on credible prior parameters to represent the general characteristics of the solute transport process an optional method is to develop a numerical model using a specific realization generated in section 4 2 the disadvantage of this method is that the inverse result is an equivalent parameter if a heterogeneity related parameter e g k is selected as the estimator increasing the difficulty of identifying the inversion accuracy another convenient and effective way is to average out the local heterogeneity of each facies type therefore we developed a prior numerical model using the mean of heterogeneous parameters in this example table 1 data worth is a quantitative index reflecting the contribution of a dataset to reduce the parameter uncertainty it is indirectly influenced by estimation parameters thus selecting the parameters of interest in the experiment as estimation parameters can usually obtain a satisfactory monitoring network for the conservative experiment in this example the k dominating the solute advection transport and the î characterizing the hydrodynamic dispersion are chosen as estimation parameters the setting information of estimation parameters is presented in table 2 5 result and discussion 5 1 optimization based on entropy analysis the sum of concentrations observed at each cml is set as target data to capture the dynamic characteristics of solute breakthrough a dataset consists of several target data obtained by numerical calculations using multiple realizations the first step in mimr optimization fig 1 is to determine parameter a in eq 5 used to discrete datasets the spatial variability of the dataset in each cml should be consistent before and after discretization li et al 2012 therefore the standard deviations of datasets are calculated and used to identify an appropriate parameter a as presented in fig 5 small values of a fail to effectively eliminate differences between approximate data weakening variability differences at all cmls fig 5a on the other hand an over large value of a will significantly reduce the information content as illustrated in fig 5c the marginal entropies at many cmls with information reduce to 0 which causes an inaccurate representation of the dataset variability fig 5b corresponds to a relatively appropriate value of 0 6 for parameter a determined through trial and error one can see that not only are all cmls distinguishable and informative but the spatial variability of the dataset is well preserved the mimr optimization results are influenced by the realizations employed in numerical models fig 1 multiple mimr optimizations based on different groups of realization can enhance the robustness of the optimization design computation costs increase with the number of groups and the number of realizations in each group therefore the second step in mimr optimization is to determine the number of realizations for single mimr optimization we calculated the mean marginal entropy at all cmls with increasing the number of realizations as shown in fig 6 generally entropy increases rapidly in the early stages and immediately reaches a constant value the curve constantly oscillates but the amplitude decreases gradually with the number of realizations given the progressively fewer benefits and increased computation burden afterward 400 realizations are set as a group to conduct single mimr optimization in this example the mimr optimization was conducted at each layer to make optimized monitoring locations keep uniform distribution the third step in mimr optimization is to determine parameter rc in eq 7 which is the threshold for triggering the termination condition of the mimr the rc directly impacts the number of optimized monitoring locations as presented in fig 7 the number of monitoring locations increases slowly when rc 0 75 and rapidly when rc 0 75 it indicates that 1 a few crucial cmls contain most of the information in each layer 2 many cmls contain little information or their information is duplicated with that of crucial cmls a significant total correlation thus the rc can be used to adjust the number of monitoring locations the critical value of 0 75 is selected for parameter rc in this example the last step is to conduct mimr optimization multiple times 100 in this example using different realization groups each optimization can obtain a set of optimized monitoring locations we calculated the probability of each cml appearing in the optimized location sets as shown in fig 8 the occurrence probability reflects cmls excellence and stability for different mimr optimization in various realizations the low probability means that the cml has the potential to be the optimized monitoring location in only a few cases the cmls with a probability close to 100 are the best choice when the required monitoring locations are small the number of cmls in fig 8 is different at each layer consistent with fig 7 in the range of rc 0 75 it may correspond to the concentration distribution of each layer that is tracer plumes are concentrated in layers 3 and 4 while rarely present in layers 1 and 6 in this example the cmls with an occurrence probability of above 50 are preserved as optimized monitoring locations and used to form the final monitoring network 5 2 optimization based on data worth analysis the first step in data worth calculation fig 1 is to obtain observation data in each cml by the prior numerical model fig 9 illustrates the solute transport behavior in the heterogeneous model using normalized breakthrough curves btcs the hydrogeological heterogeneity of sediments and the location of the tracer injection source significantly affect the shape of btcs fernandez garcia et al 2005 btcs mostly reach a final constant value by ten days the proportions of btcs in layers 1 to 6 are stabilized at 93 93 87 73 73 and 93 respectively btcs mainly show a final constant value below 0 4 while only 6 of them are greater than 0 6 some cmls such as 1 3 4 and 6 3 3 fail to capture the tracer concentration change and a majority of them are concentrated in layers 1 and 6 the various btcs representing concentration responses are the basis for quantifying the data worth of cmls the second step in data worth calculation is to calculate the variance changes r k of estimation parameters table 2 by incorporating observation data at each cml into the calibration dataset the observation data is the modeled concentration at the corresponding cml see fig 9 the r k is calculated by eq 10 and presented in fig 10 one can see that fig 10 comprises 540 grids with the same size corresponding to the impact of 90 sets of observation data on reducing the relative variances of the six estimation parameters shown on the left hand side of the grid the grid color reflects the degree of variance reduction where the value of 1 means that the estimation parameter is possibly identifiable by observation data and 0 means that such data does not contribute to parameter identification cmls typically provide different benefits in r k of each parameter reflecting the sensitivity difference of estimation parameters to the concentration response the grid with blue color indicates that the concentration response at such cml has a negligible impact on the corresponding estimation parameter the data worth of each cml can be evaluated by six connected grids representing the r k of the six parameters which provides a relatively intuitive view of the spatial distribution of cmls with high data worth the high worth cmls i e red grids compose 8 of the total these locations are vertically accumulated in layers 2 4 and 5 which is likely to be influenced by the spatial location of the tracer injection source moreover high worth cmls show apparent regularity in the horizontal direction particularly in rows 1 and 2 composing 93 of the total even though the data worth of cmls is related to the observed concentration response it is not entirely determined by the degree of concentration change the btcs support this opinion in fig 9 for example almost all btcs that fail to capture concentration response correspond to low worth cmls i e blue grids and some btcs stabilized at high concentrations e g 2 2 1 4 2 1 also correspond to low worth cmls the last step is to calculate the data worth r and select high worth cmls as optimized monitoring locations the r is calculated by eq 11 and presented in fig 11 one can see that 38 cmls accounting for 42 of the total are listed in fig 11 while the remaining cmls are of no data worth the proportion in each layer is relatively uniform 13 2 10 5 18 4 18 4 21 1 and 18 4 respectively 2 2 3 is the most important cml with an r of 5 99 and 3 2 1 ranks 38th with an r of 0 05 according to fig 11 optimized monitoring locations can be selected from top to bottom when the required monitoring locations are small in this example all cmls with data worth are preserved as optimized monitoring locations and used to form the final monitoring network 5 3 optimized monitoring network and experimental duration the final monitoring network consists of 47 optimized monitoring locations obtained by entropy and data worth analysis as shown in fig 12 among them 15 monitoring locations accounting for only 32 of the total are the mutual optimization results of entropy and data worth analysis it indicates that most monitoring locations cannot simultaneously have both high data worth and large information content confirming the necessity and effectiveness of the integration of entropy and data worth analysis the proportion of monitoring locations in each layer is uniform 12 9 14 9 19 1 19 1 19 1 and 14 9 respectively the hierarchical optimization in entropy analysis for 3d networks may contribute significantly to this result the monitoring locations in clay silty sand and fine sand are 53 2 27 7 and 19 1 respectively this result is affected by multiple factors such as the location of cmls volume proportion of each facies type and facies distribution structure thus it is quite difficult to quantify the relationship between facies type and optimized monitoring network although the capability of monitoring networks to characterize the shape of contaminant plumes is not the focus of the optimization design it is useful and of interest to some studies therefore the plumes were reconstructed using 47 optimized monitoring locations by the natural neighborhood interpolation method an arbitrary realization section 4 2 is used to compare simulated plumes with interpolated plumes as presented in fig 13 we selected the tenth day as the comparison time because the plume shape and distribution barely changed afterward fig 9 the form of plumes is highly irregular reflecting how media heterogeneity controls the solute transport behavior facies type with low k e g clay blocks the plume migration in layers 4 and 5 the blocked flow in the horizontal direction enhances the vertical migration of the solute thus under the combined impact of low k facies and vertical dispersion contaminant plumes can even be observed in layers 1 and 6 further the connected facies with high k e g fine sand forms a fast advection channel providing the primary migration pathways for the plume layers 2 and 3 the channel allows the tracer to migrate rapidly out of the heterogeneous sediments avoiding the local expansion of the plume in general the optimized monitoring network can capture the plumes shape and solute transport pathways in each layer another topic of interest is how to select a cost effective experimental duration experiment time determines the size of observation data which directly impacts entropy and data worth analysis we conducted the sensitivity analysis of joint entropy and uncertainty of estimation parameters to experiment time based on the optimized monitoring network variation of the joint entropy and variation coefficients of parameters under different experiment times is presented in fig 14 both entropy and variation coefficients are mean values calculated based on a group of realizations one can see that the joint entropy increases with time and finally tends to a constant value of about 6 5 the variation coefficients decrease with time and eventually stabilize at 0 0 12 due to the local heterogeneity of the same facies type in the realization the variation coefficients of some estimation parameters cannot approach zero day 5 is the earliest time when total information tends to the maximum and uncertainty tends to the minimum this result is affected by the simulated time step that represents the frequency of data acquisition to some extent monitoring frequency may interest some researchers but it is beyond the discussion scope of this study given the progressively fewer benefits and increased time cost five days is recommended as experimental duration in this example based on the optimized monitoring network and suggested experimental duration we calculated the values and standard deviations of estimation parameters table 2 in 100 realizations as shown in fig 15 the mean of estimated values for each parameter is 5 7e 3 0 76 11 6 0 053 1e 2 and 1 5e 3 respectively the former three values represent the effective k of each facies type similar to the mean value in table 1 the mean of standard deviations for each parameter is small enough indicating 8 5e 4 2 1e 2 2 8e 1 1 1e 2 7 7e 4 and 1 9e 4 respectively most estimation parameters can be estimated as accurately as expected confirming the rationality of the optimized monitoring network and experimental duration 6 summary and conclusions the study develops an integrated experimental design framework with entropy and data worth analysis to guide the monitoring network optimization and experiment duration selection for solute transport experiments in heterogeneous sediments entropy analysis considers the unavoidable local heterogeneity in the actual experiment and identifies a stable cml set with maximum information through multiple mimr optimizations data worth analysis quantifies the ability of observation data to reduce the uncertainty of key parameters and determine the cmls with highest worth the final monitoring network comprises optimized monitoring locations obtained based on entropy and data worth analysis the recommended experimental duration is the earliest time when total information of the monitoring network reaches the maximum and parameter uncertainty approaches the minimum the proposed design method is presented in detail through a lab scale 3d tracer experiment where 47 optimized monitoring locations are selected from 90 cmls and the experimental duration is five days discretization constant a the number of realizations for mimr optimization and ratio coefficient rc have significant influence on entropy analysis results the appropriate parameter a can be determined by trial and error very small or over large values of a lead to the distortion of spatial variability of original dataset and thereby unrepresentative analysis results the stability and computation cost of a single mimr optimization increase with the number of realizations the rc can be used to adjust the number of optimized monitoring locations the location number increases rapidly when rc is more than a specific critical value the application example shows how to determine the abovementioned parameters multiple mimr optimizations can significantly enhance the robustness of entropy analysis cmls with a probability of more than 50 are recommended to be preserved as optimized monitoring locations data worth analysis relies on a reasonable approximate numerical model that preserves the main characteristics of the experimental parameters the data worth is related to the concentration response but not determined by the degree of concentration variation estimation parameters have a significant influence on the results of data worth analysis therefore key parameters in the experiment are suggested as estimation parameters the proportion of cmls with data worth is generally small and the high worth cmls are even less than 10 in the example the ranking of cmls provides convenience and flexibility for selecting optimized monitoring locations the optimized monitoring network can provide sufficient information with high data worth it not only characterizes the distribution of contaminant plumes with high performance but promotes an accurate estimation of flow and transport parameters with the extension of experiment time the total information of the monitoring network increases to the maximum while the uncertainty of estimation parameters decreases to the minimum the suggested experimental duration is the critical value when the total information is stable and the parameter uncertainty is reduced effectively the proposed framework can be transferred from the presented lab scale example
