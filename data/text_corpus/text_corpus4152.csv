20760,the connection between two submarine pipelines is usually made by welding in the process of welding the incomplete penetration incomplete fusion porosity cracks and other welding defects are hardly preventable the incomplete penetration defects at the root of pipeline girth welds can greatly reduce the safety of submarine pipelines and increase the risk of pipeline failure in this paper the safety assessment of incomplete penetration defects at the root of pipeline girth welds are studied firstly a novel model of incomplete penetration defects at the root of girth weld pipelines is provided then an analytical solution of the novel model is obtained according to stress function method next the residual strength equation of the incomplete penetration defects at the root of pipeline girth welds is derived based on the analytical solution in the end the calculated results of the residual strength equation are verified by finite element method fem and experiment the results indicate that the calculated values are in good agreement with the fem and experiment in addition the results indicate that the safety assessment method of incomplete penetration defects at the root of pipeline girth welds is feasible it is beneficial for the safety assessment of pipelines with incomplete penetration defects keywords submarine pipeline incomplete penetration girth weld safety assessment residual strength 1 introduction pipeline is a crucial device to transport liquids and gases which can be used in hydrogen transportation chen et al 2020 oil and gas transportation alamri 2020 metallurgical industry and nuclear power plant yang et al 2020 etc some pressure pipelines are even used to carry flammable explosive toxic or corrosive high pressure fluids and gases once the pipeline fails it will cause serious consequences gao et al 2019 the submarine pipeline is a common type of pressure pipeline many submarine pipelines are joined together by welding due to the influence of welding manner welding condition and welding technique it is inevitable that a large number of girth weld defects exist in welded joints teran et al 2019 the girth weld defect is one of the volumetric defects in submarine pipelines the incomplete penetration defects at the root of pipeline girth welds can reduce the safety of submarine pipeline and increase the risk of pipeline failure jin et al 2010 therefore it is necessary to study the safety and integrity of pipelines with girth weld defects in the process of oil and gas transportation the pipelines bear high internal pressure in order to improve the efficiency of transportation the working pressure inside the pipeline will increase further increasing internal pressure makes the safety problem of pipeline and weld between pipelines become more and more prominent the incomplete penetration defects of pipelines are usually solved by simplifying the volumetric defect model the residual strength of pipeline with volumetric defect has been studied for more than 40 years kuanhai et al 2019a these pipeline defects are usually reduced to regular defects such as pit corrosion defects mokhtari and melchers 2020 groove defects zhang and zhou 2020 or gouge defects kuanhai et al 2019a based on these models many residual strength equations have provided kuanhai et al 2019b there are two types of the residual strength equations one is chosen as the international standard such as asme dnv etc the other is the research that is still under academic discussion the first type of research is listed in table 1 these residual strength equations are obtained by fitting experimental data or semi empirical methods the application scope accuracy and extensibility are largely affected by the original data moreover the semi empirical equations are developed based on a number of assumptions the main problem of this type of research is that if the load and material parameters are out of range the predictions may not be accurate scholars are mainly engaged in the second type of research deng et al 2019 2021 aiming at the girth weld defect of pipeline scholars have analyzed its safety from different angles netto et al 2008 analyzed the fatigue performance of pre strained pipes with girth weld defects paddea et al 2012 measured the residual stresses of girth weld in a steel pipe by neutron diffraction and found that the highest tensile stresses resided near the outer boundary of the heat affected zone and towards the weld root region dong dong 2007 and song et al 2020 presented several controlling parameters governing weld residual stress distributions of girth welds in pipe by doing this a unified framework for prescribing residual stress distributions is outlined for fitness for service assessment of vessel and pipe girth welds lee et al lee and chang 2013 studied the burst pressure of a pressurized super duplex stainless steel pipeline with girth weld defects in reverse osmosis desalination plants wan 2011 obtained the safety assessment curve of the pipelines with weld defects and analyzed the interference effect between different defects wang 2010 studied the safety of pipelines with girth weld defects based on extended net section collapse nsc criterion jiang 2013 analyzed the ultimate bearing capacity of the pipelines with girth weld defects under internal pressure and bending moment lei et al lai et al 2016 analyzed 32 inch oil pipeline with girth weld defects by full scale burst experiment and finite element method bastola et al 2017 studied the strain capacity of girth welds of x80 seamless pipelines in the second type of research many scholars simplified the incomplete penetration defects at the root of pipeline girth welds into a groove model for numerical calculation wan 2011 wang 2010 jiang 2013 however the groove model has some inherent defects in finite element analysis such as stress singularity and stress concentration the stress singularity is a point of the finite element mesh where the stress does not convergence towards a specific value as we keep refining the mesh the stress at this point keeps increasing theoretically the stress at the singularity is infinite stress concentration is the accumulation of stress in a body due to sudden change in its geometry in addition the groove model is not easy to carry out further theoretical analysis for the incomplete penetration defects at the root of pipeline girth welds it is necessary to propose a novel method to assess the residual strength of pipelines with girth weld defects on the basis of previous work chen et al 2017a we proposed a novel mechanical model for the incomplete penetration defects at the root of pipeline girth welds a double circular arc dca model is adopted to depict the incomplete penetration defects at the root of pipeline girth welds compared with previous girth weld defect model the dca model can overcome the problem of stress singularity and stress concentration in finite element analysis besides the dca model is mathematically solvable in this paper we studied the residual strength of submarine pipelines with incomplete penetration defects theoretically and numerically in section 2 the incomplete penetration defects of pipelines are simplified as a dca model in section 3 a residual strength equation of submarine pipelines with incomplete penetration defects is obtained in section 4 the accuracy of residual strength equation is validated by finite element method and experimental data in the end the discussions and conclusions are given 2 mechanical model of incomplete penetration defects of pipelines in this paper we are interested in the incomplete penetration defects at the root of pipeline girth weld which is caused by the metal not filling the groove completely as shown in fig 1 in the incomplete penetration defects the weld metal doesn t fully extend through the joint thickness here we do not pay attention to the causes of incomplete penetration defects but mainly focus on the impact of incomplete penetration defects on the safety of oil and gas pipelines to analyze the safety of pipelines with incomplete penetration defects researchers tend to regularize the defects as a groove defect cunha and netto 2017 as shown in fig 2 a because the modeling is convenient in the finite element analysis the groove model is used for pipeline safety analysis in many literatures ma et al 2013 shuai et al 2017 ma et al 2013 shuai et al 2017 nevertheless the groove defect has two notable shortcomings a because the regularity of the model is not good the groove model is difficult to depict mathematically b because the model cannot be described mathematically the analytical solution of groove model is difficult to derive due to a and b the groove model is not suitable for theoretical analysis usually the groove model is often used in finite element analysis however as mentioned in the introduction the groove model will encounter stress singularity and stress concentration problems in the finite element analysis scholars need considerable skill to avoid stress singularity and stress concentration in finite element analysis in this paper we adopt the double circular arc dca model to simulate the incomplete penetration defects of pipelines compared with groove model the dca model can be depicted mathematically and solved analytically meanwhile there is no stress singularity and stress concentration problem in the finite element analysis of dca model for incomplete penetration defects of oil and gas pipelines the dca model is a more suitable mechanical model the dca model includes two circles one is inner wall and the other is the outer wall as shown in fig 2 b as mentioned in literature chen et al 2017a the dca model can be depicted by the bipolar coordinate system in addition the analytical solution of the dca model can be derived in the end there is no obvious stress singularity and stress concentration in finite element analysis the dca model has remarkable advantages in the safety assessment of the pipeline with defects therefore we stick to the dca model to assess the safety of incomplete penetration defects at the root of pipeline grith weld in this paper in the dca model there are two important parameters the ratio of eccentricity ϕ and the ratio of the maximum incomplete penetration length to wall thickness φ according to fig 2 b the relationship between the two parameters can be expressed as 1 φ b i b o b c b o b i b o 2 d t 2 ϕ where d is the distance of eccentricity d o 0 o 1 in the end we establish a bipolar coordinate system in dca model as shown in fig 3 here α β is a pair of coordinate component of the bipolar coordinate system α i and α o denote the inner and outer wall of the model point m and n are the focus of the model chen et al 2017a 3 burst pressure equation the relationship between the bipolar

the external pressure p o 0 we assume that once the maximum stress of the incomplete penetration defects reaches the ultimate tensile strength the girth weld defects of pipelines will burst our previous research has made similar assumptions chen et al 2015 2017b in the dca model the maximum stress point is b c as shown in fig 2 b the coordinate of b c is 22 α α i β π by inserting eq 22 and p

of thickness to diameter φ is the ratio of defect to wall thickness due to σ β σ α the hoop stress σ β is considered as the key parameter for the burst of the incomplete penetration defects of pipelines according to the maximum tensile stress strength criterion the failure condition of the incomplete penetration defects is 24 σ β σ b where is σ b the ultimate tensile strength by inserting

element analysis 4 1 finite element models in order to obtain in depth understanding of the residual strength of submarine pipelines with incomplete penetration defects a three dimensional finite element model was developed by using the commercial software abaqus v2014 in this paper an elastic plastic finite element method fem with large deformation is applied to simulate the failure process the cross section of submarine pipelines with girth weld defects is shown as fig 2 b the geometrical parameters and material properties are listed in table 2 the finite element meshes of incomplete penetration defects is shown in fig 4 the meshes are divided into three layers along the wall thickness the overall size of the meshes is set to 15 the element type is c3d8r the c3d8r element is an 8 node linear brick and reduced integration with an hourglass control element compared with a full integral element a linear reduced integral unit contains only one integral point in the centre of the element the number of nodes is 1120 the number of elements is 630 because the most dangerous area is located in the incomplete penetration defects of the pipelines the other areas of the pipelines are relatively safe therefore in the finite element analysis we only establish the finite element model of the incomplete penetration defects 4 2 boundary conditions during the transportation the stress of submarine pipelines is complex internal pressure external pressure pipeline vibration temperature difference and so on will affect the pipeline stress here we focus on the burst behavior of submarine pipelines in the transportation in our theoretical analysis and finite element calculation we only consider the effect of internal pressure on the incomplete penetration defects of pipelines other loads such as external pressures axial forces bending moments and torque loads are ignored in addition the boundary conditions at both ends of the incomplete penetration defects also affect the load distribution in the girth weld the radial deformation of the girth weld can occur after internal pressure but the axial deformation generally does not occur therefore we constrain the axial deformation of the incomplete penetration defects in finite element analysis the rest deformations are not constrained 4 3 algorithm the pipeline burst is a typical unstable geometrically nonlinear behavior for these behaviors the risk method is often used to obtain the stress and deformation in this paper we adopt the risks method to study to burst pressure of the incomplete penetration defects in riks method the load is used as an additional unknown the loads and displacements are solved simultaneously the direction of load inside the pipeline changes with the deformation of pipelines and always keeps a vertical relationship with the inner wall of pipelines abaqus begins reducing the pressure inside the pipeline when it gradually increases to the critical pressure of the pipeline bursting and then the simulation continues this approach provides solutions regardless of whether the response is stable or unstable here we apply an initial load of 1 mpa gradually the load increases to maximum and then it starts to go down as shown in fig 5 the maximum value of the load is the burst pressure of the pipelines with incomplete penetration defects 4 4 analysis of mesh independence in order to reduce the influence of grid density on the calculation results we made an analysis of mesh independence in this paper the influence of mesh size on calculation results is shown in table 3 we carried out the numerical experiment with four sets of pipelines with different sizes for each size of pipeline the mesh size is changed from 5 to 30 the results show that the mesh size has little influence on the calculation results in this model therefore we choose any mesh size from 5 to 30 for calculation in this paper 4 5 calculated results the burst process of incomplete penetration defects is dynamic and instantaneous as time changes the stress and deformation contours of the incomplete penetration defects of pipelines is shown in fig 6 fig 6 a indicates the beginning of the burst the stress begins to increase in the thinner area of grith weld defects fig 6 b indicates that the stress in the thinnest area increases gradually fig 6 c indicates that the stress in the thinnest area continues to increase the burst is about to happen fig 6 d indicates incomplete penetration area of the pipelines has been no longer working the calculation results of the fem are listed in table 4 the diameters of the incomplete penetration defects are listed in the second column of the table the initial and minimum wall thickness of the incomplete penetration defects are listed in the third and fourth column of the table the material parameters are listed in the fifth sixth and seventh column of the table the experimental data in the eighth column of the table which comes from literature stewart and jritchie 1994 our calculated results are listed in the ninth column of the table the relative errors re are listed in the last column the results show that the calculated values of fem are in agreement with the experimental data the maximum error between experiment and fem is 2 55 and the minimum error is 0 56 the results also show that the dca model is quite suitable for calculating the residual strength of pipelines with grith weld defects 5 discussions pressure pipeline is a special equipment for continuous transport of fluid medium a large number of girth weld defects exist at pipeline joints due to high pressure in the pipelines the girth weld is prone to leakage and burst in this paper the residual strength of the pipelines with incomplete penetration defects at the root of grith weld is studied based on theoretical and numerical method in the analysis we encountered many difficulties the most difficult problem is to establish a mechanical model of girth welds with incomplete root penetration defects for a pipeline the actual shape of the welding area is extremely irregular to simplify the model we have to regularize the incomplete penetration defects of the pipeline how to regularize the defect model of girth weld is a complicated problem many scholars use volumetric defect models to simulate girth weld defects for instance jin jin et al 2010 simplified the incomplete penetration defects into a groove model while the groove model has some inherent disadvantages in calculations such as stress singularity and stress concentration different from groove model we simplified the incomplete penetration defects of pipelines into a dca model the dca model can effectively avoids stress concentration and stress singularity which can further be used for theoretical analysis and numerical calculation in addition we take out the incomplete penetration defects for finite element analysis in this paper in welding structure there is a complicated coupling relation between weld and pipeline it is very difficult to take out the weld structure separately to calculate the residual strength the difficulty is mainly reflected in the determination of boundary conditions the burst process of pipeline with incomplete penetration defects is quasi static elastic plastic process with large deformation which contains abundant material nonlinearity and geometric nonlinearity girth weld structure is not only subjected to high pressure inside the pipeline but also subjected to a small amount of axial load due to poisson effect and large deformation of the pipeline wall in our finite element model the interaction between the weld material and the pipeline is simplified these small amounts of axial loads have also been ignored in the three dimensional finite element model the axial displacement of the girth weld structure is set as 0 this displacement boundary condition means that the upper and lower surfaces of girth weld structures can only move and deform along the radial direction next it is not easy to choose an appropriate strength theory for pipeline burst under internal pressure strength theory is used to judge whether a material will fail under complex stresses which is a fantastic and interesting subject of research the problem is seemingly simple but extremely complex until now scholars have not fully understood it scholars yu 2002 have provided hundreds of strength theory to solve the problem unfortunately there is not yet a strength theory that can be applied in all kinds of situations here eq 25 is obtained based on the maximum tensile stress strength theory the fem is obtained based on von mises strength theory the two calculated results are listed in the eighth and ninth columns of table 5 the calculated results of eq 25 are slightly less than that of fem it is because the two sets of data are based on different theories the calculated results based on the von mises strength theory are always slightly higher than the experimental data as shown in table 4 while the results based on the maximum tensile strength theory are always slightly lower than the experimental data as shown in table 5 welding is an important method of connection the research results of this paper are not only instructive to submarine pipelines but also to industrial pipelines its significance is reflected in strength assessment life assessment and integrity assessment for these pipelines in addition not only for pipelines the work of this paper may be beneficial for studying the strength of other structures after welding it provides a new way to study the residual strength of structure after welding theoretically in the end the research of this paper has some significance for controlling welding structure improving welding quality and welding level this paper is only the beginning of our research on pipeline containing weld defects the load we are considering is also limited to the internal pressure in the actual service of the pipeline there are many types of loads such as external pressure jeon et al 2015 gong et al 2012 bending moment li et al 2014 2020 thermal stress peng et al 2018 taler and kaczmarski 2016 and cyclic load qin and cheng 2020 zhu et al 2017 etc under these loads or combined loads the failure behaviours of submarine pipelines with weld defects are worthy of further study besides the strength theory of pipeline burst is also a very interesting area of research finding or developing a theory of strength suitable for pipeline burst is something we have been doing for a long time chen et al 2017a unfortunately we have tried many strength theories but there are always imperfections in the future we plan to carry out further research on the submarine pipelines with girth weld defect in the two aspects 6 conclusions in this paper the mechanical characteristics and safety assessment of incomplete penetration defects at the root of pipeline girth welds are studied firstly the dca model which is used to study the burst pressure of the pipes with corrosion defects can be used to analyze the residual strength of incomplete penetration defects of pipelines compared with traditional groove model the dca model can avoid stress concentration and stress singularity in finite element simulation the application range of the dca model is greatly extended secondly based on the dca model the residual strength of incomplete penetration defects of submarine pipelines can be predicted accurately the relative errors are within an acceptable range when compared with experiment and fem as shown in table 3 in the end a novel method for safety assessment of pipelines with incomplete penetration defects at the root of girth welds is presented it is helpful to establish a new pipeline safety evaluation system credit authorship contribution statement ke qing lu writing original draft preparation methodology writing review editing jia qi lin

the introduction the groove model will encounter stress singularity and stress concentration problems in the finite element analysis scholars need considerable skill to avoid stress singularity and stress concentration in finite element analysis in this paper we adopt the double circular arc dca model to simulate the incomplete penetration defects of pipelines compared with groove model the dca model can be depicted mathematically and solved analytically meanwhile there is no stress singularity and stress concentration problem in the finite element analysis of dca model for incomplete penetration defects of oil and gas pipelines the dca model is a more suitable mechanical model the dca model includes two circles one is inner wall and the other is the outer wall as shown in fig 2 b as mentioned in literature chen et al 2017a the dca model can be depicted by the bipolar coordinate system in addition the analytical solution of the dca model can be derived in the end there is no obvious stress singularity and stress concentration in finite element analysis the dca model has remarkable advantages in the safety assessment of the pipeline with defects therefore we stick to the dca model to assess the safety of incomplete penetration defects at the root of pipeline grith weld in this paper in the dca model there are two important parameters the ratio of eccentricity ϕ and the ratio of the maximum incomplete penetration length to wall thickness φ according to fig 2 b the relationship between the two parameters can be expressed as 1 φ b i b o b c b o b i b o 2 d t 2 ϕ where d is the distance of eccentricity d o 0 o 1 in the end we establish a bipolar coordinate system in dca model as shown in fig 3 here α β is a pair of coordinate component of the bipolar coordinate system α i and α o denote the inner and outer wall of the model point m and n are the focus of the model chen et al 2017a 3 burst pressure equation the relationship between the bipolar

the external pressure p o 0 we assume that once the maximum stress of the incomplete penetration defects reaches the ultimate tensile strength the girth weld defects of pipelines will burst our

element analysis 4 1 finite element models in order to obtain in depth understanding of the residual strength of submarine pipelines with incomplete penetration defects a three dimensional finite element model was developed by using the commercial software abaqus v2014 in this paper an elastic plastic finite element method fem with large deformation is applied to simulate the failure process the cross section of submarine pipelines with girth weld defects is shown as fig 2 b the geometrical parameters and material properties are listed in table 2 the finite element meshes of incomplete penetration defects is shown in fig 4 the meshes are divided into three layers along the wall thickness the overall size of the meshes is set to 15 the element type is c3d8r the c3d8r element is an 8 node linear brick and reduced integration with an hourglass control element compared with a full integral element a linear reduced integral unit contains only one integral point in the centre of the element the number of nodes is 1120 the number of elements is 630 because the most dangerous area is located in the incomplete penetration defects of the pipelines the other areas of the pipelines are relatively safe therefore in the finite element analysis we only establish the finite element model of the incomplete penetration defects 4 2 boundary conditions during the transportation the stress of submarine pipelines is complex internal pressure external pressure pipeline vibration temperature difference and so on will affect the pipeline stress here we focus on the burst behavior of submarine pipelines in the transportation in our theoretical analysis and finite element calculation we only consider the effect of internal pressure on the incomplete penetration defects of pipelines other loads such as external pressures axial forces bending moments and torque loads are ignored in addition the boundary conditions at both ends of the incomplete penetration defects also affect the load distribution in the girth weld the radial deformation of the girth weld can occur after internal pressure but the axial deformation generally does not occur therefore we constrain the axial deformation of the incomplete penetration defects in finite element analysis the rest deformations are not constrained 4 3 algorithm the pipeline burst is a typical unstable geometrically nonlinear behavior for these behaviors the risk method is often used to obtain the stress and deformation in this paper we adopt the risks method to study to burst pressure of the incomplete penetration defects in riks method the load is used as an additional unknown the loads and displacements are solved simultaneously the direction of load inside the pipeline changes with the deformation of pipelines and always keeps a vertical relationship with the inner wall of pipelines abaqus begins reducing the pressure inside the pipeline when it gradually increases to the critical pressure of the pipeline bursting and then the simulation continues this approach provides solutions regardless of whether the response is stable or unstable here we apply an initial load of 1 mpa gradually the load increases to maximum and then it starts to go down as shown in fig 5 the maximum value of the load is the burst pressure of the pipelines with incomplete penetration defects 4 4 analysis of mesh independence in order to reduce the influence of grid density on the calculation results we made an analysis of mesh independence in this paper the influence of mesh size on calculation results is shown in table 3 we carried out the numerical experiment with four sets of pipelines with different sizes for each size of pipeline the mesh size is changed from 5 to 30 the results show that the mesh size has little influence on the calculation results in this model therefore we choose any mesh size from 5 to 30 for calculation in this paper 4 5 calculated results the burst process of incomplete penetration defects is dynamic and instantaneous as time changes the stress and deformation contours of the incomplete penetration defects of pipelines is shown in fig 6 fig 6 a indicates the beginning of the burst the stress begins to increase in the thinner area of grith weld defects fig 6 b indicates that the stress in the thinnest area increases gradually fig 6 c indicates that the stress in the thinnest area continues to increase the burst is about to happen fig 6 d indicates incomplete penetration area of the pipelines has been no longer working the calculation results of the fem are listed in table 4 the diameters of the incomplete penetration defects are listed in the second column of the table the initial and minimum wall thickness of the incomplete penetration defects are listed in the third and fourth column of the table the material parameters are listed in the fifth sixth and seventh column of the table the experimental data in the eighth column of the table which comes from literature stewart and jritchie 1994 our calculated results are listed in the ninth column of the table the relative errors re are listed in the last column the results show that the calculated values of fem are in agreement with the experimental data the maximum error between experiment and fem is 2 55 and the minimum error is 0 56 the results also show that the dca model is quite suitable for calculating the residual strength of pipelines with grith weld defects 5 discussions pressure pipeline is a special equipment for continuous transport of fluid medium a large number of girth weld defects exist at pipeline joints due to high pressure in the pipelines the girth weld is prone to leakage and burst in this paper the residual strength of the pipelines with incomplete penetration defects at the root of grith weld is studied based on theoretical and numerical method in the analysis we encountered many difficulties the most difficult problem is to establish a mechanical model of girth welds with incomplete root penetration defects for a pipeline the actual shape of the welding area is extremely irregular to simplify the model we have to regularize the incomplete penetration defects of the pipeline how to regularize the defect model of girth weld is a complicated problem many scholars use volumetric defect models to simulate girth weld defects for instance jin jin et al 2010 simplified the incomplete penetration defects into a groove model while the groove model has some inherent disadvantages in calculations such as stress singularity and stress concentration different from groove model we simplified the incomplete penetration defects of pipelines into a dca model the dca model can effectively avoids stress concentration and stress singularity which can further be used for theoretical analysis and numerical calculation in addition we take out the incomplete penetration defects for finite element analysis in this paper in welding structure there is a complicated coupling relation between weld and pipeline it is very difficult to take out the weld structure separately to calculate the residual strength the difficulty is mainly reflected in the determination of boundary conditions the burst process of pipeline with incomplete penetration defects is quasi static elastic plastic process with large deformation which contains abundant material nonlinearity and geometric nonlinearity girth weld structure is not only subjected to high pressure inside the pipeline but also subjected to a small amount of axial load due to poisson effect and large deformation of the pipeline wall in our finite element model the interaction between the weld material and the pipeline is simplified these small amounts of axial loads have also been ignored in the three dimensional finite element model the axial displacement of the girth weld structure is set as 0 this displacement boundary condition means that the upper and lower surfaces of girth weld structures can only move and deform along the radial direction next it is not easy to choose an appropriate strength theory for pipeline burst under internal pressure strength theory is used to judge whether a material will fail under complex stresses which is a fantastic and interesting subject of research the problem is seemingly simple but extremely complex until now scholars have not fully understood it scholars yu 2002 have provided hundreds of strength theory to solve the problem unfortunately there is not yet a strength theory that can be applied in all kinds of situations here eq 25 is obtained based on the maximum tensile stress strength theory the fem is obtained based on von mises strength theory the two calculated results are listed in the eighth and ninth columns of table 5 the calculated results of eq 25 are slightly less than that of fem it is because the two sets of data are based on different theories the calculated results based on the von mises strength theory are always slightly higher than the experimental data as shown in table 4 while the results based on the maximum tensile strength theory are always slightly lower than the experimental data as shown in table 5 welding is an important method of connection the research results of this paper are not only instructive to submarine pipelines but also to industrial pipelines its significance is reflected in strength assessment life assessment and integrity assessment for these pipelines in addition not only for pipelines the work of this paper may be beneficial for studying the strength of other structures after welding it provides a new way to study the residual strength of structure after welding theoretically in the end the research of this paper has some significance for controlling welding structure improving welding quality and welding level this paper is only the beginning of our research on pipeline containing weld defects the load we are considering is also limited to the internal pressure in the actual service of the pipeline there are many types of loads such as external pressure jeon et al 2015 gong et al 2012 bending moment li et al 2014 2020 thermal stress peng et al 2018 taler and kaczmarski 2016 and cyclic load qin and cheng 2020 zhu et al 2017 etc under these loads or combined loads the failure behaviours of submarine pipelines with weld defects are worthy of further study besides the strength theory of pipeline burst is also a very interesting area of research finding or developing a theory of strength suitable for pipeline burst is something we have been doing for a long time chen et al 2017a unfortunately we have tried many strength theories but there are always imperfections in the future we plan to carry out further research on the submarine pipelines with girth weld defect in the two aspects 6 conclusions in this paper the mechanical characteristics and safety assessment of incomplete penetration defects at the root of pipeline girth welds are studied firstly the dca model which is used to study the burst pressure of the pipes with corrosion defects can be used to analyze the residual strength of incomplete penetration defects of pipelines compared with traditional groove model the dca model can avoid stress concentration and stress singularity in finite element simulation the application range of the dca model is greatly extended secondly based on the dca model the residual strength of incomplete penetration defects of submarine pipelines can be predicted accurately the relative errors are within an acceptable range when compared with experiment and fem as shown in table 3 in the end a novel method for safety assessment of pipelines with incomplete penetration defects at the root of girth welds is presented it is helpful to establish a new pipeline safety evaluation system credit authorship contribution statement ke qing lu writing original draft preparation methodology writing review editing jia qi lin

20761,an analytical solution for evaluating the critical pressure of pipes under hydrostatic pressure was proposed the stability equations and the correct boundary conditions for 3d problem in cylindrical coordinates were established by using energy method the stability equations were solved together with the derived correct boundary conditions and the solution of the critical pressure for elastic buckling of the pipes was expressed in closed form by adopting the three layers model for elastic plastic buckling analysis the solution was available for the critical pressure prediction of the pipes in elastic plastic collapse the effect of the initial ovality was incorporated in formulation it shows that the increase in the magnitude of the axial compressive stress results in the further reduction in the critical pressure for fully elastic buckling while the pressures for elastic plastic collapse are always higher than those of the 2d solutions based on the plane strain deformation the influence of the initial ovality on the pressure capacity of the elastic plastic buckling of the pipes was discussed and the results from the present approach were compared with the other solutions and experiments keywords elastic buckling elastic plastic collapse single wall pipe eigenvalue layers 1 introduction pipelines are widely used in offshore structures and the collapse is one of the main failure forms of the pipes the classical solution given by timonshenko and gere 1961 is expressed in a simple form for thin shells the solution was extended to infinite cylindrical shells by adopting the assumption of the plane strain deformation and also to the estimation of the critical pressure of the pipes at initial yield and the elastic plastic collapse of a corroded cylindrical shells hoo fatt 1999 based on the levy timoshenko approach fraldi and guarracino 2011 part 1 2011 part 2 developed an improved model for pressure capacity prediction of the rings in elastic plastic buckling and the influence of the initial ovality was incorporated later yan et al 2016 extended the model to collapse pressure analysis of pipes with initial corrosion although one dimensional analysis without some complex calculations in mathematics has certain advantages it does have some limitations one of the main factors neglected in 1d model that affects the pressure capacity of the pipes is the transverse shear as the pipe becomes thick the effect of the transverse shear is considerable and the classical solution presents overestimation of the critical pressure kardomateas 1993 papadakis 2008 the issue was widely addressed and attracted much attention during the past decades in the first order deformation theory the effect of transverse shear was introduced by assuming that the deformation is a linear function of thickness fu and waas 1995 while in the high order deformation theory it was expressed as a cubic function of thickness simitses and anastasiadis 1992 simitses et al 1993 anastasiadis and simitses 1993 in refined shell theory voyiadjis and woelke 2004 voyiadjis and shi 1991 the hoop and radial deformations were obtained by solving the differential equations analytically and the effects of transverse shear stress and strain were incorporated in this approach papadakis 2008 employed this theory to develop the analytical solution of the critical pressure calculation for the thick cylindrical shells under external pressure the expressions for two cases with the rotations only and with both of the shear strains and rotations were established kardomateas 1993 proposed the solution to evaluate the critical pressure of the thick orthotropic cylindrical shells by solving directly the stability equations in novozhilov 1953 and the same method was employed in his later works kardomateas and chung 1994 kardomateas 2000 by using the conservative work potential approach ji and waas 2014 derived the stability equations and the corresponding boundary conditions for the elastic buckling of the pipes in plane strain deformation most recently li et al 2019 established the analytical solution for the collapse pressure of the pipes different from the elastic solutions mentioned above the solution in li et al 2019 was applied to critical pressure prediction of the elastic plastic collapse by introduced the three layers model the pressure bifurcation occurs when the stress at the inner radius of the pipe reaches the material proportional limit instead of the yielding stress meanwhile a series of experiments were performed using hyperbaric chamber karampour and albermani 2014 gong et al 2012 khalilpasha and albermani 2013 kyriakides and corona 2007 yeh and kyriakides 1986 the effects of the initial imperfections and the diameter thickness ratios on the critical pressures of the pipes were tested the experimental results reported in literature enable us to verify if the analytical solutions can predict correctly the critical pressures of the pipes the models based on the assumption of the 2d plane strain deformation are widely used in analysis of the pipeline buckling problem however hydrostatic pressure loading is considered to be the most representative of long pipelines installed on the seabed and is usually preferred in design kyriakides and corona 2007 the aim of this work is to establish the formulation for the 3d collapse problem of the pipes under hydrostatic pressures the stability equations in 3d framework were derived in cylindrical coordinates using energy method and for the first time the correct boundary conditions for 3d buckling loads of the pipes in compression were established the solution for critical pressure calculation of the pipes in the fully elastic buckling was developed in closed form by solving the set of the stability equations together with the correct boundary conditions by adopting the three layers model in li et al 2019 the solution was applied to the prediction of the critical pressures for elastic plastic collapse of the pipes the results from the present solution were compared to those of the experiments and the other solutions 2 elastic buckling 2 1 basic relations consider a pipe with the outer and inner radii r and r and the length l respectively the cylindrical coordinate system ρ φ z is adopted in analysis the

subjected to the internal pressure q and the external pressure p p q the inward buckling at first the pipe is in pre buckling state then the infinitesimal perturbing displacements occur and the total

collapse and influence of the initial ovality the buckling of the thick pipes will be in elastic plastic mixed mode due to the yielding of the material at the inner radius of the pipes which results in the much lower critical pressure than that evaluated from 2 49 the three layers model li et al 2019 i e the outer elastic layer the middle non linear elastic layer and the inner plastic layer are adopted in analysis of the elastic plastic buckling of the pipes as shown in fig 4 where r 1 and r 2 represent the radii of the non linear elastic and the yielding zones respectively two parameters a

those of the pre buckling state in the following process of solving the ratios a 1 and a 2 the stresses corresponding to the pre buckling state are employed the initial ovality is one of the major imperfections that affect the elastic plastic collapse behaviors of the pipe kyriakides and corona 2007 the effect of the initial ovality δ 0 should be incorporated in the determination of the parameters a 1 and a 2 the initial ovality δ 0 of the pipe is defined as 3 3 δ 0 d max d min d max d min where d min and d max are the measured minimum and maximum diameters of the pipes the initial ovality along the longitudinal direction of the pipe is assumed to be uniform in present analysis the initial ovality does not mean that the initial cross section of the pipe is elliptical kyriakides and corona 2007 however the final collapse pressure of the pipe will switch to the lowest eigenvalue n 2 even though it initially withstands the pressure corresponding to the initial imperfection shape with higher number of waves fraldi and guarracino 2013 for this reason the initial ovality can be considered as the first mode n 2 perturbing deformation when δ 0 is a small quantity at ρ r 1

q 2 and internal pressure q the yield pressure of the inner layer with the effect of the axial stress is for simplicity estimated by 3 11 q 2 q σ 0 t r 0 where t r 2 r and r 0 r 2 r 2 are the wall

and a 2 one needs to solve a set of the 2 dimensional high order coupled equations since the transitional layer middle layer is a thin one the following method in determination of the parameters a 1 and a 2 will be used to avoid the complex mathematical procedures at first the effect of the middle layer is neglected and the outer layer stresses will be applied to the radius of ρ r 2 in determination of the parameter a 2 at ρ r 2 the maximum additional hoop stress resulted from the initial ovality is obtained by rewriting 3 4 where the ratio a 1 is replaced by a 2 we have 3 13 σ φ ρ

partially by the underestimation of p 1 in the middle layer once the parameter a 2 is obtained the axial stress σ z 00 evaluated by 3 14c will be used as a known variable in next calculation then the

where d 0 and t are the mean diameter and the wall thickness of the pipes respectively when the pipes become thick the effect of the transverse shear rises the hoop and radial stresses are non linearly across the thickness of the pipes which results in the overestimation in the critical pressures the abaqus results from ji and waas 2014 are also shown in fig 5 for comparison as pointed out by ji and waas 2014 the relation of the work conjugate is violated in the finite element formula of commercial software such as abaqus which leads to the over estimation of the critical pressure for

proposed a solution in which the effects of the shear strains and rotations were considered the critical pressure was obtained by solving a set of differential stability equations numerically and the results are agreement to those from kardomateas 2000 in the case where the effect of the shear strains was neglected the solution of the critical pressures was expressed as the root of the following quadratic equation p 2 ξ n 2 5 12 r 0 d 1 t 2 4 r 0 4 p 1 t 2 r 0 ξ 5 12 1 t 2 r 0 1 n 2 1 t 2 r 0 4 2a k r 0 3 n 2 1 1 ξ 0 in which 4 2b ξ k n 2 k n 2 5 r 0 2 g t 6 4 2c d e t 1 μ 2 4 2d k e t 3 12 1 μ 2 where r 0 and t are the mean radius and the wall thickness of the pipes respectively n denotes the buckling mode number g e 2 1 μ is the lamé constant the results evaluated by 4 2a are shown in fig 5 li et al 2019 developed a solution that was based on the plane strain deformation assumption the expression for the elastic buckling is in the same form as 2 49 but different coefficients the results from li et al 2019 are between those from kardomateas 2000 and papadakis 2008 it can be observed that the critical pressures by the present 3d solution are further reduced compared to the 2d results by li et al 2019 and very closed to those from kardomateas 2000 for the elastic buckling the influence of the axial stress on the pressure capacity of the cylindrical shells under external pressure was investigated experimentally galletly et al 1987 and the results indicate that the critical pressure decreases as the magnitude of the axial compressive stress increases the analytical results from the present solution are in agreement with that of the experiment observations 4 2 elastic plastic buckling when the pipe becomes thick the plasticity may occur before the collapse the buckling pressure evaluated by 2 49 will be in overestimation since the interaction between the stability and the plasticity for the structural metals one of the most commonly constitute relationship is often expressed in the three parameters ramberg osgood power law kyriakides and corona 2007 4 3 ε σ e 1 3 7 σ σ 0 m 1 where m is the strain hardening exponent e is the elastic modulus of the materials and σ 0 is the yield stress when the constitute relation of the materials is expressed by 4 3 the proportional limit σ p in present approach is suggested as the stress corresponding to the intersection of the straight line from origin with slope of 0 985e and the power law relation 4 3 in this manner the proportional limit σ p can be evaluated by 4 4 σ p 0 03553 1 m 1 σ 0 in this section the critical pressures n 2 for the thick pipes in elastic plastic buckling are evaluated from 3 18 the material parameters of e 210 gpa μ 0 3 σ 0 235 mpa m 13 5 and the internal pressure q 0 are used in calculation as the reference case the corresponding proportional limit evaluated by 4 4 is σ p 180 mpa the variations of the critical pressures evaluated by 3 18 with the ratio r r are plotted in fig 6 three cases of the initial ovalities δ 0 0 δ 0 0 1 and δ 0 0 5 are considered it is seen that the effect of the initial ovality on the bifurcation pressure the transitional pressure from the elastic buckling to the elastic plastic one is significant and however this effect weakens as the pipe becomes thicker it should be noted that the elastic plastic buckling evaluation in present solution is for the pipes with the circular cross section and the initial ovality is considered as the first order perturbation deformation which can only be used when the initial ovality δ0 1 it is suggested that the limit value is δ0 0 6 based on the levy timoshenko approach fraldi and guarracino 2011 developed a refined 1d model for critical pressure prediction of the rings in elastic plastic buckling and the influence of the initial ovality was incorporated in the model for the materials whose constitute relation obeys the ramberg osgood power law 4 5 ε σ e ε 0 σ 0 e σ σ 0 β where σ 0 and ε 0 are the yield stress and strain respectively e is the elastic modulus and β represents the hardening parameter the critical pressure p c r of the rings is presented by the smallest real root of the following third order equation n 2 1 t r 0 2 p c r t r 0 σ 0 t r 0 2 4 p c r δ 0 e 0 e 1 p c r p e p e 2 p c r p e p 2 4 6 12 p c r p c r σ 0 t r 0 0 in which 4 7a p e p t 24 r 0 h h 2 48

thickness and the mean radius of the rings respectively n is the buckling mode number p e p represents the linear elastic plastic pressure and e t is the tangent modulus in the case of the long shell or pipe calculation timoshenko suggested the simple extension by replacing the elastic modulus e with e 1 μ 2 where μ is the poisson ratio of the materials although this method of extending the critical pressure prediction of the rings to the long cylindrical shells may seem too simple to some extent questionable for elastic plastic deformation fraldi and guarracino 2011 still recommended it for simplicity the constitute relation 4 3 corresponds to the special case of 4 5 for e ε 0 σ 0 3 σ 0 7 and β m the results by present approach and those from fraldi and guarracino 2011 and li et al 2019 for the reference case at δ 0 0 and s 1 are plotted in fig 7 it is seen that for the pipes with medium thickness r r 1 15 or d t 15 3 the results from present approach are very closed to those by li et al 2019 which is derived by adopting the plain strain assumption however with the further increase of the ratio r r the difference between the two solutions increases while the critical pressures by the present solution are always higher than that from li et al 2019 it is also seen that as the ratio r r increases the critical pressure estimated by the solution of fraldi and guarracino 2011 increases gradually and reaches the up bound value namely p σ 0 ω 1 4 δ 0 ω and ω t r 0 at r r 1 19 d t 12 53 the critical pressure evaluated by 4 6 may therefore be in overestimation for thick pipes in elastic plastic collapse finally the collapse pressures by the present solution and those from fraldi and guarracino 2011 versus the initial ovality for the ratio of r r 1 07 d t 30 6 are plotted in fig 8 it shows the strong sensitivity of the collapse pressures to the initial ovality for both solutions at δ 0 0 5 the collapse pressure evaluated by the present solution is reduced by 24 0 while it is 28 4 for the result from fraldi and guarracino 2011 4 3 compared to experiments the experimental investigations using hyperbaric chambers for the single wall pipes were performed during past decades the effects of the initial geometric imperfections and the diameter to thickness ratios were investigated in those experiment tests a series of experiments on critical pressures of the pipes were reported yeh and kyriakides 1986 kyriakides and corona 2007 with the diameter thickness ratio of 18 42 the main geometric parameters and the elastic constants of the pipes are shown in table 1 where the constitute relations of the materials are expressed by 4 3 the corresponding proportional limit σ p evaluated by 4 4 are also list table 2 shows the experimental results p e x from yeh and kyriakides 1986 and kyriakides and corona 2007 corresponding to the specimens in table 1 the results evaluated by the present approach p c r and the relative errors with respect to the experiments are list the results show that except for no 7 the critical pressures from the present solution are very closed to those of the experiment the error of no 7 may be from the sources such as the residual stress and other defects it is seen that the present solution may explain the experiments well 5 conclusion an analytical solution in 3d framework was developed for the pressure capacity evaluation of the pipes under hydrostatic pressures the correct boundary conditions were presented firstly by using energy method and the closed form solution was established for the critical pressure prediction of the pipe in fully elastic buckling and then extended to the elastic plastic collapse by adopting the three layers model and the effect of the initial ovality was incorporated compared to the 2d solution the evaluated critical pressures by the present 3d approach for fully elastic buckling are further reduced which is due to the difference of the axial stresses in two approaches in the elastic plastic buckling however the results from present 3d solution are always higher than those by the 2d solution therefore it may be conservative by using the solutions based on the plane strain deformation assumption to predict the elastic plastic collapse of the thick pipes under hydrostatic pressures the initial ovality results in the significant reduction of the bifurcation pressure with respect to that of the pipe without imperfections however this effect is trivial as the ratio r r increases the results from the present approach are also compared to those of the experiments and show

20761,an analytical solution for evaluating the critical pressure of pipes under hydrostatic pressure was proposed the stability equations and the correct boundary conditions for 3d problem in cylindrical coordinates were established by using energy method the stability equations were solved together with the derived correct boundary conditions and the solution of the critical pressure for elastic buckling of the pipes was expressed in closed form by adopting the three layers model for elastic plastic buckling analysis the solution was available for the critical pressure prediction of the pipes in elastic plastic collapse the effect of the initial ovality was incorporated in formulation it shows that the increase in the magnitude of the axial compressive stress results in the further reduction in the critical pressure for fully elastic buckling while the pressures for elastic plastic collapse are always higher than those of the 2d solutions based on the plane strain deformation the influence of the initial ovality on the pressure capacity of the elastic plastic buckling of the pipes was discussed and the results from the present approach were compared with the other solutions and experiments keywords elastic buckling elastic plastic collapse single wall pipe eigenvalue layers 1 introduction pipelines are widely used in offshore structures and the collapse is one of the main failure forms of the pipes the classical solution given by timonshenko and gere 1961 is expressed in a simple form for thin shells the solution was extended to infinite cylindrical shells by adopting the assumption of the plane strain deformation and also to the estimation of the critical pressure of the pipes at initial yield and the elastic plastic collapse of a corroded cylindrical shells hoo fatt 1999 based on the levy timoshenko approach fraldi and guarracino 2011 part 1 2011 part 2 developed an improved model for pressure capacity prediction of the rings in elastic plastic buckling and the influence of the initial ovality was incorporated later yan et al 2016 extended the model to collapse pressure analysis of pipes with initial corrosion although one dimensional analysis without some complex calculations in mathematics has certain advantages it does have some limitations one of the main factors neglected in 1d model that affects the pressure capacity of the pipes is the transverse shear as the pipe becomes thick the effect of the transverse shear is considerable and the classical solution presents overestimation of the critical pressure kardomateas 1993 papadakis 2008 the issue was widely addressed and attracted much attention during the past decades in the first order deformation theory the effect of transverse shear was introduced by assuming that the deformation is a linear function of thickness fu and waas 1995 while in the high order deformation theory it was expressed as a cubic function of thickness simitses and anastasiadis 1992 simitses et al 1993 anastasiadis and simitses 1993 in refined shell theory voyiadjis and woelke 2004 voyiadjis and shi 1991 the hoop and radial deformations were obtained by solving the differential equations analytically and the effects of transverse shear stress and strain were incorporated in this approach papadakis 2008 employed this theory to develop the analytical solution of the critical pressure calculation for the thick cylindrical shells under external pressure the expressions for two cases with the rotations only and with both of the shear strains and rotations were established kardomateas 1993 proposed the solution to evaluate the critical pressure of the thick orthotropic cylindrical shells by solving directly the stability equations in novozhilov 1953 and the same method was employed in his later works kardomateas and chung 1994 kardomateas 2000 by using the conservative work potential approach ji and waas 2014 derived the stability equations and the corresponding boundary conditions for the elastic buckling of the pipes in plane strain deformation most recently li et al 2019 established the analytical solution for the collapse pressure of the pipes different from the elastic solutions mentioned above the solution in li et al 2019 was applied to critical pressure prediction of the elastic plastic collapse by introduced the three layers model the pressure bifurcation occurs when the stress at the inner radius of the pipe reaches the material proportional limit instead of the yielding stress meanwhile a series of experiments were performed using hyperbaric chamber karampour and albermani 2014 gong et al 2012 khalilpasha and albermani 2013 kyriakides and corona 2007 yeh and kyriakides 1986 the effects of the initial imperfections and the diameter thickness ratios on the critical pressures of the pipes were tested the experimental results reported in literature enable us to verify if the analytical solutions can predict correctly the critical pressures of the pipes the models based on the assumption of the 2d plane strain deformation are widely used in analysis of the pipeline buckling problem however hydrostatic pressure loading is considered to be the most representative of long pipelines installed on the seabed and is usually preferred in design kyriakides and corona 2007 the aim of this work is to establish the formulation for the 3d collapse problem of the pipes under hydrostatic pressures the stability equations in 3d framework were derived in cylindrical coordinates using energy method and for the first time the correct boundary conditions for 3d buckling loads of the pipes in compression were established the solution for critical pressure calculation of the pipes in the fully elastic buckling was developed in closed form by solving the set of the stability equations together with the correct boundary conditions by adopting the three layers model in li et al 2019 the solution was applied to the prediction of the critical pressures for elastic plastic collapse of the pipes the results from the present solution were compared to those of the experiments and the other solutions 2 elastic buckling 2 1 basic relations consider a pipe with the outer and inner radii r and r and the length l respectively the cylindrical coordinate system ρ φ z is adopted in analysis the

as argument previously the terms related to q e in 2 47 can be dropped as the small ones and the solution reduces to 2 49 p β 1 β 4 e β 2 β 4 q equation 2 49 is available only when the stress at the inner radius of the pipe does not exceed the proportional limit of the material the lowest eigenvalue n 2 presents the critical pressure of the pipes in the fully elastic buckling 3 elastic plastic collapse and influence of the initial ovality the buckling of the thick pipes will be in elastic plastic mixed mode due to the yielding of the material at the inner radius of the pipes which results in the much lower critical pressure than that evaluated from 2 49 the three layers model li et al 2019 i e the outer elastic layer the middle non linear elastic layer and the inner plastic layer are adopted in analysis of the elastic plastic buckling of the pipes as shown in fig 4 where r 1 and r 2 represent the radii of the non linear elastic and the yielding zones respectively two parameters a 1 and a 2 are introduced as 3 1a a 1 r r 1 3 1b a 2 r r 2 if p 1 and q 2 represent the uniform pressures at the interfaces ρ r 1 and ρ r 2 respectively the outer elastic layer with the inner and outer radii of r 1 and r is under the internal pressure p 1 and the external pressure p the critical pressure of the outer layer is obtained by rewriting 2 49 as 3 2a p β 1 1 β 4 1 e β 2 1 β 4 1 p 1 in which 3 2b β 1 1 β 1 a a 1 β 2 1 β 2 a a 1 β 4 1 β 4 a a 1 at the onset of the buckling the total stresses are expressed by 2 7 however the perturbing stresses are infinitesimal terms compared to those of the pre buckling state in the following process of solving the ratios a 1 and a 2 the stresses corresponding to the pre buckling state are employed the initial ovality is one of the major imperfections that affect the elastic plastic collapse behaviors of the pipe kyriakides and corona 2007 the effect of the initial ovality δ 0 should be incorporated in the determination of the parameters a 1 and a 2 the initial ovality δ 0 of the pipe is defined as 3 3 δ 0 d max d min d max d min where d min and d max are the measured minimum and maximum diameters of the pipes the initial ovality along the longitudinal direction of the pipe is assumed to be uniform in present analysis the initial ovality does not mean that the initial cross section of the pipe is elliptical kyriakides and corona 2007 however the final collapse pressure of the pipe will switch to the lowest eigenvalue n 2 even though it initially withstands the pressure corresponding to the initial imperfection shape with higher number of waves fraldi and guarracino 2013 for this reason the initial ovality can be considered as the first mode n 2 perturbing deformation when δ 0 is a small quantity at ρ r 1 the maximum additional hoop stress due to the initial ovality is given by li et al 2019 3 4 σ φ ρ r 1 a 1 2 1 2 a 1 2 1 1 μ 2 a 1 4 a 1 2 2 e δ 0 the additional hoop stress 3 4 resulted from the initial ovality should be added to the stresses expressed by 2 26 and the stresses of the elastic layer at ρ r 1 with the effect of the initial ovality become 3 5a σ ρ 00 ρ r 1 p 1 3 5b σ φ 00 ρ r 1 2 a 1 2 a 1 2 1 p a 1 2 1 a 1 2 1 p 1 a 1 2 1 2 a 1 2 1 1 μ 2 a 1 4 a 1 2 2 e δ 0 3 5c σ z 00 p r 2 q r 2 r 2 r 2 p a 2 q a 2 1 the superscript 00 in 3 5 represents the stresses of the pre buckling state the middle layer is a transitional one and the equivalent stresses at ρ r 2 and ρ r 1 are the yield stress σ 0 and the proportional limit σ p of the material respectively the hill condition at the interface ρ r 2 is expressed as 3 6 σ z 00 2 σ z 00 σ φ 00 ρ r 2 σ φ 00 ρ r 2 2 s 2 σ 0 2 where s represents the yield stress anisotropy which is defined as the ratio of the yield stress in hoop direction to the yield stress in axial direction kyriakides and corona 2007 for simplicity the ratio of the proportional limit in hoop direction to the proportional limit in axial direction is assumed to be the same as that of the yield stress then the hill condition at the boundary ρ r 1 is written as 3 7 σ z 00 2 σ z 00 σ φ 00 ρ r 1 σ φ 00 ρ r 1 2 s 2 σ p 2 the corresponding hoop stresses at the boundaries ρ r 1 and ρ r 2 evaluated from 3 6 and 3 7 are respectively 3 8a σ φ 00 ρ r 1 1 2 s 2 σ z 00 k 1 3 8b σ φ 00 ρ r 2 1 2 s 2 σ z 00 k 2 where 3 8c k 1 1 2 s 4 σ z 00 2 4 s 2 σ p 2 σ z 00 2 1 2 3 8d k 2 1 2 s 4 σ z 00 2 4 s 2 σ 0 2 σ z 00 2 1 2 the middle layer can be regarded as a tube under external pressure p 1 and internal pressure q 2 note that the middle layer is a thin one li et al 2019 and the pressure p 1 at the interface ρ r 1 is estimated by the equilibrium condition 3 9 σ φ 00 ρ r 1 σ φ 00 ρ r 2 2 r 1 r 2 p 1 r 1 q 2 r 2 0 with inserting of 3 8 into 3 9 we have 3 10 p 1 a 2 a 1 2 a 2 k 1 k 2 s 2 σ z 00 a 1 a 2 q 2 in this manner the pressure p 1 in 3 10 is underestimated slightly the inner plastic layer with outer radius r 2 and inner radius r is under external pressure q 2 and internal pressure q the yield pressure of the inner layer with the effect of the axial stress is for simplicity estimated by 3 11 q 2 q σ 0 t r 0 where t r 2 r and r 0 r 2 r 2 are the wall thickness and the mean radius of the inner plastic layer eq 3 11 can be rewritten in terms of the parameters a and a 2 as 3 12 q 2 2 a a 2 a a 2 σ 0 q if 3 5 3 12 are used to find the parameters a 1 and a 2 one needs to solve a set of the 2 dimensional high order coupled equations since the transitional layer middle layer is a thin one the following method in determination of the parameters a 1 and a 2 will be used to avoid the complex mathematical procedures at first the effect of the middle layer is neglected and the outer layer stresses will be applied to the radius of ρ r 2 in determination of the parameter a 2 at ρ r 2 the maximum additional hoop stress resulted from the initial ovality is obtained by rewriting 3 4 where the ratio a 1 is replaced by a 2 we have 3 13 σ φ ρ r 2 a 2 2 1 2 a 2 2 1 1 μ 2 a 2 4 a 2 2 2 e δ 0 by adding the additional hoop stress the total stresses of the outer elastic layer at ρ r 2 are written as 3 14a σ ρ 00 ρ r 2 q 2 3 14b σ φ 00 ρ r 2 2 a 2 2 a 2 2 1 p a 2 2 1 a 2 2 1 q 2 a 2 2 1 2 a 2 2 1 1 μ 2 a 2 4 a 2 2 2 e δ 0 3 14c σ z 00 p r 2 q r 2 r 2 r 2 p a 2 q a 2 1 where p is the critical pressure of the outer layer which is rewritten as 3 15a p β 1 2 β 4 2 e β 2 2 β 4 2 q 2 and 3 15b β 1 2 β 1 a a 2 β 2 2 β 2 a a 2 β 4 2 β 4 a a 2 the hill condition for determination of the parameter a 2 is expressed as 3 16 σ z 00 2 σ z 00 σ φ 00 ρ r 2 σ φ 00 ρ r 2 2 s 2 σ 0 2 in this simplified manner the size of the inner plastic layer will be slightly overestimated the overestimated pressure of the inner plastic layer is however compensated partially by the underestimation of p 1 in the middle layer once the parameter a 2 is obtained the axial stress σ z 00 evaluated by 3 14c will be used as a known variable in next calculation then the parameter a 1 is determined by the following hill condition 3 17 σ z 00 2 σ z 00 σ φ 00 ρ r 1 σ φ 00 ρ r 1 2 s 2 σ p 2 where the hoop stress in 3 17 is expressed by 3 5b after determination of the parameters a 1 and a 2 the critical pressure of the pipe is given by 3 18 p β 1 1 β 4 1 e β 2 1 β 4 1 a 2 a 1 2 a 2 k 1 k 2 s 2 σ z 00 a 1 a 2 q 2 it is probably worth to emphasize that the roots a 1 and a 2 should be in the range of 1 a 1 a and 1 a 2 a otherwise the ratios a 1 or a 2 should be set as a 1 a or a 2 a in calculation the initial eccentricity is the other factor affecting the buckling of pipes which is defined as 3 19 ω 0 t max t min t max t min where t min and t max are the minimum and maximum thickness which are measured from both ends of the pipe for this imperfection with minor influence on the buckling behavior of the pipes kyriakides and corona 2007 its effect is estimated by introducing the equivalent ratio d t e which is expressed as li et al 2019 3 20 d t e d t 1 1 4 ω 0 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 compared to the other elastic solutions in this section eq 2 49 is used to evaluated the critical pressure corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue n 2 fig 5 shows the comparison of the results from the present approach for elastic buckling in the case of q 0 and those by the other elastic solutions the poison ratio and the elastic modulus of the material in calculation are μ 0 3 e 57 gpa respectively the classical solution from timonshenko and gere 1961 for the long pipes in plane strain deformation is expressed in a simple form 4 1 p e 2 e 1 μ 2 t d 0 3 where d 0 and t are the mean diameter and the wall thickness of the pipes respectively when the pipes become thick the effect of the transverse shear rises the hoop and radial stresses are non linearly across the thickness of the pipes which results in the overestimation in the critical pressures the abaqus results from ji and waas 2014 are also shown in fig 5 for comparison as pointed out by ji and waas 2014 the relation of the work conjugate is violated in the finite element formula of commercial software such as abaqus which leads to the over estimation of the critical pressure for the bodies in compression kardomateas 2000 developed an improved solution in which the influence of the normal stresses and strains was incorporated the smallest eigenvalue for n 2 was found by solving the second order coupled differential equations numerically the results from kardomateas 2000 present the lowest critical pressures in fig 5 based on the refined shell theory papadakis 2008 proposed a solution in which the effects of the shear strains and rotations were considered the critical pressure was obtained by solving a set of differential stability equations numerically and the results are agreement to those from kardomateas 2000 in the case where the effect of the shear strains was neglected the solution of the critical pressures was expressed as the root of the following quadratic equation p 2 ξ n 2 5 12 r 0 d 1 t 2 4 r 0 4 p 1 t 2 r 0 ξ 5 12 1 t 2 r 0 1 n 2 1 t 2 r 0 4 2a k r 0 3 n 2 1 1 ξ 0 in which 4 2b ξ k n 2 k n 2 5 r 0 2 g t 6 4 2c d e t 1 μ 2 4 2d k e t 3 12 1 μ 2 where r 0 and t are the mean radius and the wall thickness of the pipes respectively n denotes the buckling mode number g e 2 1 μ is the lamé constant the results evaluated by 4 2a are shown in fig 5 li et al 2019 developed a solution that was based on the plane strain deformation assumption the expression for the elastic buckling is in the same form as 2 49 but different coefficients the results from li et al 2019 are between those from kardomateas 2000 and papadakis 2008 it can be observed that the critical pressures by the present 3d solution are further reduced compared to the 2d results by li et al 2019 and very closed to those from kardomateas 2000 for the elastic buckling the influence of the axial stress on the pressure capacity of the cylindrical shells under external pressure was investigated experimentally galletly et al 1987 and the results indicate that the critical pressure decreases as the magnitude of the axial compressive stress increases the analytical results from the present solution are in agreement with that of the experiment observations 4 2 elastic plastic buckling when the pipe becomes thick the plasticity may occur before the collapse the buckling pressure evaluated by 2 49 will be in overestimation since the interaction between the stability and the plasticity for the structural metals one of the most commonly constitute relationship is often expressed in the three parameters ramberg osgood power law kyriakides and corona 2007 4 3 ε σ e 1 3 7 σ σ 0 m 1 where m is the strain hardening exponent e is the elastic modulus of the materials and σ 0 is the yield stress when the constitute relation of the materials is expressed by 4 3 the proportional limit σ p in present approach is suggested as the stress corresponding to the intersection of the straight line from origin with slope of 0 985e and the power law relation 4 3 in this manner the proportional limit σ p can be evaluated by 4 4 σ p 0 03553 1 m 1 σ 0 in this section the critical pressures n 2 for the thick pipes in elastic plastic buckling are evaluated from 3 18 the material parameters of e 210 gpa μ 0 3 σ 0 235 mpa m 13 5 and the internal pressure q 0 are used in calculation as the reference case the corresponding proportional limit evaluated by 4 4 is σ p 180 mpa the variations of the critical pressures evaluated by 3 18 with the ratio r r are plotted in fig 6 three cases of the initial ovalities δ 0 0 δ 0 0 1 and δ 0 0 5 are considered it is seen that the effect of the initial ovality on the bifurcation pressure the transitional pressure from the elastic buckling to the elastic plastic one is significant and however this effect weakens as the pipe becomes thicker it should be noted that the elastic plastic buckling evaluation in present solution is for the pipes with the circular cross section and the initial ovality is considered as the first order perturbation deformation which can only be used when the initial ovality δ0 1 it is suggested that the limit value is δ0 0 6 based on the levy timoshenko approach fraldi and guarracino 2011 developed a refined 1d model for critical pressure prediction of the rings in elastic plastic buckling and the influence of the initial ovality was incorporated in the model for the materials whose constitute relation obeys the ramberg osgood power law 4 5 ε σ e ε 0 σ 0 e σ σ 0 β where σ 0 and ε 0 are the yield stress and strain respectively e is the elastic modulus and β represents the hardening parameter the critical pressure p c r of the rings is presented by the smallest real root of the following third order equation n 2 1 t r 0 2 p c r t r 0 σ 0 t r 0 2 4 p c r δ 0 e 0 e 1 p c r p e p e 2 p c r p e p 2 4 6 12 p c r p c r σ 0 t r 0 0 in which 4 7a p e p t 24 r 0 h h 2 48

thickness and the mean radius of the rings respectively n is the buckling mode number p e p represents the linear elastic plastic pressure and e t is the tangent modulus in the case of the long shell or pipe calculation timoshenko suggested the simple extension by replacing the elastic modulus e with e 1 μ 2 where μ is the poisson ratio of the materials although this method of extending the critical pressure prediction of the rings to the long cylindrical shells may seem too simple to some extent questionable for elastic plastic deformation fraldi and guarracino 2011 still recommended it for simplicity the constitute relation 4 3 corresponds to the special case of 4 5 for e ε 0 σ 0 3 σ 0 7 and β m the results by present approach and those from fraldi and guarracino 2011 and li et al 2019 for the reference case at δ 0 0 and s 1 are plotted in fig 7 it is seen that for the pipes with medium thickness r r 1 15 or d t 15 3 the results from present approach are very closed to those by li et al 2019 which is derived by adopting the plain strain assumption however with the further increase of the ratio r r the difference between the two solutions increases while the critical pressures by the present solution are always higher than that from li et al 2019 it is also seen that as the ratio r r increases the critical pressure estimated by the solution of fraldi and guarracino 2011 increases gradually and reaches the up bound value namely p σ 0 ω 1 4 δ 0 ω and ω t r 0 at r r 1 19 d t 12 53 the critical pressure evaluated by 4 6 may therefore be in overestimation for thick pipes in elastic plastic collapse finally the collapse pressures by the present solution and those from fraldi and guarracino 2011 versus the initial ovality for the ratio of r r 1 07 d t 30 6 are plotted in fig 8 it shows the strong sensitivity of the collapse pressures to the initial ovality for both solutions at δ 0 0 5 the collapse pressure evaluated by the present solution is reduced by 24 0 while it is 28 4 for the result from fraldi and guarracino 2011 4 3 compared to experiments the experimental investigations using hyperbaric chambers for the single wall pipes were performed during past decades the effects of the initial geometric imperfections and the diameter to thickness ratios were investigated in those experiment tests a series of experiments on critical pressures of the pipes were reported yeh and kyriakides 1986 kyriakides and corona 2007 with the diameter thickness ratio of 18 42 the main geometric parameters and the elastic constants of the pipes are shown in table 1 where the constitute relations of the materials are expressed by 4 3 the corresponding proportional limit σ p evaluated by 4 4 are also list table 2 shows the experimental results p e x from yeh and kyriakides 1986 and kyriakides and corona 2007 corresponding to the specimens in table 1 the results evaluated by the present approach p c r and the relative errors with respect to the experiments are list the results show that except for no 7 the critical pressures from the present solution are very closed to those of the experiment the error of no 7 may be from the sources such as the residual stress and other defects it is seen that the present solution may explain the experiments well 5 conclusion an analytical solution in 3d framework was developed for the pressure capacity evaluation of the pipes under hydrostatic pressures the correct boundary conditions were presented firstly by using energy method and the closed form solution was established for the critical pressure prediction of the pipe in fully elastic buckling and then extended to the elastic plastic collapse by adopting the three layers model and the effect of the initial ovality was incorporated compared to the 2d solution the evaluated critical pressures by the present 3d approach for fully elastic buckling are further reduced which is due to the difference of the axial stresses in two approaches in the elastic plastic buckling however the results from present 3d solution are always higher than those by the 2d solution therefore it may be conservative by using the solutions based on the plane strain deformation assumption to predict the elastic plastic collapse of the thick pipes under hydrostatic pressures the initial ovality results in the significant reduction of the bifurcation pressure with respect to that of the pipe without imperfections however this effect is trivial as the ratio r r increases the results from the present approach are also compared to those of the experiments and show

20762,this analytical study presents the solitary wave interaction with a bottom mounted surface piercing v shaped breakwater the breakwater is impermeable thin and rigidly fixed on the bottom as a key element an imaginary closed cylinder with an arm s length radius was introduced so that the fluid domain was divided into three subdomains by an imaginary interface within which the solutions were described by eigenfunctions furthermore by satisfying the boundary and matching conditions in the subdomains the velocity potential at any point in the fluid domain could be determined the numerical results obtained for the limiting cases were verified by a comparison with previous predictions for a straight breakwater the effects of the wave incident angle opening angle of the breakwater and wave effect parameter on wave loads and wave run up were studied furthermore comparison and analysis of the hydrodynamic performance of the v shaped and arc shaped breakwaters with a similar structure showed that they had a similar wave attenuation effect however the v shaped breakwater was subject to smaller wave loads moreover for solitary wave diffraction caused by the breakwater the airy wave model might significantly underestimate wave run up keywords solitary wave v shaped breakwater arc shaped breakwater analytical derivation 1 introduction the breakwaters have been widely used in marine and coastal engineering for harbour and coastline protection because they can significantly reduce the hydrodynamic loads and wave run ups on the structures different marine environments require various forms of breakwaters that have been proposed investigated and applied in practice such as semi infinite breakwater wiegel 1962 sollitt and cross 1973 lee and kim 2006 rectangular breakwater mondal and alam 2018 fouladi et al 2020 detached breakwaters toyoshima 1975 filianoti 2000 nam and larson 2010 ashlin et al 2018 t type breakwaters neelamani and rajendran 2002 zhan et al 2017 deng et al 2019 arc shaped walls cheng et al 2007 liu and lin 2013 chu et al 2014 zhai et al 2020 2021 and cylindrical breakwaters darwiche et al 1994 williams and li 1998 tao et al 2009 liu et al 2018 among various types of breakwaters straight and cylindrical breakwaters are the most commonly used in practical applications the former is more appropriate for offshore applications whereas the latter is more often used far away from the coast for instance the well known ekofisk gravity offshore structure in the north sea is a cylindrical breakwater song and tao 2007 in many research works the estimation of wave loads and elevations is an important task which has garnered considerable attention from researchers and engineers in may 1999 a floating v shaped breakwater was developed as a new and rapidly installed breakwater system ribs by the u s army engineer research and development center erdc to provide a relatively stable environment for safe vessel operations see fig 1 without touching the seafloor the floating structure is extended vertically down to a certain depth and secured tightly in a v shape by a few mooring systems engineering practice shows that the wave defending effect of the v shaped breakwater is significant and similar facilities have been applied to prevent oil spills from tanker accidents briggs et al 2002 found that there were a few discrepancies between the measured load on the v shaped breakwater and the test numerical model based on the boundary element method using the eigenfunction expansion approach miao et al 2005 first analytically investigated the wave defending effects of a v shaped breakwater and presented analytical solutions based on the linear potential theory the bottom mounted v shaped breakwater has a better wave defending effect than the floating v shaped breakwater chang et al 2012 proposed a fast convergent method for analysing wave diffraction from a modified v shaped breakwater they mainly focused on the distribution of wave height and its attenuation more recently yu et al 2015 studied the wave pressure on the wet surface of a floating v shaped breakwater in random seas using the finite depth green function and boundary element methods the results showed that the pressure response is closely related to the opening angle of the v shaped breakwater and slightly related to the arm length previous study analysed hydrodynamic performance of the v shaped backwaters to a certain extent and left some aspects untouched analytical solution of the wave diffraction problem for a v shaped breakwater located in shallow waters has not been provided owing to the shallow water effect it is not appropriate to apply airy wave theory for the diffraction of structures near the coast when the characteristic wave height a d 0 4 and characteristic wave period t g d 11 where a is wave amplitude d is water depth t is wave period and g is the gravitation of gravity the experimental results showed that shallow water wave theories such as the cnoidal wave and solitary wave theories are more accurate for studying the diffraction problems in the shallow water area sarpkaya et al 1982 in general the v shaped breakwater can be regarded as a modification of a finite long straight breakwater most previous studies were focused on solitary wave interaction with infinity and semi infinite breakwaters experimental tests analytical models and numerical methods are the three main methods to study this problem sun et al 2018 power and chwang 1984 carried out a study on the reflection of a planar solitary wave at a vertical wall liu 1984 presented a linear diffraction solution of solitary wave interaction with a semi infinity thin wall via the fourier integral method and experimentally verified the accuracy of the solution based on the boussinesq equation in open water region derived by wu 1981 the numerical work of solitary wave interaction with a straight and thin breakwater at a constant water depth was given by wang 1993 based on depth integrated equations of motion lynett et al 2000 extended the work wu 1981 liu and wen 1997 to numerically study the interaction between solitary waves and a vertically porous breakwater model which is appropriate for weakly nonlinear weakly dispersive transient waves propagating in both variable depth open water and porous regions recently chen et al 2015 experimentally studied the reflection of steep solitary waves at a vertical wall comprehensively by using a high speed camera and image processing techniques where the experimental results were consistent with the previous theoretical investigations byatt smith 1971 su and mirie 1980 cooker et al 1997 and numerical simulations tanaka 1985 chambarel et al 2009 to the best of our knowledge no work has been reported on the analytical solution of solitary wave diffraction by a v shaped breakwater following the study conducted by miao et al 2005 for airy wave diffraction by a v shaped breakwater the interaction of a solitary wave diffraction from a v shaped breakwater is analytically investigated eigenfunction expansion and sub fluid region matching methods were used to develop analytical solutions through comparison with the existing research results the accuracy of the numerical results was verified a detailed analysis of the effect of the wave incident angle opening angle and wave effect parameter on the wave forces and elevations on the v shaped breakwater was explored in addition the wave loads and elevations of the v shaped and arc shaped breakwaters with similar structures were compared and analysed it is clearly shown that a v shaped breakwater is a reliable substitute for an arc shaped breakwater in certain cases the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the theoretical formulation is presented in section 2 sections 3 and 4 present the derivation of the analytical solution of the diffraction waves and the resulting wave forces wave moments and wave elevations a verification case was introduced in section 5 to prove the accuracy and efficiency of the analytical solution a detailed parametric study is presented in section 6 in section 7 a comparison of the hydrodynamic performance between v shaped and arc shaped breakwaters is presented finally the conclusions are drawn in section 8 2 theoretical formulation a schematic showing the solitary wave diffraction from a v shaped breakwater is presented in fig 2 the vertical bottom mounted and surface piercing v shaped breakwater is surrounded by a fluid of constant depth h the breakwater was assumed rigid and impermeable and its thickness was much smaller than the incident wavelength so that it can be regarded as a thin wall structure the length of each breakwater arm is a as seen in fig 2 the lower arm of the breakwater extends along the x axis and the opening angle between the upper and lower arms is α 0 α π the coordinate system is o x y z with the origin located at the intersection of two arms on the water bottom the z axis is directed vertically upwards where z 0 is the water bottom and z h is the still water level by introducing a virtual cylindrical structure with radius a the entire fluid domain is divided into three regions ω 1 r a 0 z h is the region of the outside the virtual cylinder ω 2 r a 0 z h 0 θ α is the region inside the breakwater and ω 3 r a 0 z h α θ 2 π is the region outside the breakwater the fluid is assumed inviscid and incompressible and its motion is irrotational the fluid motion may be described in term of the velocity potential φ x y z t re ϕ x y z t where ϕ is complex velocity potential and re is the real part of a complex expression furthermore the complex velocity potential in each region ω j j 1 2 3 can be written as ϕ j ϕ i ϕ s j where ϕ i and ϕ s j are the complex velocity potential of the incident and scattered waves respectively a right going solitary wave with a wave height h and speed c is incident upon the v shaped breakwater at an angle β β α 2 corresponds to normal wave incidence to the positive x axis the free surface elevation η i

addition the complex incident wave velocity potential ϕ i can be further written as 5 ϕ i 0 ϕ ˆ i k x c t d k evidently ϕ ˆ i k x c t satisfies the relation ϕ ˆ i x i k ϕ ˆ i 0 similarly if the complex scattered potential outside the region ω 1 can also be expressed as ϕ s 1 0 ϕ ˆ s 1 d k then ϕ ˆ s 1 must satisfy the sommerfeld radiation condition at infinity 6 lim r r ϕ ˆ s 1 r i k ϕ ˆ s 1

are a complete set of equations with the unknown coefficients a n 1 a n 2 a n 3 and b n 1 for the entire fluid domain the series are truncated after n terms and n lies between 0 and n previous studies such as ning et al 2017 and sarkar and bora 2020 have reported excellent convergence achieved by truncating the expansion series after finite terms e g n 20 the equation set can be written in matrix form as follows 29 h c ˆ e ˆ where c ˆ a 1 1 a 2 1 a n 1 a 1 2 a 2 2 a n 2 a 1 3 a 2 3 a n 3 b 1 1 b 2 1 b n 1 is an unknown matrix of order 4 n 3 h is a coefficient matrix and the right term e ˆ is a known matrix related to the incident waves therefore the unknown coefficients can be obtained efficiently by considering only a few truncated terms the hydrodynamic force overturning moment and free surface elevation can subsequently be determined for engineering applications 4 calculation of wave force and elevation based on the derived velocity potential other physical quantities of interest can be easily obtained e g hydrodynamic loads overturning moments and wave elevation the first order approximation for the free surface elevation in each region is given by isaacson 1983 30 η j 1 g ϕ j t for z h j 1 2 3 the total wave forces on the upper and lower arms along two orthogonal directions in the horizontal plane f 1 x f 1 y f 2 x and f 2 y were calculated by integrating the pressure difference between the two sides of the breakwater surface the diffraction problems pertaining to the wave field pressure distribution of linear water waves can be expressed as follows 31 p j ρ ϕ j t for j 1 2 3 hence the amplitudes of the horizontal hydrodynamic loads on the two arms can be expressed as 32 f 1 x 0 h d z 0 a p 3 p 2 θ α sin α d r re f 1 x f 1 y 0 h d z 0 a p 3 p 2 θ α cos α d r re

plane m 1 x m 1 y m 2 x and m 2 y can be obtained as follows 34 m 1 x 0 h z d z 0 a p 3 p 2 θ a sin α d r m 1 y 0 h z d z 0 a p 3 p 2 θ a cos α d r m 2 x 0 m 2 y 0 h z d z 0 a p 3 θ 2 π p 2 θ 0 d r the total hydrodynamic forces and overturning moments on the upper and lower arms can be expressed as follows 35 f 1 f 1 x 2 f 1 y 2 f 2 f 2 x 2 f 2 y 2 m 1 m 1 x 2 m 1 y 2 h 2 f 1 m 2 m 2 x 2 m 2 y 2 h 2 f 2 furthermore the total hydrodynamic forces and overturning moments on the v shaped breakwater can be written as 36 f f x 2 f y 2 m m x 2 m y 2 h 2 f in which 37 f x f 1 x f 2 x f y f 1 y f 2 y m x m 1 x m 2 x m y m 1 y m 2 y from the analytical formulation of the hydrodynamic loads and overturning moments on the v shaped breakwater it is seen that the values of the dimensionless overturning moments acting on the v shaped breakwater are exactly half of those of the corresponding dimensionless hydrodynamic loads thus the overturning moments on the breakwater must follow the same laws as the hydrodynamic loads in this study we present only the results of the wave force on the structure 5 model verification in this section a computer program was developed using fortran to implement the above analysis because no numerical and analytical results of solitary wave diffraction by a finite length v shaped breakwater were available this study results were compared with those of an infinite length straight wall vertical breakwater whose wave effects are calculated by wave reflection theory by choosing a special v shaped breakwater with an opening angle equal to 180 and enough large arm length the arm length a 1000 m in the calculations to give an effective verification of the proposed formulation meanwhile the water depth was set to h 5 m the maximum dimensionless wave runup η m a x h by choosing different wave amplitudes a 0 25 m 0 75 m 1 25 m 3 75 m the solitary wave travels normally to the straight breakwater when β α 2 90 and then total reflection occurs the first order and second order approximation analytical solutions of the solitary wave impact on an infinite vertical wall were derived by byatt smith 1971 later a third order approximation for the reflection of solitary waves at a vertical wall was derived by su and mirie 1980 the experimental results of maximum run up were obtained by camfield and street 1969 and chen et al 2015 respectively the numerical results of the maximum run up were calculated by chambarel et al 2009 the present analytical result agrees exactly with the solution of byatt smith 1971 as shown in fig 3 in addition when the dimensionless wave amplitude a h 0 4 our analytical results are in a good agreement with the published analytical numerical and experimental results however for a h 0 4 when the dimensionless wave amplitude increases the difference among results of various studies increase therefore the dimensionless wave amplitude a h 0 4 was adopted to ensure the accuracy of the results in this study 6 results and discussion considering that the wavelength of solitary waves is infinite the wave diffraction parameter k a tends to zero and becomes meaningless however diffraction is still a critical characteristic of interaction sankarbabu et al 2008 therefore the wave effect parameter c w h b 2 h 3 was introduced to provide a better description of solitary wave diffraction isaacson 1983 zhong and wang 2006 the factor ρ g h a h was used to nondimensionalize the hydrodynamic loads acting on the upper and lower arms moreover the maximum wave elevation near the breakwater is denoted as η which is dimensionless by h following the above model validation parameter studies were carried out to determine the influence of the different characteristics incident angle β opening angle α and wave effect parameter c w as computational examples we considered the case of a v shaped breakwater with two arms of 25 m in length located in a shallow area and subjected to a solitary wave with a wave height of 1 m 6 1 effect of wave incident angle fig 4 shows the variation in the maximum dimensionless hydrodynamic loads f 1 ρ g h a h f 2 ρ g h a h f ρ g h a h on the upper arm lower arm and v shaped structure for different incident angles β at the opening angle α 90 considering the symmetry of the v shaped breakwater the normal incidence β α 2 45 results in zero hydrodynamic loads for the v shaped structure the cases comprising four different wave incident angles at β α 2 45 β α 2 15 60 β α 2 30 75 and β α 2 45 90 were calculated figs 4 a and 4 b show that the wave force acting on the upper and lower arms first monotonically increases until it reaches the maximum and then decreases gradually with a further increase in c w in addition fig 4 a shows that the wave force on the upper arm monotonically decreases as the incident angle β increases that is because the lower arm has a certain shielding effect on the upper arm for the oblique incident wave from fig 4 c the wave force on the v shaped structure exhibits a similar trend to those in fig 4 a and the maximum force occurs near c w 1 3 furthermore the increase in the incident angle β has little influence on the wave force on the lower arm because an approximate total reflection occurs when an oblique incident wave implies a straight wall of finite length in general according to the wave refraction principle the shallow water wave incidence is approximately normal β α 2 when the wave spreads to the coast therefore close attention should be paid to normal incident waves due to the different wave incidence angles waves will interact with the breakwater in different ways e g the location and direction of wave collision with the breakwater and the impact of waves on the breakwater will vary with the incidence angle it is interesting to study the changes in the free surface elevations around the breakwater for varying incident angles β at c w 3 and α 90 to observe and analyse clearly we rotated the v shaped breakwater clockwise at α 2 in this study fig 5 shows the equi amplitude contours for the entire region with four different wave incident angles β 0 β 15 β 30 and β 45 clearly when β 0 the wave field loses symmetry and becomes much more complex as β increased from 0 to π 4 the wave run up around the lower arm increased gradually while the wave run up around the upper arm decreases slightly this also reflects the changing process of hydrodynamic loads more intuitively moreover the sheltered area of the structure decreased gradually as β increased 6 2 effect of the opening angle the opening angle of the v shaped breakwater determines the geometrical shape of the breakwater consequently it has directly influence on the wave effects as well fig 6 shows the variation of the maximum dimensionless hydrodynamic loads f ρ g h a h on the v shaped breakwater for different opening angles α at an incident angle β α 2 normal incident initially the hydrodynamic loads on the breakwater increase until a peak is attained and then decreases slightly with the increasing values of c w the opening angle α plays an important role in the wave force and the force gradually increases with the increase in α the maximum value of the force was 1 27 1 71 2 12 2 45 and 2 55 respectively for α 60 90 120 150 and 180 the peak value of the force at α 180 was twice as large as the force at α 60 moreover the wave force rapidly increases when α increases from 60 to 120 whereas the changes in the wave force magnitude do not vary significantly when α 150 therefore a v shaped breakwater with a small opening angle is more easily anchored and safer in practical engineering applications for normal incident waves β α 2 the wave forces acting on both arms were equal and synchronous changes with time fig 7 shows the variation of the hydrodynamic loads f 1 ρ g h a h on the upper arm versus the corresponding time g h h t for different opening angles α at the incident angle β α 2 as observed in fig 7 the peak and trough values of the force slightly increase as α increases whereas at the peak values the characteristics of sharp pulse changes are invariable in addition the absolute value of the trough is slightly higher compared to the peak value which means that the maximum wave force appears after the wave rounds the structure fig 8 shows the free surface elevation change near a v shaped breakwater for varying α when c w 2 5 and β 0 the maximum diffraction wave surface reaches its peak in front of the v shaped breakwater and the wave surface of the area behind the breakwater is significantly lower than that in front of the breakwater owing to the protection of the structure generally the wave height in the protected area can be reduced to about 20 50 of the incident wave height while the opening angle increases the wave run up on the lower and upper arms increases gradually for a more intuitive observation the corresponding wave run up on the upper arm is shown in fig 9 starts at the centre of the circle and ends at the end of the upper arm for r a 0 6 the dimensionless wave run up on the upper arm increases monotonically as α increases which means that the wave run up increases gradually at the intersection under the same arm length condition the amplitude of the dimensionless wave run up on both arms reaches a maximum at α 180 and the wave force also reaches the maximum value see fig 6 this indicates that the area in direct contact with waves increases leading to maximum wave run up and force increasing simultaneously as expected the sheltered area gradually increases when α increases however these results in the breakwater become increasingly difficult to anchor this observation is similar for airy wave scattering by a v shaped breakwater as in miao et al 2005 the pulse characteristic of the solitary wave surface propagation determines the characteristic of the dynamic wave forces acting on the v shaped breakwater considering all these factors the best opening angle of the v shaped breakwater was approximately between 90 and 120 for practical engineering 6 3 effect of the wave effect parameter fig 10 shows the variation of the hydrodynamic loads f 1 ρ g h a h on the upper arm versus corresponding time g h h t for different wave effect parameters c w at incident angles α 90 and β 45 in fig 10 the hydrodynamic loads on the upper arm vary between 1 2 and 1 2 with different c w meanwhile as c w increases the value of the crest is going to be larger than the absolute value of the trough which means that the maximum wave force exerted in front of the breakwater moreover the peak value of the wave force pulse gradually increases and moves towards the right when c w increases whereas the absolute value of the trough first increases and then decreases and also moves towards the right with a larger amplitude in addition the amplitude of the secondary pulse wave force increases with an increasing c w 7 comparison of the hydrodynamic performance of v shaped and arc shaped breakwaters it is interesting to discuss the hydrodynamic performance of v shaped and arc shaped breakwaters owing to their similar structure as shown in fig 11 as mentioned earlier cheng et al 2007 and miao et al 2005 studied the sheltering efficiency of arc shaped and v shaped breakwaters in water of finite depth based on a linearized velocity potential theory the derivation process of solitary wave diffraction by an arc shaped breakwater is shown in appendix a meanwhile our model was verified by comparison with the published results for a solid cylinder see fig 12 as shown in fig 11 the following two cases were compared 1 α 1 α 120 a 1 a 25 m and 2 α 1 180 α 90 a 1 25 m a 25 2 m moreover the two types of breakwaters were located at a constant water depth of h 5 m the incident wave height was h 1 m we focused on the comparison of the hydrodynamic loads and wave elevations thus the superiority and inferiority of the two types of breakwaters were explored 7 1 comparison of wave forces between the arc shaped and v shaped breakwaters the comparison of the dimensionless wave force on the arc shaped and v shaped breakwaters with two types of incident waves is shown in figs 13 and 14 according to figs 13 a and 14 a the wave force on the two breakwaters maintains a similar trend at a small value of k d and their difference is small when k d 2 especially for case 1 however according to figs 13 b and 14 b the force on the arc shaped breakwater is significantly larger than that of the v shaped breakwater as the wave effect parameter c w 1 5 this reason is that waves do not effectively aggregate at the tip of the v shaped breakwater while waves can be efficiently aggregated and uniformly distributed on the arc shaped breakwater 7 2 comparison of wave elevations between the arc shaped and v shaped breakwaters the changes in the wave surface distribution near a v shaped and an arc shaped breakwater with 2 types of incident waves are shown in figs 15 and 16 for the two cases as expected all equi amplitude plots were symmetric with respect to the longitudinal x axis moreover for case 1 of the solitary wave as the incident wave the maximum free surface elevation before and after the breakwater see fig 15 c and d was evidently higher than that of the airy wave see fig 15 a and b in addition for cases 1 and 2 the sheltered area of the arc shaped breakwater was slightly larger than that of the v shaped breakwater and it was subject to larger wave loads in addition the wave elevation at the tip behind the v shaped breakwater was higher than that of the arc shaped structure the reason behind is the rate of decay of the wave elevation on the arms of the v shaped breakwater was slower than that of the arc shaped breakwater as the wave rounded them despite the obvious difference in the inside domain solutions for the v shaped and arc shaped breakwaters the geometrical similarity of the two structures leads to the wave amplitude distribution being close in the vicinity x the corresponding free surface profiles along the centreline of the two types of breakwaters are shown in fig 17 the wave elevation of the solitary wave is larger than that of the airy wave which is consistent with the observations in figs 15 and 16 this implies that considering the effect of solitary waves on the structure in the limiting case is more reliable compared to the airy wave in marine engineering design overall case 1 is more similar to case 2 in structure their wave defending effects are similar as well in other words a v shaped breakwater is an appropriate substitute for an arc shaped breakwater at an opening angle α 120 additionally v shaped and arc shaped breakwaters has a similar wave attenuation effect under the same conditions the v shaped breakwater was subject to less hydrodynamic loads however the sheltered area was slightly smaller moreover the construction of a v shaped breakwater is economical and convenient for practical engineering 8 conclusion the solitary wave interaction with a bottom mounted surface piercing v shaped breakwater was investigated analytically using the eigenfunction expression approach the present method were validated by comparing the numerical results for limiting cases with the experimental analytical and numerical results provided in camfield and street 1969 byatt smith 1971 and chambarel et al 2009 a detailed analysis of the effect of the wave incident angle opening angle of the breakwater and wave effect parameters on wave forces and elevations on the breakwater were explored the main conclusions drawn were as follows 1 as the incident angle increased the wave patterns near the v shaped breakwater became much more complex because the lower arm had a certain shielding effect on the upper arm for the oblique incident wave the force on the upper arm gradually decreased in comparison the lower arm itself was subject to relatively larger wave loads 2 as the opening angle of the breakwater increased the sheltered area gradually increased meanwhile the maximum wave force also increased consequently employing the breakwater became increasingly difficult 3 for solitary wave diffraction caused by a v shaped breakwater the airy wave model might significantly underestimate wave run ups 4 by comparing and analysing the hydrodynamic performance of v shaped and arc shaped breakwaters with a similar structure the results showed that they exhibited similar wave attenuation effects however the v shaped breakwater was subject to smaller wave loads and it could be more economical and convenient to construct in practice credit authorship contribution statement zhenfeng zhai conceptualization validation

breakwater was α 1 2 π 2 γ as a key element a virtual closed circular cylindrical structure was introduced to extend the structure from the same centre cheng et al 2007 thus the fluid domain was divided into two sub regions the region outside of the arc shaped breakwater ω 1 r a 1 0 z h and the region inside of the arc shaped breakwater ω 2 r a 1 0 z h the fluid motion can be described in

20762,this analytical study presents the solitary wave interaction with a bottom mounted surface piercing v shaped breakwater the breakwater is impermeable thin and rigidly fixed on the bottom as a key element an imaginary closed cylinder with an arm s length radius was introduced so that the fluid domain was divided into three subdomains by an imaginary interface within which the solutions were described by eigenfunctions furthermore by satisfying the boundary and matching conditions in the subdomains the velocity potential at any point in the fluid domain could be determined the numerical results obtained for the limiting cases were verified by a comparison with previous predictions for a straight breakwater the effects of the wave incident angle opening angle of the breakwater and wave effect parameter on wave loads and wave run up were studied furthermore comparison and analysis of the hydrodynamic performance of the v shaped and arc shaped breakwaters with a similar structure showed that they had a similar wave attenuation effect however the v shaped breakwater was subject to smaller wave loads moreover for solitary wave diffraction caused by the breakwater the airy wave model might significantly underestimate wave run up keywords solitary wave v shaped breakwater arc shaped breakwater analytical derivation 1 introduction the breakwaters have been widely used in marine and coastal engineering for harbour and coastline protection because they can significantly reduce the hydrodynamic loads and wave run ups on the structures different marine environments require various forms of breakwaters that have been proposed investigated and applied in practice such as semi infinite breakwater wiegel 1962 sollitt and cross 1973 lee and kim 2006 rectangular breakwater mondal and alam 2018 fouladi et al 2020 detached breakwaters toyoshima 1975 filianoti 2000 nam and larson 2010 ashlin et al 2018 t type breakwaters neelamani and rajendran 2002 zhan et al 2017 deng et al 2019 arc shaped walls cheng et al 2007 liu and lin 2013 chu et al 2014 zhai et al 2020 2021 and cylindrical breakwaters darwiche et al 1994 williams and li 1998 tao et al 2009 liu et al 2018 among various types of breakwaters straight and cylindrical breakwaters are the most commonly used in practical applications the former is more appropriate for offshore applications whereas the latter is more often used far away from the coast for instance the well known ekofisk gravity offshore structure in the north sea is a cylindrical breakwater song and tao 2007 in many research works the estimation of wave loads and elevations is an important task which has garnered considerable attention from researchers and engineers in may 1999 a floating v shaped breakwater was developed as a new and rapidly installed breakwater system ribs by the u s army engineer research and development center erdc to provide a relatively stable environment for safe vessel operations see fig 1 without touching the seafloor the floating structure is extended vertically down to a certain depth and secured tightly in a v shape by a few mooring systems engineering practice shows that the wave defending effect of the v shaped breakwater is significant and similar facilities have been applied to prevent oil spills from tanker accidents briggs et al 2002 found that there were a few discrepancies between the measured load on the v shaped breakwater and the test numerical model based on the boundary element method using the eigenfunction expansion approach miao et al 2005 first analytically investigated the wave defending effects of a v shaped breakwater and presented analytical solutions based on the linear potential theory the bottom mounted v shaped breakwater has a better wave defending effect than the floating v shaped breakwater chang et al 2012 proposed a fast convergent method for analysing wave diffraction from a modified v shaped breakwater they mainly focused on the distribution of wave height and its attenuation more recently yu et al 2015 studied the wave pressure on the wet surface of a floating v shaped breakwater in random seas using the finite depth green function and boundary element methods the results showed that the pressure response is closely related to the opening angle of the v shaped breakwater and slightly related to the arm length previous study analysed hydrodynamic performance of the v shaped backwaters to a certain extent and left some aspects untouched analytical solution of the wave diffraction problem for a v shaped breakwater located in shallow waters has not been provided owing to the shallow water effect it is not appropriate to apply airy wave theory for the diffraction of structures near the coast when the characteristic wave height a d 0 4 and characteristic wave period t g d 11 where a is wave amplitude d is water depth t is wave period and g is the gravitation of gravity the experimental results showed that shallow water wave theories such as the cnoidal wave and solitary wave theories are more accurate for studying the diffraction problems in the shallow water area sarpkaya et al 1982 in general the v shaped breakwater can be regarded as a modification of a finite long straight breakwater most previous studies were focused on solitary wave interaction with infinity and semi infinite breakwaters experimental tests analytical models and numerical methods are the three main methods to study this problem sun et al 2018 power and chwang 1984 carried out a study on the reflection of a planar solitary wave at a vertical wall liu 1984 presented a linear diffraction solution of solitary wave interaction with a semi infinity thin wall via the fourier integral method and experimentally verified the accuracy of the solution based on the boussinesq equation in open water region derived by wu 1981 the numerical work of solitary wave interaction with a straight and thin breakwater at a constant water depth was given by wang 1993 based on depth integrated equations of motion lynett et al 2000 extended the work wu 1981 liu and wen 1997 to numerically study the interaction between solitary waves and a vertically porous breakwater model which is appropriate for weakly nonlinear weakly dispersive transient waves propagating in both variable depth open water and porous regions recently chen et al 2015 experimentally studied the reflection of steep solitary waves at a vertical wall comprehensively by using a high speed camera and image processing techniques where the experimental results were consistent with the previous theoretical investigations byatt smith 1971 su and mirie 1980 cooker et al 1997 and numerical simulations tanaka 1985 chambarel et al 2009 to the best of our knowledge no work has been reported on the analytical solution of solitary wave diffraction by a v shaped breakwater following the study conducted by miao et al 2005 for airy wave diffraction by a v shaped breakwater the interaction of a solitary wave diffraction from a v shaped breakwater is analytically investigated eigenfunction expansion and sub fluid region matching methods were used to develop analytical solutions through comparison with the existing research results the accuracy of the numerical results was verified a detailed analysis of the effect of the wave incident angle opening angle and wave effect parameter on the wave forces and elevations on the v shaped breakwater was explored in addition the wave loads and elevations of the v shaped and arc shaped breakwaters with similar structures were compared and analysed it is clearly shown that a v shaped breakwater is a reliable substitute for an arc shaped breakwater in certain cases the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the theoretical formulation is presented in section 2 sections 3 and 4 present the derivation of the analytical solution of the diffraction waves and the resulting wave forces wave moments and wave elevations a verification case was introduced in section 5 to prove the accuracy and efficiency of the analytical solution a detailed parametric study is presented in section 6 in section 7 a comparison of the hydrodynamic performance between v shaped and arc shaped breakwaters is presented finally the conclusions are drawn in section 8 2 theoretical formulation a schematic showing the solitary wave diffraction from a v shaped breakwater is presented in fig 2 the vertical bottom mounted and surface piercing v shaped breakwater is surrounded by a fluid of constant depth h the breakwater was assumed rigid and impermeable and its thickness was much smaller than the incident wavelength so that it can be regarded as a thin wall structure the length of each breakwater arm is a as seen in fig 2 the lower arm of the breakwater extends along the x axis and the opening angle between the upper and lower arms is α 0 α π the coordinate system is o x y z with the origin located at the intersection of two arms on the water bottom the z axis is directed vertically upwards where z 0 is the water bottom and z h is the still water level by introducing a virtual cylindrical structure with radius a the entire fluid domain is divided into three regions ω 1 r a 0 z h is the region of the outside the virtual cylinder ω 2 r a 0 z h 0 θ α is the region inside the breakwater and ω 3 r a 0 z h α θ 2 π is the region outside the breakwater the fluid is assumed inviscid and incompressible and its motion is irrotational the fluid motion may be described in term of the velocity potential φ x y z t re ϕ x y z t where ϕ is complex velocity potential and re is the real part of a complex expression furthermore the complex velocity potential in each region ω j j 1 2 3 can be written as ϕ j ϕ i ϕ s j where ϕ i and ϕ s j are the complex velocity potential of the incident and scattered waves respectively a right going solitary wave with a wave height h and speed c is incident upon the v shaped breakwater at an angle β β α 2 corresponds to normal wave incidence to the positive x axis the free surface elevation η i

addition the complex incident wave velocity potential ϕ i can be further written as 5 ϕ i 0 ϕ ˆ i k x c t d k evidently ϕ ˆ i k x c t satisfies the relation ϕ ˆ i x i k ϕ ˆ i 0 similarly if the complex scattered potential outside the region ω 1 can also be expressed as ϕ s 1 0 ϕ ˆ s 1 d k then ϕ ˆ s 1 must satisfy the sommerfeld radiation condition at infinity 6 lim r r ϕ ˆ s 1 r i k ϕ ˆ s 1

are a complete set of equations with the unknown coefficients a n 1 a n 2 a n 3 and b n 1 for the entire fluid domain the series are truncated after n terms and n lies between 0 and n previous studies such as ning et al 2017 and sarkar and bora 2020 have reported excellent convergence achieved by truncating the expansion series after finite terms e g n 20 the equation set can be written in matrix

known matrix related to the incident waves therefore the unknown coefficients can be obtained efficiently by considering only a few truncated terms the hydrodynamic force overturning moment and free surface elevation can subsequently be determined for engineering applications 4 calculation of wave force and elevation based on the derived velocity potential other physical quantities of interest can be easily obtained e g hydrodynamic loads overturning moments and wave elevation the first order approximation for the free surface elevation in each region is given by isaacson 1983 30 η j 1 g ϕ

difference between the two sides of the breakwater surface the diffraction problems pertaining to the wave field pressure distribution of linear water waves can be expressed as follows 31 p j ρ ϕ j t

the total hydrodynamic forces and overturning moments on the upper and lower arms can be expressed as follows 35 f 1 f 1 x 2 f 1 y 2 f 2 f 2 x 2 f 2 y 2 m 1 m 1 x 2 m 1 y 2 h 2 f 1 m 2 m 2 x 2 m 2 y 2 h 2 f 2 furthermore the total hydrodynamic forces and overturning moments on the v shaped breakwater can be written as 36 f f x 2 f y 2 m m x 2 m y 2 h 2 f in which 37 f x f 1 x f 2 x f y f 1 y f 2 y m x m 1 x m 2 x m y m 1 y m 2 y from the analytical formulation of the hydrodynamic loads and overturning moments on the v shaped breakwater it is seen that the values of the dimensionless overturning moments acting on the v shaped breakwater are exactly half of those of the corresponding dimensionless hydrodynamic loads thus the overturning moments on the breakwater must follow the same laws as the hydrodynamic loads in this study we present only the results of the wave force on the structure 5 model verification in this section a computer program was developed using fortran to implement the above analysis because no numerical and analytical results of solitary wave diffraction by a finite length v shaped breakwater were available this study results were compared with those of an infinite length straight wall vertical breakwater whose wave effects are calculated by wave reflection theory by choosing a special v shaped breakwater with an opening angle equal to 180 and enough large arm length the arm length a 1000 m in the calculations to give an effective verification of the proposed formulation meanwhile the water depth was set to h 5 m the maximum dimensionless wave runup η m a x h by choosing different wave amplitudes a 0 25 m 0 75 m 1 25 m 3 75 m the solitary wave travels normally to the straight breakwater when β α 2 90 and then total reflection occurs the first order and second order approximation analytical solutions of the solitary wave impact on an infinite vertical wall were derived by byatt smith 1971 later a third order approximation for the reflection of solitary waves at a vertical wall was derived by su and mirie 1980 the experimental results of maximum run up were obtained by camfield and street 1969 and chen et al 2015 respectively the numerical results of the maximum run up were calculated by chambarel et al 2009 the present analytical result agrees exactly with the solution of byatt smith 1971 as shown in fig 3 in addition when the dimensionless wave amplitude a h 0 4 our analytical results are in a good agreement with the published analytical numerical and experimental results however for a h 0 4 when the dimensionless wave amplitude increases the difference among results of various studies increase therefore the dimensionless wave amplitude a h 0 4 was adopted to ensure the accuracy of the results in this study 6 results and discussion considering that the wavelength of solitary waves is infinite the wave diffraction parameter k a tends to zero and becomes meaningless however diffraction is still a critical characteristic of interaction sankarbabu et al 2008 therefore the wave effect parameter c w h b 2 h 3 was introduced to provide a better description of solitary wave diffraction isaacson 1983 zhong and wang 2006 the factor ρ g h a h was used to nondimensionalize the hydrodynamic loads acting on the upper and lower arms moreover the maximum wave elevation near the breakwater is denoted as η which is dimensionless by h following the above model validation parameter studies were carried out to determine the influence of the different characteristics incident angle β opening angle α and wave effect parameter c w as computational examples we considered the case of a v shaped breakwater with two arms of 25 m in length located in a shallow area and subjected to a solitary wave with a wave height of 1 m 6 1 effect of wave incident angle fig 4 shows the variation in the maximum dimensionless hydrodynamic loads f 1 ρ g h a h f 2 ρ g h a h f ρ g h a h on the upper arm lower arm and v shaped structure for different incident angles β at the opening angle α 90 considering the symmetry of the v shaped breakwater the normal incidence β α 2 45 results in zero hydrodynamic loads for the v shaped structure the cases comprising four different wave incident angles at β α 2 45 β α 2 15 60 β α 2 30 75 and β α 2 45 90 were calculated figs 4 a and 4 b show that the wave force acting on the upper and lower arms first monotonically increases until it reaches the maximum and then decreases gradually with a further increase in c w in addition fig 4 a shows that the wave force on the upper arm monotonically decreases as the incident angle β increases that is because the lower arm has a certain shielding effect on the upper arm for the oblique incident wave from fig 4 c the wave force on the v shaped structure exhibits a similar trend to those in fig 4 a and the maximum force occurs near c w 1 3 furthermore the increase in the incident angle β has little influence on the wave force on the lower arm because an approximate total reflection occurs when an oblique incident wave implies a straight wall of finite length in general according to the wave refraction principle the shallow water wave incidence is approximately normal β α 2 when the wave spreads to the coast therefore close attention should be paid to normal incident waves due to the different wave incidence angles waves will interact with the breakwater in different ways e g the location and direction of wave collision with the breakwater and the impact of waves on the breakwater will vary with the incidence angle it is interesting to study the changes in the free surface elevations around the breakwater for varying incident angles β at c w 3 and α 90 to observe and analyse clearly we rotated the v shaped breakwater clockwise at α 2 in this study fig 5 shows the equi amplitude contours for the entire region with four different wave incident angles β 0 β 15 β 30 and β 45 clearly when β 0 the wave field loses symmetry and becomes much more complex as β increased from 0 to π 4 the wave run up around the lower arm increased gradually while the wave run up around the upper arm decreases slightly this also reflects the changing process of hydrodynamic loads more intuitively moreover the sheltered area of the structure decreased gradually as β increased 6 2 effect of the opening angle the opening angle of the v shaped breakwater determines the geometrical shape of the breakwater consequently it has directly influence on the wave effects as well fig 6 shows the variation of the maximum dimensionless hydrodynamic loads f ρ g h a h on the v shaped breakwater for different opening angles α at an incident angle β α 2 normal incident initially the hydrodynamic loads on the breakwater increase until a peak is attained and then decreases slightly with the increasing values of c w the opening angle α plays an important role in the wave force and the force gradually increases with the increase in α the maximum value of the force was 1 27 1 71 2 12 2 45 and 2 55 respectively for α 60 90 120 150 and 180 the peak value of the force at α 180 was twice as large as the force at α 60 moreover the wave force rapidly increases when α increases from 60 to 120 whereas the changes in the wave force magnitude do not vary significantly when α 150 therefore a v shaped breakwater with a small opening angle is more easily anchored and safer in practical engineering applications for normal incident waves β α 2 the wave forces acting on both arms were equal and synchronous changes with time fig 7 shows the variation of the hydrodynamic loads f 1 ρ g h a h on the upper arm versus the corresponding time g h h t for different opening angles α at the incident angle β α 2 as observed in fig 7 the peak and trough values of the force slightly increase as α increases whereas at the peak values the characteristics of sharp pulse changes are invariable in addition the absolute value of the trough is slightly higher compared to the peak value which means that the maximum wave force appears after the wave rounds the structure fig 8 shows the free surface elevation change near a v shaped breakwater for varying α when c w 2 5 and β 0 the maximum diffraction wave surface reaches its peak in front of the v shaped breakwater and the wave surface of the area behind the breakwater is significantly lower than that in front of the breakwater owing to the protection of the structure generally the wave height in the protected area can be reduced to about 20 50 of the incident wave height while the opening angle increases the wave run up on the lower and upper arms increases gradually for a more intuitive observation the corresponding wave run up on the upper arm is shown in fig 9 starts at the centre of the circle and ends at the end of the upper arm for r a 0 6 the dimensionless wave run up on the upper arm increases monotonically as α increases which means that the wave run up increases gradually at the intersection under the same arm length condition the amplitude of the dimensionless wave run up on both arms reaches a maximum at α 180 and the wave force also reaches the maximum value see fig 6 this indicates that the area in direct contact with waves increases leading to maximum wave run up and force increasing simultaneously as expected the sheltered area gradually increases when α increases however these results in the breakwater become increasingly difficult to anchor this observation is similar for airy wave scattering by a v shaped breakwater as in miao et al 2005 the pulse characteristic of the solitary wave surface propagation determines the characteristic of the dynamic wave forces acting on the v shaped breakwater considering all these factors the best opening angle of the v shaped breakwater was approximately between 90 and 120 for practical engineering 6 3 effect of the wave effect parameter fig 10 shows the variation of the hydrodynamic loads f 1 ρ g h a h on the upper arm versus corresponding time g h h t for different wave effect parameters c w at incident angles α 90 and β 45 in fig 10 the hydrodynamic loads on the upper arm vary between 1 2 and 1 2 with different c w meanwhile as c w increases the value of the crest is going to be larger than the absolute value of the trough which means that the maximum wave force exerted in front of the breakwater moreover the peak value of the wave force pulse gradually increases and moves towards the right when c w increases whereas the absolute value of the trough first increases and then decreases and also moves towards the right with a larger amplitude in addition the amplitude of the secondary pulse wave force increases with an increasing c w 7 comparison of the hydrodynamic performance of v shaped and arc shaped breakwaters it is interesting to discuss the hydrodynamic performance of v shaped and arc shaped breakwaters owing to their similar structure as shown in fig 11 as mentioned earlier cheng et al 2007 and miao et al 2005 studied the sheltering efficiency of arc shaped and v shaped breakwaters in water of finite depth based on a linearized velocity potential theory the derivation process of solitary wave diffraction by an arc shaped breakwater is shown in appendix a meanwhile our model was verified by comparison with the published results for a solid cylinder see fig 12 as shown in fig 11 the following two cases were compared 1 α 1 α 120 a 1 a 25 m and 2 α 1 180 α 90 a 1 25 m a 25 2 m moreover the two types of breakwaters were located at a constant water depth of h 5 m the incident wave height was h 1 m we focused on the comparison of the hydrodynamic loads and wave elevations thus the superiority and inferiority of the two types of breakwaters were explored 7 1 comparison of wave forces between the arc shaped and v shaped breakwaters the comparison of the dimensionless wave force on the arc shaped and v shaped breakwaters with two types of incident waves is shown in figs 13 and 14 according to figs 13 a and 14 a the wave force on the two breakwaters maintains a similar trend at a small value of k d and their difference is small when k d 2 especially for case 1 however according to figs 13 b and 14 b the force on the arc shaped breakwater is significantly larger than that of the v shaped breakwater as the wave effect parameter c w 1 5 this reason is that waves do not effectively aggregate at the tip of the v shaped breakwater while waves can be efficiently aggregated and uniformly distributed on the arc shaped breakwater 7 2 comparison of wave elevations between the arc shaped and v shaped breakwaters the changes in the wave surface distribution near a v shaped and an arc shaped breakwater with 2 types of incident waves are shown in figs 15 and 16 for the two cases as expected all equi amplitude plots were symmetric with respect to the longitudinal x axis moreover for case 1 of the solitary wave as the incident wave the maximum free surface elevation before and after the breakwater see fig 15 c and d was evidently higher than that of the airy wave see fig 15 a and b in addition for cases 1 and 2 the sheltered area of the arc shaped breakwater was slightly larger than that of the v shaped breakwater and it was subject to larger wave loads in addition the wave elevation at the tip behind the v shaped breakwater was higher than that of the arc shaped structure the reason behind is the rate of decay of the wave elevation on the arms of the v shaped breakwater was slower than that of the arc shaped breakwater as the wave rounded them despite the obvious difference in the inside domain solutions for the v shaped and arc shaped breakwaters the geometrical similarity of the two structures leads to the wave amplitude distribution being close in the vicinity x the corresponding free surface profiles along the centreline of the two types of breakwaters are shown in fig 17 the wave elevation of the solitary wave is larger than that of the airy wave which is consistent with the observations in figs 15 and 16 this implies that considering the effect of solitary waves on the structure in the limiting case is more reliable compared to the airy wave in marine engineering design overall case 1 is more similar to case 2 in structure their wave defending effects are similar as well in other words a v shaped breakwater is an appropriate substitute for an arc shaped breakwater at an opening angle α 120 additionally v shaped and arc shaped breakwaters has a similar wave attenuation effect under the same conditions the v shaped breakwater was subject to less hydrodynamic loads however the sheltered area was slightly smaller moreover the construction of a v shaped breakwater is economical and convenient for practical engineering 8 conclusion the solitary wave interaction with a bottom mounted surface piercing v shaped breakwater was investigated analytically using the eigenfunction expression approach the present method were validated by comparing the numerical results for limiting cases with the experimental analytical and numerical results provided in camfield and street 1969 byatt smith 1971 and chambarel et al 2009 a detailed analysis of the effect of the wave incident angle opening angle of the breakwater and wave effect parameters on wave forces and elevations on the breakwater were explored the main conclusions drawn were as follows 1 as the incident angle increased the wave patterns near the v shaped breakwater became much more complex because the lower arm had a certain shielding effect on the upper arm for the oblique incident wave the force on the upper arm gradually decreased in comparison the lower arm itself was subject to relatively larger wave loads 2 as the opening angle of the breakwater increased the sheltered area gradually increased meanwhile the maximum wave force also increased consequently employing the breakwater became increasingly difficult 3 for solitary wave diffraction caused by a v shaped breakwater the airy wave model might significantly underestimate wave run ups 4 by comparing and analysing the hydrodynamic performance of v shaped and arc shaped breakwaters with a similar structure the results showed that they exhibited similar wave attenuation effects however the v shaped breakwater was subject to smaller wave loads and it could be more economical and convenient to construct in practice credit authorship contribution statement zhenfeng zhai conceptualization validation

of the solitary wave diffraction by an arc shaped breakwater this section presents the derivation process of solitary wave interaction with an arc shaped breakwater a schematic diagram is shown in fig 18 symbols a 1 and h denote the arc shaped wall radius and still water depth respectively the breakwater was symmetrically placed between θ γ and θ 2 π γ in particular the central angle of the breakwater was α 1 2 π 2 γ as a key element a virtual closed circular cylindrical structure was introduced to extend the structure from the same centre cheng et al 2007 thus the fluid domain was divided into two sub regions the region outside of the arc shaped breakwater ω 1 r a 1 0 z h and the region inside of the arc shaped breakwater ω 2 r a 1 0 z h the fluid motion can be described in terms of the velocity potential φ x y z t re ϕ x y z t the complex velocity potential in each region ω j j 1 2 can be written as ϕ j ϕ i ϕ s j on the arc shaped breakwater and virtual cylindrical

20763,in this study a floating barge moon pool platform model equipped with an nrel 5 mw wind turbine and mooring systems was numerically and experimentally tested under wave and wind loads to analyze the hydrodynamic performance and stability of the barge platform and the mooring system in a 50 m water depth condition the numerical model was based on ansys aqwa and this hydrodynamic model included nonlinear hydrostatic and froude krylov forces diffraction radiation forces obtained from the linear potential theory and morison forces to consider viscous effects on the heave plates the experiment model was a 1 64 scaled barge platform with an nrel 5 mw wind turbine scaled in the same ratio both full coupling platform were simulated under three conditions namely free decay test regular wave test and irregular wave test including a typhoon extreme case with wind operation and parking first the hydrodynamic model was calibrated against the free decay test results consequently a good agreement was achieved by calibrating the mooring properties of the experiment model a comparison of the regular wave cases was then performed with the same trend of results observed for the surge heave and pitch motions of the floating barge system finally irregular model tests which aimed to measure the dynamics of the barge platform and the mooring system in a 50 year sea state in taiwan offshore were conducted the motion responses of the barge platform and the mooring tensions were recorded and compared with full coupled dynamic analysis results the dnv gl standards were used to check the reliability of the mooring system and the stability of the barge platform keywords barge floating platform fowt experiment and numerical morison equation mooring system model 1 introduction the floating offshore wind market is gradually growing worldwide offshore wind previously dominated in some countries located in relatively shallow water depths 40 m and near shores 30 km fixed bottom foundation is used to support the wind turbine populous areas near the coast have been developed to be saturated and seabed conditions are not suitable for the traditional fixed bottom foundation with the energy demand the floating wind is a potentially sustainable future energy source offshore wind is expected to be developed further from the shore 30 km and in deeper water 60 m golbert et al 2016 offshore wind energy has been the focus of many engineers and researchers these days more and more countries are beginning to explore the potential of floating offshore wind power in particular japan the united states us and many european countries including the united kingdom norway france portugal and spain have significant potential for growth 1 1 the concepts of different types fowts different floating platform types are currently applied in countries the common four types of floating wind platform were presented as below 1 1 1 spar buoy the spar buoy floating platform uses large cylindrical shaped structures which are moored by ballast with catenary mooring systems the cylindrical shaped structure is usually composed of steel or concrete and ballasted by water and soil this mechanism used to let the lower half of substructure be heavy and the upper half of substructure near the surface be lighter which has a comparatively large draft one advantage of spar buoy platform is a simple device and excellent stability and it is easier to normalization and standardization however the structure is larger resulting in the relatively high platform s cost the deeper draft of platform requires deeper water depth james et al 2018 1 1 2 semi submersible the semi submersible floating platform integrates two designs it uses the distributed buoyancy stabilized type and connects the sea floor with the catenary mooring system to maintain balance compared with spar buoy type the draft is much shallower even less than 10 m which means that it can be deployed in areas with a water depth of approximately 40 50 m in addition the shallower draft makes it possible to install the wind turbine system in harbors then transport it to offshore by using tug boats one advantage of semi submersible floating platforms is that the characteristic of this platform is flexible to a range of water depths it can take advantage of ballast inside the chamber to adjust stabilization as mentioned before in terms of operation and maintenance o m this kind of platform largely decreases the demand for personnel and equipment james et al 2018 1 1 3 tension leg platform tlp the tension leg floating platform uses the underwater buoyant structure and is anchored to seabed with a taut leg mooring system called vertical tendons which are made by steel to add the integral buoyancy and stability the main advantage of tension leg platform is that the demand for substructure is smaller and lighter and therefore the lower material costs owing to taut leg mooring systems resulting in vertical tension at the anchor point and relatively smaller footprint the sea area required is relatively small the anchor types are used either gravity anchors suction anchors or anchor piles according to seabed condition and geology to withstand large vertical loads however if the tendons of platform fail it may lead to turnover the earthquake is common in taiwan and breaks one of tethers which may lose stability severely the stability of tension leg platform before anchorage is not good as well as it is hard to disconnect if the wind turbines are to be assembled and maintained onshore or in the dry dock the problem of subsequent towage must be considered all of above will influence operational risks and increase the difficulty of construction atcheson et al 2016 1 1 4 barge type platform the barge floating platform concept is extended form semi submersible it s a concrete or steel floating hull with shallow draft to support the wind turbine system it uses the distributed buoyancy stabilized type to achieve stability using the large weighted water plane area the floating barge is characterized by a square and ring shaped floating platform with a central pool called the moon pool which absorbs the wave loads and diminish the floater motion ideol has developed a foundation based on a patented damping pool the wind turbine is put on the side it comes also with a catenary mooring system which will prevent drifting j m jonkman and buhl jr 2007 it is much easier to install a floating wind turbine further from shore and without any constraints on the other users of marine environment with floating offshore wind the wind turbine is mounted onto the floating platform at quayside before tugging the entire assembly offshore because of shape the large platform area can accommodate the transmission equipment the maintenance and repairs procedure could be easy ideol 2019 the comparison of three design concepts is detailed below see table 1 the spar buoy platform has commercial wind farms in operation such as the hywind pilot park in scotland by statoil fig 1 a the semisubmersible platform has full scale field tests such as windfloat pacific in the us by principle power fig 1 b the tension leg platform is under development and demonstration e g gicon sof pilot in congermany by gicon fig 1 c meanwhile the barge platform has been consented in floatgen in france by ideol fig 1 d in this study we chose a barge type fowt to support the wind turbine and designed a floating barge platform that can be resisted by wind and waves in taiwan 1 2 the scale models test of fowts in order to validate the performance of fowts tri floater courbois 2013 müller et al 2014 roddier et al 2010 huijs huijs et al 2013 hiprwind ishihara et al 2009 windsea windsea 2010 iberdrola amate et al 2014 poseidon floating power by the netherlands floating power plant as pelastar tlp vita et al 2015 and volturnus viselli et al 2015 have been tested in scale models which the model scaled between 1 300 and 1 2 in europe müller et al 2014 fowts are highly complex systems aerodynamics loads wind turbine hydrodynamics loads floating structure and mooring lines elasticity blade pitch controls and restoring force effect of mooring lines are needed to consider in the dynamic models j jonkman butterfield musial and scott 2009 in this paper a full coupling model including wind wave and mooring system loads had been studied in 1 64 scale under taiwan offshore sea conditions the testing conditions are referenced from the hsinchu offshore sea condition for the numerical and experimental model 1 3 the environmental condition in taiwan the wind power in the coastal areas of western taiwan is very strong especially the northeast monsoon during winter the power potential is estimated to be approximately 23 gw in 36 power potential sites the water depth range is from 20 to 50 m as water depth greater than 40 m then it could be considered using the floating platform technology the wind energy density in hsinchu and miaoli offshore are the highest area in taiwan and the distance from the shore are appropriate which are also due to the constrictive effect of the taiwan strait the potential for development is approximately 9 gw its energy density is approximately 1 8 times higher than the current 36 power potential sites announced the special geographical conditions are the advantages of taiwan s wind power development taiwan is known for its excellent caisson manufacturing and the caisson just like the floating barge another advantage is the much shallower draft which can be deployed in areas with water depths of 40 50 m that is suitable for taiwan s water depth the easy transportation and maintenance procedure and the large content of concrete not steel can reduce the cost which is also an advantage for taiwan s marine engineering team these are the reasons why the barge was chosen as the floating platform in this study the highest wind energy is located in hsinchu and miaoli offshore where the water depth is around 50 100 m 2 governing equations and numerical setup we used ansys aqwa as the simulation software herein it can simulate linearized hydrodynamic fluid wave loading on floating bodies wave loads on floating structures calculated during radiation diffraction simulation can be mapped to a finite element structural analysis the following outlined theory has its reference mainly from the aqwa theory manual ansys 2013 and uses the boundary element method that can simultaneously solve and output the first and second order wave effects in the frequency and time domains second order forces can be calculated from either near or far field solutions and accomplished by employing a three dimensional 3d radiation diffraction theory including morison s equation in regular and irregular waves in the time and frequency domains waves passing through marine structures such as a barge platform actually affect the fluid because the fluid passing through marine structures may produce complex vortex phenomena behind the object we will divide the force of the entire wave field into two parts 1 forces from the sea wave and 2 dynamic motion response of the floating platform 2 1 morison equation the morison equation approach based on the fluid potential theory is widely used for calculating a small body floating structure in waves when value of the characteristic length such as diameter d of column structure over wavelength l d l is small than 0 2 then the morison equation can be used forces from the sea wave can be split into first and second order terms the first order terms consist of motion at a wave frequency such as the incident wave force froude krylov force and the diffraction or radiation force induced by the disturbance wave due to the existence of a body in the froude krylov force the fluid motion is not affected by the existence of a cylinder that is the fluid force acts directly on the cylinder without considering the diffraction wave of the existence of the cylinder the diffraction radiation force can be solved by the source distribution method in aqwa by assuming the fluid ideal using a velocity potential function employing the linear hydrodynamic theory and considering wave radiation and diffraction the wave inertia or radiation load is caused by the disturbed waves induced by the structure motions solved by fluid potential theories the hydrodynamic force including drag can be calculated as follows using the morison equation when the characteristic diameter is less than 0 2 to the wavelength for the cylinder elements 1 f ρ ω α w ρ c a ω α w ρ c a ω x 1 2 ρ c d d v v each term in the equation represents the froude krylov wave inertia radiation and drag forces from left to right where α w x acceleration of the flow and the body respectively c a c d added mass and drag coefficients of the element respectively v relative velocity between the flow and the body ω volume of the element per unit length d characteristic drag diameter λ wave length the second order terms are much smaller than first order terms the second order force including both loads with low frequency force slow drift and sum frequency quadratic transfer function qtf if their frequency is close to the floating structure s natural frequency they will cause the floating structure to drift slowly the second order motion and force are some of the major design considerations for safety in marine structures the second order wave of the hydrodynamic responses of a floating or fixed structure is assumed as an inviscid irrotational homogeneous and incompressible fluid moreover both the fluid of the wave amplitude and the amplitude of the corresponding structural motion responses are small in shallow water the second order potential can significantly increase the drift force coefficients therefore the second order incident and diffraction potentials must be included to accurately evaluate the second order wave excitation force in shallow water the second order wave is calculated using pinkster approximation ja pinkster 1980 in aqwa 2 2 motion equation when the wave passes through the floating structure the structure moves due to the wave s action for the responses and force of structure in the x direction the equation of motion of the structure in the frequency domain for the unit wave amplitude can be written as follows 2 f ω m s x m a ω x b ω x c x where m s structure mass m a added mass frequency dependent b damping frequency dependent c hydrostatic stiffness f wave force incident and diffracting force x x x accelerations velocity and displacement of the body the motion equation shows that the structure mass added mass radiation damping and hydrostatic stiffness are balanced by the external force as for the structure the wave created by the structure movement contains two parts progressive and oscillating waves the progressive wave transfers energy away exhibiting energy loss for the structural system it is added to the formula called the radiation damping term a part of the oscillating wave does not pass outwards thereby causing difficulties in the structure movement just like the increase in the structure mass called the added mass generally speaking the analysis of the floating structures includes the wave field generated by the movement of the floating structure and the motion of the floating structure fig 2 depicts the coupling of the wave force and the structural motion 2 3 numerical setup process the numerical setup was performed herein following four steps 2 3 1 setup of the barge platform model before the numerical analysis the floating platform should be established to a 3d model and the relative relationship of the position height angle and components of the floating platform in space must be defined we used ansys geometry which provides a modern interface as the modeling tool first the appropriate length units e g meters millimeters feet and inches were chosen in the modeling environment depending on the model size after the model establishment the 3d model information was imported into the ansys static structure to calculate the weight center of gravity and moment of inertia data required 2 3 2 setup of the environment in the frequency domain the second step is to set the floating platform parameters in the wave field as a solution to the hydrodynamic response in the frequency domain the parameters input in hydrodynamic diffraction were 50 m water depth and 1025 kg m3 seawater density the wave direction range was 180 180 and the interval was 30 the wave frequency was set with equal periodic interval the period range was 5 30 s and the interval period was 1 s the mesh affected the accuracy of the hydrodynamic properties of the analyzed structures in this thesis uniform mesh was used and the parameter was set to 2 m as a unit 2 3 3 setup of the mooring system the mooring system design and verification had been done in orcaflex then input the characteristic parameters of the designed mooring system to aqwa the mooring system can be interpreted as fixing the floating platform or restricting its motion within the allowed safety range aqwa allows users to set different connections including the joint fender and cable this study used the catenary mooring system 2 3 4 setup of the hydrodynamic response in the time domain the last step is setting inputs of the related parameters that need to be set in aqwa when the dynamic analysis of the floating barge platform is performed in the time domain in setting the external force conditions two environmental factors are discussed in this thesis 1 wave force and 2 wind force aqwa was used to analyze the structural position cable tension and anchor forces in 6 degrees of freedom dof under the actions of wind and wave this thesis assumed that the wave condition involves regular and irregular waves the wave direction was set to 0 and represented the positive x axis the stokes second order wave theory was used by the regular wave while jonswap spectrum was used by the irregular wave the total simulation time was 6000 s the motion in the time series started to stabilize at approximately 2000 s fig 3 illustrates the flow chart of the aqwa setup 2 4 mooring system model verification software the model mooring system was redesign in this paper in order to verify equivalent restoring force from full scale mooring system to scaled model mooring system we used the orcaflex as the verification tool for mooring system orcaflex uses finite element model for a line the line is divided into a series of line segments which are then modelled by straight massless model segments with a node at each end the model segments only model the axial and torsional properties of the line the other properties mass weight buoyancy etc are all lumped to the nodes that is the line is modelled as a series of lumps of mass joined together by massless springs the lumps of mass are called nodes and the springs joining them are called segments each segment represents a short piece of the line whose properties mass buoyancy drag etc have been lumped for modeling purposes at the nodes at its ends 3 barge type fowt and experimental setup 3 1 target model a floating barge type platform with an nrel 5 mw wind turbine was chosen as the target platform model as shown in fig 4 and fig 5 the model appearance is similar to the ideol barge platform the wind turbine was mounted on the side because the damping moon pool is at the center of the platform the weights of the floating platform and the nrel 5 mw wind turbine were 32 200 282 kg and 1 038 400 kg respectively the significant difference between the ideol platform and our target platform was in the inner hull that uses a different chamber configuration fig 6 the platform had different size and ballast balance stability moreover the platform redesigned the catenary mooring system to adapt the water depth in offshore taiwan the wind turbine position was relatively heavy thus the center of gravity must be balanced by a permanent solid or iron as the platform ballast table 2 shows more details about the barge type platform table 3 and fig 7 and fig 8 show the specification power curve augusto antônio coutinho silva 2018 and thrust curve respectively of the nrel oc5 5 mw wind turbine the cut in and cut out velocities were 3 and 25 m s respectively while the rated wind speed was 11 4 m s at which point the electricity generation was no longer achieved through the torque control in the rotor axis instead pitch control was required and the 5 mw nominal generation was maintained from this speed on the mooring system aims to keep the floating platform within a specified range to provide the floating platform stability according to the reference position the mooring system herein referred to the oc5 deepcwind semisubmersible floating system robertson et al 2016 but the water depth was adjusted from 50 to 200 m therefore a redesigned mooring system was used for the platform in 50 m water depth to provide the same restoring force the mooring system must be increased to eight mooring lines fig 9 and the stiffness must be in accordance with the catenary equation the chain nominal diameter of the designed mooring system was 162 mm a grade r3 stud less chain was chosen as the mooring component the unstretched mooring line length was 280 m and the radius to anchor from the platform centerline was 300 m fig 10 presents the other arrangement details of the mooring system table 4 and fig 11 show the properties and a side view of the mooring system respectively 3 2 wave basin and instrumentation the model tests were conducted in the near shore wave basin of tainan hydraulics laboratory thl in national cheng kung university fig 12 left the near shore wave basin was 60 m long 7 m wide and 1 m deep and equipped with long crest wave generators operating through an electro control system producing irregular waves up to 0 32 m high at tpeak of 1 6 2 5 s the north south direction length direction was the wave making direction a piston type irregular wave generator fig 12 right was installed in the north of the wave basin the wave generator was 7 m wide and 1 2 m high the wave generating unit was a hydraulic power drive system the wave generator had a device which is an active reflection compensation system this device was equipped with three sets of wave gauges and an electronic signal box on the wave paddle to measure the water level in front of the wave blade the water level calculated on the wave paddle and the actual water level was used to conduct feedback compensation actions three capacitive wave gauges were installed to measure the wave elevations during the model test the distances were 4 67 m in the front of the experimental model and 2 5 and 4 m in the back the capacitance wave gauges fig 13 were developed and manufactured by the thl the linear relationship between the water level and the capacitance measurement circuit was used to measure the wave level change ℓ represents the total length of the wire and h represents the water level the capacitance value is denoted by cw when the capacitance line is completely submerged in water the capacitance value is ca when it is completely submerged in air the capacitance is c cw ca h ca when h is submerged in water when a wave passes the wire immersion variation generates a capacitance variation that can be recorded by the recording system three kinds of sensors were installed in the platform in the model test first a led tracking system was applied to measure the heave and surge motion responses of the platform this study used red light leds with full color cameras fig 14 to track the displacement of the floating platforms through image processing and analysis second a gyroscope fig 15 was manufactured by xsens to measure the accelerations and rotors of three axes the type specification was mti 30 attitude and heading reference system ahrs a full gyro enhanced ahrs it outputs drift free roll pitch and true magnetic north referenced yaw the roll pitch accuracy was 0 2 and 0 5 static and dynamic respectively and 0 1 in the yaw direction the tension load cells fig 16 were manufactured by japan ssk to measure the mooring line tension attached to the fairlead the rated output were 5 and 10 kgf called herein as lt10 5 and lt10 10 respectively the load pin was completely waterproof and can be immersed in water for 3 m a data acquisition system was used to simultaneously obtain the data of the wave elevation mooring line tensions and platform motion response all equipment were calibrated before the model tests 3 3 experimental model the model scale was 1 64 including the wind turbine barge platform and mooring system froude scaling laws were adopted in this experiment to fit the geometric kinematic and dynamic similitude reynolds number was generally used to maintain the wind turbine model similitude in other words the aerodynamics and the hydrodynamics are suited to two different dimensionless scaling laws however we can only fit one dimensionless parameter in a scaled model hence to simulate the full coupling dynamic response we simulated the wind turbine model through modified wind turbine blades to fit the froude scaling laws table 5 presents the main dimensions of the prototype and the nrel 5 mw wind turbine barge platform scaled model the mooring line tension was mainly provided by the self weight of the mooring line under the static and quasi static situations however the mooring line stiffness generated a highly nonlinear tension change under the dynamic stage in which the mooring lines were completely suspended in the water therefore to design the mooring scaled models the geometry of the mooring lines i e length density diameter and weight was considered to ensure equivalent restoring force and offsets the restoring force of the mooring line was the same as the original scale the material stiffness must be considered in the scale model the main idea of designing a scale mooring system model is to keep the restoring force and the excursion relation in the same ratio in the model scale four steps are followed to design a scaled mooring system model first scale down to 1 64 the relationship between the surge displacement and the restoring force of the prototype mooring system second calculate the length and the unit weight of the single mooring line to provide the equivalent restoring force approximately equal to the maximum force for the floating platform model by the catenary theory third adjust the maximum angles in the fairlead diameter and length of the mooring line to fit the restoring force curve fourth calculate the spring constant k to let the model match the stiffness in the prototype after this design process the spring constant is calculated to 3 697 n cm fig 17 depicts the mooring line model with a spring table 6 lists the mooring system specification of the prototype and the test model 3 4 experimental descriptions the experiments were divided into three parts 1 characteristic calibration tests including the wave generator wind turbine barge platform and mooring system 2 regular wave tests and 3 extreme condition tests conducted to obtain mooring tensions and the motion performance of the floating barge platform the study focuses on full coupling dynamic motion and the mooring line reliability the regular wave was simulated by airy wave considered as the simplest ocean wave and based on the assumption of a homogeneous incompressible inviscid fluid and irrotational flow when nonlinear effects that are weak or strong occur only intermittently the waves can be treated as linear waves on a large scale with relatively small nonlinear corrections at these scales holthuijsen 2007 the irregular wave was simulated by the jonswap spectrum the target site was hsinchu offshore as for the west coast of taiwan hwung chiang and liao 2003 collected the wave data of hsinchu and taichung offshore the analysis results suggested that the spectrum of these coastal areas is represented by the jonswap spectrum and γ 2 08 is suitable six regular wave cases and four irregular wave cases were assessed table 7 and table 8 present all conditions the sensor sampling frequency was 50 hz the duration for the regular wave test was 300 s whereas that for the irregular cases was 600 s corresponding to approximately 40 and 80 min in the prototype respectively 4 results and discussion the fully coupled dynamic analysis was performed by ansys aqwa the simulation duration was 20 000 s and the time step was 0 1 s the numerical results including the platform motion responses and the mooring tensions will be compared with the experimental results only the most loaded mooring lines top end tensions will be discussed all the results shown in this section have been transformed to full scale value 4 1 wave calibration tests the wave generated by the wave maker must be calibrated before performing the irregular model tests the wave elevation was recorded by the wave gauge the wave spectrum was transformed to form a raw wave elevation by fast fourier transform fft fig 18 shows the results wherein the measured spectrum was in a good agreement with the target proving that the wave maker worked well and was capable of conducting the next irregular model tests 4 2 wind turbine calibration test fig 19 shows the process of the designed scaled wind turbine through the design process fig 20 presents the good match curves of the wind speed and the thrust force in both target and model in full scale a maximum thrust of approximately 3 n was obtained in the 1 64 scaled model when the wind speed was equal to 11 4 m s in full scale the redesigned wind turbine model had a tower and an experimental wind turbine with four mini fans fig 21 illustrates that the relationship between the motor control signal and the output thrust of each mini fan must be designed following the installation position of the experimental fans in this study each fan input the same signal controlled by pulse width modulation pwm therefore the force of the wind turbine was presented by controlling the thrust of the motor output in addition to the mini fans the experimental wind turbine was also equipped with a gyroscope and a load cell to output the attitude of the wind turbine and measure the load the mini fan will generate the corresponding thrust at every rotating speed 4 3 mooring system model calibration test the characteristics of the mooring system must be calibrated before conducting the model tests the calibration was done in orcaflex fig 22 the barge platform was given a time series displacement from 0 469 to 0 469 m and each position was paused for 30 s the position was constantly changed the corresponding mooring system surge restoring force was recoded and the relationship between the surge displacement and the mooring system restoring force was obtained the mooring system model calibration test result confirmed a good agreement in the target and measured value fig 23 fig 24 exhibits the mooring system configuration in the model test 4 4 barge platform model verification in free decay in the free decay test the floating platform was moved to a fixed displacement or rotated in a fixed inclination under stable situations it was used in conjunction with the gyroscope and a led image tracking system to measure the heave roll and pitch motion decaying with time to evaluate the experimental error an inclinometer and a displacement meter were used to ensure that each displacement was fixed each free decay test was repeated thrice to examine the experimental repeatability and the convergence rate of the error the time series motion was measured during the tests moreover raw data were transformed with the fast fourier series obtained to acquire the natural period in three directions the difference between the simulation and experimental result in the three directions is discussed below 4 4 1 mooring system damping effect the free decay test was divided into two parts 1 barge platform without mooring system and 2 barge platform with a mooring system the differences will be discussed in the subsequent sections fig 25 presents the results of the time series motion in the three directions without a mooring system fig 26 illustrates the natural frequency results in the three directions the experimental results showed that each time series dates had an excellent periodic phase overlap indicating that the experiment is highly repeatable through an fft analysis the natural periods of heave roll and pitch were obtained as 11 04 9 29 and 9 23 s without the mooring system and 10 99 s 10 41 s and 10 62 s with the mooring system respectively table 9 sorts all the natural period results the mooring system can slightly change the natural period of the platform especially in the roll and pitch directions see table 9 4 4 2 moon pool damping effect in the heave direction the designed floating barge platform had two different natural periods in fig 27 the solid line represents the natural period without the mooring system while the dashed line represents the natural period with the mooring system the natural periods of the platform with the mooring system were 7 98 and 10 99 s in full scale this concept of the floating barge platform was like the tuned liquid damper tld frandsen 2004 primary resonance period or the natural period of the platform and secondary resonance period or the natural period of fluid sloshing the system is a 2 dof structure with two natural frequencies the tld at the external force frequency will generate liquid oscillation in the barge platform the water will produce the liquid sloshing coupling phenomenon and the resonance phenomenon will occur at a specific frequency a resonance relationship will exist between the natural frequency of the platform and the fluid in the water the oscillating force generated by the fluid sloshing can help offset the platform s motion 4 5 dynamic response of the barge platform under regular and irregular waves the dynamic responses of the barge floating platform and the tension of the mooring system during the wave and wind load are the two main indicators for checking the barge platform stability section 3 4 and table 6 present all the regular wave conditions the response amplitude operator rao which is a non dimensional parameter was used herein to evaluate the responses of the barge platform under different regular wave periods the rao is defined in eq 3 when the incident wave is a regular wave the rao can be defined as the ratio of the amplitude of the motion responses to the amplitude of the incident wave journée and massie 2001 3 r a o z a δ a where z a is the motion amplitude of the center of gravity position and δ a is the amplitude of the incident wave the responses in three motion directions i e surge heave and pitch were calculated in the raos the results of which are then compared with the numerical results 4 5 1 regular wave load regular wave tests without wind were performed fig 28 shows the rao analysis for the surge heave and pitch motion without wind including the simulation and experimental results there was a good agreement between the numerical and experimental trends and the peak values of surge and pitch directions were presented in the same period the most of experimental rao values were slightly smaller than numerical values the phenomenon could cause by the viscosity damping effect on the experiment the increase in the surge direction was mainly caused by the wave frequency closing to the frequency of the storing force of the mooring system in the heave rao the interaction between the structure and the wave produced a heave resonance at this time the platform mainly moved up and down and its amplitude was equal to the incident wave amplitude in addition the experimental results in the resonance region were smaller than the numerical predictions the main reason for this is that when the bottom of platform was at a right angle the vertical flow velocity of the water particles at the bottom became larger at resonance and the right angled edges were prone to separation flow and eddy currents in low pressure areas the pitch rao initially increased with period and gradually rose to a peak and started to decrease because the frequency of the incident wave resonated with the structure when the period was approximately 11 s in the three directions the rao value gradually reached the peak and decreased after the period was approximately 9 11 s the surge and pitch rao value at 14 s was about half of the peak value when the period was at 11 s the wind effect was also considered the wind fan controller generated the thrust to simulate the maximum thrust in the 3 016 n in model scale 790 6 kn in full scale fig 29 depicts the test results the reduction effect at the resonance period was more obvious in cases with wind the maximum surge dynamic response decreased from rao 2 to rao 1 which was 1 2 of the original because the wind force acted on the floating platform under the influence of the wind hence the pretension of the mooring system was increased and improved the platform stability in the heave and pitch directions the difference between cases without and with wind was very small this phenomenon represents that the response of the platform under the action of wind is still similar to that of the regular wave only it did not cause platform instability in the heave and pitch directions furthermore the wind turbine can operate and generate electricity under the wave height of 6 4 m in the sea 4 5 2 irregular wave load the wave spectrum is an important statistical property of random ocean waves it not only contains the second order of the waves but also gives the energy distribution of the wave relative to the frequency and direction the time domain analysis uses the johnswap spectrum the following wave conditions table 8 in hsinchu taiwan were selected normal sea state northeast monsoon 10 year return period 50 year return period and uniform wind speed converted to the wind speed of the potential site of 11 4 11 4 60 and 60 m s the total experimental time was 220 s including an additional 20 s at the beginning of the time series to omit the unstable stages in the analysis figs 30 32 show the three extreme condition results for the irregular motion of the heave roll and pitch we observed the peak value and frequency in the northeast monsoon the wind turbine operation has more influence on the response of the surge and the tension once the wind turbine starts to operate the steady displacement presented in x axis direction because of the thrust generation force moving the fowt to the positive x axis direction then the mooring system provided a restoring force on the fowt the balance process of two forces make the fowt have dynamic motion in x axis direction the platform motion in the pitch direction was mainly observed herein no absolute criteria were provided for the platform stability this thesis sets the criteria that the proposed range of angles allowed in the pitch direction is 10 the statistics results are detailed below based on the standard normal distribution of four different sea states the data were converted into probabilities and the probability of over 10 was calculated bar graphs figs 33 35 in the experiment table 10 the probability of the pitch response exceeding 10 in the normal sea state approached 0 the data of the northeast monsoon sea conditions were estimated the proportion of the pitch response exceeding 10 was quite low at only 0 262 the probabilities of the 10 and 50 year return periods were 0 9 and 2 58 respectively 4 6 mooring system analysis 4 6 1 reliability of the mooring system the analysis of the mooring operations should consider the most severe load expected from the environmental conditions and the operating time of the mooring position and calculate the mooring line tension less than the minimum breaking load mbl dnvgl 2015 4 m b l t d the minimum breaking load m b l and the mooring system tension t d were calculated following eq 6 the load factor requirements for design of the mooring lines of proof load and the breaking load are presented in table 11 and table 12 5 m b l i n k n c d 2 44 0 08 d d i n m m where c is the load factor d is the chain nominal diameter in mm and the minimum breaking load was calculated in kn the values of the proof test load of stud less and the breaking test load are shown below the dynamic tensions of the mooring system of four different irregular wave conditions with and without turbine operation were compared to the proof test load and the breaking test load in full scale fig 36 and fig 37 the mooring system tension was less than the proof load and breaking load the design tension t d was then compared to the proof test load and the breaking test load fig 38 and fig 39 were the fast fourier transform fft analysis for irregular wave and tension except the extreme wave condition jh87t12 case the maximum tension showed the corresponding period with wave period however in the jh87t12 case the period of maximum tension happened around 16 2 s which longer than the significant wave period in the other words effect of the long wave period will induce larger tension than the wave height 4 6 2 mooring system design confirmation the design standard for the floating wind turbines was considered the load design of the mooring system is defined as follows 6 t d γ m e a n t c m e a n γ d y n t c d y n where t c m e a n denotes the mean tension of the time series t c d y n is defined as the dynamic line tension of the 50 year return period caused by the low frequency and wave frequency motions t c d y n is the dynamic tension of the time series equal to t c m e a n subtracted from the most probable maximum tension of the time series and γ m e a n and γ d y n are the partial safety factors on the mean and dynamic tensions respectively the characteristic mean line tension t c m e a n is defined as the pretension of the mooring systems of the 50 year return period and the average environmental load caused by wind waves and currents characteristic dynamic line tension an ultimate limit state uls is used to ensure that the individual mooring lines have adequate strength to withstand the load effects imposed by extreme environmental actions taking the uls as an example we list the partial safety factors in table 13 dnvgl 2016 mentioned that quasi static or dynamic analysis and frequency or time domain analysis methods may be applied depending on the difference between the region and the working time of the mooring system table 14 shows that the dynamic analysis in the time domain is suitable for long term floating offshore platforms the 50 year return period environmental load jh87t12 caused by wind and waves was chosen as the test condition fig 40 illustrates the uls results the blue line represents the breaking test load the red line denotes the proof test load the characteristic line tension for the uls in irregular waves with and without turbine operation was less than that of the test load representing that the design of the mooring lines meets the required standards 5 conclusions this study focused on the barge type fowt platform stability and the mooring system reliability through the 1 64 scaled model tank test and using the aqwa software the following results were drawn from the experiment and the simulation 1 the mooring system design is a key technology in a full scaled model we designed a mooring system suitable for 50 m water depth of a barge type fowt platform in the 1 64 scaled model we used a spring to simulate the mooring line stiffness to obtain an equivalent mooring line with the full scaled model 2 the experimental result of the barge type fowt platform was then compared to the numerical result the validation of the numerical simulations and the experiment results confirmed that the numerical model had good predictability for the response of the floating platform and the tension response of the mooring system 3 in the free decay test the floating barge platform had two different natural periods in the heave direction primary resonance period natural period of the platform and secondary resonance period natural period of fluid sloshing a resonance relationship was found between the natural frequency of the platform and the fluid in the water the oscillating force generated by the fluid sloshing can help offset the platform s motion 4 from the simulation result the wave frequency motion mainly induced the motion in a vertical plane such as heave roll and pitch the low frequency slow drift motion mainly caused the motion in the horizontal plane e g surge sway and yaw the function of the mooring system was to resist the low frequency motion especially in a shallow water area water depth less than 50 m 5 in extreme conditions the stability of the barge platform should be improved in the pitch direction however the design and reliability of the mooring system showed a good performance therefore the next step of this study is to improve the design of the barge platform to achieve a higher stability credit authorship contribution statement tzu ching chuang

20763,in this study a floating barge moon pool platform model equipped with an nrel 5 mw wind turbine and mooring systems was numerically and experimentally tested under wave and wind loads to analyze the hydrodynamic performance and stability of the barge platform and the mooring system in a 50 m water depth condition the numerical model was based on ansys aqwa and this hydrodynamic model included nonlinear hydrostatic and froude krylov forces diffraction radiation forces obtained from the linear potential theory and morison forces to consider viscous effects on the heave plates the experiment model was a 1 64 scaled barge platform with an nrel 5 mw wind turbine scaled in the same ratio both full coupling platform were simulated under three conditions namely free decay test regular wave test and irregular wave test including a typhoon extreme case with wind operation and parking first the hydrodynamic model was calibrated against the free decay test results consequently a good agreement was achieved by calibrating the mooring properties of the experiment model a comparison of the regular wave cases was then performed with the same trend of results observed for the surge heave and pitch motions of the floating barge system finally irregular model tests which aimed to measure the dynamics of the barge platform and the mooring system in a 50 year sea state in taiwan offshore were conducted the motion responses of the barge platform and the mooring tensions were recorded and compared with full coupled dynamic analysis results the dnv gl standards were used to check the reliability of the mooring system and the stability of the barge platform keywords barge floating platform fowt experiment and numerical morison equation mooring system model 1 introduction the floating offshore wind market is gradually growing worldwide offshore wind previously dominated in some countries located in relatively shallow water depths 40 m and near shores 30 km fixed bottom foundation is used to support the wind turbine populous areas near the coast have been developed to be saturated and seabed conditions are not suitable for the traditional fixed bottom foundation with the energy demand the floating wind is a potentially sustainable future energy source offshore wind is expected to be developed further from the shore 30 km and in deeper water 60 m golbert et al 2016 offshore wind energy has been the focus of many engineers and researchers these days more and more countries are beginning to explore the potential of floating offshore wind power in particular japan the united states us and many european countries including the united kingdom norway france portugal and spain have significant potential for growth 1 1 the concepts of different types fowts different floating platform types are currently applied in countries the common four types of floating wind platform were presented as below 1 1 1 spar buoy the spar buoy floating platform uses large cylindrical shaped structures which are moored by ballast with catenary mooring systems the cylindrical shaped structure is usually composed of steel or concrete and ballasted by water and soil this mechanism used to let the lower half of substructure be heavy and the upper half of substructure near the surface be lighter which has a comparatively large draft one advantage of spar buoy platform is a simple device and excellent stability and it is easier to normalization and standardization however the structure is larger resulting in the relatively high platform s cost the deeper draft of platform requires deeper water depth james et al 2018 1 1 2 semi submersible the semi submersible floating platform integrates two designs it uses the distributed buoyancy stabilized type and connects the sea floor with the catenary mooring system to maintain balance compared with spar buoy type the draft is much shallower even less than 10 m which means that it can be deployed in areas with a water depth of approximately 40 50 m in addition the shallower draft makes it possible to install the wind turbine system in harbors then transport it to offshore by using tug boats one advantage of semi submersible floating platforms is that the characteristic of this platform is flexible to a range of water depths it can take advantage of ballast inside the chamber to adjust stabilization as mentioned before in terms of operation and maintenance o m this kind of platform largely decreases the demand for personnel and equipment james et al 2018 1 1 3 tension leg platform tlp the tension leg floating platform uses the underwater buoyant structure and is anchored to seabed with a taut leg mooring system called vertical tendons which are made by steel to add the integral buoyancy and stability the main advantage of tension leg platform is that the demand for substructure is smaller and lighter and therefore the lower material costs owing to taut leg mooring systems resulting in vertical tension at the anchor point and relatively smaller footprint the sea area required is relatively small the anchor types are used either gravity anchors suction anchors or anchor piles according to seabed condition and geology to withstand large vertical loads however if the tendons of platform fail it may lead to turnover the earthquake is common in taiwan and breaks one of tethers which may lose stability severely the stability of tension leg platform before anchorage is not good as well as it is hard to disconnect if the wind turbines are to be assembled and maintained onshore or in the dry dock the problem of subsequent towage must be considered all of above will influence operational risks and increase the difficulty of construction atcheson et al 2016 1 1 4 barge type platform the barge floating platform concept is extended form semi submersible it s a concrete or steel floating hull with shallow draft to support the wind turbine system it uses the distributed buoyancy stabilized type to achieve stability using the large weighted water plane area the floating barge is characterized by a square and ring shaped floating platform with a central pool called the moon pool which absorbs the wave loads and diminish the floater motion ideol has developed a foundation based on a patented damping pool the wind turbine is put on the side it comes also with a catenary mooring system which will prevent drifting j m jonkman and buhl jr 2007 it is much easier to install a floating wind turbine further from shore and without any constraints on the other users of marine environment with floating offshore wind the wind turbine is mounted onto the floating platform at quayside before tugging the entire assembly offshore because of shape the large platform area can accommodate the transmission equipment the maintenance and repairs procedure could be easy ideol 2019 the comparison of three design concepts is detailed below see table 1 the spar buoy platform has commercial wind farms in operation such as the hywind pilot park in scotland by statoil fig 1 a the semisubmersible platform has full scale field tests such as windfloat pacific in the us by principle power fig 1 b the tension leg platform is under development and demonstration e g gicon sof pilot in congermany by gicon fig 1 c meanwhile the barge platform has been consented in floatgen in france by ideol fig 1 d in this study we chose a barge type fowt to support the wind turbine and designed a floating barge platform that can be resisted by wind and waves in taiwan 1 2 the scale models test of fowts in order to validate the performance of fowts tri floater courbois 2013 müller et al 2014 roddier et al 2010 huijs huijs et al 2013 hiprwind ishihara et al 2009 windsea windsea 2010 iberdrola amate et al 2014 poseidon floating power by the netherlands floating power plant as pelastar tlp vita et al 2015 and volturnus viselli et al 2015 have been tested in scale models which the model scaled between 1 300 and 1 2 in europe müller et al 2014 fowts are highly complex systems aerodynamics loads wind turbine hydrodynamics loads floating structure and mooring lines elasticity blade pitch controls and restoring force effect of mooring lines are needed to consider in the dynamic models j jonkman butterfield musial and scott 2009 in this paper a full coupling model including wind wave and mooring system loads had been studied in 1 64 scale under taiwan offshore sea conditions the testing conditions are referenced from the hsinchu offshore sea condition for the numerical and experimental model 1 3 the environmental condition in taiwan the wind power in the coastal areas of western taiwan is very strong especially the northeast monsoon during winter the power potential is estimated to be approximately 23 gw in 36 power potential sites the water depth range is from 20 to 50 m as water depth greater than 40 m then it could be considered using the floating platform technology the wind energy density in hsinchu and miaoli offshore are the highest area in taiwan and the distance from the shore are appropriate which are also due to the constrictive effect of the taiwan strait the potential for development is approximately 9 gw its energy density is approximately 1 8 times higher than the current 36 power potential sites announced the special geographical conditions are the advantages of taiwan s wind power development taiwan is known for its excellent caisson manufacturing and the caisson just like the floating barge another advantage is the much shallower draft which can be deployed in areas with water depths of 40 50 m that is suitable for taiwan s water depth the easy transportation and maintenance procedure and the large content of concrete not steel can reduce the cost which is also an advantage for taiwan s marine engineering team these are the reasons why the barge was chosen as the floating platform in this study the highest wind energy is located in hsinchu and miaoli offshore where the water depth is around 50 100 m 2 governing equations and numerical setup we used ansys aqwa as the simulation software herein it can simulate linearized hydrodynamic fluid wave loading on floating bodies wave loads on floating structures calculated during radiation diffraction simulation can be mapped to a finite element structural analysis the following outlined theory has its reference mainly from the aqwa theory manual ansys 2013 and uses the boundary element method that can simultaneously solve and output the first and second order wave effects in the frequency and time domains second order forces can be calculated from either near or far field solutions and accomplished by employing a three dimensional 3d radiation diffraction theory including morison s equation in regular and irregular waves in the time and frequency domains waves passing through marine structures such as a barge platform actually affect the fluid because the fluid passing through marine structures may produce complex vortex phenomena behind the object we will divide the force of the entire wave field into two parts 1 forces from the sea wave and 2 dynamic motion response of the floating platform 2 1 morison equation the morison equation approach based on the fluid potential theory is widely used for calculating a small body floating structure in waves when value of the characteristic length such as diameter d of column structure over wavelength l d l is small than 0 2 then the morison equation can be used forces from the sea wave can be split into first and second order terms the first order terms consist of motion at a wave frequency such as the incident wave force froude krylov force and the diffraction or radiation force induced by the disturbance wave due to the existence of a body in the froude krylov force the fluid motion is not affected by the existence of a cylinder that is the fluid force acts directly on the cylinder without considering the diffraction wave of the existence of the cylinder the diffraction radiation force can be solved by the source distribution method in aqwa by assuming the fluid ideal using a velocity potential function employing the linear hydrodynamic theory and considering wave radiation and diffraction the wave inertia or radiation load is caused by the disturbed waves induced by the structure motions solved by fluid potential theories the hydrodynamic force including drag can be calculated as follows using the morison equation when the characteristic diameter is less than 0 2 to the wavelength for the cylinder elements 1 f ρ ω α w ρ c a ω α w ρ c a ω x 1 2 ρ c d d v v each term in the equation represents the froude krylov wave inertia radiation and drag forces from left to right where α w x acceleration of the flow and the body respectively c a c d added mass and drag coefficients of the element respectively v relative velocity between the flow and the body ω volume of the element per unit length d characteristic drag diameter λ wave length the second order terms are much smaller than first order terms the second order force including both loads with low frequency force slow drift and sum frequency quadratic transfer function qtf if their frequency is close to the floating structure s natural frequency they will cause the floating structure to drift slowly the second order motion and force are some of the major design considerations for safety in marine structures the second order wave of the hydrodynamic responses of a floating or fixed structure is assumed as an inviscid irrotational homogeneous and incompressible fluid moreover both the fluid of the wave amplitude and the amplitude of the corresponding structural motion responses are small in shallow water the second order potential can significantly increase the drift force coefficients therefore the second order incident and diffraction potentials must be included to accurately evaluate the second order wave excitation force in shallow water the second order wave is calculated using pinkster approximation ja pinkster 1980 in aqwa 2 2 motion equation when the wave passes through the floating structure the structure moves due to the wave s action for the responses and force of structure in the x direction the equation of motion of the structure in the frequency domain for the unit wave amplitude can be written as follows 2 f ω m s x m a ω x b ω x c x where m s structure mass m a added mass frequency dependent b damping frequency dependent c hydrostatic stiffness f wave force incident and diffracting force x x x accelerations velocity and displacement of the body the motion equation shows that the structure mass added mass radiation damping and hydrostatic stiffness are balanced by the external force as for the structure the wave created by the structure movement contains two parts progressive and oscillating waves the progressive wave transfers energy away exhibiting energy loss for the structural system it is added to the formula called the radiation damping term a part of the oscillating wave does not pass outwards thereby causing difficulties in the structure movement just like the increase in the structure mass called the added mass generally speaking the analysis of the floating structures includes the wave field generated by the movement of the floating structure and the motion of the floating structure fig 2 depicts the coupling of the wave force and the structural motion 2 3 numerical setup process the numerical setup was performed herein following four steps 2 3 1 setup of the barge platform model before the numerical analysis the floating platform should be established to a 3d model and the relative relationship of the position height angle and components of the floating platform in space must be defined we used ansys geometry which provides a modern interface as the modeling tool first the appropriate length units e g meters millimeters feet and inches were chosen in the modeling environment depending on the model size after the model establishment the 3d model information was imported into the ansys static structure to calculate the weight center of gravity and moment of inertia data required 2 3 2 setup of the environment in the frequency domain the second step is to set the floating platform parameters in the wave field as a solution to the hydrodynamic response in the frequency domain the parameters input in hydrodynamic diffraction were 50 m water depth and 1025 kg m3 seawater density the wave direction range was 180 180 and the interval was 30 the wave frequency was set with equal periodic interval the period range was 5 30 s and the interval period was 1 s the mesh affected the accuracy of the hydrodynamic properties of the analyzed structures in this thesis uniform mesh was used and the parameter was set to 2 m as a unit 2 3 3 setup of the mooring system the mooring system design and verification had been done in orcaflex then input the characteristic parameters of the designed mooring system to aqwa the mooring system can be interpreted as fixing the floating platform or restricting its motion within the allowed safety range aqwa allows users to set different connections including the joint fender and cable this study used the catenary mooring system 2 3 4 setup of the hydrodynamic response in the time domain the last step is setting inputs of the related parameters that need to be set in aqwa when the dynamic analysis of the floating barge platform is performed in the time domain in setting the external force conditions two environmental factors are discussed in this thesis 1 wave force and 2 wind force aqwa was used to analyze the structural position cable tension and anchor forces in 6 degrees of freedom dof under the actions of wind and wave this thesis assumed that the wave condition involves regular and irregular waves the wave direction was set to 0 and represented the positive x axis the stokes second order wave theory was used by the regular wave while jonswap spectrum was used by the irregular wave the total simulation time was 6000 s the motion in the time series started to stabilize at approximately 2000 s fig 3 illustrates the flow chart of the aqwa setup 2 4 mooring system model verification software the model mooring system was redesign in this paper in order to verify equivalent restoring force from full scale mooring system to scaled model mooring system we used the orcaflex as the verification tool for mooring system orcaflex uses finite element model for a line the line is divided into a series of line segments which are then modelled by straight massless model segments with a node at each end the model segments only model the axial and torsional properties of the line the other properties mass weight buoyancy etc are all lumped to the nodes that is the line is modelled as a series of lumps of mass joined together by massless springs the lumps of mass are called nodes and the springs joining them are called segments each segment represents a short piece of the line whose properties mass buoyancy drag etc have been lumped for modeling purposes at the nodes at its ends 3 barge type fowt and experimental setup 3 1 target model a floating barge type platform with an nrel 5 mw wind turbine was chosen as the target platform model as shown in fig 4 and fig 5 the model appearance is similar to the ideol barge platform the wind turbine was mounted on the side because the damping moon pool is at the center of the platform the weights of the floating platform and the nrel 5 mw wind turbine were 32 200 282 kg and 1 038 400 kg respectively the significant difference between the ideol platform and our target platform was in the inner hull that uses a different chamber configuration fig 6 the platform had different size and ballast balance stability moreover the platform redesigned the catenary mooring system to adapt the water depth in offshore taiwan the wind turbine position was relatively heavy thus the center of gravity must be balanced by a permanent solid or iron as the platform ballast table 2 shows more details about the barge type platform table 3 and fig 7 and fig 8 show the specification power curve augusto antônio coutinho silva 2018 and thrust curve respectively of the nrel oc5 5 mw wind turbine the cut in and cut out velocities were 3 and 25 m s respectively while the rated wind speed was 11 4 m s at which point the electricity generation was no longer achieved through the torque control in the rotor axis instead pitch control was required and the 5 mw nominal generation was maintained from this speed on the mooring system aims to keep the floating platform within a specified range to provide the floating platform stability according to the reference position the mooring system herein referred to the oc5 deepcwind semisubmersible floating system robertson et al 2016 but the water depth was adjusted from 50 to 200 m therefore a redesigned mooring system was used for the platform in 50 m water depth to provide the same restoring force the mooring system must be increased to eight mooring lines fig 9 and the stiffness must be in accordance with the catenary equation the chain nominal diameter of the designed mooring system was 162 mm a grade r3 stud less chain was chosen as the mooring component the unstretched mooring line length was 280 m and the radius to anchor from the platform centerline was 300 m fig 10 presents the other arrangement details of the mooring system table 4 and fig 11 show the properties and a side view of the mooring system respectively 3 2 wave basin and instrumentation the model tests were conducted in the near shore wave basin of tainan hydraulics laboratory thl in national cheng kung university fig 12 left the near shore wave basin was 60 m long 7 m wide and 1 m deep and equipped with long crest wave generators operating through an electro control system producing irregular waves up to 0 32 m high at tpeak of 1 6 2 5 s the north south direction length direction was the wave making direction a piston type irregular wave generator fig 12 right was installed in the north of the wave basin the wave generator was 7 m wide and 1 2 m high the wave generating unit was a hydraulic power drive system the wave generator had a device which is an active reflection compensation system this device was equipped with three sets of wave gauges and an electronic signal box on the wave paddle to measure the water level in front of the wave blade the water level calculated on the wave paddle and the actual water level was used to conduct feedback compensation actions three capacitive wave gauges were installed to measure the wave elevations during the model test the distances were 4 67 m in the front of the experimental model and 2 5 and 4 m in the back the capacitance wave gauges fig 13 were developed and manufactured by the thl the linear relationship between the water level and the capacitance measurement circuit was used to measure the wave level change ℓ represents the total length of the wire and h represents the water level the capacitance value is denoted by cw when the capacitance line is completely submerged in water the capacitance value is ca when it is completely submerged in air the capacitance is c cw ca h ca when h is submerged in water when a wave passes the wire immersion variation generates a capacitance variation that can be recorded by the recording system three kinds of sensors were installed in the platform in the model test first a led tracking system was applied to measure the heave and surge motion responses of the platform this study used red light leds with full color cameras fig 14 to track the displacement of the floating platforms through image processing and analysis second a gyroscope fig 15 was manufactured by xsens to measure the accelerations and rotors of three axes the type specification was mti 30 attitude and heading reference system ahrs a full gyro enhanced ahrs it outputs drift free roll pitch and true magnetic north referenced yaw the roll pitch accuracy was 0 2 and 0 5 static and dynamic respectively and 0 1 in the yaw direction the tension load cells fig 16 were manufactured by japan ssk to measure the mooring line tension attached to the fairlead the rated output were 5 and 10 kgf called herein as lt10 5 and lt10 10 respectively the load pin was completely waterproof and can be immersed in water for 3 m a data acquisition system was used to simultaneously obtain the data of the wave elevation mooring line tensions and platform motion response all equipment were calibrated before the model tests 3 3 experimental model the model scale was 1 64 including the wind turbine barge platform and mooring system froude scaling laws were adopted in this experiment to fit the geometric kinematic and dynamic similitude reynolds number was generally used to maintain the wind turbine model similitude in other words the aerodynamics and the hydrodynamics are suited to two different dimensionless scaling laws however we can only fit one dimensionless parameter in a scaled model hence to simulate the full coupling dynamic response we simulated the wind turbine model through modified wind turbine blades to fit the froude scaling laws table 5 presents the main dimensions of the prototype and the nrel 5 mw wind turbine barge platform scaled model the mooring line tension was mainly provided by the self weight of the mooring line under the static and quasi static situations however the mooring line stiffness generated a highly nonlinear tension change under the dynamic stage in which the mooring lines were completely suspended in the water therefore to design the mooring scaled models the geometry of the mooring lines i e length density diameter and weight was considered to ensure equivalent restoring force and offsets the restoring force of the mooring line was the same as the original scale the material stiffness must be considered in the scale model the main idea of designing a scale mooring system model is to keep the restoring force and the excursion relation in the same ratio in the model scale four steps are followed to design a scaled mooring system model first scale down to 1 64 the relationship between the surge displacement and the restoring force of the prototype mooring system second calculate the length and the unit weight of the single mooring line to provide the equivalent restoring force approximately equal to the maximum force for the floating platform model by the catenary theory third adjust the maximum angles in the fairlead diameter and length of the mooring line to fit the restoring force curve fourth calculate the spring constant k to let the model match the stiffness in the prototype after this design process the spring constant is calculated to 3 697 n cm fig 17 depicts the mooring line model with a spring table 6 lists the mooring system specification of the prototype and the test model 3 4 experimental descriptions the experiments were divided into three parts 1 characteristic calibration tests including the wave generator wind turbine barge platform and mooring system 2 regular wave tests and 3 extreme condition tests conducted to obtain mooring tensions and the motion performance of the floating barge platform the study focuses on full coupling dynamic motion and the mooring line reliability the regular wave was simulated by airy wave considered as the simplest ocean wave and based on the assumption of a homogeneous incompressible inviscid fluid and irrotational flow when nonlinear effects that are weak or strong occur only intermittently the waves can be treated as linear waves on a large scale with relatively small nonlinear corrections at these scales holthuijsen 2007 the irregular wave was simulated by the jonswap spectrum the target site was hsinchu offshore as for the west coast of taiwan hwung chiang and liao 2003 collected the wave data of hsinchu and taichung offshore the analysis results suggested that the spectrum of these coastal areas is represented by the jonswap spectrum and γ 2 08 is suitable six regular wave cases and four irregular wave cases were assessed table 7 and table 8 present all conditions the sensor sampling frequency was 50 hz the duration for the regular wave test was 300 s whereas that for the irregular cases was 600 s corresponding to approximately 40 and 80 min in the prototype respectively 4 results and discussion the fully coupled dynamic analysis was performed by ansys aqwa the simulation duration was 20 000 s and the time step was 0 1 s the numerical results including the platform motion responses and the mooring tensions will be compared with the experimental results only the most loaded mooring lines top end tensions will be discussed all the results shown in this section have been transformed to full scale value 4 1 wave calibration tests the wave generated by the wave maker must be calibrated before performing the irregular model tests the wave elevation was recorded by the wave gauge the wave spectrum was transformed to form a raw wave elevation by fast fourier transform fft fig 18 shows the results wherein the measured spectrum was in a good agreement with the target proving that the wave maker worked well and was capable of conducting the next irregular model tests 4 2 wind turbine calibration test fig 19 shows the process of the designed scaled wind turbine through the design process fig 20 presents the good match curves of the wind speed and the thrust force in both target and model in full scale a maximum thrust of approximately 3 n was obtained in the 1 64 scaled model when the wind speed was equal to 11 4 m s in full scale the redesigned wind turbine model had a tower and an experimental wind turbine with four mini fans fig 21 illustrates that the relationship between the motor control signal and the output thrust of each mini fan must be designed following the installation position of the experimental fans in this study each fan input the same signal controlled by pulse width modulation pwm therefore the force of the wind turbine was presented by controlling the thrust of the motor output in addition to the mini fans the experimental wind turbine was also equipped with a gyroscope and a load cell to output the attitude of the wind turbine and measure the load the mini fan will generate the corresponding thrust at every rotating speed 4 3 mooring system model calibration test the characteristics of the mooring system must be calibrated before conducting the model tests the calibration was done in orcaflex fig 22 the barge platform was given a time series displacement from 0 469 to 0 469 m and each position was paused for 30 s the position was constantly changed the corresponding mooring system surge restoring force was recoded and the relationship between the surge displacement and the mooring system restoring force was obtained the mooring system model calibration test result confirmed a good agreement in the target and measured value fig 23 fig 24 exhibits the mooring system configuration in the model test 4 4 barge platform model verification in free decay in the free decay test the floating platform was moved to a fixed displacement or rotated in a fixed inclination under stable situations it was used in conjunction with the gyroscope and a led image tracking system to measure the heave roll and pitch motion decaying with time to evaluate the experimental error an inclinometer and a displacement meter were used to ensure that each displacement was fixed each free decay test was repeated thrice to examine the experimental repeatability and the convergence rate of the error the time series motion was measured during the tests moreover raw data were transformed with the fast fourier series obtained to acquire the natural period in three directions the difference between the simulation and experimental result in the three directions is discussed below 4 4 1 mooring system damping effect the free decay test was divided into two parts 1 barge platform without mooring system and 2 barge platform with a mooring system the differences will be discussed in the subsequent sections fig 25 presents the results of the time series motion in the three directions without a mooring system fig 26 illustrates the natural frequency results in the three directions the experimental results showed that each time series dates had an excellent periodic phase overlap indicating that the experiment is highly repeatable through an fft analysis the natural periods of heave roll and pitch were obtained as 11 04 9 29 and 9 23 s without the mooring system and 10 99 s 10 41 s and 10 62 s with the mooring system respectively table 9 sorts all the natural period results the mooring system can slightly change the natural period of the platform especially in the roll and pitch directions see table 9 4 4 2 moon pool damping effect in the heave direction the designed floating barge platform had two different natural periods in fig 27 the solid line represents the natural period without the mooring system while the dashed line represents the natural period with the mooring system the natural periods of the platform with the mooring system were 7 98 and 10 99 s in full scale this concept of the floating barge platform was like the tuned liquid damper tld frandsen 2004 primary resonance period or the natural period of the platform and secondary resonance period or the natural period of fluid sloshing the system is a 2 dof structure with two natural frequencies the tld at the external force frequency will generate liquid oscillation in the barge platform the water will produce the liquid sloshing coupling phenomenon and the resonance phenomenon will occur at a specific frequency a resonance relationship will exist between the natural frequency of the platform and the fluid in the water the oscillating force generated by the fluid sloshing can help offset the platform s motion 4 5 dynamic response of the barge platform under regular and irregular waves the dynamic responses of the barge floating platform and the tension of the mooring system during the wave and wind load are the two main indicators for checking the barge platform stability section 3 4 and table 6 present all the regular wave conditions the response amplitude operator rao which is a non dimensional parameter was used herein to evaluate the responses of the barge platform under different regular wave periods the rao is defined in eq 3 when the incident wave is a regular wave the rao can be defined as the ratio of the amplitude of the motion responses to the amplitude of the incident wave journée and massie 2001 3 r a o z a δ a where z a is the motion amplitude of the center of gravity position and δ a is the amplitude of the incident wave the responses in three motion directions i e surge heave and pitch were calculated in the raos the results of which are then compared with the numerical results 4 5 1 regular wave load regular wave tests without wind were performed fig 28 shows the rao analysis for the surge heave and pitch motion without wind including the simulation and experimental results there was a good agreement between the numerical and experimental trends and the peak values of surge and pitch directions were presented in the same period the most of experimental rao values were slightly smaller than numerical values the phenomenon could cause by the viscosity damping effect on the experiment the increase in the surge direction was mainly caused by the wave frequency closing to the frequency of the storing force of the mooring system in the heave rao the interaction between the structure and the wave produced a heave resonance at this time the platform mainly moved up and down and its amplitude was equal to the incident wave amplitude in addition the experimental results in the resonance region were smaller than the numerical predictions the main reason for this is that when the bottom of platform was at a right angle the vertical flow velocity of the water particles at the bottom became larger at resonance and the right angled edges were prone to separation flow and eddy currents in low pressure areas the pitch rao initially increased with period and gradually rose to a peak and started to decrease because the frequency of the incident wave resonated with the structure when the period was approximately 11 s in the three directions the rao value gradually reached the peak and decreased after the period was approximately 9 11 s the surge and pitch rao value at 14 s was about half of the peak value when the period was at 11 s the wind effect was also considered the wind fan controller generated the thrust to simulate the maximum thrust in the 3 016 n in model scale 790 6 kn in full scale fig 29 depicts the test results the reduction effect at the resonance period was more obvious in cases with wind the maximum surge dynamic response decreased from rao 2 to rao 1 which was 1 2 of the original because the wind force acted on the floating platform under the influence of the wind hence the pretension of the mooring system was increased and improved the platform stability in the heave and pitch directions the difference between cases without and with wind was very small this phenomenon represents that the response of the platform under the action of wind is still similar to that of the regular wave only it did not cause platform instability in the heave and pitch directions furthermore the wind turbine can operate and generate electricity under the wave height of 6 4 m in the sea 4 5 2 irregular wave load the wave spectrum is an important statistical property of random ocean waves it not only contains the second order of the waves but also gives the energy distribution of the wave relative to the frequency and direction the time domain analysis uses the johnswap spectrum the following wave conditions table 8 in hsinchu taiwan were selected normal sea state northeast monsoon 10 year return period 50 year return period and uniform wind speed converted to the wind speed of the potential site of 11 4 11 4 60 and 60 m s the total experimental time was 220 s including an additional 20 s at the beginning of the time series to omit the unstable stages in the analysis figs 30 32 show the three extreme condition results for the irregular motion of the heave roll and pitch we observed the peak value and frequency in the northeast monsoon the wind turbine operation has more influence on the response of the surge and the tension once the wind turbine starts to operate the steady displacement presented in x axis direction because of the thrust generation force moving the fowt to the positive x axis direction then the mooring system provided a restoring force on the fowt the balance process of two forces make the fowt have dynamic motion in x axis direction the platform motion in the pitch direction was mainly observed herein no absolute criteria were provided for the platform stability this thesis sets the criteria that the proposed range of angles allowed in the pitch direction is 10 the statistics results are detailed below based on the standard normal distribution of four different sea states the data were converted into probabilities and the probability of over 10 was calculated bar graphs figs 33 35 in the experiment table 10 the probability of the pitch response exceeding 10 in the normal sea state approached 0 the data of the northeast monsoon sea conditions were estimated the proportion of the pitch response exceeding 10 was quite low at only 0 262 the probabilities of the 10 and 50 year return periods were 0 9 and 2 58 respectively 4 6 mooring system analysis 4 6 1 reliability of the mooring system the analysis of the mooring operations should consider the most severe load expected from the environmental conditions and the operating time of the mooring position and calculate the mooring line tension less than the minimum breaking load mbl dnvgl 2015 4 m b l t d the minimum breaking load m b l and the mooring system tension t d were calculated following eq 6 the load factor requirements for design of the mooring lines of proof load and the breaking load are presented in table 11 and table 12 5 m b l i n k n c d 2 44 0 08 d d i n m m where c is the load factor d is the chain nominal diameter in mm and the minimum breaking load was calculated in kn the values of the proof test load of stud less and the breaking test load are shown below the dynamic tensions of the mooring system of four different irregular wave conditions with and without turbine operation were compared to the proof test load and the breaking test load in full scale fig 36 and fig 37 the mooring system tension was less than the proof load and breaking load the design tension t d was then compared to the proof test load and the breaking test load fig 38 and fig 39 were the fast fourier transform fft analysis for irregular wave and tension except the extreme wave condition jh87t12 case the maximum tension showed the corresponding period with wave period however in the jh87t12 case the period of maximum tension happened around 16 2 s which longer than the significant wave period in the other words effect of the long wave period will induce larger tension than the wave height 4 6 2 mooring system design confirmation the design standard for the floating wind turbines was considered the load design of the mooring system is defined as follows 6 t d γ m e a n t c m e a n γ d y n t c d y n where t c m e a n denotes the mean tension of the time series t c d y n is defined as the dynamic line tension of the 50 year return period caused by the low frequency and wave frequency motions t c d y n is the dynamic tension of the time series equal to t c m e a n subtracted from the most probable maximum tension of the time series and γ m e a n and γ d y n are the partial safety factors on the mean and dynamic tensions respectively the characteristic mean line tension t c m e a n is defined as the pretension of the mooring systems of the 50 year return period and the average environmental load caused by wind waves and currents characteristic dynamic line tension an ultimate limit state uls is used to ensure that the individual mooring lines have adequate strength to withstand the load effects imposed by extreme environmental actions taking the uls as an example we list the partial safety factors in table 13 dnvgl 2016 mentioned that quasi static or dynamic analysis and frequency or time domain analysis methods may be applied depending on the difference between the region and the working time of the mooring system table 14 shows that the dynamic analysis in the time domain is suitable for long term floating offshore platforms the 50 year return period environmental load jh87t12 caused by wind and waves was chosen as the test condition fig 40 illustrates the uls results the blue line represents the breaking test load the red line denotes the proof test load the characteristic line tension for the uls in irregular waves with and without turbine operation was less than that of the test load representing that the design of the mooring lines meets the required standards 5 conclusions this study focused on the barge type fowt platform stability and the mooring system reliability through the 1 64 scaled model tank test and using the aqwa software the following results were drawn from the experiment and the simulation 1 the mooring system design is a key technology in a full scaled model we designed a mooring system suitable for 50 m water depth of a barge type fowt platform in the 1 64 scaled model we used a spring to simulate the mooring line stiffness to obtain an equivalent mooring line with the full scaled model 2 the experimental result of the barge type fowt platform was then compared to the numerical result the validation of the numerical simulations and the experiment results confirmed that the numerical model had good predictability for the response of the floating platform and the tension response of the mooring system 3 in the free decay test the floating barge platform had two different natural periods in the heave direction primary resonance period natural period of the platform and secondary resonance period natural period of fluid sloshing a resonance relationship was found between the natural frequency of the platform and the fluid in the water the oscillating force generated by the fluid sloshing can help offset the platform s motion 4 from the simulation result the wave frequency motion mainly induced the motion in a vertical plane such as heave roll and pitch the low frequency slow drift motion mainly caused the motion in the horizontal plane e g surge sway and yaw the function of the mooring system was to resist the low frequency motion especially in a shallow water area water depth less than 50 m 5 in extreme conditions the stability of the barge platform should be improved in the pitch direction however the design and reliability of the mooring system showed a good performance therefore the next step of this study is to improve the design of the barge platform to achieve a higher stability credit authorship contribution statement tzu ching chuang

20764,this paper proposes a study on the hull structure optimization of a semi submersible medical platform the hull structure sizes have great important effect on the cost hydrodynamics global and manufacture of the whole semi submersible platform in this paper the economy lightweight and higher stability should be ensured for the medical platform during the optimization design process the hull sizing optimization process is modeled as a multivariable minimization problem which is minimizing the hull structure weight the heave response and the roll response the surrogate model method is introduced to obtain the relationship between the design variables and output variables which reduced the time consuming induced by the numerical simulation and improved the optimization efficiency a multi objective optimization for the hull structure is developed by using the gray correlation analysis to evaluate the weight of three optimization objects at last the optimization solutions are achieved in the form of pareto set according to the optimization results the changing relations between the sizes of the deck column pontoon and draft with the total weight and the heave and roll response can be determined keywords multi objective optimization semi submersible medical platform surrogate model gray correlation analysis 1 introduction semi submersible semi platform is one of the most preferred floating type for oil gas exploration and offshore wind energy in the deep water in the past few decades semi shows more merits on the aspect of good seakeeping capability large riser holding space easy offshore installation and large topside space furthermore semi has no restriction on fabrication location as it can be built by a number of shipyards worldwide and it has the large deck and adapts to a wide range of water depth therefore more and more semi platforms are fabricated not only for production but also for accommodation service tourism and medical one of the major challenges for designing a semi submersible is the relatively larger vertical motion in waves which makes it difficult to design robust and reliable mooring and riser systems optimization of the hull form to reach better global motion performance is critical to the development of the semi a lot of efforts have been made on the determination of the optimal hull form since the amplitude of wave induced motion is closely related to the hull form and the mass distribution clauss and birk 1996 introduced a fully automated numerical procedure for optimization venzon et al 2013 presented a procedure for hull form optimization of semi rig using an artificial neural network model as a quick estimate of the heave motion avoiding the extensive use of numerical methods and mesh generation park et al 2015 proposed an automated procedure for the hull form optimization of semi submersible floating production unit the 3 h heave most probable extreme value and the structural weight are the objectives and each objective is weighted and four optimal solutions are obtained zhang et al 2018 used the evolutionary algorithm to optimize the tension leg platform based on the surrogate model the total weight and tendon tension are the optimization objects qiu et al 2019 proposed a semi submersible platform optimization program using particle swam optimization algorithm the heave motion and total weight are considered as the optimization objects for three types of semis sugita and suzuki 2016 performed the hull sizing of tension leg platforms using an optimization model the hull and the tendon weight are the objectives and the global performance strength and initial screening criteria are the constraint conditions du kim and jang 2016 performed multi objective optimization for tlp considering the hull form and tendon system the maximum heave response and the total weight are formulated as objective functions and pareto set with eight different optimum solutions were obtained xie and falzarano 2020 developed an optimization framework using genetic algorithm to realize automatic parameter optimization for semi submersible design of eight pontoons emami and mostafa gharabaghi 2020 introduced a grid search algorithm in the form of a three objective function to minimize the weight of a semi submersible hull and to reduce the heave and pitch motion responses xu 2011 proposed a new semi submersible platform concept by extending the width and height of the float box at the bottom of the column to form a float which not only increases the bottom area and inhibits the oscillating motion but also interrupts the consistent continuity of the column decreases the effective draft inhibits the generation of eddy motion and makes the semi submersible platform optimized in terms of motion performance thus the economy safety and reliability of semi submersible platform structure will become a trend zhang et al 2017 and tian et al 2019 therefore how to optimize the hull shape to achieve better overall motion performance is very important for the development of the semi submersible platform in the present study a semi submersible platform is designed mainly for medical at the engineering phase of offshore platform projects various design criteria such as hydrodynamic response global performance stability and structural strength are considered to determine the initial configuration and sizes and then the initial design is optimized for economy safety or easy of construction the weight of the semi submersible platform is mainly based on the amount of steel used which is related to the cost among the six degrees of freedom responses of the platform heave and roll have the most obvious effects on the platform s hydrodynamic performance song et al 2019 and xie et al 2019 considering the stability requirements of the medical platform its motion response have to be limited so as not to produce large instability under the wave load therefore the weight heave motion and roll motion should be considered as the optimization goals to obtain a more cost safety and stability design while the safety and installation of a platform are considered as constraints the whole paper is organized as follows the mathematical model of the medical platform is proposed in section 2 section 3 establishes the surrogate model and multi objective function of the medical platform the pareto solution set results are obtained in section 4 last the conclusions are given in section 5 2 mathematical model 2 1 model of the semi submersible platform the semi submersible platform is designed aimed for medical the upper part of the platform is arranged for medical area living area and so on the lower part is arranged for the mechanical area ballast tanks fresh water tanks fuel tanks pump tanks and so on the whole layout of the platform is shown in fig 1 the hull form is determined according to the existing hull types and in the conceptual design phase the dimensions of the hull need to be determined firstly considering the environmental conditions and functional requirements the initial hull shape and sizes are estimated by past project data or by applying the engineers experience the conceptual selection results are taken as an initial design for further optimization in the present study in order to find a better technically and economically feasible design the shape and sizes of the hull are need to be optimized considering the weight control hydrostatic stability hydrodynamic and global performance therefore the hull sizing optimization process is modeled as a multivariable minimization problem with multiple constraint conditions the optimization process is shown in fig 2 firstly an assessment of the objectives and confirmation of the set of constraints of each design candidate is necessary and the surrogate model is used to obtain the function relationship between input and output by continuous approximation to replace the numerical simulations for each varied hull form and the multi objective model is established by using the gray correlation analysis method finally the optimization results are obtained by nsga ii algorithm 2 2 design variables for the design of the medical semi submersible platform the sizes of the deck column pontoon and hull draft are all needed to be determined and nine design variables including deck height deck width deck length column height column width column length pontoon length pontoon height hull draft as shown in fig 3 for the whole semi submersible platform economy and lightweight is the first considered for the platform optimization design in addition this platform needs higher stability as the heave and rolling of platform have a great impact on the stability performance therefore the weight heave performance and rolling performance are firstly considered during the optimization design process a total of nine independent variables are list in table 1 which are introduced to express the hull and the deck initial form these variables are directly related to the dimensions of each part of the hull and deck respectively other dimensions can be calculated from these nine variables according to the design requirements the hull draft must be larger than the pontoon height the pontoon width is the same with the column width and the deck length is the sum of the column width and transverse brace length the initial value lower bound and upper bound of design variables deck height deck width deck length column height column width column length pontoon length pontoon height hull draft are list in table 1 in the initial design stage the main performance of the platform should be evaluated to meet the safety and economy of the platform the pitch performance stability performance and heave acceleration are mainly considered here among the motions only heave motion is selected as the objective because relative to pitch and roll it is the dominant to the operability of topside process 2 3 wt estimation the weight of the hull structural is an important indicator which directly determines the cost of the whole platform as the design parameters are changed during the optimization process the hull form is changed continuously and the center of mass is also changed therefore the weight and the center of mass should be estimated the weight of the hull mainly contains four sections pontoon weight column weight transverse brace weight and deck weight each section is estimated based on the surface area volume and height of the hull structure for simple calculation the hull shape is simplified rectangular as shown in fig 3 for the pontoon it must provide adequate sufficient displacement the internal structural design such as the size and arrangement of ribs must enable the floating body to withstand hydrostatic pressure therefore the steel weight of the pontoon is taken as a function of the surface area of the pontoon and draft depth of the platform gosain et al 2017 1 w 1 9 4 10 3 s p t op 1 05 2 s p 2 x 7 x 4 x 8 t o p x 9 where w 1 is the steel weight of a single pontoon s p is the surface area of the lower floating body t o p is the draft depth of the platform x 7 x 4 and x 8 is the length width and height of the pontoon respectively for the column weight it can be calculated by the geometry directly as follows 3 w 2 x 6 0 286 x 5 1 612 where w 2 is the steel weight of a single column x 6 and x 5 are the height and width of the column respectively the transverse brace is generally cylindrical shell with stiffeners inside the load acting on the transverse brace is mainly the dynamic alternating tension and compression force which is usually designed according to the buckling criterion the steel weight of a transverse brace is estimated according to the following equ 4 4 w 3 l 0 405 d 1 608 d 3 3 where l is the length of the transverse brace l x 1 2 x 4 d is the diameter of the transverse brace the semi submersible platforms are often built with a box deck mainly consisting of a lower deck structure with double bottoms one or more intermediate decks and a main deck the inherent rigidity and strength of the box deck also reduces the need for diagonal bracing and the horizontal cross bracing is sufficient to meet the structural requirements therefore the weight of the whole deck structure is mainly composed of the main deck the remaining decks and the bulkheads which are denoted by w 4 w 5 and w 6 respectively main deck weight 5 w 4 0 242 a m d k 0 121 1 0 4 a m d k 2 remaining deck weight 6 w 5 0 051 a r d k 0 162 1 0 4 a r d k 2 bulkhead weight 7 w 6 0 026 h a mdk 2 13 where a m d k is the main deck area and equals to x 1 multiplying x 2 a rdk is the area of the remaining decks a rdk 2 x 1 x 2 and h is the height of the box deck generally the total weight of the hull structure is expressed as follows 8 w 2 w 1 4 w 2 2 w 3 w 4 w 5 w 6 additionally the hull outfit weight should be considered including power device weight fixed equipment weight ballast water weight consumable weight movable equipment weight etc for the center of gravity estimation it can be estimated by the weight of each part and the total weight based on the waterline of the platform the gravity center can be calculated as follows 9 z w i z i w s u m where w i is the weight of each part z i is the gravity center of each part and w sum is the whole weight of the platform 2 4 hydrodynamic performance in the marine environment semi submersible platform is sensitive to the ocean environment loads such as wind wave current and so on for the motion of offshore floating platform the most common and lasting influence is wind and wave it seriously affects the structural safety the adaptability and the cost in this paper wave load is the main considered load according to newton s second law the dynamic equation of an arbitrary floating body under the action of fluid is as follows fei et al 2017 10 f m x c x k x where f is the fluid force matrix including wave force and hydrostatic recovery force m is the mass matrix including its hull mass and additional mass x is the displacement matrix which is divided into surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw according to the direction of the spatial coordinate system c is the radiation damping matrix and viscous matrix and k is the stiffness matrix and k is the hydrostatic stiffness matrix when positioning without mooring furthermore f m and c are all related to the wave frequency as shown in fig 4 based on the three dimensional potential flow theory and morison equation the hydrodynamic characteristics and the motion responses can be achieved numerically the panel element model was established by using the three dimensional potential flow theory in the frequency domain and the influence of viscosity is considered by the morison equation to form a complete numerical calculation model for the wave load of the semi platform it is mainly caused by the pressure field generated by the wave motion wave loads are generally classified into three types inertial force dragging force and diffraction force for the large scale floating body the wave passing through it changes significantly so the diffraction effect of the floating body on the fluid must be considered the basic assumptions of diffraction theory are as follows a the fluid is an ideal fluid with uniform density incompressible and viscosity is ignored b the waves in the flow field are all linear waves c the fluid is in a non rotating motion which is the potential flow d the floating body is a rigid body e all the motions in the direction of six degrees of freedom are micro amplitude motions therefore the panel method can be adopted to compute the wave loads of large scale floating body it is assumed that the amplitudes of wave and motion of body are small compared with the cross section of body for the slender rod the ratio of cross section size to wavelength is less than 0 2 which has no interference on the wave motion direction in this case the viscous effect and additional mass effect of fluid play a decisive role on the load of the slender rod that is the wave force on the rod is composed of the inertial force generated by the local flow acceleration and the viscous force proportional to the square of the instantaneous velocity the wave load of the slender rod is calculated according to the morison equation which is a semi empirical formula for wave action in flow field tian et al 2019 and the general form of morison equation is as follows 11 f w a v e c m ρ v u c d 1 2 ρ a u u where f wave is the wave force acting on the slender rod c m is the coefficient of inertial force dimensionless value ρ is the density of sea water v is the drainage volume of the floating body u is the local flow velocity u is the local flow acceleration c d is the coefficient of viscous force dimensionless value a is the characteristic area that is the projected area of the bar perpendicular to the wave direction under unit height through the potential flow theory and morison equation added mass damping coefficient and the wave loads can be obtained by assuming the platform is rigid body the equations of motion can be solved in frequency domain motion response is conducted using the commercial program the response amplitude operators rao is a transfer function which can indicate the motion response characteristics of the floating body it represents the amplitude of platform sway motion caused by regular wave per amplitude for the translational direction degree of freedom its unit is m m and for the rotational direction degree of freedom its unit is deg m compared with other parameters the motion response rao is the most intuitive frequency domain index to evaluate the hydrodynamic performance of the scheme considering the water depth in the south china sea it is assumed that all platforms are operating with a depth of 1500 m since the platform is symmetrical the numerical model is shown in fig 5 and the wave direction angle range is 0 90 and the step length is 30 with a total of 4 angles the raos at different wave directions are shown in fig 6 the data in the figure shows that heave and roll have the greatest movement under unit amplitude that is they are the factors that have the greatest influence on the platform hydrodynamics therefore steel quantity heave response and roll response are used as the three optimization objectives it can be seen from fig 6 c and d that the changing trend of heave and roll is almost the same their motion amplitudes are large at low frequency and first increase and then decrease to the minimum value with the frequency increasing last the response is keeping low moreover rao of heave and roll are maximum when wave incident angle is 90 as can be seen from fig 6 e the pitch rao is maximum when wave incident angle is 0 therefore the heave and roll response values of the wave incident angle of 90 and the pitch response value of the wave incident angle of 0 are important generally based on the previous hydrodynamic model the motion responses under different sea conditions can be obtained the medical platform is calculated by selecting the sea condition of the first 10 year return period in the south china sea the parameters of the ten year return period sea condition are shown in table 2 and the heave and roll response under 90 wave and the pitch response under 0 wave are all calculated 2 5 stability performance the stability refers to the ability of the floating platform to automatically return to its original position by relying on buoyancy and gravity when the floating body is tilted under external forces other than buoyancy and gravity as shown in fig 7 when the semi submersible platform is tilted due to external force the waterline changes from w 0 l 0 to w 1 l 1 and the center of buoyancy moves from b 0 to b 1 at this time the displacement and the position of gravity center remain unchanged and gravity and buoyancy no longer act on the same plumb line resulting in a moment called restoring moment when the external force disappears the restoring moment will make the platform return to its original equilibrium position which is called stability the stability is an important performance for the semi submersible platform when the platform inclines slightly the restoring moment can be expressed by equ 12 12 m s gm sin φ where m s is the restoring moment is the displacement of the platform g is the center of gravity m is the transverse stability center gm is the stability height of platform φ is the transverse inclination angle of the platform when m point is higher than g point gm 0 and the restoring moment is positive which resists the platform s heeling when m point is lower than g point gm 0 and the restoring moment is negative which makes the ship keep heeling the m point is called the transverse metacentric of the platform in the conceptual design stage of the platform the height of the horizontal stability and the height of the longitudinal stability can be used as the preliminary means to measure the stability performance of the platform due to the structural characteristics of semi submersible platform the height of horizontal stability is the main factor determining the safety of the platform therefore the height of horizontal stability is taken as an index to judge whether the stability performance meets the requirements or not and is used as the constraint conditions in design optimization dnv requires that gm should be bigger than 0 m dnv 2011 but in actual the initial stability value is often higher than the standard value usually gm of the existing platform is generally greater than 2 m considering for the application of medical for this platform higher requirements are needed therefore in this study gm should be bigger than 3 m in this paper which can ensure the whole stability of the platform 3 multi objective optimization model for the semi submersible medical platform optimization problem the safety and economy should be satisfied therefore the hull steel weight heave response and roll response are selected as the optimized objects for the three optimization objects they are usually incongruous or contradictory the final optimization method should make tradeoffs and compromises among them during the optimization process the model of medical platform is crucial if the actual model is used for iterative optimization the calculation is usually large and the optimization efficiency is poor the corresponding approximate model can be established for analysis on the premise of ensuring the accuracy of the model the surrogate model is an appropriate method and it can establish empirical formula obtain the relationship between input variables and output variables reduce the time consuming call of simulation program and improve the optimization efficiency alexandrov et al 2001 3 1 surrogate model surrogate model is efficient for rapid optimization analyses it can establish the nonlinear relationship between design variables and their corresponding responses in complex engineering problem by mathematical model some representative sample points are required for building the surrogate model which are selected according to the design of experiment doe therefore doe related with the strategy of assigning sample points is one of the important tasks which should be considered during the construction process of surrogate model there are number of forms of surrogate model including response surface model kriging model support vector machine svm and radial basis function rbf and rbf is introduced in this study 3 1 1 experimental design method design of experiment doe is a technology based on probability theory and mathematical statistics to study how to make scientific and reasonable test scheme improve test efficiency and reduce the influence of random error wang et al 2020 the common experimental design methods contains orthogonal experimental design oed center composite design ccd uniform design ud ladin hypercube design lhd and optimal ladin hypercube design olhd latin hypercube sampling lhd is a stratified sampling technique it is a method to randomly select sample points from multivariate distribution however the spatial distribution uniformity of lhd would be poor for more design variables in order to improve the shortcomings of lhd chen proposed an optimal latin hypercube design olhd jin et al 2003 which has the characteristics of strong filling capacity good balance and even distribution of sampling points in the tests with high repeatability therefore this method can better reflect the design space characteristics fig 8 shows the flow chart of olhd the process contains inner loop and the outer loop the inner loop constantly updates the matrix and a better design is selected to replace the outer loop controls the optimization process by updating the threshold t h to prevent the local optimum firstly the randomly generated matrix is selected as the initial matrix x 0 then a new design is constructed by exchanging columns of the initial matrix at last according to the judgment criteria it is decided whether to replace the existing design with the new design olhd is used to generate the required sample points as 9 design variables are selected for the medical platform and the 9 dimensional image cannot be obtained the quality of the results cannot be observed therefore two dimensional plane images with 2 arbitrary design variables are used to illustrate with lhd and olhd in the same sample space the observed results are shown in fig 9 it can be seen that the uniformity of sample points selected by olhd is significantly improved than that of lhd according to the evaluation criteria maximum minimum distance criterion d min and φ p criterion kenny et al 2000 the two experimental design methods are evaluated as shown in table 3 it can be concluded that the minimum distance of olhd is larger than that of lhd and φ p is smaller than that of lhd which indicates that the performance of sample points selected by olhd is better than that of lhd therefore the sample points of semi submersible medical platform are selected by olhd experimental design method and 80 sample points were selected from 9 design variables to establish the surrogate model 3 1 2 radial basis function model radial basis function model rbf is used for the data fitting which has a high fitting effect for the nonlinear function radial basis neural networks are usually divided into three layers including input layer hidden layer and output layer as shown in fig 10 the input layer x 1 x 2 x n consists of the source nodes responsible for passing signals to the hidden layer and is mainly used to calculate the euclidean distance between the sample and prediction points the hidden layer h 1 h 2 h p consists of radial basis functions and map the vectors from low to high dimensions it is equivalent to finding the surface that best fits the input prediction points in the high dimensional space of the hidden layer the output layer realizes a weighted combination in a new linear space the specific solution of rbf neural network is as follows 13 f x i 1 n ω i φ r i w t ϕ where w is the vector of weight coefficient r i is the euclidean distance between the interpolation point and the sample point φ r is a radial function ϕ is the vector of radial function many functions can be used for the rbf functions such as gauss cubic inverse multi quadric imq and multi quadric mq among them imq rbf is selected as the rbf function and written as 14 ϕ r r 2 c 2 0 5 where c is the shape function commonly used assessment methods to test the reliability of the approximate model include root mean square error rmse mean relative error mre and complex correlation coefficient r2 and they are expressed as in equ 15 16 and 17 respectively 15 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i y p i 2 16 m r e 1 n i 1 n y i y p i y i ε 17 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y p i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where y i and y pi is the response values of the selected sample points and the predictive values of the model respectively n is the number of samples y is the average value of responses ε is the residual when y i 0 ε 0 when y i 0 ε 0 01 3 1 3 surrogate model of the whole medical platform the surrogate model of the medical platform is established by selecting 80 groups of sample points among them 70 groups of sample points are used to establish the approximate model and the rest 10 groups are used to verify the accuracy the data comes from the finite element analysis results and contains the response values of the heave roll pitch heave acceleration and transverse metacentric height by the rbf the approximate model of five response parameters are established and the details are shown in table 4 also the fitting curve of each approximate model is shown in fig 11 generally rmse mre r2 and maximum error can be used to test the accuracy of surrogate model in this paper rmse mre and r2 were used to test the closer the values of mre and rmse are to 0 the higher the fitting accuracy of the approximate model is and the closer r2 is to 1 the higher the fitting accuracy is for the engineering application it is usually required that the values of mre and rmse are less than 0 2 and r2 is greater than 0 9 it can be seen from table 4 that the fitting accuracy of heave motion roll motion pitch motion transverse metacentric height and heave acceleration all meet the requirements fig 11 depicts the fitting accuracy of 10 sample points which can reflect the fitting situation of sample points more intuitively the black line in the figure represents the fitted functional relationship while the red dots represent 10 sample points used to test the accuracy the closer the red dots are to the black line the higher the fitting accuracy is it can be seen that the distance between the red dot and the black line in fig 11 e is the closest indicating that the fitting accuracy of heave acceleration is the best the fitting accuracy of other graphs is slightly worse but the sample points are still near the function relation line indicating that the accuracy meets the requirements and the fitting effect is good 3 2 multi objective function as mentioned above the hull steel weight heave response and roll response are the optimized goals for the semi submersible medical platform for the multi objective optimization problems the optimal decisions are needed to be taken in the presence of trade offs between two or more conflicting objectives sometimes there is no solution that can satisfy all the constraints and make several objectives reach the global optimum at the same time to solve this problem deb put forward the method of a quick computation of pareto optimal solutions deb et al 2005 pareto optimization is a compromise solution to multiple objectives which is usually used to solve the contradiction between multiple objectives the mathematical model of optimization objective is shown in equ 18 18 y w hull steel weight ref steel weight 33945 ton z heave 90 ref heave r x roll 90 ref roll s t g m 6 0 m r y 6 0 z a 0 8 m s 2 min air gap 2 0 m hull draft pontoon height pontoonwidth column width deck length column width transverse brace length where w is weight of the hull structural z is heave response and rx is rolling response gm is transverse metacentric height ry is pitch response and za is heave acceleration response since the order of magnitude of the amount of steel used differs greatly from the order of magnitude of the heave and roll performance each sub objective has to be treated without magnitude and thus a proportionality factor is introduced the optimal values obtained from the single objective optimization of heave performance roll performance and economic performance as objectives are the proportionality factors for each sub objective in the present study three constraints contain the transverse metacentric height pitch motion and heave acceleration motion are considered the criterion of each constraint is deduced from the reference model and the recommended practice suggested by the api digre and zwerneman 2012 in this study gray correlation analysis method is introduced to determine the weighting factors of each optimization objective the specific method is shown in fig 12 firstly it is needed to find the optimal value of each objective function in single objective optimization and two sequences are formed one is formed by the values of all objective functions which is taken as the reference sequence and the other is produced by each sub objective optimization results obtained in single objective optimization which is as the target sequence and then the reference sequence and the target sequence should be normalized respectively last the weighting coefficient of each objective function are calculated by the gray correlation theory the target sequence x i and the reference sequence x j are shown in equ 19 and 20 19 x i x i 1 x i 2 x i n 20 x j x j 1 x j 2 x j n first calculate the absolute degree of correlation according to x i and x j calculate the sequence of the beginning of the zero like x i 0 k x j 0 k and then calculate s i s j s i s j respectively to get the absolute degree of correlation the calculation process is shown in equ 21 26 21 x i 0 k x i k x i 1 22 x j 0 k x j k x j 1 23 s i k 2 n 1 x i 0 k 0 5 x i 0 n 24 s j k 2 n 1 x j 0 k 0 5 x j 0 n 25 s i s j k 2 n 1 x i 0 k x j 0 k 0 5 x i 0 n x j 0 n 26 ε i j 1 s i s j 1 s i s j s i s j similarly calculate the relative degree of correlation the relative correlation analysis of the sequence starting point zeroing like x i 0 k x j 0 k as shown in equ 27 and 28 s i s j s i s j and the relative degree of correlation r i j calculated in the same way as the absolute correlation analysis in equ 23 24 and 25 27 x i 0 k x i k x i 1 1 28 x j 0 k x j k x j 1 1 finally the introduction of the adjustment coefficient θ the absolute degree of correlation ε ij and the relative degree of correlation r ij add up to get a comprehensive correlation ρ ij as shown in equ 29 generally take θ 0 1 generally take 0 5 29 ρ i j θ ε i j 1 θ r i j the weighting coefficients of each objective function are calculated as shown in table 5 nsga ii is a more popular multi objective genetic algorithm which is a modified version of nsga non dominated sorting genetic algorithm deb et al 2000 nsga ii has three merits to ensure the multi objective solutions first it proposed the fast non dominant sorting algorithm to reduce the computational complex second the elitist strategy is introduced to improve the accuracy of optimization results last crowding degree and crowding comparison operators are adopted to ensure the population diversity therefore nsga ii algorithm is selected to solve the multi objective problems to generate the optimal set of pareto solutions and the detail process is shown in fig 13 4 results and discussions 4 1 multi objective optimization results the optimization process is performed based on the initial model shown in fig 3 the values of each object is estimated from that model the hull weight of the initial model is 8 786 5 tons and the maximum heave motion response is 3 62 m the maximum roll motion response is 5 845 the population size is set to 48 and number of generation is set to 40 finally non dominated 30 pareto optimal solutions are obtained and the optimization results are shown in fig 14 in fig 14 the red dots represent the inferior solutions which indicates the poor optimization effects and can be eliminated the black dots are the feasible solutions which meet the constraint conditions the blue and green dots constitute the non inferior solutions of pareto which indicates the satisfactory optimization effects the pareto solution set is also represented by a two dimensional graph as shown in fig 15 it can be clearly seen that the hull steel weight is inversely related to heave motion and roll motion and the heave motion is positively related to roll motion when the weight is reducing the heave motion and roll motion responses are increasing therefore the hull steel weight is contradictory with other two optimized objects there are 314 solutions making up the pareto frontier set which all meet the constraint conditions considering the aims of the medical platform optimization two groups of optimal solutions are focused on the first group focus on the platform cost with light weight reduction the second group focus on the stability of the medical platform with small heave and roll motion responses and the two groups are shown in table 6 according to table 6 the optimized objects are all reduced for the first case the weight is reduced by 9 47 and the heave and roll is reduced by 9 93 and 14 85 respectively for the second case the weight is reduced by 2 42 and the heave and roll is reduced by 16 40 and 20 09 respectively it also indicates that the performance of the three constraints are also improved with the stability performance increasing by 36 88 and 26 59 the pitch response reducing by 27 19 and 21 18 and the heave acceleration reducing by 17 48 and 25 65 the overall performance of the platform is well improved 4 2 discussions and analysis meanwhile the optimization results based on the surrogate model are verified by the direct numerical model simulations to ensure the accuracy of the surrogate model the comparisons of optimization results and numerical values are all list in table 7 using the nine design variables obtained after optimization the numerical model was established and the simulation analysis was carried out to obtain the simulation values of gm heave response roll response pitch response and heave response acceleration table 7 compares the optimization results with the simulation results the maximum deviation of gm was 8 382 and 3 49 for two optimization results respectively the heave response deviation after the first optimization is 5 24 for other response values the deviations are all within 5 the cause of the error may be that there is a small error which cannot be eliminated in the process of simulation analysis with software on the whole the whole numerical simulation model can provide satisfactory results moreover the iterative process of the nine design variables is described in fig 16 the x axis is the number of iterations and y axis is the design variable it can be shown that the design variables fluctuate within the design range and gradually converge after 2000 iterations in addition the correlations of design variables and output variables are calculated as shown in fig 17 it can be found that the largest correlation is about w and x1 which indicates that the weight of the hull structure mainly depends on the deck length moreover the weight has large correlation with most of the design variables but has little correlation with the hull draft there are negative correlations between the heave response and deck length width height and hull draft the largest correlation for roll is with column width the largest correlation for pitch is with pontoon length from the above analysis in fig 17 it is obviously found the important design variables that have greatest impact on the outputs thus the relationship of the output with the two important design variables are drawn in fig 18 the weight is the steel weight is positively correlated with the length and width of the deck for the heave response and roll response they both have highest correlation with the deck length and the column width for the platform stability it is highly affected by the column width and height the pith response is related with the column width and the pontoon length the heave acceleration response is related with the deck length and the column length 5 conclusions in this study the hull optimization for the semi submersible medical platform was performed three objects related to the cost and motion response performance were considered the total goal was to minimize the whole weight and minimized the heave and roll response nine hull form parameters including the deck sizes column sizes pontoon sizes and the hull draft were the design variables the transverse metacentric height the pitch response and the heave acceleration response were imposed as the constraints 1 a surrogate model was established for the semi submersible medical platform to express the relationship between design variables and output variables which reduced the time consuming induced by the numerical simulation and improved the optimization efficiency 2 the multi objective model was proposed for the semi submersible medical platform the gray correlation analysis was used to evaluate the importance of three optimization objects for the whole performance 3 the optimization process was performed by the nsga ii algorithm and pareto solutions were achieved results showed that the whole hull structure weight showed positive correlation with the sizing of deck column and pontoon but negative relation with the hull draft the heave and roll response showed positive correlation with the sizing of column and pontoon but negative relation with the sizing of deck and hull draft credit

20764,this paper proposes a study on the hull structure optimization of a semi submersible medical platform the hull structure sizes have great important effect on the cost hydrodynamics global and manufacture of the whole semi submersible platform in this paper the economy lightweight and higher stability should be ensured for the medical platform during the optimization design process the hull

achieved in the form of pareto set according to the optimization results the changing relations between the sizes of the deck column pontoon and draft with the total weight and the heave and roll response can be determined keywords multi objective optimization semi submersible medical platform surrogate model gray correlation analysis 1 introduction semi submersible semi platform is one of the most preferred floating type for oil gas exploration and offshore wind energy in the deep water in the past few decades semi shows more merits on the aspect of good seakeeping capability large riser holding space easy offshore installation and large topside space furthermore semi has no restriction on fabrication location as it can be built by a number of shipyards worldwide and it has the large deck and adapts to a wide range of water depth therefore more and more semi platforms are fabricated not only for production but also for accommodation service tourism and medical one of the major challenges for designing a semi submersible is the relatively larger vertical motion in waves which makes it difficult to design robust and reliable mooring and riser systems optimization of the hull form to reach better global motion performance is critical to the development of the semi a lot of efforts have been made on the determination of the optimal hull form since the amplitude of wave induced motion is closely related to the hull form and the mass distribution clauss and birk 1996 introduced a fully automated numerical procedure for optimization venzon et al 2013 presented a procedure for hull form optimization of semi rig using an artificial neural network model as a quick estimate of the heave motion avoiding the extensive use of numerical methods and mesh generation park et al 2015 proposed an automated procedure for the hull form optimization of semi submersible floating production unit the 3 h heave most probable extreme value and the structural weight are the objectives and each objective is weighted and four optimal solutions are obtained zhang et al 2018 used the evolutionary algorithm to optimize the tension leg platform based on the surrogate model the total weight and tendon tension are the optimization objects qiu et al 2019 proposed a semi submersible platform optimization program using particle swam optimization algorithm the heave motion and total weight are considered as the optimization objects for three types of semis sugita and suzuki 2016 performed the hull sizing of tension leg platforms using an optimization model the hull and the tendon weight are the objectives and the global performance strength and initial screening criteria are the constraint conditions du kim and jang 2016 performed multi objective optimization for tlp considering the hull form and tendon system the maximum heave response and the total weight are formulated as objective functions and pareto set with eight different optimum solutions were obtained xie and falzarano 2020 developed an optimization framework using genetic algorithm to realize automatic parameter optimization for semi submersible design of eight pontoons emami and mostafa gharabaghi 2020 introduced a grid search algorithm in the form of a three objective function to minimize the weight of a semi submersible hull and to reduce the heave and pitch motion responses xu 2011 proposed a new semi submersible platform concept by extending the width and height of the float box at the bottom of the column to form a float which not only increases the bottom area and inhibits the oscillating motion but also interrupts the consistent continuity of the column decreases the effective draft inhibits the generation of eddy motion and makes the semi submersible platform optimized in terms of motion performance thus the economy safety and reliability of semi submersible platform structure will become a trend zhang et al 2017 and tian et al 2019 therefore how to optimize the hull shape to achieve better overall motion performance is very important for the development of the semi submersible platform in the present study a semi submersible platform is designed mainly for medical at the engineering phase of offshore platform projects various design criteria such as hydrodynamic response global performance stability and structural strength are considered to determine the initial configuration and sizes and then the initial design is optimized for economy safety or easy of construction the weight of the semi submersible platform is mainly based on the amount of steel used which is related to the cost among the six degrees of freedom responses of the platform heave and roll have the most obvious effects on the platform s hydrodynamic performance song et al 2019 and xie et al 2019 considering the stability requirements of the medical platform its motion response have to be limited so as not to produce large instability under the wave load therefore the weight heave motion and roll motion should be considered as the optimization goals to obtain a more cost safety and stability design while the safety and installation of a platform are considered as constraints the whole paper is organized as follows the mathematical model of the medical platform is proposed in section 2 section 3 establishes the surrogate model and multi objective function of the medical platform the pareto solution set results are obtained in section 4 last the conclusions are given in section 5 2 mathematical model 2 1 model of the semi submersible platform the semi submersible platform is designed aimed for medical the upper part of the platform is arranged for medical area living area and so on the lower part is arranged for the mechanical area ballast tanks fresh water tanks fuel tanks pump tanks and so on the whole layout of the platform is shown in fig 1 the hull form is determined according to the existing hull types and in the conceptual design phase the dimensions of the hull need to be determined firstly considering the environmental conditions and functional requirements the initial hull shape and sizes are estimated by past project data or by applying the engineers experience the conceptual selection results are taken as an initial design for further optimization in the present study in order to find a better technically and economically feasible design the shape and sizes of the hull are need to be optimized considering the weight control hydrostatic stability hydrodynamic and global performance therefore the hull sizing optimization process is modeled as a multivariable minimization problem with multiple constraint conditions the optimization process is shown in fig 2 firstly an assessment of the objectives and confirmation of the set of constraints of each design candidate is necessary and the surrogate model is used to obtain the function relationship between input and output by continuous approximation to replace the numerical simulations for each varied hull form and the multi objective model is established by using the gray correlation analysis method finally the optimization results are obtained by nsga ii algorithm 2 2 design variables for the design of the medical semi submersible platform the sizes of the deck column pontoon and hull draft are all needed to be determined and nine design variables including deck height deck width deck length column height column width column length pontoon length pontoon height hull draft as shown in fig 3 for the whole semi submersible platform economy and lightweight is the first considered for the platform optimization design in addition this platform needs higher stability as the heave and rolling of platform have a great impact on the stability performance therefore the weight heave performance and rolling performance are firstly considered during the optimization design process a total of nine independent variables are list in table 1 which are introduced to express the hull and the deck initial form these variables are directly related to the dimensions of each part of the hull and deck respectively other dimensions can be calculated from these nine variables according to the design requirements the hull draft must be larger than the pontoon height the pontoon width is the same with the column width and the deck length is the sum of the column width and transverse brace length the initial value lower bound and upper bound of design variables deck height deck width deck length column height column width column length pontoon length pontoon height hull draft are list in table 1 in the initial design stage the main performance of the platform should be evaluated to meet the safety and economy of the platform the pitch performance stability performance and heave acceleration are mainly considered here among the motions only heave motion is selected as the objective because relative to pitch and roll it is the dominant to the operability of topside process 2 3 wt estimation the weight of the hull structural is an important indicator which directly determines the cost of the whole platform as the design parameters are changed during the optimization process the hull form is changed continuously and the center of mass is also changed therefore the weight and the center of mass should be estimated the weight of the hull mainly contains four sections pontoon weight column weight transverse brace weight and deck weight each section is estimated based on the surface area volume and height of the hull structure for simple calculation the hull shape is simplified rectangular as shown in fig 3 for the pontoon it must provide adequate sufficient displacement the internal structural design such as the size and arrangement of ribs must enable the floating body to withstand hydrostatic pressure therefore the steel weight of the pontoon is taken as a function of the surface area of the pontoon and draft depth of the platform gosain et al 2017 1 w 1 9 4 10 3 s p t op 1 05 2 s p 2 x 7 x 4 x 8 t o p x 9 where w 1 is the steel weight of a single pontoon s p is the surface area of the lower floating body t o p is the draft depth of the platform x 7 x 4 and x 8 is the length width and height of the pontoon respectively for the column weight it can be calculated by the geometry directly as follows 3 w 2 x 6 0 286 x 5 1 612 where w 2 is the steel weight of a single column x 6 and x 5 are the height and width of the column respectively the transverse brace is generally cylindrical shell with stiffeners inside the load acting on the transverse brace is mainly the dynamic alternating tension and compression force which is usually designed according to the buckling criterion the steel weight of a transverse brace is estimated according to the following equ 4 4 w 3 l 0 405 d 1 608 d 3 3 where l is the length of the transverse brace l x 1 2 x 4 d is the diameter of the transverse brace the semi submersible platforms are often built with a box deck mainly consisting of a lower deck structure with double bottoms one or more intermediate decks and a main deck the inherent rigidity and strength of the box deck also reduces the need for diagonal bracing and the horizontal cross bracing is sufficient to meet the structural requirements therefore the weight of the whole deck structure is mainly composed of the main deck the remaining decks and the bulkheads which are denoted by w 4 w 5 and w 6 respectively main deck weight 5 w 4 0 242 a m d k 0 121 1 0 4 a m d k 2 remaining deck weight 6 w 5 0 051 a r d k 0 162 1 0 4 a r d k 2 bulkhead weight 7 w 6 0 026 h a mdk 2 13 where a m d k is the main deck area and equals to x 1 multiplying x 2 a rdk is the area of the remaining decks a rdk 2 x 1 x 2 and h is the height of the box deck generally the total weight of the hull structure is expressed as follows 8 w 2 w 1 4 w 2 2 w 3 w 4 w 5 w 6 additionally the hull outfit weight should be considered including power device weight fixed equipment weight ballast water weight consumable weight movable equipment weight etc for the center of gravity estimation it can be estimated by the weight of each part and the total weight based on the waterline of the platform the gravity center can be calculated as follows 9 z w i z i w s u m where w i is the weight of each part z i is the gravity center of each part and w sum is the whole weight of the platform 2 4 hydrodynamic performance in the marine environment semi submersible platform is sensitive to the ocean environment loads such as wind wave current and so on for the motion of offshore floating platform the most common and lasting influence is wind and wave it seriously affects the structural safety the adaptability and the cost in this paper wave load is the main considered load according to newton s second law the dynamic equation of an arbitrary floating body under the action of fluid is as follows fei et al 2017 10 f m x c x k x where f is the fluid force matrix including wave force and hydrostatic recovery force m is the mass matrix including its hull mass and additional mass x is the displacement matrix which is divided into surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw according to the direction of the spatial coordinate system c is the radiation damping matrix and viscous matrix and k is the stiffness matrix and k is the hydrostatic stiffness matrix when positioning without mooring furthermore f m and c are all related to the wave frequency as shown in fig 4 based on the three dimensional potential flow theory and morison equation the hydrodynamic characteristics and the motion responses can be achieved numerically the panel element model was established by using the three dimensional potential flow theory in the frequency domain and the influence of viscosity is considered by the morison equation to form a complete numerical calculation model for the wave load of the semi platform it is mainly caused by the pressure field generated by the wave motion wave loads are generally classified into three types inertial force dragging force and diffraction force for the large scale floating body the wave passing through it changes significantly so the diffraction effect of the floating body on the fluid must be considered the basic assumptions of diffraction theory are as follows a the fluid is an ideal fluid with uniform density incompressible and viscosity is ignored b the waves in the flow field are all linear waves c the fluid is in a non rotating motion which is the potential flow d the floating body is a rigid body e all the motions in the direction of six degrees of freedom are micro amplitude motions therefore the panel method can be adopted to compute the wave loads of large scale floating body it is assumed that the amplitudes of wave and motion of body are small compared with the cross section of body for the slender rod the ratio of cross section size to wavelength is less than 0 2 which has no interference on the wave motion direction in this case the viscous effect and additional mass effect of fluid play a decisive role on the load of the slender rod that is the wave force on the rod is composed of the inertial force generated by the local flow acceleration and the viscous force proportional to the square of the instantaneous velocity the wave load of the slender rod is calculated according to the morison equation which is a semi empirical formula for wave action in flow field tian et al 2019 and the general form of morison equation is as follows 11 f w a v e c m ρ v u c d 1 2 ρ a u u where f wave is the wave force acting on the slender rod c m is the coefficient of inertial force dimensionless value ρ is the density of sea water v is the drainage volume of the floating body u is the local flow velocity u is the local flow acceleration c d is the coefficient of viscous force dimensionless value a is the characteristic area that is the projected area of the bar perpendicular to the wave direction under unit height through the potential flow theory and morison equation added mass damping coefficient and the wave loads can be obtained by assuming the platform is rigid body the equations of motion can be solved in frequency domain motion response is conducted using the commercial program the response amplitude operators rao is a transfer function which can indicate the motion response characteristics of the floating body it represents the amplitude of platform sway motion caused by regular wave per amplitude for the translational direction degree of freedom its unit is m m and for the rotational direction degree of freedom its unit is deg m compared with other parameters the motion response rao is the most intuitive frequency domain index to evaluate the hydrodynamic performance of the scheme considering the water depth in the south china sea it is assumed that all platforms are operating with a depth of 1500 m since the platform is symmetrical the numerical model is shown in fig 5 and the wave direction angle range is 0 90 and the step length is 30 with a total of 4 angles the raos at different wave directions are shown in fig 6 the data in the figure shows that heave and roll have the greatest movement under unit amplitude that is they are the factors that have the greatest influence on the platform hydrodynamics therefore steel quantity heave response and roll response are used as the three optimization objectives it can be seen from fig 6 c and d that the changing trend of heave and roll is almost the same their motion amplitudes are large at low frequency and first increase and then decrease to the minimum value with the frequency increasing last the response is keeping low moreover rao of heave and roll are maximum when wave incident angle is 90 as can be seen from fig 6 e the pitch rao is maximum when wave incident angle is 0 therefore the heave and roll response values of the wave incident angle of 90 and the pitch response value of the wave incident angle of 0 are important generally based on the previous hydrodynamic model the motion responses under different sea conditions can be obtained the medical platform is calculated by selecting the sea condition of the first 10 year return period in the south china sea the parameters of the ten year return period sea condition are shown in table 2 and the heave and roll response under 90 wave and the pitch response under 0 wave are all calculated 2 5 stability performance the stability refers to the ability of the floating platform to automatically return to its original position by relying on buoyancy and gravity when the floating body is tilted under external forces other than buoyancy and gravity as shown in fig 7 when the semi submersible platform is tilted due to external force the waterline changes from w 0 l 0 to w 1 l 1 and the center of buoyancy moves from b 0 to b 1 at this time the displacement and the position of gravity center remain unchanged and gravity and buoyancy no longer act on the same plumb line resulting in a moment called restoring moment when the external force disappears the restoring moment will make the platform return to its original equilibrium position which is called stability the stability is an important performance for the semi submersible platform when the platform inclines slightly the restoring moment can be expressed by equ 12 12 m s gm sin φ where m s is the restoring moment is the displacement of the platform g is the center of gravity m is the transverse stability center gm is the stability height of platform φ is the transverse inclination angle of the platform when m point is higher than g point gm 0 and the restoring moment is positive which resists the platform s heeling when m point is lower than g point gm 0 and the restoring moment is negative which makes the ship keep heeling the m point is called the transverse metacentric of the platform in the conceptual design stage of the platform the height of the horizontal stability and the height of the longitudinal stability can be used as the preliminary means to measure the stability performance of the platform due to the structural characteristics of semi submersible platform the height of horizontal stability is the main factor determining the safety of the platform therefore the height of horizontal stability is taken as an index to judge whether the stability performance meets the requirements or not and is used as the constraint conditions in design optimization dnv requires that gm should be bigger than 0 m dnv 2011 but in actual the initial stability value is often higher than the standard value usually gm of the existing platform is generally greater than 2 m considering for the application of medical for this platform higher requirements are needed therefore in this study gm should be bigger than 3 m in this paper which can ensure the whole stability of the platform 3 multi objective optimization model for the semi submersible medical platform optimization problem the safety and economy should be satisfied therefore the hull steel weight heave response and roll response are selected as the optimized objects for the three optimization objects they are usually incongruous or contradictory the final optimization method should make tradeoffs and compromises among them during the optimization process the model of medical platform is crucial if the actual model is used for iterative optimization the calculation is usually large and the optimization efficiency is poor the corresponding approximate model can be established for analysis on the premise of ensuring the accuracy of the model the surrogate model is an appropriate method and it can establish empirical formula obtain the relationship between input variables and output variables reduce the time consuming call of simulation program and improve the optimization efficiency alexandrov et al 2001 3 1 surrogate model surrogate model is efficient for rapid optimization analyses it can establish the nonlinear relationship between design variables and their corresponding responses in complex engineering problem by mathematical model some representative sample points are required for building the surrogate model which are selected according to the design of experiment doe therefore doe related with the strategy of assigning sample points is one of the important tasks which should be considered during the construction process of surrogate model there are number of forms of surrogate model including response surface model kriging model support vector machine svm and radial basis function rbf and rbf is introduced in this study 3 1 1 experimental design method design of experiment doe is a technology based on probability theory and mathematical statistics to study how to make scientific and reasonable test scheme improve test efficiency and reduce the influence of random error wang et al 2020 the common experimental design methods contains orthogonal experimental design oed center composite design ccd uniform design ud ladin hypercube design lhd and optimal ladin hypercube design olhd latin hypercube sampling lhd is a stratified sampling technique it is a method to randomly select sample points from multivariate distribution however the spatial distribution uniformity of lhd would be poor for more design variables in order to improve the shortcomings of lhd chen proposed an optimal latin hypercube design olhd jin et al 2003 which has the characteristics of strong filling capacity good balance and even distribution of sampling points in the tests with high repeatability therefore this method can better reflect the design space characteristics fig 8 shows the flow chart of olhd the process contains inner loop and the outer loop the inner loop constantly updates the matrix and a better design is selected to replace the outer loop controls the optimization process by updating the threshold t h to prevent the local optimum firstly the randomly generated matrix is selected as the initial matrix x 0 then a new design is constructed by exchanging columns of the initial matrix at last according to the judgment criteria it is decided whether to replace the existing design with the new design olhd is used to generate the required sample points as 9 design variables are selected for the medical platform and the 9 dimensional image cannot be obtained the quality of the results cannot be observed therefore two dimensional plane images with 2 arbitrary design variables are used to illustrate with lhd and olhd in the same sample space the observed results are shown in fig 9 it can be seen that the uniformity of sample points selected by olhd is significantly improved than that of lhd according to the evaluation criteria maximum minimum distance criterion d min and φ p criterion kenny et al 2000 the two experimental design methods are evaluated as shown in table 3 it can be concluded that the minimum distance of olhd is larger than that of lhd and φ p is smaller than that of lhd which indicates that the performance of sample points selected by olhd is better than that of lhd therefore the sample points of semi submersible medical platform are selected by olhd experimental design method and 80 sample points were selected from 9 design variables to establish the surrogate model 3 1 2 radial basis function model radial basis function model rbf is used for the data fitting which has a high fitting effect for the nonlinear function radial basis neural networks are usually divided into three layers including input layer hidden layer and output layer as shown in fig 10 the input layer x 1 x 2 x n consists of the source nodes responsible for passing signals to the hidden layer and is mainly used to calculate the euclidean distance between the sample and prediction points the hidden layer h 1 h 2 h p consists of radial basis functions and map the vectors from low to high dimensions it is equivalent to finding the surface that best fits the input prediction points in the high dimensional space of the hidden layer the output layer realizes a weighted combination in a new linear space the specific solution of rbf neural network is as follows 13 f x i 1 n ω i φ r i w t ϕ where w is the vector of weight coefficient r i is the euclidean distance between the interpolation point and the sample point φ r is a radial function ϕ is the vector of radial function many functions can be used for the rbf functions such as gauss cubic inverse multi quadric imq and multi quadric mq among them imq rbf is selected as the rbf function and written as 14 ϕ r r 2 c 2 0 5 where c is the shape function commonly used assessment methods to test the reliability of the approximate model include root mean square error rmse mean relative error mre and complex correlation coefficient r2 and they are expressed as in equ 15 16 and 17 respectively 15 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i y p i 2 16 m r e 1 n i 1 n y i y p i y i ε 17 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y p i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where y i and y pi is the response values of the selected sample points and the predictive values of the model respectively n is the number of samples y is the average value of responses ε is the residual when y i 0 ε 0 when y i 0 ε 0 01 3 1 3 surrogate model of the whole medical platform the surrogate model of the medical platform is established by selecting 80 groups of sample points among them 70 groups of sample points are used to establish the approximate model and the rest 10 groups are used to verify the accuracy the data comes from the finite element analysis results and contains the response values of the heave roll pitch heave acceleration and transverse metacentric height by the rbf the approximate model of five response parameters are established and the details are shown in table 4 also the fitting curve of each approximate model is shown in fig 11 generally rmse mre r2 and maximum error can be used to test the accuracy of surrogate model in this paper rmse mre and r2 were used to test the closer the values of mre and rmse are to 0 the higher the fitting accuracy of the approximate model is and the closer r2 is to 1 the higher the fitting accuracy is for the engineering application it is usually required that the values of mre and rmse are less than 0 2 and r2 is greater than 0 9 it can be seen from table 4 that the fitting accuracy of heave motion roll motion pitch motion transverse metacentric height and heave acceleration all meet the requirements fig 11 depicts the fitting accuracy of 10 sample points which can reflect the fitting situation of sample points more intuitively the black line in the figure represents the fitted functional relationship while the red dots represent 10 sample points used to test the accuracy the closer the red dots are to the black line the higher the fitting accuracy is it can be seen that the distance between the red dot and the black line in fig 11 e is the closest indicating that the fitting accuracy of heave acceleration is the best the fitting accuracy of other graphs is slightly worse but the sample points are still near the function relation line indicating that the accuracy meets the requirements and the fitting effect is good 3 2 multi objective function as mentioned above the hull steel weight heave response and roll response are the optimized goals for the semi submersible medical platform for the multi objective optimization problems the optimal decisions are needed to be taken in the presence of trade offs between two or more conflicting objectives sometimes there is no solution that can satisfy all the constraints and make several objectives reach the global optimum at the same time to solve this problem deb put forward the method of a quick computation of pareto optimal solutions deb et al 2005 pareto optimization is a compromise solution to multiple objectives which is usually used to solve the contradiction between multiple objectives the mathematical model of optimization objective is shown in equ 18 18 y w hull steel weight ref steel weight 33945 ton z heave 90 ref heave r x roll 90 ref roll s t g m 6 0 m r y 6 0 z a 0 8 m s 2 min air gap 2 0 m hull draft pontoon height pontoonwidth column width deck length column width transverse brace length where w is weight of the hull structural z is heave response and rx is rolling response gm is transverse metacentric height ry is pitch response and za is heave acceleration response since the order of magnitude of the amount of steel used differs greatly from the order of magnitude of the heave and roll performance each sub objective has to be treated without magnitude and thus a proportionality factor is introduced the optimal values obtained from the single objective optimization of heave performance roll performance and economic performance as objectives are the proportionality factors for each sub objective in the present study three constraints contain the transverse metacentric height pitch motion and heave acceleration motion are considered the criterion of each constraint is deduced from the reference model and the recommended practice suggested by the api digre and zwerneman 2012 in this study gray correlation analysis method is introduced to determine the weighting factors of each optimization objective the specific method is shown in fig 12 firstly it is needed to find the optimal value of each objective function in single objective optimization and two sequences are formed one is formed by the values of all objective functions which is taken as the reference sequence and the other is produced by each sub objective optimization results obtained in single objective optimization which is as the target sequence and then the reference sequence and the target sequence should be normalized respectively last the weighting coefficient of each objective function are calculated by the gray correlation theory the target sequence x i and the reference sequence x j are shown in equ 19 and 20 19 x i x i 1 x i 2 x i n 20 x j x j 1 x j 2 x j n first calculate the absolute degree of correlation according to x i and x j calculate the sequence of the beginning of the zero like x i 0 k x j 0 k and then calculate s i s j s i s j respectively to get the absolute degree of correlation the calculation process is shown in equ 21 26 21 x i 0 k x i k x i 1 22 x j 0 k x j k x j 1 23 s i k 2 n 1 x i 0 k 0 5 x i 0 n 24 s j k 2 n 1 x j 0 k 0 5 x j 0 n 25 s i s j k 2 n 1 x i 0 k x j 0 k 0 5 x i 0 n x j 0 n 26 ε i j 1 s i s j 1 s i s j s i s j similarly calculate the relative degree of correlation the relative correlation analysis of the sequence starting point zeroing like x i 0 k x j 0 k as shown in equ 27 and 28 s i s j s i s j and the relative degree of correlation r i j calculated in the same way as the absolute correlation analysis in equ 23 24 and 25 27 x i 0 k x i k x i 1 1 28 x j 0 k x j k x j 1 1 finally the introduction of the adjustment coefficient θ the absolute degree of correlation ε ij and the relative degree of correlation r ij add up to get a comprehensive correlation ρ ij as shown in equ 29 generally take θ 0 1 generally take 0 5 29 ρ i j θ ε i j 1 θ r i j the weighting coefficients of each objective function are calculated as shown in table 5 nsga ii is a more popular multi objective genetic algorithm which is a modified version of nsga non dominated sorting genetic algorithm deb et al 2000 nsga ii has three merits to ensure the multi objective solutions first it proposed the fast non dominant sorting algorithm to reduce the computational complex second the elitist strategy is introduced to improve the accuracy of optimization results last crowding degree and crowding comparison operators are adopted to ensure the population diversity therefore nsga ii algorithm is selected to solve the multi objective problems to generate the optimal set of pareto solutions and the detail process is shown in fig 13 4 results and discussions 4 1 multi objective optimization results the optimization process is performed based on the initial model shown in fig 3 the values of each object is estimated from that model the hull weight of the initial model is 8 786 5 tons and the maximum heave motion response is 3 62 m the maximum roll motion response is 5 845 the population size is set to 48 and number of generation is set to 40 finally non dominated 30 pareto optimal solutions are obtained and the optimization results are shown in fig 14 in fig 14 the red dots represent the inferior solutions which indicates the poor optimization effects and can be eliminated the black dots are the feasible solutions which meet the constraint conditions the blue and green dots constitute the non inferior solutions of pareto which indicates the satisfactory optimization effects the pareto solution set is also represented by a two dimensional graph as shown in fig 15 it can be clearly seen that the hull steel weight is inversely related to heave motion and roll motion and the heave motion is positively related to roll motion when the weight is reducing the heave motion and roll motion responses are increasing therefore the hull steel weight is contradictory with other two optimized objects there are 314 solutions making up the pareto frontier set which all meet the constraint conditions considering the aims of the medical platform optimization two groups of optimal solutions are focused on the first group focus on the platform cost with light weight reduction the second group focus on the stability of the medical platform with small heave and roll motion responses and the two groups are shown in table 6 according to table 6 the optimized objects are all reduced for the first case the weight is reduced by 9 47 and the heave and roll is reduced by 9 93 and 14 85 respectively for the second case the weight is reduced by 2 42 and the heave and roll is reduced by 16 40 and 20 09 respectively it also indicates that the performance of the three constraints are also improved with the stability performance increasing by 36 88 and 26 59 the pitch response reducing by 27 19 and 21 18 and the heave acceleration reducing by 17 48 and 25 65 the overall performance of the platform is well improved 4 2 discussions and analysis meanwhile the optimization results based on the surrogate model are verified by the direct numerical model simulations to ensure the accuracy of the surrogate model the comparisons of optimization results and numerical values are all list in table 7 using the nine design variables obtained after optimization the numerical model was established and the simulation analysis was carried out to obtain the simulation values of gm heave response roll response pitch response and heave response acceleration table 7 compares the optimization results with the simulation results the maximum deviation of gm was 8 382 and 3 49 for two optimization results respectively the heave response deviation after the first optimization is 5 24 for other response values the deviations are all within 5 the cause of the error may be that there is a small error which cannot be eliminated in the process of simulation analysis with software on the whole the whole numerical simulation model can provide satisfactory results moreover the iterative process of the nine design variables is described in fig 16 the x axis is the number of iterations and y axis is the design variable it can be shown that the design variables fluctuate within the design range and gradually converge after 2000 iterations in addition the correlations of design variables and output variables are calculated as shown in fig 17 it can be found that the largest correlation is about w and x1 which indicates that the weight of the hull structure mainly depends on the deck length moreover the weight has large correlation with most of the design variables but has little correlation with the hull draft there are negative correlations between the heave response and deck length width height and hull draft the largest correlation for roll is with column width the largest correlation for pitch is with pontoon length from the above analysis in fig 17 it is obviously found the important design variables that have greatest impact on the outputs thus the relationship of the output with the two important design variables are drawn in fig 18 the weight is the steel weight is positively correlated with the length and width of the deck for the heave response and roll response they both have highest correlation with the deck length and the column width for the platform stability it is highly affected by the column width and height the pith response is related with the column width and the pontoon length the heave acceleration response is related with the deck length and the column length 5 conclusions in this study the hull optimization for the semi submersible medical platform was performed three objects related to the cost and motion response performance were considered the total goal was to minimize the whole weight and minimized the heave and roll response nine hull form parameters including the deck sizes column sizes pontoon sizes and the hull draft were the design variables the transverse metacentric height the pitch response and the heave acceleration response were imposed as the constraints 1 a surrogate model was established for the semi submersible medical platform to express the relationship between design variables and output variables which reduced the time consuming induced by the numerical simulation and improved the optimization efficiency 2 the multi objective model was proposed for the semi submersible medical platform the gray correlation analysis was used to evaluate the importance of three optimization objects for the whole performance 3 the optimization process was performed by the nsga ii algorithm and pareto solutions were achieved results showed that the whole hull structure weight showed positive correlation with the sizing of deck column and pontoon but negative relation with the hull draft the heave and roll response showed positive correlation with the sizing of column and pontoon but negative relation with the sizing of deck and hull draft credit
