4755,subsurface mineral dissolution problems exhibit complex behaviors which are difficult to model and validate numerically controlled physically validated experimental problems can be used to better understand mineral dissolution and subsequent numerical representation bridging the gap between numerical models and field observations the objective of this work was to collect the first controlled physical measurements in a porous aquifer overlying an evaporite mineral and to create a numerical model of the system the problem studied was modified from the classic hydrocoin level 1 case 5 problem three flow gradients in a porous aquifer were investigated in duplicate in a 2 d box problem the duplicate measurements had high variability shown by numerical modeling to be a result of initial conditions variable flux representing dissolution sharp gradients and variable dispersivity the physical measurements of parameters and fields were important for calibration success the numerical models including sensitivity analyses were capable of simulating flow patterns observed concentrations and peaks resulting from observed initial conditions the numerical models were a key tool in understanding factors influencing the flow and spread of salt within the system the models were limited by the ability to detail physical observations difficult in both the laboratory and for potential field applications the results provided insight in the hydrocoin level 1 case 5 numerical simulations with flow appearing to be swept forward however observed concentrations were lower than commonly modeled keywords dissolution density driven flow dispersion numerical modeling 1 introduction mineral dissolution is an important consideration in groundwater management scenarios that involve salt mining nuclear waste storage karstification land subsidence oil and gas and geothermal projects e g nea and oecd 1988 acero et al 2015 zidane et al 2014 hesshaus et al 2013 and krupp 2005 meaningful representations of mineral dissolution problems are difficult to create due to both complex flow patterns and the lack of measured geochemical data available for study for example groundwater flow near evaporite mineral formations where high density contrasts occur is generally characterized by erratic convective flow patterns and instability development or fingering e g elder 1967 voss and souza 1987 and schincariol et al 1994 analytic mathematical solutions to these problems are limited in scope and realistic solutions are best represented with numerical models however numerical codes must be validated to ensure they are capable of adequately capturing complex density driven flow and dissolution observations and carefully controlled experiments i e benchmarks are important tools that greatly increase the strength of non linear density dependent flow numerical codes by providing actual measurements of solute concentrations thus enabling calibration and validation bridging the gap between numerical solutions and field observations two methods used to create benchmarks are 1 model inter comparison and 2 physical measurements from experiments or case studies for mineral dissolution problems limited examples of physically validated benchmarks are available the primary benchmark used for mineral dissolution problems is the hydrocoin level 1 case 5 salt water distribution in a saturated porous medium nea and oecd 1988 hereafter referred to as hydrocoin1 5 however this benchmark is a model intercomparison thus this work aims to create a physically validated benchmark related to mineral dissolution model inter comparison benchmarks are based on results from several simulators and potentially some field data e g nea and oecd 1988 and voss and souza 1987 physical measurements involve collecting data in a controlled laboratory setting and then calibrating a numerical model to match the data e g konz et al 2009 schincariol and schwartz 1990 stoeckl et al 2016 wooding et al 1997a wooding et al 1997b simmons et al 1999 and elder 1967 however the work listed above in physically based density driven flow and transport benchmarking has focused on the injection of a brine into a groundwater system as opposed to the development of a brine resulting from mineral dissolution presented here the hydrocoin5 1 benchmark is a simplification of the gorleben salt dome in germany and deals with the salt concentration in an aquifer overlying a salt dome the lack of physical validation in this model inter comparison benchmark has led to a substantial debate over correct results younes et al 1999 diersch 2014 and herbert et al 1988 modeled the hydrocoin1 5 problem and observed recirculation patterns which occurs when diffusion is relatively high and brine spreads laterally across the lower part of the system oldenburg and pruess 1995 fig 1 however nea and oecd 1988 konikow et al 1997 and oldenburg and pruess 1995 observed swept forward flow which occurs when diffusion is small and brine spreads in the same general direction of regional flow although konikow et al 1997 indicated variations in results are a result of boundary conditions at the salt dome younes et al 1999 simulated recirculation under multiple boundary conditions and indicated swept forward or recirculation flow patterns may depend on the selection of finite element fe or finite difference fd methods konikow et al 1997 stated that although the numerical solutions for hydrocoin1 5 are considered benchmarks and model consistency can be compared physically based observations are required to determine if the models are accurate and precise clearly without a physical solution the results cannot be fully understood therefore this work aims to provide some insight into this highly debated classic benchmark in modeling mineral dissolution the reaction rate r for dissolving minerals is often expressed as jeschke et al 2001 r k 1 c c eq n where k is the surface reaction rate coefficient n is the reaction order c is the mass concentration and c eq is the equilibrium concentration or solubility for halite which has a high dissolution rate the large k value makes the boundary conditions close to thermodynamic equilibrium guo et al 2016 laouafa et al 2019 so that c c eq therefore equilibrium values are commonly used in salt dissolution problem transport of dissolved salts in porous media has been shown in controlled experiments to be represented using dispersivity and density driven flow e g konz et al 2009 schincariol et al 1994 guo et al 2016 showed that darcy formulations were acceptable in marco scale numerical models of minerals dissolution however field scale salt problems have generally focused on cavity development type problems e g guo et al 2016 laouafa et al 2019 work focusing on the interaction between dissolving salt formations tend to concentration on mechanical deformations e g chemia et al 2009 schneider 2011 however this work introduces a controlled physical analysis of the influence from the dissolution and presence of dissolved salt as mentioned controlled physically based datasets are valuable for the validation of groundwater solute transport numerical codes however none of the controlled physically based datasets reviewed involved the dissolution of the mineral itself therefore studies have assumed the adequate performance of numerical models in high density mineral dissolution problems while in fact there are no known accounts of controlled physically based experiments for these scenarios therefore the objective of this work is to collect controlled physical measurements and to determine the numerical parameters most important to represent the physical measurements in a scenario where density driven flow results from mineral dissolution in this study the first physical measurements of salt dissolution and resulting solute were collected in a porous experimental aquifer overlying a dissolving salt mineral under controlled experimental conditions these are the first known flow and transport measurements in an experimental aquifer resulting from mineral dissolution in a controlled setting considered in this problem are the dissolution of the mineral mineral flux rate aqueous phase solute and transient density driven flow numerical modeling is then used to examine parameter and boundary conditions settings that can best represent the observed results the flow and solute transport reported in this physical evaporite mineral dissolution pemd study explores the relationship between dissolution density driven solute transport and hydrodynamic dispersion the physical measurements will also provide insight into hydrocoin1 5 physical results a problem that has only been addressed using numerical methods to this point 2 methods 2 1 model concept and design for this physical and numerical study a 2 d flow tank filled with porous material was adapted from the classic hydrocoin1 5 problem nea and oecd 1988 the hydrocoin1 5 setup is a 900 m wide by 300 m high cross section with a salt dome along the centre third of the bottom table 1 freshwater is introduced and removed via a sloping head boundary along the top and all other boundaries are no flow the salt is represented as an aqueous brine via a constant concentration boundary the model is idealized 2 d and all material and properties are considered homogeneous and isotropic nea and oecd 1988 for this pemd study the physical experimental setup was a much smaller system based on hydrocoin1 5 table 1 this study changed the sloping head boundary applied in hydrocoin1 5 to constant head boundaries in the upper right and upper left corners of the aquifer for increased control in the physical measurements based on numerical results a constant head boundary will increase the vertical movement of the salt isolines this pemd study had higher hydraulic conductivity and porosity that hydrocoin1 5 salt was introduced using a flux boundary for the fe model as average flux was measured in the experiment the fd model used a constant concentration due to available model features finally hydrocoin1 5 applied a freshwater head gradient of approximately 1 1 while in this investigation three head gradients were used 2 5 and 10 2 2 experimental method to investigate mineral dissolution and solute transport through a porous media a series of physical measurements were made in a benchtop aquifer duplicate experiments were conducted at 2 5 and 10 head gradients gradients were calculated from the saltwater head at the inflow and outflow for each replicate the basic design of the physical experiments was a 0 3 m 0 9 m 0 12 m plexiglass tank filled with sand with an inflow in the upper left outflow in the upper right and a 0 3 m salt core along the centre of the bottom fig 2 table 1 the size of the experimental aquifer allowed for the development of a stable flow field the flow was created using a peristaltic pump masterflex l s 07522 20 with an overflow to maintain the constant head boundary due to the large water demand for each experimental run tap water was used concentrations are reported in m m 1 relative to saturation of 6 14 m so that 0 01 m m 1 represents a concentration relative to saturation equivalent to 0 0641 m the electrical conductivity of the tap water remained below 1 6 10 4 m m 1 the water temperature was maintained at 22 c 2 c the porous medium was unimin 0 65 filter sil silica sand sieved between 841 and 1700 μm the average particle size was 1 3 0 2 mm the sand was added while damp and packed every 4 cm to create homogeneous and isotropic packing and eliminate air pockets the hydraulic conductivity of the sand was measured using a falling head test with 3 measurements at 5 head differences ranging from 0 032 to 0 27 m was 2 3 10 3 2 9 10 4 m s 1 astm international 2000 the porosity of the sand was calculated as the fraction of the void volume over the total volume based on mass measurements and a sand specific gravity of 2 65 g cm 3 the salt dome was simulated using salt cores composed primarily of halite from the prairie evaporite formation in the williston basin near rocanville saskatchewan canada cores were selected to represent the mineral density and composition at depth in a salt formation the halite cores were cut and arranged so that there was a 0 30 m by 0 12 m flat surface a mass balance based on the loss of salt mineral mass over the course of the experiment was used to determine the average dissolution rate of the cores inductively coupled plasma icp analysis at the manitoba chemical analysis laboratory indicated that the salt cores contained a ratio of sodium calcium strontium 100 na 2 3 ca 0 018 sr and trace amounts of magnesium lead tellurium thorium beryllium and potassium the analysis was done using a varian plasma icp oes model 725 es with avarian 323 autosampler clay was packed around the cores to restrict water contact with the salt cores to the top movement of salt into the clay was assumed to be negligible during the experiment due to the low hydraulic conductivity of the clay the initial condition in hydrocoin level 1 case 5 where freshwater overlies a salt dome is an idealized condition that can be simulated numerically but not physically mineral dissolution appears to have occurred immediately after water contacted the salt mineral prior to the establishment of the flow field measurements began once the tank was full and flow was developed and continued until steady state appeared to be achieved the hydraulic head was manually recorded at the inflow and outflow as well as at 36 locations at y locations of 0 03 0 08 0 16 and 0 24 m between x locations of 0 08 and 0 81 m hydraulic head measurements in regions with detectable salt concentrations at the time of observation were converted to equivalent freshwater heads using the relationships described below see 2 3 1 density definitions measurement error was estimated at 0 005 m for these readings salt concentrations were measured at 16 discrete points every 15 s using electrical resistance measurements and manually using 5 extracted samples extracted samples were taken to calibrate and verify resistance readings the locations of the points were selected to capture the region immediately above and within the solute plume fig 2 resistance measurements were spaced at a minimum distance of 0 05 m to reduce interference e g hassanizadeh and leijnse 1995 resistance measurements were collected using a datascan 7321 measurement system with copper terminals spaced at 0 01 m a 0 75 ma energization source was applied resistance readings were calibrated using extracted samples thus included the formation factor resistivity measurements measure the environment around electrodes and thus represent an integral value so that exact measurement volume is unknown e g konz et al 2008 photometric dye methods were not used due to the inability to consistently dye the halite core however rhodamine wt was used to characterize flow patterns samples were extracted from the same location as the discrete measurements 5 times during the experimental run extraction samples were taken in 8 ml volumes using a syringe the extracted samples were calibrated using standards created from the salt cores as well as a pure nacl solution for all calculations it was assumed that all present ions were na and cl quality assurance and quality control were carefully maintained field blanks sampling duplicates laboratory duplicates and calibration standards were used laboratory duplicate errors were 2 4 3 0 and 2 7 sampling duplicate errors for the 2 5 and 10 gradients were 15 0 15 0 and 5 0 this translates to 5 2 10 4 m m 1 precision sampling duplicate error may have been high due to the disturbance in flow patterns and concentration caused by the initial sample collection a power curve best represented the relationship between the in situ resistance and extracted fluid equivalent nacl concentration the correlation coefficient of the calibration r2 was in the range of 0 60 0 99 for high concentration 5 5 10 4 m m 1 above background and 0 to 0 60 for freshwater concentration values the poor r2 values for the low concentrations were due to the very small change in observed resistance the average percent standard error in ec measurements between the resistance and extracted samples for the 2 5 and 10 gradients were 14 7 7 8 and 8 7 these errors may result from a difference in precise sampling location volume sampled or disturbance from the drawn sample the high end of the error 14 7 relates to a 6 0 10 4 m m 1 sensitivity or smallest detectable change based on the sampling error and measurement error the minimum detectable change in concentration was conservatively estimated to be 0 001 m m 1 the discrete concentration measurements were used to create isohalines for average steady state observations for each the 2 5 and 10 gradients the isohalines were used to extrapolate between points using triangulation with linear interpolation values were recorded after approximately 0 14 days data were gridded from x 0 25 to 0 9 m and y 0 to 0 2 m the gridded data were used to create an interpretation of the laboratory data however the physical based numerical modeling validated with point data is required to provide an interpretation of the flow and transport results 2 3 numerical methods the numerical model was a 2 d idealized concept of the physical benchtop aquifer the benchtop aquifer was designed to have boundaries that easily translated to numerical models the flow was assumed to occur through only the porous media and the clay packing was not considered in the numerical model mineral dissolution was represented with a flux boundary which was initially assumed to be constant throughout the experiment field potentials and parameters were measured wherever possible including hydraulic head solute concentration hydraulic conductivity porosity longitudinal dispersivity and average mineral flux table 1 table 2 based on the peclet number diffusion was determined to be negligible compared to dispersion to calibrate the numerical model to concentration results transverse dispersivity initial concentration and flux were adjusted the initial and inflow temperatures were set at 22 c the primary impetus for this simulation was a code capable of simulating transient density driven flow individual mineral reactions were not considered because in high density contrast problems density effects dominate over individual reactive transport post and prommer 2007 the finite element fe code feflow diersch 2014 was selected to complete the numerical investigation as is common in these types of problems transport of salt is modeled as the transport of a single species individual transport of ions is not considered transient saturated flow was described using the equation of continuity with a darcy flux law multiple iterative equation solvers were used a preconditioned conjugate gradient pcg solver was used for flow and bicgstabp type solver for transport the model was a 2 d vertical projection quadrilateral mode transport mapping was used to create the grid as this grid type increased numerical stability diersch 2014 the model grid size was reduced until the grid peclet number was below 2 based on the length of each element values in the model ranged from 0 31 to 1 78 cell lengths in the model were 0 0032 m above y 0 075 and 0 0016 m below the time step length was reduced until the courant number was below 1 which is beneficial for the result accuracy and numerical stability of transport calculations the initial time was set at 1 10 7 d with a maximum time step of 1 10 3 d however time step length was reduced where numerical oscillation or model instability was detected to compare finite element and finite difference fd results seawat guo and langevin 2002 was used with a conjugate gradient solver pcg2 the initial time step was 0 001 d and the maximum time step was 0 03 d with a total of 25 time steps the cells were 0 0025 by 0 0025 m the salt dome was simulated using a constant concentration boundary in the fd model 3 theory 3 1 hydrodynamic dispersion

combined effect of mechanical dispersion d m and diffusion d d fetter 1999 1 d l d m d d dispersion of dissolved sodium chloride was measured in a column using the methods described in pickens and

the effective molecular diffusion coefficient estimated as 6 d d ω d d where ω is a coefficient related to tortuosity and is estimated to be 0 6 to 0 7 for unconsolidated granular material fetter 1999 perkins and johnston 1963 d d is the diffusion coefficient of nacl in water at 25 c and ranges from 1 612 10 9 m2 s 1 at 0 mol l 1 to a low of 1 474 10 9 m2 s 1 at 0 5 mol l 1 to 1 584 10 9 m2 s 1 at 4 mol l 1 stokes 1950 an average value of 1 5 10 9 m2 s 1 was taken and therefore a value of 1 0 10 9 m2 s 1 was used for d d the sensitivity of concentration to diffusion was low variation of diffusion values in the range of 1 12 10 9 m2 s 1 to 0 88 10 9 m2 s 1 minimum and maximum values based on estimated tortuosity and diffusion of nacl resulted in an average of 0 26 difference between concentration values with a maximum difference of 1 3 the ratio of transverse to longitudinal dispersivity was estimated using dye the ratio was measured for 6 timesteps in the 5 gradients and found to be 0 11 0 05 this is comparable to the common estimate of 0 10 and within suggested values from fetter 1999 of 0 05 to 0 16 and pickens and grisak 1981 of 0 003 to 0 33 both at the field scale

significant contribution to hydrodynamic dispersion olsson and grathwohl 2007 3 2 density definitions in density driven problems at two points with equal pressure and elevation but different fluid density the hydraulic head will differ both feflow and seawat use equivalent freshwater head h 0 to calculate darcy flow saltwater fluid hydraulic head h s m is related to the density of the water ρ s kg m 3 10 h s p ρ s g z where p is pressure kg m 1 s 2 g is the gravitational acceleration m s 2 and z is elevation head m the mass conservation equation of a saturated fluid is given by diersch 2014 as 11 s 0 h 0 t q q q eob where s 0 is specific storage m 1 q is sinks and sources s 1 and q eob s 1 is a correction term saturated darcy flux q m s 1 in feflow is defined diersch 2014 as 12 q k f u h

hydraulic head and e is the gravitational unit vector 1 the density ratio χ in feflow is defined by diersch 2014 as 13 χ k 1 n 1 β ck c k c k 0 β t t t 0 where β ck m3 kg 1 is the solutal expansion coefficient of species k c k kg m 3 is the mass concentration of species k c k 0 kg m 3 is the initial concentration of species k β c 1 is the thermal expansion coefficient t c is temperature t 0 c is

the y and z directions see langevin et al 2007 4 results 4 1 pemd physical model flow and dispersion results flow in the pemd benchtop aquifer was maintained at a constant rate and gradients varied slightly from expected table 2 flow patterns observed using rhodamine wt appeared to be smooth swept forward flow which traveled down from the inflow across the salt dome and up to the outflow this supports the interpolated concentration isolines fig 3 swept forward flow was supported by concentration observations at upstream locations 0 50 0 03 m and 0 29 0 03 m which were 2 to 56 times lower than downstream concentrations whereas recirculation patterns would result in increased upstream concentration no short circuiting of flow or preferred pathways were observed with the exception of potential boundary influence from 0 90 0 00 m to 0 90 0 30 m along the outflow where low concentration values were observed at 0 89 0 17 m the use of saltwater head resulted in a maximum error of 0 0045 m based on a maximum density of 1014 kg m 3 4 2 pemd physical model salt concentration results the benchtop aquifer physical measurements examined solute concentrations observed in the aquifer overlying a salt mineral both methods of calculating dispersion produced similar results table 2 the peclet number indicated that diffusion was negligible for all tests a positive correlation existed between the head gradient and mass of dissolved salt introduced into the aquifer with 2 at 576 g d 1 5 at 705 g d 1 and 10 at 878 g d 1 this indicated that the dissolution of salt was transport or diffusion limited however the mass of dissolved salt fluctuated between replicates duplicate data were only available for the 5 gradients 705 and 489 g d 1 this indicated that flux likely varied during the experiment the dissolution of the salt resulted in a change in volume of 7 2 10 5 9 6 10 5 and 1 1 10 4 m3 for the 2 5 and 10 gradients respectively this is a height of 0 0020 0 0026 and 0 0031 m over the 0 12 m by 0 30 m salt cores the interpolated isohalines provide a potential interpretation of the physical results fig 3 fig 4 the experimental replicates exhibited variability however they exhibited similar overall flow and transport patterns as flow began peaks in concentration were observed downstream from the salt block indicating a surge of salt concentration through the system table 3 following the peaks was a decrease in concentration to a relatively steady value after 30 150 min fluctuating concentration patterns were observed approximately every 50 min in the 5 gradients the possibility that these patterns were related to withdrawal sampling was considered however sampling did not coincide with the circular concentration pattern time to steady state was negatively correlated with the gradient the 2 gradient experiment took the longest time to reach steady state in the corner below the outflow 0 85 0 01 m a continuous increase in concentration was observed in some experiments resulting in the highest steady state concentration while in other experiments the highest steady state concentration was observed at the downstream end of the salt block 0 61 0 01 m table 3 no relationship was observed between maximum concentration and gradient consistent initial conditions were difficult to achieve with increased concentrations observed at the beginning of the test while filling the tank immediately after water contacted the salt mineral duplicates at the various gradients indicated that the steady state conditions were sensitive to initial concentration distribution fig 4 this is in contrast to linear groundwater flow only models which given different initial conditions under the same boundary conditions will reach the same steady state conditions reilly and harbaugh 2004 the differences in observed concentration isolines for the two 5 gradient duplicates at the beginning of the test and after steady state were compared replicate 1 had a lower initial concentration above and upstream of the salt block whereas replicate 2 had a high concentration above and upstream of the salt block the resulting steady state concentration isolines showed similarities with increased concentrations near the edge of the salt block at 0 00 0 60 m and under the outlet at 0 00 0 90 m however replicate 2 had increased concentration overlying the upstream side of the salt core at 0 30 m not observed in replicate 1 4 3 numerical simulation results the observed phenomena in the physical benchtop aquifer experiments were investigated using numerical modeling the objective was to identify the key parameters that influenced calibration of the benchtop aquifer these comparisons between the benchtop aquifer experimental results and numerical models focused on the 5 gradient due to the high variation between experimental replicates the approach to the numerical modeling was first to create a model that represented the physical observations under uncalibrated conditions following that one of the 5 gradient replicates was examined to understand influences on calibration by examining values found to have the greatest effect on flow including initial conditions flux density and transverse dispersivity 4 3 1 uncalibrated model results model 1 parameters were based on measured values in the benchtop aquifer for k n dl dt average mineral flux and fields for equivalent freshwater hydraulic head and concentration the initial concentration throughout the numerical model was set at that of fresh water model 1 represented the uncalibrated results and used measured flux of 1500 g m 2 d 1 and transverse dispersivity of 0 00025 m when comparing model 1 to the laboratory results the observed and calculated head values at 0 075 days showed good correlation 0 892 and 0 895 for observed heads and equivalent freshwater head fig 5 the largest error between measured and observed values was at the point closest to the inflow 0 08 0 03 m and outflow 0 82 0 24 m where a high gradient is expected observation points in the benchtop aquifer containing saltwater were converted to equivalent freshwater head using the nearest concentration observation point and equation 18 the largest correction for freshwater and saltwater heads was 0 002 m the uncalibrated model concentration isohalines exhibited swept forward flow similar to the experimental results numerical models produced concentration magnitudes similar to observed values and similar flow patterns fig 6 however calibration to data points was poor in some locations for example concentrations were overestimated near the outflow and initial peaks in concentration were not captured fig 7 the numerical models were sensitive to grid size and time step length with too large of grid or time step resulting in numerical oscillation that resembled convective flow patterns the grid size was primarily sensitive to the longitudinal dispersivity values with decreasing values requiring decreasing grid size 4 3 2 uncalibrated gradients comparisons were made between predicted concentrations for the 2 5 and 10 gradients under uncalibrated conditions fig 8 similar to the laboratory observations the lower the gradient the longer it took the system to reach steady state in the experimental results measured flux increased with increasing gradient for 2 5 and 10 respectively these values were input into the numerical model table 2 maximum values observed in the numerical model were 0 200 0 067 and 0 039 m m 1 for the 2 5 and 10 gradients respectively thus exhibiting a pattern of decreasing maximum concentration with increasing gradient in contrast to the experimental results where no pattern was observed in the numerical model for all gradients the maximum concentration was generally observed at 0 60 0 00 m this is similar to the experimental results where the highest concentration in the laboratory measurements was located at 0 61 0 01 m or 0 85 0 01 m table 3 4 3 3 fd flow patterns previous studies e g younes et al 1999 have suggested that swept forward versus recirculation patterns may be related to model selection so the uncalibrated conditions were simulated in an fd model the fd model resulted in a similar swept forward flow to the fe model fig 9 the fd code produced stable results with a similar grid spacing however the model was more stable with larger time steps using the fd code 4 3 4 calibration and sensitivities model 2 represents calibration to 5 replicate 2 fig 6 calibration to physical results was identified to be primarily dependent on flux values hydrodynamic dispersion and initial concentration therefore these values were varied to examine effect on model results variable flux explained peaks in concentration that occur after near steady state is reached fig 7 a modulation function was applied to simulate changing flux to match observations flux over the salt block was divided into three equal sections with 2000 g m 2 d 1 500 g m 2 d 1 and 1000 g m 2 d 1 from downstream to upstream fig 6 calibration was based on the reduction of rmse and comparison to observed data the large initial peaks in concentration were closely related to the initial concentrations throughout the aquifer fig 7 the timing of the physically observed peaks was dependent on the initial location and magnitude of the increased concentration in the aquifer but could be created using different patterns of initial concentration the influence of initial conditions resulted in changes in location and magnitude of isolines which works to explain the high variability observed between replicates including location of maximum concentration in the numerical models the unstable initial conditions increased the time to steady state however similar isohalines to the uncalibrated scenario were achieved at steady state this is in contrast to the experimental results where steady state isohalines appeared to be sensitive to initial conditions however due to the slow shifting of concentrations continued physical measurements may have resulted in a steady state the dissolving salt mineral limited a continuous simulation a low transverse dispersivity value resulted in the best match for concentration observations in the section of vertical flow near the outflow while a high transverse dispersivity value best matched the salt concentrations near the salt mineral and downstream table 4 fig 7 to calibrate the model a transverse dispersivity value of 2 5 10 4 m was used from x 0 to 0 8 and a reduced value of 5 10 5 m from 0 8 to 0 9 m the sensitivity of a low estimate of 8 61 10 6 m indicating a ratio longitudinal to transverse dispersivity of 305 with a high estimate of 0 0025 m indicating a ratio of 1 were evaluated fig 7 this indicates that dispersivities are evolving throughout the experiment the sensitivity to the concentration gradient was evaluated by comparing concentration measurements over a 2 cm vertical distance in the model the resulting difference was approximately 0 032 m m 1 concentration or 11 g l 1 of salt fig 10 this large gradient is important considering measurement errors and heterogeneity in the physical model as well as the unknown measurement volume due to the unknown measurement volume and measurement errors observation points were adjusted by up to 1 cm to improve calibration 5 discussion 5 1 general discussion capturing data from an experiment in a benchtop aquifer resulted in a better understanding of flow and transport resulting from mineral dissolution high variability between experimental replicates was observed highlighting the variable nature of dissolution in porous media the numerical investigation indicated experimental variation was high due to 1 sharp gradients 2 potentially fluctuating mineral dissolution and 3 initial concentrations in the overlying aquifer the numerical models were capable of generally producing flow and concentration contours at locations and magnitudes observed in the benchtop aquifer and offered insight into the variation observed in the benchtop aquifer numerical models could not be precisely calibrated due to limited data on initial conditions variable flux and variations in hydrodynamic dispersivity variable initial conditions were shown to be an important factor in simulating initial peaks observed in the physical results erratic flow patterns observed in the physical measurements were confirmed to be a result of variable initial conditions and variable flux in the numerical model variable initial conditions were supported by initial measurements and are a result of salt dissolving as soon as it is in contact with water salt dissolution is likely to have varied with concentration of the overlying fluid this provides the physical basis for different salt flux over the length of the mineral it also explains the different steady state conditions reached due to varying initial concentration influencing mineral dissolution note schincariol and schwartz 1990 found that in variable density groundwater flow models different patterns developed based on the brine concentration in these experiments both the physical measurements and the fe and fd numerical model flow stabilized to a swept forward pattern in the numerical models the steady state isohalines were the same regardless of initial conditions on an extended time scale while in the physical simulation steady state appeared to be dependent on initial conditions concentrations and variable mineral flux this may have been a result of the physical measurements ending prior to reaching a true steady state or varying flux rates variations in the steady state distribution of concentration isohalines based on changes in initial conditions have previously been observed in non linear flow experiments schincariol and schwartz 1990 the time to reach a steady state was dependent on the hydraulic gradient increased concentrations in the overlying aquifer increased the time it took for the numerical simulations to reach a steady state the numerical models assumed that the system could be represented by one transverse and one longitudinal dispersivity value and that they were a physical property not chemically controlled however in 1 d experiments hassanizadeh and leijnse 1995 indicated that dispersivity was not only a property of the porous medium but also dependent on the concentration gradient and values had to be changed from case to case to get sufficient fits sudicky et al 1983 showed that dispersivities evolved over distance in the case of this pemd problem different calibration points fit better with high or low transverse dispersivity which may indicate that dispersivity is also dependent on concentration further study is warranted in understanding dispersivity and concentration in this context the pemd measurements collected one average mineral flux value for each physical model however spatially and temporally variable flux rates were used in the calibration to provide a better fit to the data heterogeneities in dissolution have previously been identified in the literature stiller et al 2007 showed that the initial salinity and overlying salinity in solutions was correlated to the dissolution rate weisbrod et al 2012 found that dissolution patterns either channel or frontal in halite cores were controlled by flow rate alkattan et al 1997a and alkattan et al 1997b found that under varying temperatures halite saturation flow velocity and trace metal concentration dissolution of halite ranged from about 1 10 1 and 9 10 3 mol m 2 s 1 the largest changes in flux are therefore expected prior to the experiment reaching steady state dissolution rates appear to be transport or diffusion limited as solute overlying the salt block was not saturated future mineral dissolution studies would benefit from continuous flux measurements 6 limitations the interpretation of the physical model results was limited by the inability to detail the concentration distribution within the tank the interpretations of the point observations figs 2 3 were limited by measurement density however a closer spacing of the resistance measurements may have resulted in interference withdrawal samples influenced flow patterns by removal of fluid and some ports were subject to leaks therefore replicates were completed to improve confidence in the results resistance measurement error ranged from 7 8 to 14 however provided good temporal data withdrawal samples had errors of 2 4 to 3 0 for laboratory duplicates and up to 15 for sampling duplicates however they provided poor temporal data photometric methods could not be used due to the difficulty dying a salt mineral and electrical magnetic scans with adequate resolution could not penetrate the plexiglas hydraulic heterogeneities in the benchtop aquifer from the shape of the particles packing of the sand or dissolution of the salt mineral have been shown to play an important role in the plume movement prasad and simmons 2003 schincariol and schwartz 1990 slight fluctuations observed in the physical model were assumed to be a result of physical heterogeneities such as particle packing and shape and slight head fluctuations the creation of void space as the salt mineral dissolved may have resulted in increased hydraulic conductivity in the overlying sand as dissolution based on flux values the reduction in mineral height resulting from dissolution was 0 0020 to 0 0031 m approximately twice the particle size of the porous media the diffusion of the salt into the clay pack around the mineral and clay into the physical tank was assumed to be negligible however any release of clay ions into the aquifer may have resulted in an overestimation of salt entering the aquifer the lack of detection of any concentration at 0 89 0 10 m in some replicates is assumed to be a result of preferential flow along the physical model boundary 6 1 comparison with numerical hydrocoin1 5 the observed concentrations in the physical experiments and numerical models had steep concentration gradients and swept forward flow this supports the numerical theory that swept forward flow dominated in this problem the field data associated with the hydrocoin1 5 problem supported the theory of a steep gradient nea and oecd 1988 results such as diersch and kolditz 1998 which support recirculation in the bottom portion of the aquifer indicate increased concentrations at points upstream of the salt block similar to downstream the measured results indicate no or low salt concentrations at steady state at points above or upstream of the salt block however the concentrations are lower and head gradients are higher in this pemd study than hydrocoin1 5 hydrocoin1 5 applied concentration or flux boundaries much higher than found in these pemd simulations as a result the hydrocoin1 5 solute concentration results from nea and oecd 1988 were approximately 10 times higher than the pemd physical model observations kinetically controlled solute transport between the solid and aqueous phase can be limited by surface reactions diffusion or transport resulting in the lower concentrations observed here studies of the application of the kinetic rate of dissolving salt into groundwater flow would be beneficial 7 conclusions flow and concentration data were collected in a porous benchtop aquifer overlying a dissolving salt mineral to provide physical evaporite mineral dissolution pemd data duplicate measurements were made for 2 5 and 10 flow gradients dissolution and transport of halite in porous media produced complex results high variability was observed between replicates however a swept forward pattern was observed at all gradients considerable data were collected to support a better understanding of mineral dissolution and its numerical representation the physical and numerical results indicate that low flow gradient systems required more time to reach equilibrium the maximum concentration was observed just above the salt block at the downstream end but did not reach saturation this work indicates that the numerical models used were capable of simulating and explaining flow patterns resulting from mineral dissolution the numerical models provided a reliable method of interpretation of flow patterns and causal relationships both fe and fd numerical codes were capable of simulating the general flow patterns concentration magnitudes locations of increased concentrations and peaks resulting from initial conditions however this work also highlights the difficulty in collecting representative data and the importance of sensitivity analyses the measurements of physical parameters such as hydraulic head permeability porosity hydrodynamic dispersion and flux were of paramount importance in model development in addition to these parameters generally important in porous media modeling results indicated that initial conditions mineral flux and dispersivity played major roles in salt distribution initial concentration up to 0 05 m m 1 were found to best simulate initial peaks in concentration ratios of longitudinal to transverse dispersivity ranging from 1 to 305 were found to provide good fits in different parts of the model flux values with a range of 500 2000 g m 2 d 1 were found to best fit the data average measured flux was 1500 g m 2 d 1 the models also indicated that sample locations were incredibly sensitive over 2 cm in space concentration values ranged over an order of magnitude e g from 0 003 m m 1 to 0 03 m m 1 although this work resulted in challenges with high variability it provides important insights in to the potential challenges and important parameters when working with soluble formations and subsurface solute transport the results suggest that high variability in concentration is intrinsic to salt dissolution problems and factors influencing dissolution should be characterized in a sensitivity analysis to indicate the potential range in concentrations groundwater solute data can be used to calibrate models however steep gradients can lead to widely varying concentrations in a small area numerical models require input data related to dissolution including varying flux rates hydrodynamic dispersion and even suspended particles resulting from mineral dissolution that occurs even under controlled conditions similar issues are expected at the field scale credit authorship contribution

4755,subsurface mineral dissolution problems exhibit complex behaviors which are difficult to model and validate numerically controlled physically validated experimental problems can be used to better understand mineral dissolution and subsequent numerical representation bridging the gap between numerical models and field observations the objective of this work was to collect the first controlled physical measurements in a porous aquifer overlying an evaporite mineral and to create a numerical model of the system the problem studied was modified from the classic hydrocoin level 1 case 5 problem three flow gradients in a porous aquifer were investigated in duplicate in a 2 d box problem the duplicate measurements had high variability shown by numerical modeling to be a result of initial conditions variable flux representing dissolution sharp gradients and variable dispersivity the physical measurements of parameters and fields were important for calibration success the numerical models including sensitivity analyses were capable of simulating flow patterns observed concentrations and peaks resulting from observed initial conditions the numerical models were a key tool in understanding factors influencing the flow and spread of salt within the system the models were limited by the ability to detail physical observations difficult in both the laboratory and for potential field applications the results provided insight in the hydrocoin level 1 case 5 numerical simulations with flow appearing to be swept forward however observed concentrations were lower than commonly modeled keywords dissolution density driven flow dispersion numerical modeling 1 introduction mineral dissolution is an important consideration in groundwater management scenarios that involve salt mining nuclear waste storage karstification land subsidence oil and gas and geothermal projects e g nea and oecd 1988 acero et al 2015 zidane et al 2014 hesshaus et al 2013 and krupp 2005 meaningful representations of mineral dissolution problems are difficult to create due to both complex flow patterns and the lack of measured geochemical data available for study for example groundwater flow near evaporite mineral formations where high density contrasts occur is generally characterized by erratic convective flow patterns and instability development or fingering e g elder 1967 voss and souza 1987 and schincariol et al 1994 analytic mathematical solutions to these problems are limited in scope and realistic solutions are best represented with numerical models however numerical codes must be validated to ensure they are capable of adequately capturing complex density driven flow and dissolution observations and carefully controlled experiments i e benchmarks are important tools that greatly increase the strength of non linear density dependent flow numerical codes by providing actual measurements of solute concentrations thus enabling calibration and validation bridging the gap between numerical solutions and field observations two methods used to create benchmarks are 1 model inter comparison and 2 physical measurements from experiments or case studies for mineral dissolution problems limited examples of physically validated benchmarks are available the primary benchmark used for mineral dissolution problems is the hydrocoin level 1 case 5 salt water distribution in a saturated porous medium nea and oecd 1988 hereafter referred to as hydrocoin1 5 however this benchmark is a model intercomparison thus this work aims to create a physically validated benchmark related to mineral dissolution model inter comparison benchmarks are based on results from several simulators and potentially some field data e g nea and oecd 1988 and voss and souza 1987 physical measurements involve collecting data in a controlled laboratory setting and then calibrating a numerical model to match the data e g konz et al 2009 schincariol and schwartz 1990 stoeckl et al 2016 wooding et al 1997a wooding et al 1997b simmons et al 1999 and elder 1967 however the work listed above in physically based density driven flow and transport benchmarking has focused on the injection of a brine into a groundwater system as opposed to the development of a brine resulting from mineral dissolution presented here the hydrocoin5 1 benchmark is a simplification of the gorleben salt dome in germany and deals with the salt concentration in an aquifer overlying a salt dome the lack of physical validation in this model inter comparison benchmark has led to a substantial debate over correct results younes et al 1999 diersch 2014 and herbert et al 1988 modeled the hydrocoin1 5 problem and observed recirculation patterns which occurs when diffusion is relatively high and brine spreads laterally across the lower part of the system oldenburg and pruess 1995 fig 1 however nea and oecd 1988 konikow et al 1997 and oldenburg and pruess 1995 observed swept forward flow which occurs when diffusion is small and brine spreads in the same general direction of regional flow although konikow et al 1997 indicated variations in results are a result of boundary conditions at the salt dome younes et al 1999 simulated recirculation under multiple boundary conditions and indicated swept forward or recirculation flow patterns may depend on the selection of finite element fe or finite difference fd methods konikow et al 1997 stated that although the numerical solutions for hydrocoin1 5 are considered benchmarks and model consistency can be compared physically based observations are required to determine if the models are accurate and precise clearly without a physical solution the results cannot be fully understood therefore this work aims to provide some insight into this highly debated classic benchmark in modeling mineral dissolution the reaction rate r for dissolving minerals is often expressed as jeschke et al 2001 r k 1 c c eq n where k is the surface reaction rate coefficient n is the reaction order c is the mass concentration and c eq is the equilibrium concentration or solubility for halite which has a high dissolution rate the large k value makes the boundary conditions close to thermodynamic equilibrium guo et al 2016 laouafa et al 2019 so that c c eq therefore equilibrium values are commonly used in salt dissolution problem transport of dissolved salts in porous media has been shown in controlled experiments to be represented using dispersivity and density driven flow e g konz et al 2009 schincariol et al 1994 guo et al 2016 showed that darcy formulations were acceptable in marco scale numerical models of minerals dissolution however field scale salt problems have generally focused on cavity development type problems e g guo et al 2016 laouafa et al 2019 work focusing on the interaction between dissolving salt formations tend to concentration on mechanical deformations e g chemia et al 2009 schneider 2011 however this work introduces a controlled physical analysis of the influence from the dissolution and presence of dissolved salt as mentioned controlled physically based datasets are valuable for the validation of groundwater solute transport numerical codes however none of the controlled physically based datasets reviewed involved the dissolution of the mineral itself therefore studies have assumed the adequate performance of numerical models in high density mineral dissolution problems while in fact there are no known accounts of controlled physically based experiments for these scenarios therefore the objective of this work is to collect controlled physical measurements and to determine the numerical parameters most important to represent the physical measurements in a scenario where density driven flow results from mineral dissolution in this study the first physical measurements of salt dissolution and resulting solute were collected in a porous experimental aquifer overlying a dissolving salt mineral under controlled experimental conditions these are the first known flow and transport measurements in an experimental aquifer resulting from mineral dissolution in a controlled setting considered in this problem are the dissolution of the mineral mineral flux rate aqueous phase solute and transient density driven flow numerical modeling is then used to examine parameter and boundary conditions settings that can best represent the observed results the flow and solute transport reported in this physical evaporite mineral dissolution pemd study explores the relationship between dissolution density driven solute transport and hydrodynamic dispersion the physical measurements will also provide insight into hydrocoin1 5 physical results a problem that has only been addressed using numerical methods to this point 2 methods 2 1 model concept and design for this physical and numerical study a 2 d flow tank filled with porous material was adapted from the classic hydrocoin1 5 problem nea and oecd 1988 the hydrocoin1 5 setup is a 900 m wide by 300 m high cross section with a salt dome along the centre third of the bottom table 1 freshwater is introduced and removed via a sloping head boundary along the top and all other boundaries are no flow the salt is represented as an aqueous brine via a constant concentration boundary the model is idealized 2 d and all material and properties are considered homogeneous and isotropic nea and oecd 1988 for this pemd study the physical experimental setup was a much smaller system based on hydrocoin1 5 table 1 this study changed the sloping head boundary applied in hydrocoin1 5 to constant head boundaries in the upper right and upper left corners of the aquifer for increased control in the physical measurements based on numerical results a constant head boundary will increase the vertical movement of the salt isolines this pemd study had higher hydraulic conductivity and porosity that hydrocoin1 5 salt was introduced using a flux boundary for the fe model as average flux was measured in the experiment the fd model used a constant concentration due to available model features finally hydrocoin1 5 applied a freshwater head gradient of approximately 1 1 while in this investigation three head gradients were used 2 5 and 10 2 2 experimental method to investigate mineral dissolution and solute transport through a porous media a series of physical measurements were made in a benchtop aquifer duplicate experiments were conducted at 2 5 and 10 head gradients gradients were calculated from the saltwater head at the inflow and outflow for each replicate the basic design of the physical experiments was a 0 3 m 0 9 m 0 12 m plexiglass tank filled with sand with an inflow in the upper left outflow in the upper right and a 0 3 m salt core along the centre of the bottom fig 2 table 1 the size of the experimental aquifer allowed for the development of a stable flow field the flow was created using a peristaltic pump masterflex l s 07522 20 with an overflow to maintain the constant head boundary due to the large water demand for each experimental run tap water was used concentrations are reported in m m 1 relative to saturation of 6 14 m so that 0 01 m m 1 represents a concentration relative to saturation equivalent to 0 0641 m the electrical conductivity of the tap water remained below 1 6 10 4 m m 1 the water temperature was maintained at 22 c 2 c the porous medium was unimin 0 65 filter sil silica sand sieved between 841 and 1700 μm the average particle size was 1 3 0 2 mm the sand was added while damp and packed every 4 cm to create homogeneous and isotropic packing and eliminate air pockets the hydraulic conductivity of the sand was measured using a falling head test with 3 measurements at 5 head differences ranging from 0 032 to 0 27 m was 2 3 10 3 2 9 10 4 m s 1 astm international 2000 the porosity of the sand was calculated as the fraction of the void volume over the total volume based on mass measurements and a sand specific gravity of 2 65 g cm 3 the salt dome was simulated using salt cores composed primarily of halite from the prairie evaporite formation in the williston basin near rocanville saskatchewan canada cores were selected to represent the mineral density and composition at depth in a salt formation the halite cores were cut and arranged so that there was a 0 30 m by 0 12 m flat surface a mass balance based on the loss of salt mineral mass over the course of the experiment was used to determine the average dissolution rate of the cores inductively coupled plasma icp analysis at the manitoba chemical analysis laboratory indicated that the salt cores contained a ratio of sodium calcium strontium 100 na 2 3 ca 0 018 sr and trace amounts of magnesium lead tellurium thorium beryllium and potassium the analysis was done using a varian plasma icp oes model 725 es with avarian 323 autosampler clay was packed around the cores to restrict water contact with the salt cores to the top movement of salt into the clay was assumed to be negligible during the experiment due to the low hydraulic conductivity of the clay the initial condition in hydrocoin level 1 case 5 where freshwater overlies a salt dome is an idealized condition that can be simulated numerically but not physically mineral dissolution appears to have occurred immediately after water contacted the salt mineral prior to the establishment of the flow field measurements began once the tank was full and flow was developed and continued until steady state appeared to be achieved the hydraulic head was manually recorded at the inflow and outflow as well as at 36 locations at y locations of 0 03 0 08 0 16 and 0 24 m between x locations of 0 08 and 0 81 m hydraulic head measurements in regions with detectable salt concentrations at the time of observation were converted to equivalent freshwater heads using the relationships described below see 2 3 1 density definitions measurement error was estimated at 0 005 m for these readings salt concentrations were measured at 16 discrete points every 15 s using electrical resistance measurements and manually using 5 extracted samples extracted samples were taken to calibrate and verify resistance readings the locations of the points were selected to capture the region immediately above and within the solute plume fig 2 resistance measurements were spaced at a minimum distance of 0 05 m to reduce interference e g hassanizadeh and leijnse 1995 resistance measurements were collected using a datascan 7321 measurement system with copper terminals spaced at 0 01 m a 0 75 ma energization source was applied resistance readings were calibrated using extracted samples thus included the formation factor resistivity measurements measure the environment around electrodes and thus represent an integral value so that exact measurement volume is unknown e g konz et al 2008 photometric dye methods were not used due to the inability to consistently dye the halite core however rhodamine wt was used to characterize flow patterns samples were extracted from the same location as the discrete measurements 5 times during the experimental run extraction samples were taken in 8 ml volumes using a syringe the extracted samples were calibrated using standards created from the salt cores as well as a pure nacl solution for all calculations it was assumed that all present ions were na and cl quality assurance and quality control were carefully maintained field blanks sampling duplicates laboratory duplicates and calibration standards were used laboratory duplicate errors were 2 4 3 0 and 2 7 sampling duplicate errors for the 2 5 and 10 gradients were 15 0 15 0 and 5 0 this translates to 5 2 10 4 m m 1 precision sampling duplicate error may have been high due to the disturbance in flow patterns and concentration caused by the initial sample collection a power curve best represented the relationship between the in situ resistance and extracted fluid equivalent nacl concentration the correlation coefficient of the calibration r2 was in the range of 0 60 0 99 for high concentration 5 5 10 4 m m 1 above background and 0 to 0 60 for freshwater concentration values the poor r2 values for the low concentrations were due to the very small change in observed resistance the average percent standard error in ec measurements between the resistance and extracted samples for the 2 5 and 10 gradients were 14 7 7 8 and 8 7 these errors may result from a difference in precise sampling location volume sampled or disturbance from the drawn sample the high end of the error 14 7 relates to a 6 0 10 4 m m 1 sensitivity or smallest detectable change based on the sampling error and measurement error the minimum detectable change in concentration was conservatively estimated to be 0 001 m m 1 the discrete concentration measurements were used to create isohalines for average steady state observations for each the 2 5 and 10 gradients the isohalines were used to extrapolate between points using triangulation with linear interpolation values were recorded after approximately 0 14 days data were gridded from x 0 25 to 0 9 m and y 0 to 0 2 m the gridded data were used to create an interpretation of the laboratory data however the physical based numerical modeling validated with point data is required to provide an interpretation of the flow and transport results 2 3 numerical methods the numerical model was a 2 d idealized concept of the physical benchtop aquifer the benchtop aquifer was designed to have boundaries that easily translated to numerical models the flow was assumed to occur through only the porous media and the clay packing was not considered in the numerical model mineral dissolution was represented with a flux boundary which was initially assumed to be constant throughout the experiment field potentials and parameters were measured wherever possible including hydraulic head solute concentration hydraulic conductivity porosity longitudinal dispersivity and average mineral flux table 1 table 2 based on the peclet number diffusion was determined to be negligible compared to dispersion to calibrate the numerical model to concentration results transverse dispersivity initial concentration and flux were adjusted the initial and inflow temperatures were set at 22 c the primary impetus for this simulation was a code capable of simulating transient density driven flow individual mineral reactions were not considered because in high density contrast problems density effects dominate over individual reactive transport post and prommer 2007 the finite element fe code feflow diersch 2014 was selected to complete the numerical investigation as is common in these types of problems transport of salt is modeled as the transport of a single species individual transport of ions is not considered transient saturated flow was described using the equation of continuity with a darcy flux law multiple iterative equation solvers were used a preconditioned conjugate gradient pcg solver was used for flow and bicgstabp type solver for transport the model was a 2 d vertical projection quadrilateral mode transport mapping was used to create the grid as this grid type increased numerical stability diersch 2014 the model grid size was reduced until the grid peclet number was below 2 based on the length of each element values in the model ranged from 0 31 to 1 78 cell lengths in the model were 0 0032 m above y 0 075 and 0 0016 m below the time step length was reduced until the courant number was below 1 which is beneficial for the result accuracy and numerical stability of transport calculations the initial time was set at 1 10 7 d with a maximum time step of 1 10 3 d however time step length was reduced where numerical oscillation or model instability was detected to compare finite element and finite difference fd results seawat guo and langevin 2002 was used with a conjugate gradient solver pcg2 the initial time step was 0 001 d and the maximum time step was 0 03 d with a total of 25 time steps the cells were 0 0025 by 0 0025 m the salt dome was simulated using a constant concentration boundary in the fd model 3 theory 3 1 hydrodynamic dispersion

4 mol l 1 stokes 1950 an average value of 1 5 10 9 m2 s 1 was taken and therefore a value of 1 0 10 9 m2 s 1 was used for d d the sensitivity of concentration to diffusion was low variation of diffusion values in the range of 1 12 10 9 m2 s 1 to 0 88 10 9 m2 s 1 minimum and maximum values based on estimated tortuosity and diffusion of nacl resulted in an average of 0 26 difference between concentration values with a maximum difference of 1 3 the ratio of transverse to longitudinal dispersivity was estimated using dye the ratio was measured for 6 timesteps in the 5 gradients and found to be 0 11 0 05 this is comparable to the common estimate of 0 10 and within suggested values from fetter 1999 of 0 05 to 0 16 and pickens and grisak 1981 of 0 003 to 0 33 both at the field scale

slightly from expected table 2 flow patterns observed using rhodamine wt appeared to be smooth swept forward flow which traveled down from the inflow across the salt dome and up to the outflow this supports the interpolated concentration isolines fig 3 swept forward flow was supported by concentration observations at upstream locations 0 50 0 03 m and 0 29 0 03 m which were 2 to 56 times lower than downstream concentrations whereas recirculation patterns would result in increased upstream concentration no short circuiting of flow or preferred pathways were observed with the exception of potential boundary influence from 0 90 0 00 m to 0 90 0 30 m along the outflow where low concentration values were observed at 0 89 0 17 m the use of saltwater head resulted in a maximum error of 0 0045 m based on a maximum density of 1014 kg m 3 4 2 pemd physical model salt concentration results the benchtop aquifer physical measurements examined solute concentrations observed in the aquifer overlying a salt mineral both methods of calculating dispersion produced similar results table 2 the peclet number indicated that diffusion was negligible for all tests a positive correlation existed between the head gradient and mass of dissolved salt introduced into the aquifer with 2 at 576 g d 1 5 at 705 g d 1 and 10 at 878 g d 1 this indicated that the dissolution of salt was transport or diffusion limited however the mass of dissolved salt fluctuated between replicates duplicate data were only available for the 5 gradients 705 and 489 g d 1 this indicated that flux likely varied during the experiment the dissolution of the salt resulted in a change in volume of 7 2 10 5 9 6 10 5 and 1 1 10 4 m3 for the 2 5 and 10 gradients respectively this is a height of 0 0020 0 0026 and 0 0031 m over the 0 12 m by 0 30 m salt cores the interpolated isohalines provide a potential interpretation of the physical results fig 3 fig 4 the experimental replicates exhibited variability however they exhibited similar overall flow and transport patterns as flow began peaks in concentration were observed downstream from the salt block indicating a surge of salt concentration through the system table 3 following the peaks was a decrease in concentration to a relatively steady value after 30 150 min fluctuating concentration patterns were observed approximately every 50 min in the 5 gradients the possibility that these patterns were related to withdrawal sampling was considered however sampling did not coincide with the circular concentration pattern time to steady state was negatively correlated with the gradient the 2 gradient experiment took the longest time to reach steady state in the corner below the outflow 0 85 0 01 m a continuous increase in concentration was observed in some experiments resulting in the highest steady state concentration while in other experiments the highest steady state concentration was observed at the downstream end of the salt block 0 61 0 01 m table 3 no relationship was observed between maximum concentration and gradient consistent initial conditions were difficult to achieve with increased concentrations observed at the beginning of the test while filling the tank immediately after water contacted the salt mineral duplicates at the various gradients indicated that the steady state conditions were sensitive to initial concentration distribution fig 4 this is in contrast to linear groundwater flow only models which given different initial conditions under the same boundary conditions will reach the same steady state conditions reilly and harbaugh 2004 the differences in observed concentration isolines for the two 5 gradient duplicates at the beginning of the test and after steady state were compared replicate 1 had a lower initial concentration above and upstream of the salt block whereas replicate 2 had a high concentration above and upstream of the salt block the resulting steady state concentration isolines showed similarities with increased concentrations near the edge of the salt block at 0 00 0 60 m and under the outlet at 0 00 0 90 m however replicate 2 had increased concentration overlying the upstream side of the salt core at 0 30 m not observed in replicate 1 4 3 numerical simulation results the observed phenomena in the physical benchtop aquifer experiments were investigated using numerical modeling the objective was to identify the key parameters that influenced calibration of the benchtop aquifer these comparisons between the benchtop aquifer experimental results and numerical models focused on the 5 gradient due to the high variation between experimental replicates the approach to the numerical modeling was first to create a model that represented the physical observations under uncalibrated conditions following that one of the 5 gradient replicates was examined to understand influences on calibration by examining values found to have the greatest effect on flow including initial conditions flux density and transverse dispersivity 4 3 1 uncalibrated model results model 1 parameters were based on measured values in the benchtop aquifer for k n dl dt average mineral flux and fields for equivalent freshwater hydraulic head and concentration the initial concentration throughout the numerical model was set at that of fresh water model 1 represented the uncalibrated results and used measured flux of 1500 g m 2 d 1 and transverse dispersivity of 0 00025 m when comparing model 1 to the laboratory results the observed and calculated head values at 0 075 days showed good correlation 0 892 and 0 895 for observed heads and equivalent freshwater head fig 5 the largest error between measured and observed values was at the point closest to the inflow 0 08 0 03 m and outflow 0 82 0 24 m where a high gradient is expected observation points in the benchtop aquifer containing saltwater were converted to equivalent freshwater head using the nearest concentration observation point and equation 18 the largest correction for freshwater and saltwater heads was 0 002 m the uncalibrated model concentration isohalines exhibited swept forward flow similar to the experimental results numerical models produced concentration magnitudes similar to observed values and similar flow patterns fig 6 however calibration to data points was poor in some locations for example concentrations were overestimated near the outflow and initial peaks in concentration were not captured fig 7 the numerical models were sensitive to grid size and time step length with too large of grid or time step resulting in numerical oscillation that resembled convective flow patterns the grid size was primarily sensitive to the longitudinal dispersivity values with decreasing values requiring decreasing grid size 4 3 2 uncalibrated gradients comparisons were made between predicted concentrations for the 2 5 and 10 gradients under uncalibrated conditions fig 8 similar to the laboratory observations the lower the gradient the longer it took the system to reach steady state in the experimental results measured flux increased with increasing gradient for 2 5 and 10 respectively these values were input into the numerical model table 2 maximum values observed in the numerical model were 0 200 0 067 and 0 039 m m 1 for the 2 5 and 10 gradients respectively thus exhibiting a pattern of decreasing maximum concentration with increasing gradient in contrast to the experimental results where no pattern was observed in the numerical model for all gradients the maximum concentration was generally observed at 0 60 0 00 m this is similar to the experimental results where the highest concentration in the laboratory measurements was located at 0 61 0 01 m or 0 85 0 01 m table 3 4 3 3 fd flow patterns previous studies e g younes et al 1999 have suggested that swept forward versus recirculation patterns may be related to model selection so the uncalibrated conditions were simulated in an fd model the fd model resulted in a similar swept forward flow to the fe model fig 9 the fd code produced stable results with a similar grid spacing however the model was more stable with larger time steps using the fd code 4 3 4 calibration and sensitivities model 2 represents calibration to 5 replicate 2 fig 6 calibration to physical results was identified to be primarily dependent on flux values hydrodynamic dispersion and initial concentration therefore these values were varied to examine effect on model results variable flux explained peaks in concentration that occur after near steady state is reached fig 7 a modulation function was applied to simulate changing flux to match observations flux over the salt block was divided into three equal sections with 2000 g m 2 d 1 500 g m 2 d 1 and 1000 g m 2 d 1 from downstream to upstream fig 6 calibration was based on the reduction of rmse and comparison to observed data the large initial peaks in concentration were closely related to the initial concentrations throughout the aquifer fig 7 the timing of the physically observed peaks was dependent on the initial location and magnitude of the increased concentration in the aquifer but could be created using different patterns of initial concentration the influence of initial conditions resulted in changes in location and magnitude of isolines which works to explain the high variability observed between replicates including location of maximum concentration in the numerical models the unstable initial conditions increased the time to steady state however similar isohalines to the uncalibrated scenario were achieved at steady state this is in contrast to the experimental results where steady state isohalines appeared to be sensitive to initial conditions however due to the slow shifting of concentrations continued physical measurements may have resulted in a steady state the dissolving salt mineral limited a continuous simulation a low transverse dispersivity value resulted in the best match for concentration observations in the section of vertical flow near the outflow while a high transverse dispersivity value best matched the salt concentrations near the salt mineral and downstream table 4 fig 7 to calibrate the model a transverse dispersivity value of 2 5 10 4 m was used from x 0 to 0 8 and a reduced value of 5 10 5 m from 0 8 to 0 9 m the sensitivity of a low estimate of 8 61 10 6 m indicating a ratio longitudinal to transverse dispersivity of 305 with a high estimate of 0 0025 m indicating a ratio of 1 were evaluated fig 7 this indicates that dispersivities are evolving throughout the experiment the sensitivity to the concentration gradient was evaluated by comparing concentration measurements over a 2 cm vertical distance in the model the resulting difference was approximately 0 032 m m 1 concentration or 11 g l 1 of salt fig 10 this large gradient is important considering measurement errors and heterogeneity in the physical model as well as the unknown measurement volume due to the unknown measurement volume and measurement errors observation points were adjusted by up to 1 cm to improve calibration 5 discussion 5 1 general discussion capturing data from an experiment in a benchtop aquifer resulted in a better understanding of flow and transport resulting from mineral dissolution high variability between experimental replicates was observed highlighting the variable nature of dissolution in porous media the numerical investigation indicated experimental variation was high due to 1 sharp gradients 2 potentially fluctuating mineral dissolution and 3 initial concentrations in the overlying aquifer the numerical models were capable of generally producing flow and concentration contours at locations and magnitudes observed in the benchtop aquifer and offered insight into the variation observed in the benchtop aquifer numerical models could not be precisely calibrated due to limited data on initial conditions variable flux and variations in hydrodynamic dispersivity variable initial conditions were shown to be an important factor in simulating initial peaks observed in the physical results erratic flow patterns observed in the physical measurements were confirmed to be a result of variable initial conditions and variable flux in the numerical model variable initial conditions were supported by initial measurements and are a result of salt dissolving as soon as it is in contact with water salt dissolution is likely to have varied with concentration of the overlying fluid this provides the physical basis for different salt flux over the length of the mineral it also explains the different steady state conditions reached due to varying initial concentration influencing mineral dissolution note schincariol and schwartz 1990 found that in variable density groundwater flow models different patterns developed based on the brine concentration in these experiments both the physical measurements and the fe and fd numerical model flow stabilized to a swept forward pattern in the numerical models the steady state isohalines were the same regardless of initial conditions on an extended time scale while in the physical simulation steady state appeared to be dependent on initial conditions concentrations and variable mineral flux this may have been a result of the physical measurements ending prior to reaching a true steady state or varying flux rates variations in the steady state distribution of concentration isohalines based on changes in initial conditions have previously been observed in non linear flow experiments schincariol and schwartz 1990 the time to reach a steady state was dependent on the hydraulic gradient increased concentrations in the overlying aquifer increased the time it took for the numerical simulations to reach a steady state the numerical models assumed that the system could be represented by one transverse and one longitudinal dispersivity value and that they were a physical property not chemically controlled however in 1 d experiments hassanizadeh and leijnse 1995 indicated that dispersivity was not only a property of the porous medium but also dependent on the concentration gradient and values had to be changed from case to case to get sufficient fits sudicky et al 1983 showed that dispersivities evolved over distance in the case of this pemd problem different calibration points fit better with high or low transverse dispersivity which may indicate that dispersivity is also dependent on concentration further study is warranted in understanding dispersivity and concentration in this context the pemd measurements collected one average mineral flux value for each physical model however spatially and temporally variable flux rates were used in the calibration to provide a better fit to the data heterogeneities in dissolution have previously been identified in the literature stiller et al 2007 showed that the initial salinity and overlying salinity in solutions was correlated to the dissolution rate weisbrod et al 2012 found that dissolution patterns either channel or frontal in halite cores were controlled by flow rate alkattan et al 1997a and alkattan et al 1997b found that under varying temperatures halite saturation flow velocity and trace metal concentration dissolution of halite ranged from about 1 10 1 and 9 10 3 mol m 2 s 1 the largest changes in flux are therefore expected prior to the experiment reaching steady state dissolution rates appear to be transport or diffusion limited as solute overlying the salt block was not saturated future mineral dissolution studies would benefit from continuous flux measurements 6 limitations the interpretation of the physical model results was limited by the inability to detail the concentration distribution within the tank the interpretations of the point observations figs 2 3 were limited by measurement density however a closer spacing of the resistance measurements may have resulted in interference withdrawal samples influenced flow patterns by removal of fluid and some ports were subject to leaks therefore replicates were completed to improve confidence in the results resistance measurement error ranged from 7 8 to 14 however provided good temporal data withdrawal samples had errors of 2 4 to 3 0 for laboratory duplicates and up to 15 for sampling duplicates however they provided poor temporal data photometric methods could not be used due to the difficulty dying a salt mineral and electrical magnetic scans with adequate resolution could not penetrate the plexiglas hydraulic heterogeneities in the benchtop aquifer from the shape of the particles packing of the sand or dissolution of the salt mineral have been shown to play an important role in the plume movement prasad and simmons 2003 schincariol and schwartz 1990 slight fluctuations observed in the physical model were assumed to be a result of physical heterogeneities such as particle packing and shape and slight head fluctuations the creation of void space as the salt mineral dissolved may have resulted in increased hydraulic conductivity in the overlying sand as dissolution based on flux values the reduction in mineral height resulting from dissolution was 0 0020 to 0 0031 m approximately twice the particle size of the porous media the diffusion of the salt into the clay pack around the mineral and clay into the physical tank was assumed to be negligible however any release of clay ions into the aquifer may have resulted in an overestimation of salt entering the aquifer the lack of detection of any concentration at 0 89 0 10 m in some replicates is assumed to be a result of preferential flow along the physical model boundary 6 1 comparison with numerical hydrocoin1 5 the observed concentrations in the physical experiments and numerical models had steep concentration gradients and swept forward flow this supports the numerical theory that swept forward flow dominated in this problem the field data associated with the hydrocoin1 5 problem supported the theory of a steep gradient nea and oecd 1988 results such as diersch and kolditz 1998 which support recirculation in the bottom portion of the aquifer indicate increased concentrations at points upstream of the salt block similar to downstream the measured results indicate no or low salt concentrations at steady state at points above or upstream of the salt block however the concentrations are lower and head gradients are higher in this pemd study than hydrocoin1 5 hydrocoin1 5 applied concentration or flux boundaries much higher than found in these pemd simulations as a result the hydrocoin1 5 solute concentration results from nea and oecd 1988 were approximately 10 times higher than the pemd physical model observations kinetically controlled solute transport between the solid and aqueous phase can be limited by surface reactions diffusion or transport resulting in the lower concentrations observed here studies of the application of the kinetic rate of dissolving salt into groundwater flow would be beneficial 7 conclusions flow and concentration data were collected in a porous benchtop aquifer overlying a dissolving salt mineral to provide physical evaporite mineral dissolution pemd data duplicate measurements were made for 2 5 and 10 flow gradients dissolution and transport of halite in porous media produced complex results high variability was observed between replicates however a swept forward pattern was observed at all gradients considerable data were collected to support a better understanding of mineral dissolution and its numerical representation the physical and numerical results indicate that low flow gradient systems required more time to reach equilibrium the maximum concentration was observed just above the salt block at the downstream end but did not reach saturation this work indicates that the numerical models used were capable of simulating and explaining flow patterns resulting from mineral dissolution the numerical models provided a reliable method of interpretation of flow patterns and causal relationships both fe and fd numerical codes were capable of simulating the general flow patterns concentration magnitudes locations of increased concentrations and peaks resulting from initial conditions however this work also highlights the difficulty in collecting representative data and the importance of sensitivity analyses the measurements of physical parameters such as hydraulic head permeability porosity hydrodynamic dispersion and flux were of paramount importance in model development in addition to these parameters generally important in porous media modeling results indicated that initial conditions mineral flux and dispersivity played major roles in salt distribution initial concentration up to 0 05 m m 1 were found to best simulate initial peaks in concentration ratios of longitudinal to transverse dispersivity ranging from 1 to 305 were found to provide good fits in different parts of the model flux values with a range of 500 2000 g m 2 d 1 were found to best fit the data average measured flux was 1500 g m 2 d 1 the models also indicated that sample locations were incredibly sensitive over 2 cm in space concentration values ranged over an order of magnitude e g from 0 003 m m 1 to 0 03 m m 1 although this work resulted in challenges with high variability it provides important insights in to the potential challenges and important parameters when working with soluble formations and subsurface solute transport the results suggest that high variability in concentration is intrinsic to salt dissolution problems and factors influencing dissolution should be characterized in a sensitivity analysis to indicate the potential range in concentrations groundwater solute data can be used to calibrate models however steep gradients can lead to widely varying concentrations in a small area numerical models require input data related to dissolution including varying flux rates hydrodynamic dispersion and even suspended particles resulting from mineral dissolution that occurs even under controlled conditions similar issues are expected at the field scale credit authorship contribution

this manuscript was handled by g syme editor in chief with assistance of jesús mateo lázaro associate editor flood frequency analysis ffa is used for estimating the return period of a design flood fundamental to ffa is the selection of a frequency distribution fitted to the data set where an inappropriate choice of a distribution can lead to significant error and bias in the design flood estimate the usual criteria for selecting a distribution are akaike information criterion aic bayesian information criterion bic and root mean square error rmse although these criteria have limitations this paper performed ffa using three main steps first five generalized distributions were considered as candidate distributions for ffa second the principle of maximum entropy pome and the method of maximum likelihood mle were used for parameter estimation and third a new model selection criterion based on the value of entropy was proposed to choose the best fitted distribution monte carlo simulation was carried out to test this entropy based method for four sample sizes equal to 50 200 1000 and 10000 and simulation was repeated 1000 times for each sample size then the probability that a given method identified the correct distribution was determined the probabilities affected by the sample size skewness and shape of the probability density function pdf were assessed using qing river basin china as a case study the design flood values were calculated and compared results of simulation showed that the proposed method was better than other methods for the following cases a the sample size of data set x is small b the skewness coefficient c s 0 and c the shape of pdfs is bell shaped keywords flood frequency analysis generalized distribution entropy theory model selection simulation test 1 introduction floods are among the worst natural disasters causing millions of dollars of damage annually and loss of human lives aziz et al 2016 in china alone more than 3900 people died because of floods during the period from 2011 to 2018 floods cannot be eliminated entirely but flood risk can be reduced the common tool to evaluate flood risk is flood frequency analysis ffa which constitutes the basis of flood mitigation measures including the design of flood control structures st george and mudelsee 2018 by ffa design floods and their return periods are estimated which are also required for flood plain management development and planning controls and flood insurance studies chen et al 2010 2011 fundamental to ffa is the selection of a frequency distribution where an inappropriate choice of a distribution can lead to significant error and bias in design flood estimates particularly for high return periods leading to either under or over estimation with serious implications in practice rahman et al 2013 a multitude of distributions have been employed in ffa for example the pearson type three p3 distribution is recommended in china chen et al 2015 the log pearson type three lpt3 distribution is used in the u s and australia benameur et al 2017 and generalized extreme value gev distribution is usually employed in europe nerc 1975 1999 recently some generalized distributions have been used in ffa chen et al 2017 used the generalized gamma gg and singh and singh 2007 used the generalized beta of second kind gb2 distributions for hydrologic frequency analysis halphen 1941 first proposed the halphen type a hal a distribution in 1941 and to accommodate greater flexibility in the modeling of smaller values in a data set he proposed the halphen type b hal b and halphen type ib hal ib distributions sanov 1958 joshi et al 2016 and chen et al 2018 applied hal a hal b and hal ib distributions to river flows in canada and mississippi respectively joshi et al 2016 chen et al 2018 the advantage of these generalized distributions is that they provide sufficient flexibility to fit a large variety of data sets which facilitates the selection and comparison of different distributions chen and singh 2018 the popular techniques for distribution parameter estimation include the methods of maximum likelihood mle o connor 1975 moments mom bayentin et al 2010 l moments lm glucina et al 1990 and principle of maximum entropy pome singh 2010 gulati and singh 1998 indicated that compared to the mle method when the skewness of data is high such as cs 2 5 the pome yields superior parameter estimates but for low skewness such as cs 0 5 the mle may be the preferred method after parameter estimation the next step is to select the probability distribution the usual selection criteria are akaike information criterion aic bayesian information criterion bic and root mean square error rmse aic tests the significance of differences between the distribution functions gersch et al 1973 wang and liu 2006 showed that when nested models were involved bic was better than aic although aic and bic are widely used in hydrological model selection they have limitations which may lead to unreliable results the aic and bic are respectively expressed as aic 2 ln i 1 n f x x i θ 2 k and bic 2 ln i 1 n f x x i θ k ln n where k is the number of parameters of the model and ln i 1 n f x x i θ denotes the log likelihood function of the probability density function f x x i θ evaluated at the point of maximum likelihood when sample size n is too large aic may lead to the overfitting of the distribution which can lead to the distortion of observed information when sample size n is too small bic may result in under fitting which can result in less than satisfactory determination of the tail characteristics of the distribution as parameter k goes up the penalties increase sharply this may lead aic and bic to choose the distribution whose parameter k is large as a result aic and bic should be used cautiously in conjunction with graphs and other criteria to evaluate the estimates from the chosen distribution in addition entropy theory proposed by shannon in late 1940 can provide an alternative way for model selection until now entropy has been widely used for ffa however entropy is mainly used in the derivation of distributions and parameter estimation based on the principle of maximum entropy singh 1997 for example kapur 1989 derived the pome based distributions for continuous random variates over a finite interval montroll and shlesinger 1983 employed the pome to derive the distributions with long tails jee and ratnaparkhi 1986 investigated the functional relationship between entropy h and variance σ 2 for some well known distributions moreover the parameters of some widely used distributions in hydrology such as gamma pearson type iii log pearson type iii pareto and weibull distributions and certain generalized distributions were estimated using pome method singh 1989 singh and guo 1995a 1995b 1995c chen et al 2017 and chen et al 2018 however little research has been carried out on the selection of distributions using entropy theory thus the objective of this study is therefore to propose a method that uses entropy theory to choose the best fitted distribution and validate the method using monte carlo simulation and data from the qing river basin china 2 methodology the methodology involved the following steps 1 five generalized frequency distributions were selected 2 pome and mle were employed for distribution parameter estimation 3 a new criterion based on the value of entropy was developed to choose the best fitted distribution 4 monte carlo simulation was carried out to evaluate the new method 5 the method was applied to the flood data from the qing river basin in china and design flood values were calculated and compared 2 1 candidate distributions five generalized distributions namely generalized gamma distribution gg generalized beta distribution of second kind gb2 halphen type a distribution hal a halphen type b distribution hal b and halphen type ib distribution hal ib were selected for this study the advantage of these generalized distributions is that they provide sufficient flexibility to fit a large variety of data sets which facilitates the selection and comparison of different distributions chen et al 2017 the traditional method is to try a variety of distributions and choose the best fitted distribution based on a particular mathematical norm such as least square error or maximum likelihood the disadvantage of this method of choosing is that it is tedious because too many different distributions need to be tried and empirical choices of candidate distributions make the results subjective chen et al 2018 the formulas of the generalized distributions are given in appendix a 2 2 parameter estimation the maximum likelihood estimation mle method and the principle of maximum entropy pome were used for parameter estimation considering different values of skewness of data different parameter estimation methods were considered the mle method involves the following steps 1 establishment of the appropriate likelihood function 2 derivation of the function 3 finding the maximum likelihood estimate value and 4 solution of the likelihood function more details can be found in davison and smith 1990 according to chen et al 2017 the pome method involves the following steps 1 specification of constraints 2 maximization of entropy using the method of lagrange multipliers 3 derivation of the relation between lagrange multipliers and constraints 4 derivation of the relation between lagrange multipliers and distribution parameters and 5 derivation of the relation between distribution parameters and constraints central to the pome method is to find the appropriate constraints for the distributions the constraints of the candidate distributions for pome method are discussed below for a continuous variable x the shannon entropy of variable x can be written as 1 h x x 1 x 2 f x ln f x d x where x 1 and x 2 are the lower and upper limits of the integral or the range of variable x the constraints of f x are given by 2 x 1 x 2 f x d x 1 3 x 1 x 2 h i x f x d x m i i 1 2 n where h i x are arbitrary functions of x m i are the expected value of h i x which are calculated based on observed data and n is the number of constraints the constraints h i x should be simple and should express those features of the distribution that are likely to be preserved in the future in addition constraints h i x should also be chosen based on the appropriateness of the resulting distribution given the empirical evidence papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2012 pointed out that the expectation of ln x makes an essential constraint for positively skewed random variables meanwhile the function ln x offers a very robust measure that is more likely to be preserved than the estimated sample moments kapur 1989 koutsoyiannis 2005 thus the function ln x is an appropriate choice as a constraint singh 1998 found that the function x q for small values of q behaves similar to ln x which is also an appropriate choice as a constraint considering that generalized entropy measures have been criticized for lacking theoretical consistency and for being arbitrary papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2012 defined the function ln 1 p x q p as an another constraint when p 0 lim p 0 ln 1 p x q p x q based on the above considerations the following constraints can be taken into accounts for different distributions 4 0 ln x f x x d x e ln x 5 0 x q f x x d x e x q m q 6 1 p 0 ln 1 p x q f x x d x e x p q m p q 7 0 f x d x 1 combining eqs 4 5 and 7 the entropy based probability density function can be written as 8 f x x exp λ 0 λ 1 ln x λ 2 x q after algebraic manipulations and parameter renaming eq 8 can be written as 9 f x x b c γ a b x c a 1 exp x c b eq 9 is the density function of the gg distribution combining eqs 4 6 and 7 the density function can be written as 10 f x x exp λ 0 λ 1 ln x λ 2 ln 1 p x q p after algebraic manipulation and parameter renaming eq 10 can be written as 11 f x c d b a b x d ac 1 1 x d c a b eq 11 is the density function of the gb2 distribution perreault et al 1999 did a series of studies on the halphen family they used the integral representation of the bessel function to derive an expression for the non central moment of order r for the halphen family specific expressions of constraints are given as follows 12a μ ar 0 x r f a x d x m r k υ r 2 α k υ 2 α 12b μ br 0 x r f b x d x m r e f υ r 2 α e f υ α 12c μ ibr 0 x r f ib x d x m r e f υ r 2 α e f υ α where m 0 is a scale parameter α 0 and υ r are the shape parameters k υ is the modified bessel function of the second kind of order υ e f υ is the exponential factorial function and r is the order of the moment for halphen type a distribution perreault et al 1999 pointed out that the sample moments of harmonic geometric and arithmetic means are sufficient statistics for parameters ashkar et al 1988 and kendall et al 1987 had concluded similarly the arithmetic mean is given by eq 13a the harmonic mean is given by eq 13b and the geometric mean is given by eq 13c which are corresponding to the noncentral moment of order r 1 1 and quasi zero 13a e x μ a 1 m k υ 1 2 α k υ 2 α 13b e 1 x μ a 1 1 m k υ 1 2 α k υ 2 α 13c e ln x ln μ a 0 ln m k υ 2 α υ k υ 2 α based on the above discussion we finally chose the following constraints for hal a distribution 14 x 1 x 2 f x d x 1 x 1 x 2 f x ln x d x e ln x x 1 x 2 f x x d x e x x 1 x 2 f x 1 x d x e 1 x based on eq 14 the density function can be written as 15 f x x exp λ 0 λ 1 ln x λ 2 x λ 3 1 x after algebraic manipulation and parameter renaming eq 15 can be written as 16 f x x 1 2 m υ k υ 2 α x υ 1 exp α x m m x eq 16 is the density function of the hal a distribution for halphen type b distribution the sample moments of geometric quadratic and arithmetic sample mean are sufficient statistics for parameters the arithmetic mean is given by eq 17a the quadratic mean is given by eq 17b and the geometric mean is given by eq 17c which are the noncentral moments of order r 1 2 and quasi zero 17a μ b 1 e x m e f υ 1 2 α e f υ α 17b μ b 2 e x 2 m 2 e f υ 1 α e f υ α 17c ln μ b 0 e ln x ln m e f υ α υ 2 e f υ α then we chose the following constraints for hal b distribution 18 x 1 x 2 f x d x 1 x 1 x 2 f x ln x d x e ln x x 1 x 2 f x x d x e x x 1 x 2 f x x 2 d x e x 2 based on eq 18 the density function can be written as 19 f x x exp λ 0 λ 1 ln x λ 2 x 2 λ 3 x after algebraic manipulation and parameter renaming eq 19 can be written as 20 f x x 2 c 2 υ e f υ α x 2 υ 1 exp x m 2 α m x eq 20 is the density function of the hal b distribution for halphen type ib distribution morlat 1956 and perreault et al 1999 recognized the relationship between type b and type ib distributions if x follows the halphen type b distribution then the inverse 1 x follows the halphen type ib distribution then we chose the following constraints for the hal ib distribution 21 x 1 x 2 f x d x 1 x 1 x 2 f x ln x d x e ln x x 1 x 2 f x 1 x d x e 1 x x 1 x 2 f x 1 x 2 d x e 1 x 2 based on eq 21 the density function can be written as 22 f x x exp

distribution thus the constraints of the five candidate distributions for pome were obtained now the parameters of each generalized distribution can be estimated and the derived equation sets are given in appendix b the detailed derivation of these equation sets can be found in chen et al 2017 2018 2 3 model selection based on the entropy based method this study proposed the entropy based method as a new criterion for model selection after estimating parameters of the five generalized distributions the shannon entropy value of each distribution was calculated then the distribution with the highest entropy value was selected as the best fitted one the reasons for this model selection criterion are as follows entropy can be justified as a measure of goodness of predictive distributions by a conceptual repeated sampling experiment as described by sanov 1958 according to pome when making inferences based on incomplete information the probability distribution to be drawn must have the maximum entropy permitted by the available information expressed in the form of constraints intuitively the distributions of higher entropy are smoother more uniform and more probable singh 1997 when the number of constraints increases namely more specific information added the entropy value will become smaller which is expressed by eq 24 24 h m x h n x m n where n and m represent the number of constraints the proof is given below for a continuous variable x two probability density functions f x and q x are used to fit the variable x where f x satisfies the first m constraints and q x satisfies the n constraints which include the m constraints namely m n let the entropy of f x and q x be h m x and h n x m n respectively the maximum entropy of distribution f x will be greater than or equal to the maximum entropy of distribution q x namely h m x h n x since more constraints and information are in q x whose entropy and its corresponding uncertainty will be less than that of f x 2 4 simulation testing of the proposed method to validate the proposed method two monte carlo simulation tests were used in this study two parent distributions were chosen from the above distributions and a series of data sets were generated from these parent distributions several candidate distributions were used to fit the data set the proposed method and currently used norms were used to select the best fitted distribution finally the best fitted distribution was compared with the parent distribution to see whether they were the same the procedure for monte carlo simulation is described as follows assume a parent distribution in this study two distributions namely gev and gb2 distributions were chosen as parent distributions respectively different parameter sets were considered for each parent distribution to discuss the effect of shape of pdf and skewness on the model selection results the variable x was randomly generated from the parent distributions using the r software the sample size m of variable x was equal to 50 200 1000 and 10000 respectively seven candidate distributions namely gg gb2 hal a hal b hal ib gev and p iii distributions were used to fit the data sets of x the mle or pome methods were used to estimate the parameters of the seven distributions the criteria of rmse aic bic and the proposed method were used to select the best fitted distribution steps b to e were repeated 1000 times the performance of each criterion was evaluated and the probabilities of identifying the correct distribution based on each criterion were calculated by eq 25 25 p t c n 100 where p is the probability of identifying the correct distribution tc is the number of correctly classified distribution and n is the total number of experiment repeats for test 1 the gev distribution was chosen as a parent distribution four different parameter sets were set which corresponded to four different situations namely cases 1 4 respectively the specific parameters for the four cases are shown in table 1 and their corresponding pdfs and cdfs are shown in fig 1 the data set x with sample size m where m 50 200 1000 and 10000 respectively was generated from these distributions for cases 1 and 2 since c s is small mle was chosen for parameter estimation for cases 3 and 4 since c s is high pome was chosen for parameter estimation seven candidate distributions namely gg gb2 hal a hal b hal ib gev and p iii distributions were used to fit the data sets of x the criteria rmse aic bic and proposed method were employed to select the best fitted distributions for test 2 the gb2 distribution was chosen as a parent distribution when the parameters of gb2 distribution r 2 and b β r 2 1 r 3 the gb2 distribution tended to be the gg distribution chen and singh 2017 based on this theory special parameters were set whose values are shown in table 3 and their corresponding pdfs and cdfs are shown in fig 2 the data set x with m 50 200 1000 and 10 000 was generated from this parent distribution pome was chosen for parameter estimation seven candidate distributions namely gg gb2 hal a hal b hal ib gev and p iii distributions were used to fit the data sets of x the criteria rmse aic bic and the proposed criterion were employed to select the best fitted distributions 3 results and discussions 3 1 results of simulation test for test 1 the selection results of each case are shown in table 2 when the sample size m 50 the corrected probability of both the proposed and aic criteria were more than 70 when m 200 the aic criterion showed the best performance and its corrected probability was 83 5 and when m 1000 and m 10000 both the proposed and bic criteria performed better the corrected probabilities of which were more than 80 thus when the sample size of data set was small both the proposed method and aic criterion were a good choice for model selection when the sample size of data set was medium the aic criterion performed the best and when the sample size of the data set was large both the proposed and aic criteria were better choices when c s 0 the aic method performed the best but the performances of the proposed and bic criteria were mediocre when c s 0 the corrected probabilities of all criteria went down by 10 compared to other cases and when c s 0 the corrected probability of the proposed criteria was the highest which was 90 4 when the shape of pdfs was bell shaped all the criteria showed good performances and when the shape was j shaped the corrected probabilities of all the criteria were low for test 2 the selection results are shown in table 4 when m 50 the proposed method showed the highest accuracy when m 200 the aic criterion performed the best when m 1000 and m 10000 both the proposed method and bic criteria performed well but the aic criterion performed badly as m went up the aic method did not perform well whereas the proposed method and bic criterion showed a better performance as discussed above the parameters of the gb2 parent distribution were set to a special value which made the gb2 distribution similar to the gg distribution thus it was difficult for all criteria to choose the correct distribution and made the accuracy of all criteria decline to further explore how often the proposed method agreed with other criteria case 1 with m 10 000 was taken as an example in this case the proposed method missed on 131 samples while aic bic and rmse missed on 456 186 and 201 samples respectively for aic criterion there were 127 missing samples that were the same with the proposed method accounting for 97 for bic criterion there were 122 identical missing samples which accounted for 93 for rmse 113 of 201 samples were the same with the proposed method and the consistency was 86 thus the proposed method displayed in a similar way with aic and bic criteria from the above discussion on model selection when the sample size m was small the proposed method performed better than other criteria and when m was high the proposed method had a good performance as sample size increased the probability that the proposed method identified the correct distribution increased when c s 0 the probability that the proposed method identified the correct distribution was high when c s 0 the probability was mediocre and when c s 0 the proposed method performed not so well since most of the hydrological data presented positive skewness the proposed method showed an obvious practical applicability when the pdfs were bell shaped the proposed method performed well and when the shape was j the probability of identifying the correct distribution based on proposed method was low in fact most of the pdfs of hydrometeorology data were bell shaped in summary the proposed method can be a good criterion for model selection 3 2 results of case study 3 2 1 data the qing river basin was selected as a case study this river is the first tributary of the yangtze river which originates from qiyue mountain in enshi city hubei province and flows through seven counties and cities qing river is 423 km long with a basin area of 167 700 square kilometers the annual maximum am sampling method was used here and 53 years flood series were obtained for ffa 3 2 2 parameter estimation the five generalized distributions and p iii distribution were used to fit the data set the pome method was used to estimate the parameters of these distributions and the estimated parameter values are given in table 5 the fitting histograms of these distributions are shown in fig 3 which shows that the results of fitting of these distributions are close to each other it is difficult to select the best fitted distribution from the visual graphs and the quantitative selection criteria are therefore needed 3 2 3 model selection according to fig 3 the pdfs of six candidate distributions are bell shaped and all distributions were positively skewed it is coincident with case 3 with m 50 in test 1 in this case the proposed criterion showed the best performance thus the proposed criterion was chosen as the preferred method for case study and other criteria were also employed for comparison 3 2 4 model selection results for the entropy based method for model selection the entropy value of each distribution was calculated based on eq 1 the distribution with the highest entropy was selected as the best one and results are given in table 6 according to table 6 the entropy value of the gb2 distribution was the highest thus it was chosen as the best fitted distribution for other traditional selection methods rmse aic and bic were calculated using the above formulas and results are shown in table 6 the distribution with the lowest value was selected as the best fitted distribution according to table 6 the value of gb2 distribution was the lowest thus it was chosen as the best fitted distribution based on the results of model selection for the qing river basin the gb2 distribution was the best fitted one in addition as the preferred method the proposed criterion successfully selected the optimal distribution in the case study although all the methods had the ability to select the best fitted distribution according to the simulation test for this special case the accuracy of the proposed criterion was better 3 2 5 calculation of design flood for the qing river basin the t year design flood was calculated using the six distributions as shown in table 7 since the gb2 was selected as the most appropriate distribution the 50 year 100 year 500 year 1000 year and 5000 year design floods were calculated by the gb2 distribution their corresponding values were 11 022 m3 s 12 631 m3 s 17 189 m3 s 19 607 m3 s and 26 575 m3 s respectively it is seen from table 7 that when different distributions were used for calculating the design flood the results were very different for example when the p iii distribution recommended in china was used the 5000 year design flood was 17 697 m3 s actually the 5000 year design flood calculated by gb2 distribution was 26 575 m3 s the flood frequency curves of these distributions and q q plot are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively from these figures the design values for large return periods of gb2 distribution were closer to the observed values and they were significantly less for the p iii distribution than the observed flood therefore the p iii distribution underestimated the design flood values causing greater flood risk 4 conclusions the paper used five generalized distributions gg gb2 hal a hal b and hal ib for ffa and the pome and mle methods were used for parameter estimation a new model selection criterion based on maximum entropy was developed to choose the best fitted distribution monte carlo simulation was carried out to evaluate this new method for four sample sizes equal to 50 200 1000 and 10 000 each simulation experiment was repeated 1000 times the probability that a given method identified the correct distribution was determined the probabilities affected by the sample sizes skewness and shapes of pdf were assessed the qing river basin china was selected as a case study the main conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows 1 monte carlo simulation results show that both mle and pome are good methods for parameter estimation and the proposed method can be a good criterion for model selection 2 simulation tests show that when the data set conform to the following characteristics respectively the proposed method is better than other methods a the sample size of data set x is small b the skewness coefficient c s 0 and c the pdf is bell shaped in other cases the proposed method also performs not bad 3 results of the case study show that the five generalized distributions are suitable for ffa the parameter estimation method based on pome is reasonable the gb2 distribution is found to be the most appropriate distribution for the design flood calculation for the qing river basin 4 results of design floods show that the incorrect distribution selected for ffa may lead to higher flood risk for example in qing river basin when the p iii distribution recommended in china is used the 5000 year design flood is 17 697 m3 s actually the 5000 year design flood calculated by gb2 distribution is 26 575 m3 s credit authorship contribution

this manuscript was handled by g syme editor in chief with assistance of jesús mateo lázaro associate editor flood frequency analysis ffa is used for estimating the return period of a design flood fundamental to ffa is the selection of a frequency distribution fitted to the data set where an inappropriate choice of a distribution can lead to significant error and bias in the design flood estimate the usual criteria for selecting a distribution are akaike information criterion aic bayesian information criterion bic and root mean square error rmse although these criteria have limitations this paper performed ffa using three main steps first five generalized distributions were considered as candidate distributions for ffa second the principle of maximum entropy pome and the method of maximum likelihood mle were used for parameter estimation and third a new model selection criterion based on the value of entropy was proposed to choose the best fitted distribution monte carlo simulation was carried out to test this entropy based method for four sample sizes equal to 50 200 1000 and 10000 and simulation was repeated 1000 times for each sample size then the probability

sample size of data set x is small b the skewness coefficient c s 0 and c the shape of pdfs is bell shaped keywords flood frequency analysis generalized distribution entropy theory model selection simulation test 1 introduction floods are among the worst natural disasters causing millions of dollars of damage annually and loss of human lives aziz et al 2016 in china alone more than 3900 people died because of floods during the period from 2011 to 2018 floods cannot be eliminated entirely but flood risk can be reduced the common tool to evaluate flood risk is flood frequency analysis ffa which constitutes the basis of flood mitigation measures including the design of flood control structures st george and mudelsee 2018 by ffa design floods and their return periods are estimated which are also required for flood plain management development and planning controls and flood insurance studies chen et al 2010 2011 fundamental to ffa is the selection of a frequency distribution where an inappropriate choice of a distribution can lead to significant error and bias in design flood estimates particularly for high return periods leading to either under or over estimation with serious implications in practice rahman et al 2013 a multitude of distributions have been employed in ffa for example the pearson type three p3 distribution is recommended in china chen et al 2015 the log pearson type three lpt3 distribution is used in the u s and australia benameur et al 2017 and generalized extreme value gev distribution is usually employed in europe nerc 1975 1999 recently some generalized distributions have been used in ffa chen et al 2017 used the generalized gamma gg and singh and singh 2007 used the generalized beta of second kind gb2 distributions for hydrologic frequency analysis halphen 1941 first proposed the halphen type a hal a distribution in 1941 and to accommodate greater flexibility in the modeling of smaller values in a data set he proposed the halphen type b hal b and halphen type ib hal ib distributions sanov 1958 joshi et al 2016 and chen et al 2018 applied hal a hal b and hal ib distributions to river flows in canada and mississippi respectively joshi et al 2016 chen et al 2018 the advantage of these generalized distributions is that they provide sufficient flexibility to fit a large variety of data sets which facilitates the selection and comparison of different distributions chen and singh 2018 the popular techniques for distribution parameter estimation include the methods of maximum likelihood mle o connor 1975 moments mom bayentin et al 2010 l moments lm glucina et al 1990 and principle of maximum entropy pome singh 2010 gulati and singh 1998 indicated that compared to the mle method when the skewness of data is high such as cs 2 5 the pome yields superior parameter estimates but for low skewness such as cs 0 5 the mle may be the preferred method after parameter estimation the next step is to select the probability distribution the usual selection criteria are akaike information criterion aic bayesian information criterion bic and root mean square error rmse aic tests the significance of differences between the distribution functions gersch et al 1973 wang and liu 2006 showed that when nested models were involved bic was better than aic although aic and bic are widely used in hydrological model selection they have limitations which may lead to unreliable results the aic and bic are respectively expressed as aic 2 ln i 1 n f x x i θ 2 k and bic 2 ln i 1 n f x x i θ k ln n where k is the number of parameters of the model and ln i 1 n f x x i θ denotes the log likelihood function of the probability density function f x x i θ evaluated at the point of maximum likelihood when sample size n is too large aic may lead to the overfitting of the distribution which can lead to the distortion of observed information when sample size n is too small bic may result in under fitting which can result in less than satisfactory determination of the tail characteristics of the distribution as parameter k goes up the penalties increase sharply this may lead aic and bic to choose the distribution whose parameter k is large as a result aic and bic should be used cautiously in conjunction with graphs and other criteria to evaluate the estimates from the chosen distribution in addition entropy theory proposed by shannon in late 1940 can provide an alternative way for model selection until now entropy has been widely used for ffa however entropy is mainly used in the derivation of distributions and parameter estimation based on the principle of maximum entropy singh 1997 for example kapur 1989 derived the pome based distributions for continuous random variates over a finite interval montroll and shlesinger 1983 employed the pome to derive the distributions with long tails jee and ratnaparkhi 1986 investigated the functional relationship between entropy h and variance σ 2 for some well known distributions moreover the parameters of some widely used distributions in hydrology such as gamma pearson type iii log pearson type iii pareto and weibull distributions and certain generalized distributions were estimated using pome method singh 1989 singh and guo 1995a 1995b 1995c chen et al 2017 and chen et al 2018 however little research has been carried out on the selection of distributions using entropy theory thus the objective of this study is therefore to propose a method that uses entropy theory to choose the best fitted distribution and validate the method using monte carlo simulation and data from the qing river basin china 2 methodology the methodology involved the following steps 1 five generalized frequency distributions were selected 2 pome and mle were employed for distribution parameter estimation 3 a new criterion based on the value of entropy was developed to choose the best fitted distribution 4 monte carlo simulation was carried out to evaluate the new method 5 the method was applied to the flood data from the qing river basin in china and design flood values were calculated and compared 2 1 candidate distributions five generalized distributions namely generalized gamma distribution gg generalized beta distribution of second kind gb2 halphen type a distribution hal a halphen type b distribution hal b and halphen type ib distribution hal ib were selected for this study the advantage of these generalized distributions is that they provide sufficient flexibility to fit a large variety of data sets which facilitates the selection and comparison of different distributions chen et al 2017 the traditional method is to try a variety of distributions and choose the best fitted distribution based on a particular mathematical norm such as least square error or maximum likelihood the disadvantage of this method of choosing is that it is tedious because too many different distributions need to be tried and empirical choices of candidate distributions make the results subjective chen et al 2018 the formulas of the generalized distributions are given in appendix a 2 2 parameter estimation the maximum likelihood estimation mle method and the principle of maximum entropy pome were used for parameter estimation considering different values of skewness of data different parameter estimation methods were considered the mle method involves the following steps 1 establishment of the appropriate likelihood function 2 derivation of the function 3 finding the maximum likelihood estimate value and 4 solution of the likelihood function more details can be found in davison and smith 1990 according to chen et al 2017 the pome method involves the following steps 1 specification of constraints 2 maximization of entropy using the method of lagrange multipliers 3 derivation of the relation between lagrange multipliers and constraints 4 derivation of the relation between lagrange multipliers and distribution parameters and 5 derivation of the relation between distribution parameters and constraints central to the pome method is to find the appropriate constraints for the distributions the constraints of the candidate distributions for pome method are discussed below for a continuous variable x the shannon entropy of variable x can be written as 1 h x x 1 x 2 f x ln f x d x where x 1 and x 2 are the lower and upper limits of the integral or the range of variable x the constraints of f x are given by 2 x 1 x 2 f x d x 1 3 x 1 x 2 h i x f x d x m i i 1 2 n where h i x are arbitrary functions of x m i are the expected value of h i x which are calculated based on observed data and n is the number of constraints the constraints h i x should be simple and should express those features of the distribution that are likely to be preserved in the future in addition constraints h i x should also be chosen based on the appropriateness of the resulting distribution given the empirical evidence papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2012 pointed out that the expectation of ln x makes an essential constraint for positively skewed random variables meanwhile the function ln x offers a very robust measure that is more likely to be preserved than the estimated sample moments kapur 1989 koutsoyiannis 2005 thus the function ln x is an appropriate choice as a constraint singh 1998 found that the function x q for small values of q behaves similar to ln x which is also an appropriate choice as a constraint considering that generalized entropy measures have been criticized for lacking theoretical consistency and for being arbitrary papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2012 defined the function ln 1 p x q p as an another constraint when p 0 lim p 0 ln 1 p x q p x q based on the above considerations the following constraints can be taken into accounts for different distributions 4 0 ln x f x x d x e ln x 5 0 x q f x x d x e x q m q 6 1 p 0 ln 1 p x q f x x d x e x p q m p q 7 0 f x d x 1 combining eqs 4 5 and 7 the entropy based probability density function can be written as 8 f x x exp λ 0 λ 1 ln x λ 2 x q after algebraic manipulations and parameter renaming eq 8 can be written as 9 f x x b c γ a b x c a 1 exp x c b eq 9 is the density function of the gg distribution combining eqs 4 6 and 7 the density function can be written as 10 f x x exp λ 0 λ 1 ln x λ 2 ln 1 p x q p after algebraic manipulation and parameter renaming eq 10 can be written as 11 f x c d b a b x d ac 1 1 x d c a b eq 11 is the density function of the gb2 distribution perreault et al 1999 did a series of studies on the halphen family they used the integral representation of the bessel function to derive an expression for the non central moment of order r for the halphen family specific expressions of constraints are given as follows 12a μ ar 0 x r f a x d x m r k υ r 2 α k υ 2 α 12b μ br 0 x r f b x d x m r e f υ r 2 α e f υ α 12c μ ibr 0 x r f ib x d x m r e f υ r 2 α e f υ α where m 0 is a scale parameter α 0 and υ r are the shape parameters k υ is the modified bessel function of the second kind of order υ e f υ is the exponential factorial function and r is the order of the moment for halphen type a distribution perreault et al 1999 pointed out that the sample moments of harmonic geometric and arithmetic means are sufficient statistics for parameters ashkar et al 1988 and kendall et al 1987 had concluded similarly the arithmetic mean is given by eq 13a the harmonic mean is given by eq 13b and the geometric mean is given by eq 13c which are corresponding to the noncentral moment of order r 1 1 and quasi zero 13a e x μ a 1 m k υ 1 2 α k υ 2 α 13b e 1 x μ a 1 1 m k υ 1 2 α k υ 2 α 13c e ln x ln μ a 0 ln m k υ 2 α υ k υ 2 α based on the above discussion we finally chose the following constraints for hal a distribution 14 x 1 x 2 f x d x 1 x 1 x 2 f x ln x d x e ln x x 1 x 2 f x x d x e x x 1 x 2 f x 1 x d x e 1 x based on eq 14 the density function can be written as 15 f x x exp λ 0 λ 1 ln x λ 2 x λ 3 1 x after algebraic manipulation and parameter renaming eq 15 can be written as 16 f x x 1 2 m υ k υ 2 α x υ 1 exp α x m m x eq 16 is the density function of the hal a distribution for halphen type b distribution the sample moments of geometric quadratic and arithmetic sample mean are sufficient statistics for parameters the arithmetic mean is given by eq 17a the quadratic mean is given by eq 17b and the geometric mean is given by eq 17c which are the noncentral moments of order r 1 2 and quasi zero 17a μ b 1 e x m e f υ 1 2 α e f υ α 17b μ

written as 20 f x x 2 c 2 υ e f υ α x 2 υ 1 exp x m 2 α m x eq 20 is the density function of the hal b distribution for halphen type ib distribution morlat 1956 and perreault et al 1999 recognized the relationship between type b and type ib distributions if x follows the halphen type b distribution then the inverse 1 x follows the halphen type ib distribution then we chose the following constraints for the hal ib distribution 21 x 1 x 2 f x d x 1 x 1 x 2 f x ln x d x e ln x x 1 x 2 f x 1 x d x e 1 x x 1 x 2 f x 1 x 2 d x e 1 x 2 based on eq 21 the density function can be written as 22 f x x exp

distribution thus the constraints of the five candidate distributions for pome were obtained now the parameters of each generalized distribution can be estimated and the derived equation sets are given in appendix b the detailed derivation of these equation sets can be found in chen et al 2017 2018 2 3 model selection based on the entropy based method this study proposed the entropy based method as a new criterion for model selection after estimating parameters of the five generalized distributions the shannon entropy value of each distribution was calculated then the distribution with the highest entropy value was selected as the best fitted one the reasons for this model selection criterion are as follows entropy can be justified as a measure of goodness of predictive distributions by a conceptual repeated sampling experiment as described by sanov 1958 according to pome when making inferences based on incomplete information the probability distribution to be drawn must have the maximum entropy permitted by the available information expressed in the form of constraints intuitively the distributions of higher entropy are smoother more uniform and more probable singh 1997 when the number of constraints increases namely more specific information added the entropy value will become smaller which is expressed by eq 24 24 h m x h n x m n where n and m represent the number of constraints the proof is given below for a continuous variable x two probability density functions f x and q x are used to fit the variable x where f x satisfies the first m constraints and q x satisfies the n constraints which include the m constraints namely m n let the entropy of f x and q x be h m x and h n x m n respectively the maximum entropy of distribution f x will be greater than or equal to the maximum entropy of distribution q x namely h m x h n x since more constraints and information are in q x whose entropy and its corresponding uncertainty will be less than that of f x 2 4 simulation testing of the proposed method to validate the proposed method two monte carlo simulation tests were used in this study two parent distributions were chosen from the above distributions and a series of data sets were generated from these parent distributions several candidate distributions were used to fit the data set the proposed method and currently used norms were used to select the best fitted distribution finally the best fitted distribution was compared with the parent distribution to see whether they were the same the procedure for monte carlo simulation is described as follows assume a parent distribution in this study two distributions namely gev and gb2 distributions were chosen as parent distributions respectively different parameter sets were considered for each parent distribution to discuss the effect of shape of pdf and skewness on the model selection results the variable x was randomly generated from the parent distributions using the r software the sample size m of variable x was equal to 50 200 1000 and 10000 respectively seven candidate distributions namely gg gb2 hal a hal b hal ib gev and p iii distributions were used to fit the data sets of x the mle or pome methods were used to estimate the parameters of the seven distributions the criteria of rmse aic bic and the proposed method were used to select the best fitted distribution steps b to e were repeated 1000 times the performance of each criterion was evaluated and the probabilities of identifying the correct distribution based on each criterion were calculated by eq 25 25 p t c n 100 where p is the probability of identifying the correct distribution tc is the number of correctly classified distribution and n is the total number of experiment repeats for test 1 the gev distribution was chosen as a parent distribution four different parameter sets were set which corresponded to four different situations namely cases 1 4 respectively the specific parameters for the four cases are shown in table 1 and their corresponding pdfs and cdfs are shown in fig 1 the data set x with sample size m where m 50 200 1000 and 10000 respectively was generated from these distributions for cases 1 and 2 since c s is small mle was chosen for parameter estimation for cases 3 and 4 since c s is high pome was chosen for parameter estimation seven candidate distributions namely gg gb2 hal a hal b hal ib gev and p iii distributions were used to fit the data sets of x the criteria rmse aic bic and proposed method were employed to select the best fitted distributions for test 2 the gb2 distribution was chosen as a parent distribution when the parameters of gb2 distribution r 2 and b β r 2 1 r 3 the gb2 distribution tended to be the gg distribution chen and singh 2017 based on this theory special parameters were set whose values are shown in table 3 and their corresponding pdfs and cdfs are shown in fig 2 the data set x with m 50 200 1000 and 10 000 was generated from this parent distribution pome was chosen for parameter estimation seven candidate distributions namely gg gb2 hal a hal b hal ib gev and p iii distributions were used to fit the data sets of x the criteria rmse aic bic and the proposed criterion were employed to select the best fitted distributions 3 results and discussions 3 1 results of simulation test for test 1 the selection results of each case are shown in table 2 when the sample size m 50 the corrected probability of both the proposed and aic criteria were more than 70 when m 200 the aic criterion showed the best performance and its corrected probability was 83 5 and when m 1000 and m 10000 both the proposed and bic criteria performed better the corrected probabilities of which were more than 80 thus when the sample size of data set was small both the proposed method and aic criterion were a good choice for model selection when the sample size of data set was medium the aic criterion performed the best and when the sample size of the data set was large both the proposed and aic criteria were better choices when c s 0 the aic method performed the best but the performances of the proposed and bic criteria were mediocre when c s 0 the corrected probabilities of all criteria went down by 10 compared to other cases and when c s 0 the corrected probability of the proposed criteria was the highest which was 90 4 when the shape of pdfs was bell shaped all the criteria showed good performances and when the shape was j shaped the corrected probabilities of all the criteria were low for test 2 the selection results are shown in table 4 when m 50 the proposed method showed the highest accuracy when m 200 the aic criterion performed the best when m 1000 and m 10000 both the proposed method and bic criteria performed well but the aic criterion performed badly as m went up the aic method did not perform well whereas the proposed method and bic criterion showed a better performance as discussed above the parameters of the gb2 parent distribution were set to a special value which made the gb2 distribution similar to the gg distribution thus it was difficult for all criteria to choose the correct distribution and made the accuracy of all criteria decline to further explore how often the proposed method agreed with other criteria case 1 with m 10 000 was taken as an example in this case the proposed method missed on 131 samples while aic bic and rmse missed on 456 186 and 201 samples respectively for aic criterion there were 127 missing samples that were the same with the proposed method accounting for 97 for bic criterion there were 122 identical missing samples which accounted for 93 for rmse 113 of 201 samples were the same with the proposed method and the consistency was 86 thus the proposed method displayed in a similar way with aic and bic criteria from the above discussion on model selection when the sample size m was small the proposed method performed better than other criteria and when m was high the proposed method had a good performance as sample size increased the probability that the proposed method identified the correct distribution increased when c s 0 the probability that the proposed method identified the correct distribution was high when c s 0 the probability was mediocre and when c s 0 the proposed method performed not so well since most of the hydrological data presented positive skewness the proposed method showed an obvious practical applicability when the pdfs were bell shaped the proposed method performed well and when the shape was j the probability of identifying the correct distribution based on proposed method was low in fact most of the pdfs of hydrometeorology data were bell shaped in summary the proposed method can be a good criterion for model selection 3 2 results of case study 3 2 1 data the qing river basin was selected as a case study this river is the first tributary of the yangtze river which originates from qiyue mountain in enshi city hubei province and flows through seven counties and cities qing river is 423 km long with a basin area of 167 700 square kilometers the annual maximum am sampling method was used here and 53 years flood series were obtained for ffa 3 2 2 parameter estimation the five generalized distributions and p iii distribution were used to fit the data set the pome method was used to estimate the parameters of these distributions and the estimated parameter values are given in table 5 the fitting histograms of these distributions are shown in fig 3 which shows that the results of fitting of these distributions are close to each other it is difficult to select the best fitted distribution from the visual graphs and the quantitative selection criteria are therefore needed 3 2 3 model selection according to fig 3 the pdfs of six candidate distributions are bell shaped and all distributions were positively skewed it is coincident with case 3 with m 50 in test 1 in this case the proposed criterion showed the best performance thus the proposed criterion was chosen as the preferred method for case study and other criteria were also employed for comparison 3 2 4 model selection results for the entropy based method for model selection the entropy value of each distribution was calculated based on eq 1 the distribution with the highest entropy was selected as the best one and results are given in table 6 according to table 6 the entropy value of the gb2 distribution was the highest thus it was chosen as the best fitted distribution for other traditional selection methods rmse aic and bic were calculated using the above formulas and results are shown in table 6 the distribution with the lowest value was selected as the best fitted distribution according to table 6 the value of gb2 distribution was the lowest thus it was chosen as the best fitted distribution based on the results of model selection for the qing river basin the gb2 distribution was the best fitted one in addition as the preferred method the proposed criterion successfully selected the optimal distribution in the case study although all the methods had the ability to select the best fitted distribution according to the simulation test for this special case the accuracy of the proposed criterion was better 3 2 5 calculation of design flood for the qing river basin the t year design flood was calculated using the six distributions as shown in table 7 since the gb2 was selected as the most appropriate distribution the 50 year 100 year 500 year 1000 year and 5000 year design floods were calculated by the gb2 distribution their corresponding values were 11 022 m3 s 12 631 m3 s 17 189 m3 s 19 607 m3 s and 26 575 m3 s respectively it is seen from table 7 that when different distributions were used for calculating the design flood the results were very different for example when the p iii distribution recommended in china was used the 5000 year design flood was 17 697 m3 s actually the 5000 year design flood calculated by gb2 distribution was 26 575 m3 s the flood frequency curves of these distributions and q q plot are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively from these figures the design values for large return periods of gb2 distribution were closer to the observed values and they were significantly less for the p iii distribution than the observed flood therefore the p iii distribution underestimated the design flood values causing greater flood risk 4 conclusions the paper used five generalized distributions gg gb2 hal a hal b and hal ib for ffa and the pome and mle methods were used for parameter estimation a new model selection criterion based on maximum entropy was developed to choose the best fitted distribution monte carlo simulation was carried out to evaluate this new method for four sample sizes equal to 50 200 1000 and 10 000 each simulation experiment was repeated 1000 times the probability that a given method identified the correct distribution was determined the probabilities affected by the sample sizes skewness and shapes of pdf were assessed the qing river basin china was selected as a case study the main conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows 1 monte carlo simulation results show that both mle and pome are good methods for parameter estimation and the proposed method can be a good criterion for model selection 2 simulation tests show that when the data set conform to the following characteristics respectively the proposed method is better than other methods a the sample size of data set x is small b the skewness coefficient c s 0 and c the pdf is bell shaped in other cases the proposed method also performs not bad 3 results of the case study show that the five generalized distributions are suitable for ffa the parameter estimation method based on pome is reasonable the gb2 distribution is found to be the most appropriate distribution for the design flood calculation for the qing river basin 4 results of design floods show that the incorrect distribution selected for ffa may lead to higher flood risk for example in qing river basin when the p iii distribution recommended in china is used the 5000 year design flood is 17 697 m3 s actually the 5000 year design flood calculated by gb2 distribution is 26 575 m3 s credit authorship contribution

4757,determining the soil moisture content smc distribution is indispensable for field management especially in arid and semiarid regions effective parameters can contribute to the optimization of smc models for accurate smc prediction therefore in this study the relationships between the smc and multifractal parameters d2 dv ds av and fv denote the correlation dimension property of small probability and large probability spectrum width and symmetry of spectrum shape respectively of the soil particle size distribution psd were explored in the hilly loess region of china a grid method was adopted 20 m 20 m total 384 points to sample the smc in the 0 40 cm and 40 80 cm soil layers on the second eighth and twelfth days after the first rainfall which were defined as the early sampling es medium sampling ms and late sampling ls respectively we found that the variation in the smc explained by the multifractal parameters increased as smc decreased where they accounted for 40 07 and 75 75 of the smc in the 0 40 cm and 40 80 cm soil layers in ls respectively the variation in the smc in the 0 40 cm explained by the multifractal parameters was lower than that in the 40 80 cm soil layer in all sampling stages the equations fitted for the whole soil layer were significant in all sampling stages p 0 01 av 31 95 and dv 13 59 had negative correlations with smc and their relative importance values with respect to smc were high in all sampling stages p 0 05 smc at higher values had a positive correlation with fv whereas smc at lower values had a significant positive correlation with d2 and negative correlation with ds and these two parameters in the ms and ls stages explained more than 75 of the variation in the smc in the 40 80 cm soil layer these results suggest that the characteristics of the soil psd can be described in detail by the multifractal parameters which can directly reflect the smc thus we conclude that smc is closely related to the multifractal parameters of the psd av dv ds d2 and fv and it can be applied to optimize smc models keywords multifractal parameter particle size distribution soil moisture content 1 introduction soil moisture is a key variable in hydrology and meteorology fu et al 2003 zhu and lin 2011 and it plays an important role in the allocation of surface evaporation runoff sensible heat and latent heat pachepsky et al 2003 liao et al 2017 in addition soil moisture is also an important factor for crop growth yuan et al 2019 vegetation restoration jian et al 2015 and soil erosion famiglietti et al 1998 therefore determining the variability in the soil moisture content smc across spatiotemporal scales can improve the understanding of land surface processes liao et al 2017 smc simulation and prediction have been investigated extensively using different methods brandhorst et al 2017 chatterjee et al 2018 jalilvand et al 2019 xu et al 2013 in particular based on an optimized neural network chatterjee et al 2018 showed that their model was highly reliable under changing weather conditions in the short term but it had limitations in the medium term and long term zhu et al 2012 constructed a dynamic two zone smc model in the variable root area with high simulation accuracy however the parameters required could not be measured and calculated in a convenient manner due to their spatial variability jalilvand et al 2019 showed that low resolution remote sensing had difficulty capturing the smc in farmland where unreliable rainfall and evapotranspiration data could also lead to overestimates or underestimates of farmland irrigation in summary the existing smc models need to be continuously optimized to improve the prediction accuracy smc is restricted by many factors such as the soil texture soil aggregates and capillary pores brandhorst et al 2017 ogen et al 2019 moreover when the smc differs the effect of each associated factor on the smc is also different chu et al 2015 showed that the relationships between the smc and these factors or relevant parameters were complex and nonlinear due to the interactions of various factors therefore the smc was affected by many factors and it was difficult to select appropriate parameters and thus diverse prediction results were obtained from model simulations chu et al 2015 di fusco et al 2018 and yang et al 2016 showed that different soil textures can have significant effects on the smc yang et al 2016 showed that the smc increased as the clay and silt contents increased but it decreased as the sand content increased in addition the soil particle size distribution psd can affect the smc in terms of its retention and movement chamizo et al 2013 pollacco et al 2020 showed that the soil water retention curve was successfully simulated by a novel physical conceptual intergranular mixing soil psd model mean nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of 0 92 this model accounts for the fact that all soil pores are not perfectly spherical by considering the intergranular rearrangement mixing of particles and it can address the absence of psd data for sizes smaller than the clay fraction in addition the soil type i e sand loam and clay can have significant effects on the smc where gao and wu 2012 determined the order of the smc retention capacity in different soil types as clay loam sandy loam based on these results we hypothesize that the smc could be reflected by the soil psd it is essential to determine the distribution of the soil psd because of the spatial variability in the smc distribution according to the psd range soil particles are divided into sand silt and clay but many standards are available and their scales differ greatly barman and choudhury 2019 bormann 2010 the soil psd also has a wide range e g the silt range for sandy loam is 0 45 in the soil texture triangle and it cannot fully reflect the soil psd de et al 2008 fractal geometry is a useful tool for quantifying complex natural phenomena and it has been used widely for assessing the soil psd wang et al 2018a showed that compared with employing single fractal or geostatistical methods for assessing mine soil textures more features e g psd range concentration dispersion inhomogeneity and symmetry could be quantified in terms of the spatial variation in the soil psd by using multifractal parameters paterson et al 2018 employed australian national soil survey centre data to show that the hausdorff besicovitch dimension remained relatively stable over a range of about 100 km where the spatial variations in the soil properties were highly random at a fine scale of 3 8 km to 0 001 km but they gradually changed with the scale and range thus multifractal theory may be suitable for characterizing the soil texture martı et al 2002 previous studies identified significant correlations between the soil psd fractal parameters and the sand silt and clay contents de et al 2008 showed that the entropy dimension d1 and the entropy dimension capacity d1 d0 ratio were positively correlated with the silt and clay contents correlation coefficients ranging from 0 66 to 0 92 p 0 01 as well as having significant negative correlations with the sand content correlation coefficients ranging from 0 7 to 0 94 p 0 01 in different land use types on the loess plateau in china which agreed with the results obtained by qi et al 2018 in the funiu mountain region of china wang et al 2015 examined the relationships between the multifractal parameters of the soil psd and field capacity in mining areas and found that the field capacity was negatively correlated with av and positively correlated with fv p 0 05 these findings suggest that the smc is closely related to the multifractal parameters of the soil psd smc varies in space and time whereas the soil psd is constant over the long term thus the relationship between smc and the soil psd may differ at various smc levels however previous studies did not fully elucidate the relationship between soil psd and smc therefore in the present study we collected soil samples at different times after rainfall to explore the relationships between the smc and the multifractal parameters of the soil psd to confirm whether these parameters can be applied to optimize smc models in the future therefore the aims of this study were 1 to explore the relationship between the soil psd and smc at different times after rainfall and 2 to assess the mechanism associated with the effect of the soil psd on smc 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experimental site was

cm layers respectively according to the international standard for soil texture classification the experimental site was planted with matrimony vine lycium barbarum l 2 2 meteorological data and sample measurement meteorological data including the hourly temperature relative humidity precipitation atmospheric pressure 2 m wind speed on the ground and solar radiation were monitored by an automatic meteorological station frt x06a fuotong technology beijing co ltd china installed at the experimental field site a period between two natural rainfall events was selected during 2018 with total precipitation of 14 6 mm on july 15 and 16 and 8 8 mm on july 31 fig 2 total precipitation of 72 mm occurred from 5 to 10 july the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 was calculated using the penman monteith method fao 56 allen et al 1998 the precipitation and daily et0 data are shown in fig 2 three samples were collected to determine the smc on the second eighth and twelfth days after the first rainfall event which were defined as the early sampling es medium sampling ms and late sampling ls respectively the grid method was adopted 20 m 20 m n 64 fig 3 the sampling depth was 80 cm and each layer was treated as measuring 40 cm trimble geoxt gps equipment sunnyvale california usa with a positioning precision of 0 5 m was used to locate the sampling center point coordinates soil was sampled from each grid according to the five point sampling method with a soil auger diameter of 4 cm with a retractable extended drill stem and the five samples were mixed uniformly fig 3 one soil sample was placed in an aluminum box and used to measure the smc the soil samples were dried in an oven until constant weight at 105 c for 8 h to determine the smc bao 2005 one soil sample was placed in a plastic bag and used to measure the soil psd to determine the soil psd air dried soil samples were passed through a 2 mm screen to remove any roots before adding 10 h2o2 solution to degrade any organic matter and 0 3 g of the soil was employed for laser diffraction analysis mastersizer 2000 malvern company uk 2 3 calculation of multifractal parameters a particle size interval comprising μm i 0 2 1000 was considered in this study the size interval was partitioned into 64 subintervals i i φi φi 1 i 1 2 65 the lengths of these subintervals follow a logarithmic scale such that lg φ i 1 φ i is constant i e the first subinterval is i 1 0 2 0 228 and the last subinterval is i 64 875 394 1000 after dividing i into 64 subintervals i i a dimensionless interval j 0 3 699 is obtained with 64 equidistant subintervals ji ji j1 j2 j64 0 0 058 0 058 0 116 3 641 3 699 ji was constructed by the logarithmic transformation in eq 1 1 φ j lg φ j φ 1 j 1 2 65 where φj is the particle size measured by the laser particle size analyzer μm φ1 0 2 μm and φj is the dimensionless value of the equal interval based on the soil particle size interval in the interval j we considered n ε 2 k subintervals of equal size ε 3 699 2 k for k ranging from 1 to 6 where n ε is the number of subintervals and ε is the step length p i ε is defined as the probability of finding soil particles of a certain mass within particle size interval j i montero 2005 qi et al 2018 wang et al 2018b the generalized fractal dimension dq is defined as follows 2 d q lim ε 0 1 q 1 lg i 1 n ε p i ε q lg ε q 1 3 d 1 l i m ε 0 i 1 n ε p i ε l g p i ε l g ε q 1 where q are integers in i e the probability density weight index li et al 2011 the values of dq for the soil psd in different soil layers were obtained by fitting eqs 2 and 3 using the least squares method chhabra et al 1989 when q 0 1 and 2 d0 d1 and d2 are the capacity dimension information dimension and correlation dimension respectively wang et al 2015 the most heterogeneous case gives d0 1 whereas d0 0 indicates the richest soil textural structure in addition a d1 value close to 1 indicates the evenness of measures over the set of cell sizes whereas a d1 value close to 0 shows that the irregularities are concentrated in a subset of the scale the correlation dimension d2 reflects the dispersion of the psd measurement in the local region where a greater value of d2 indicates a smaller difference in the psd measurement distributed in different local regions and the soil psd is more homogeneous when the dispersion is larger wang et al 2018a when q 0 dv

performance of the model where it comprises a combination of many predictor trees and each tree is generated from a random vector cutler and stevens 2006 breiman 2001 rf can rank the relative importance of predictor variables based on the regression s out of bag error predictions taghizadeh mehrjardi et al 2016 we determined the important multifractal parameters for smc rf was implemented using the package in r r development core team 2017 2 5 statistical analysis the values calculated for the smc and multifractal parameters of the soil psd i e d0 d1 d2 av fv ds and dv were analyzed using classical statistical methods we used the spss 23 0 software package spss chicago usa to determine the mean standard deviation coefficient of variation multifactor linear regression between smc and multifractal parameters and pearson s correlation coefficients as well as for conducting kolmogorov smirnov tests and least significant difference lsd tests at p 0 05 graphs were prepared with origin pro 8 0 electronic arts inc usa 3 results 3 1 variations in smc the smc values at different sampling stages in the 0 40 cm and 40 80 cm soil layers are shown in fig 4 smc was 25 30 g g 1 17 10 g g 1 and 12 08 g g 1 in es ms and ls in the 0 40 cm soil layer respectively the smc values were 24 56 g g 1 16 50 g g 1 and 14 92 g g 1 in es ms and ls respectively in the 40 80 cm soil layer over time in the whole soil layer smc decreased significantly by 32 62 and 45 87 in ms and ls respectively compared with es p 0 05 over time the standard deviation of smc increased gradually in the whole soil layer thereby indicating that the variability of smc increased smc in es was significantly higher in the 0 40 cm soil layer than the 40 80 cm soil layer whereas the opposite was found in ls p 0 05 smc in ms did not differ significantly between the 0 40 cm and 40 80 cm soil layers 3 2 soil psd meneveau et al 1990 observed that the linear relationship between μi q ε lg μi q ε and lg ε can be used as a key index to assess the presence of multifractal characteristics at the study scale where the slope of the straight line is f α q if this linear relationship is satisfied multifractal analysis should be applied and vice versa as shown in fig 5 the slope of the straight line corresponding to the different q values varied and r2 was more than 0 9 thereby indicating that the soil psd had multifractal characteristics the multifractal parameters of the psd in different soil layers are shown in table 1 we found that all of the multifractal parameters dv ds d0 d1 d2 and av in the 0 40 cm layer differed significantly from those in the 40 80 cm layer p 0 05 in contrast to ds dv was significantly higher in the 0 40 cm layer than the 40 80 cm layer thereby indicating that soil psd in the 0 40 cm soil layer had a more complicated fractal structure and it was more inhomogeneous in the large probability estimation regions d0 d1 d2 and av were significantly lower in the 0 40 cm soil layer than the 40 80 cm layer p 0 05 thereby indicating that the deeper soil layer had a wider psd range more particle groups and higher local and overall variability at each point the fv values in the whole soil layers were greater than 0 and they did not differ significantly thereby indicating that a large probability subset was dominant in the soil psd 3 3 relationships between smc and soil psd 3 3 1 correlation coefficients between smc and multifractal parameters of soil psd the correlation coefficients between the multifractal parameters and smc in different soil layers and sampling stages are shown in fig 6 the smc in the same soil layer was significantly correlated in different sampling stages which indicates that the smc had close relationships with the multifractal parameters of the soil psd smc in the 40 80 cm soil layer under es as well as in the 0 40 cm soil layer under ms and ls were significantly negatively correlated with av p 0 01 which indicates that av was more sensitive to the smc level smc in the 40 80 cm soil layer under es and ms were significantly negatively correlated with fv p 0 05 which indicates that the surface soil was more affected by external factors and thus fv was more sensitive to the soil depth dv was also affected by the smc level and soil depth where it had significant negative correlations with smc in the 40 80 cm layer under es and ms as well as in the whole soil layer under ls p 0 05 therefore the correlations between the multifractal parameters and smc varied under different sampling stages in the different soil layers 3 3 2 rf analysis between smc and multifractal parameters of soil psd rf was used in order to estimate the different effects of each multifractal parameter of the psd on the smc in the 0 40 cm and 40 80 cm soil layers and the results are shown in fig 7 a c in es the multifractal parameters that differed significantly in terms of their relative importance value incmse increase in mean squared error with respect to the smc were av 14 00 and fv 9 16 in the 0 40 cm soil layer and av 25 45 and dv 10 40 in the 40 80 cm soil layer p 0 05 in ms the multifractal parameters that differed significantly in terms of their relative importance value with respect to the smc were av 24 29 and dv 21 08 in the 0 40 cm soil layer and av 49 00 dv 13 51 and d2 12 88 in the 40 80 cm soil layer p 0 05 in ls the multifractal parameters that differed significantly in terms of their relative importance value with respect to the smc were av 32 90 and dv 15 37 in the 0 40 cm soil layer and av 46 07 dv 16 90 d2 14 58 and ds 12 23 in the 40 80 cm soil layer p 0 05 over time the multifractal parameters explained 7 9 36 6 and 40 07 of the variation in smc in es ms and ls in the 0 40 cm soil layer respectively and 29 63 79 98 and 75 75 in the 40 80 cm soil layer table 2 3 3 3 equations based on smc and multifractal parameters of soil psd the empirical regression equations between the smc and multifractal parameters of soil psd are shown in table 3 the empirical regression equations were all significant at all sampling stages in the different soil layers p 0 01 the r2 values for the 0 40 cm soil layer followed the order of ls 0 47 ms 0 30 es 0 16 the r2 values for the 40 80 cm soil layer were over 0 90 in ms and ls we found negative correlations between smc with av dv and ds but positive correlations between smc with fv and d2 the r2 values increased as the number of multifractal parameters of the soil psd increased 4 discussion in our study the soil psd differed between the different soil layers where the soil psd in the 0 40 cm layer had a finer fractal structure and it was more inhomogeneous in the large probability estimation regions whereas the soil psd in the 40 80 cm soil layer had a wider range with more particle groups and higher local and overall variability table 2 de et al 2008 obtained similar results for different land use types in addition it has been shown that the soil psd is constant over a long time period in each soil layer martı et al 2002 mohammadi et al 2019 montero 2005 previous studies have shown that soil psd had close relationships with the soil organic matter aggregates and pores wang et al 2015 in the absence of human interference the distribution and contents of the soil properties will remain relatively stable and they can directly or indirectly affect the smc distribution therefore the soil psd has a relatively stable effect on smc multifractal parameters can directly or indirectly capture the details of the soil properties multifractal parameters can directly describe the detailed distribution concentration local variability overall variability degree of symmetry and heterogeneity of the soil psd zeleke and si 2006 wang et al 2019 previous studies identified significant correlations between the multifractal parameters and the sand silt and clay contents de et al 2008 qi et al 2018 different proportions of sand silt and clay directly affect the soil pore types and distribution smc is mainly determined by the abundance of capillary pores jian et al 2015 liao et al 2017 in addition multifractal parameters can indirectly reflect other soil properties that greatly influence the distribution and average smc wang et al 2015 showed that d1 and av increased whereas fv decreased as soil bulk density organic matter total nitrogen and soil electrical conductivity increased as the ph and field water capacity decreased we found that av and dv had the most significant impacts on the smc in the whole soil layer in most sampling stages table 3 a lower av value indicates the lower heterogeneity of the whole fractal structure and a higher smc implies that greater heterogeneity enhances the smc retention capacity a higher dv value indicates the complexity or fineness characteristics of the psd fractal structure by contrast a psd fractal structure with roughness characteristics contributes to the conservation of smc the multifractal parameters used to describe the differences in the soil psd could directly reflect the smc in different sampling stages fig 7 and table 3 however the amounts of the variation in the smc explained by the multifractal parameters were affected by the smc level and soil layer depth we found that the variation in the smc was explained better by the multifractal parameters when smc was lower table 2 which may be explained as follows smc was mainly affected by the soil texture organic matter and aggregates after the loss of water as rainfall via gravity a relatively high smc was greatly affected by the soil organic matter and aggregates with a relatively low smc the effects of soil organic matter and aggregates on water retention decreased gradually and thus the smc was mainly controlled by the soil psd yang et al 2016 so the variation in the smc was explained by the increases in the multifractal parameters the multifractal parameters in the 0 40 cm soil layer explained less of the variation in the smc than those in the 40 80 cm soil layer at all sampling stages table 2 these results may be explained as follows 1 in contrast to the 40 80 cm soil layer the 0 40 cm soil layer was subjected to plowing and it had higher soil organic matter and aggregate contents and a greater underground biomass dou et al 2020 eapen et al 2017 jiang et al 2013 peng et al 2020 2 according to previous studies 80 of the root system of vegetation is mainly in 0 40 cm soil layer eapen et al 2017 gao et al 2014 ren et al 2018 wang et al 2018c and thus the consumption of smc by roots affects the distribution of smc 3 the smc in the 0 40 cm soil layer may have been affected more by the vegetation coverage and field management jian et al 2015 showed that vegetation coverage directly affects smc by affecting canopy interception in addition dong et al 2018 and tan et al 2017 showed that different agricultural techniques significantly affect smc by reducing water evaporation these results suggest that the variation in smc can be explained well by multifractal parameters and they can be used to optimize and improve the predictive accuracy of smc models our results are transferrable to many locations the multifractal parameters were significantly correlated with smc in the range from 14 92 to 25 30 g g 1 after rainfall table 3 and fig 4 which suggests that these results may be applicable to most conditions and regions in addition as the average smc decreased the correlations became much stronger between the multifractal parameters and smc table 3 thereby indicating that these results were more suitable for drier conditions however our results cannot be applied to areas with high smc such as marshland where the large amount of water has only a slight effect on the soil texture in addition these results cannot be applied to freezing thawing areas because the smc has a solid status in the capillary pores or macropores for most of the time in addition sun et al 2015 showed that the freezing thawing process can change the soil texture and affect the smc distribution 5 conclusion in this study we explored the relationships between the smc and multifractal parameters of the soil psd in the 0 40 cm and 40 80 cm soil layers at different sampling stages after rainfall in the hilly loess region of china the multifractal parameters used to describe the differences in the soil psd in multiple dimensions can directly reflect the smc and they are transferrable to many locations the explanation of the variation in the smc by the multifractal parameters increased as the smc value decreased the smc in the 0 40 cm soil layer was readily affected by external factors and thus the multifractal parameters could explain relatively less of the variation in the smc compared with those in the 40 80 cm soil layer the existing smc models also have many limitations such as the climate and region which affect the values of the parameters in our study the equations fitted between the multifractal parameters and smc for the whole soil layer were significant in all sampling stages thus smc was closely related to the multifractal parameters av dv ds d2 and fv and they could be applied to optimize smc models in future research the multifractal parameters of the psd should be introduced into smc models to verify the accuracy of the predictions credit authorship contribution statement zengming ke writing original draft lihui ma feng jiao conceptualization methodology xiaoli liu investigation zheng liu data

4757,determining the soil moisture content smc distribution is indispensable for field management especially in arid and semiarid regions effective parameters can contribute to the optimization of smc models for accurate smc prediction therefore in this study the relationships between the smc and multifractal parameters d2 dv ds av and fv denote the correlation dimension property of small probability and large probability spectrum width and symmetry of spectrum shape respectively of the soil particle size distribution psd were explored in the hilly loess region of china a grid method was adopted 20 m 20 m total 384 points to sample the smc in the 0 40 cm and 40 80 cm soil layers on the second eighth and twelfth days after the first rainfall which were defined as the early sampling es medium sampling ms and late sampling ls respectively we found that the variation in the smc explained by the multifractal parameters increased as smc decreased where they accounted for 40 07 and 75 75 of the smc in the 0 40 cm and 40 80 cm soil layers in ls respectively the variation in the smc in the 0 40 cm explained by the multifractal parameters was lower than that in the 40 80 cm soil layer in all sampling stages the equations fitted for the whole soil layer were significant in all sampling stages p 0 01 av 31 95 and dv 13 59 had negative correlations with smc and their relative importance values with respect to smc were high in all sampling stages p 0 05 smc at higher values had a positive correlation with fv whereas smc at lower values had a significant positive correlation with d2 and negative correlation with ds and these two parameters in the ms and ls stages explained more than 75 of the variation in the smc in the 40 80 cm soil layer these results suggest that the characteristics of the soil psd can be described in detail by the multifractal parameters which can directly reflect the smc thus we conclude that smc is closely related to the multifractal parameters of the psd av dv ds d2 and fv and it can be applied to optimize smc models keywords multifractal parameter particle size distribution soil moisture content 1 introduction soil moisture is a key variable in hydrology and meteorology fu et al 2003 zhu and lin 2011 and it plays an important role in the allocation of surface evaporation runoff sensible heat and latent heat pachepsky et al 2003 liao et al 2017 in addition soil moisture is also an important factor for crop growth yuan et al 2019 vegetation restoration jian et al 2015 and soil erosion famiglietti et al 1998 therefore determining the variability in the soil moisture content smc across spatiotemporal scales can improve the understanding of land surface processes liao et al 2017 smc simulation and prediction have been investigated extensively using different methods brandhorst et al 2017 chatterjee et al 2018 jalilvand et al 2019 xu et al 2013 in particular based on an optimized neural network chatterjee et al 2018 showed that their model was highly reliable under changing weather conditions in the short term but it had limitations in the medium term and long term zhu et al 2012 constructed a dynamic two zone smc model in the variable root area with high simulation accuracy however the parameters required could not be measured and calculated in a convenient manner due to their spatial variability jalilvand et al 2019 showed that low resolution remote sensing had difficulty capturing the smc in farmland where unreliable rainfall and evapotranspiration data could also lead to overestimates or underestimates of farmland irrigation in summary the existing smc models need to be continuously optimized to improve the prediction accuracy smc is restricted by many factors such as the soil texture soil aggregates and capillary pores brandhorst et al 2017 ogen et al 2019 moreover when the smc differs the effect of each associated factor on the smc is also different chu et al 2015 showed that the relationships between the smc and these factors or relevant parameters were complex and nonlinear due to the interactions of various factors therefore the smc was affected by many factors and it was difficult to select appropriate parameters and thus diverse prediction results were obtained from model simulations chu et al 2015 di fusco et al 2018 and yang et al 2016 showed that different soil textures can have significant effects on the smc yang et al 2016 showed that the smc increased as the clay and silt contents increased but it decreased as the sand content increased in addition the soil particle size distribution psd can affect the smc in terms of its retention and movement chamizo et al 2013 pollacco et al 2020 showed that the soil water retention curve was successfully simulated by a novel physical conceptual intergranular mixing soil psd model mean nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of 0 92 this model accounts for the fact that all soil pores are not perfectly spherical by considering the intergranular rearrangement mixing of particles and it can address the absence of psd data for sizes smaller than the clay fraction in addition the soil type i e sand loam and clay can have significant effects on the smc where gao and wu 2012 determined the order of the smc retention capacity in different soil types as clay loam sandy loam based on these results we hypothesize that the smc could be reflected by the soil psd it is essential to determine the distribution of the soil psd because of the spatial variability in the smc distribution according to the psd range soil particles are divided into sand silt and clay but many standards are available and their scales differ greatly barman and choudhury 2019 bormann 2010 the soil psd also has a wide range e g the silt range for sandy loam is 0 45 in the soil texture triangle and it cannot fully reflect the soil psd de et al 2008 fractal geometry is a useful tool for quantifying complex natural phenomena and it has been used widely for assessing the soil psd wang et al 2018a showed that compared with employing single fractal or geostatistical methods for assessing mine soil textures more features e g psd range concentration dispersion inhomogeneity and symmetry could be quantified in terms of the spatial variation in the soil psd by using multifractal parameters paterson et al 2018 employed australian national soil survey centre data to show that the hausdorff besicovitch dimension remained relatively stable over a range of about 100 km where the spatial variations in the soil properties were highly random at a fine scale of 3 8 km to 0 001 km but they gradually changed with the scale and range thus multifractal theory may be suitable for characterizing the soil texture martı et al 2002 previous studies identified significant correlations between the soil psd fractal parameters and the sand silt and clay contents de et al 2008 showed that the entropy dimension d1 and the entropy dimension capacity d1 d0 ratio were positively correlated with the silt and clay contents correlation coefficients ranging from 0 66 to 0 92 p 0 01 as well as having significant negative correlations with the sand content correlation coefficients ranging from 0 7 to 0 94 p 0 01 in different land use types on the loess plateau in china which agreed with the results obtained by qi et al 2018 in the funiu mountain region of china wang et al 2015 examined the relationships between the multifractal parameters of the soil psd and field capacity in mining areas and found that the field capacity was negatively correlated with av and positively correlated with fv p 0 05 these findings suggest that the smc is closely related to the multifractal parameters of the soil psd smc varies in space and time whereas the soil psd is constant over the long term thus the relationship between smc and the soil psd may differ at various smc levels however previous studies did not fully elucidate the relationship between soil psd and smc therefore in the present study we collected soil samples at different times after rainfall to explore the relationships between the smc and the multifractal parameters of the soil psd to confirm whether these parameters can be applied to optimize smc models in the future therefore the aims of this study were 1 to explore the relationship between the soil psd and smc at different times after rainfall and 2 to assess the mechanism associated with the effect of the soil psd on smc 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experimental site was

penman monteith method fao 56 allen et al 1998 the precipitation and daily et0 data are shown in fig 2 three samples were collected to determine the smc on the second eighth and twelfth days after the

each layer was treated as measuring 40 cm trimble geoxt gps equipment sunnyvale california usa with a positioning precision of 0 5 m was used to locate the sampling center point coordinates soil was sampled from each grid according to the five point sampling method with a soil auger diameter of 4 cm with a retractable extended drill stem and the five samples were mixed uniformly fig 3 one soil sample was placed in an aluminum box and used to measure the smc the soil samples were dried in an oven until constant weight at 105 c for 8 h to determine the smc bao 2005 one soil sample was placed in a plastic bag and used to measure the soil psd to determine the soil psd air dried soil samples were passed through a 2 mm screen to remove any roots before adding 10 h2o2 solution to degrade any organic matter and 0 3 g of the soil was employed for laser diffraction analysis mastersizer 2000 malvern company uk 2 3 calculation of multifractal parameters a particle size interval comprising μm i

by the laser particle size analyzer μm φ1 0 2 μm and φj is the dimensionless value of the equal interval based on the soil particle size interval in the interval j we considered n ε 2 k subintervals of equal size ε 3 699 2 k for k ranging from 1 to 6 where n ε is the number of subintervals and ε is the step length p i ε is defined as the probability of finding soil particles of a certain mass within particle size interval j i montero 2005 qi et al 2018 wang et al 2018b the generalized fractal dimension dq is defined as follows 2 d q lim ε 0 1 q 1 lg i 1 n ε p i ε q lg ε q 1 3 d 1 l i m ε 0 i 1 n ε p i ε l g p i ε l g ε q 1 where q are integers in i e the probability density weight index li et al 2011 the values of dq for the soil psd in different soil layers were obtained by fitting eqs 2 and 3 using the least squares method chhabra et al 1989 when q 0 1 and 2 d0 d1 and d2 are the capacity dimension information dimension and correlation dimension respectively wang et al 2015 the most heterogeneous case gives d0 1 whereas d0 0 indicates the richest soil textural structure in addition a d1 value close to 1 indicates the evenness of measures over the set of cell sizes whereas a d1 value close to 0 shows that the irregularities are concentrated in a subset of the scale the correlation dimension d2 reflects the dispersion of the psd measurement in the local region where a greater value of d2 indicates a smaller difference in the psd measurement distributed in different local regions and the soil psd is more homogeneous when the dispersion is larger wang et al 2018a when q 0 dv d 10 d0 denotes the property of a small probability estimation region qi et al 2018 when q 0 ds d0 d10 denotes the large probability estimation regions which reflects the complexity or fineness

fv 0 shows that a subset is dominant with a small probability and f α q has a form similar to a hook to the right by contrast fv 0 denotes that a subset is dominant with a large probability and f α q has a form similar to a hook to the left 2 4 random forest rf rf is a nonparametric method developed as an extension of the classification and regression trees program to improve the predictive

g g 1 and 12 08 g g 1 in es ms and ls in the 0 40 cm soil layer respectively the smc values were 24 56 g g 1 16 50 g g 1 and 14 92 g g 1 in es ms and ls respectively in the 40 80 cm soil layer over time in the whole soil layer smc decreased significantly by 32 62 and 45 87 in ms and ls respectively compared with es p 0 05 over time the standard deviation of smc increased gradually in the whole soil layer thereby indicating that the variability of smc increased smc in es was significantly higher in the 0 40 cm soil layer than the 40 80 cm soil layer whereas the opposite was found in ls p 0 05 smc in ms did not differ significantly between the 0 40 cm and 40 80 cm soil layers 3 2 soil psd meneveau et al 1990 observed that the linear relationship between μi q ε lg μi q ε and lg ε can be used as a key index to assess the presence of multifractal characteristics at the study scale where the slope of the straight line is f α q if this linear relationship is satisfied multifractal analysis should be applied and vice versa as shown in fig 5 the slope of the straight line corresponding to the different q values varied and r2 was more than 0 9 thereby indicating that the soil psd had multifractal characteristics the multifractal parameters of the psd in different soil layers are shown in table 1 we found that all of the multifractal parameters dv ds d0 d1 d2 and av in the 0 40 cm layer differed significantly from those in the 40 80 cm layer p 0 05 in contrast to ds dv was significantly higher in the 0 40 cm layer than the 40 80 cm layer thereby indicating that soil psd in the 0 40 cm soil layer had a more complicated fractal structure and it was more inhomogeneous in the large probability estimation regions d0 d1 d2 and av were significantly lower in the 0 40 cm soil layer than the 40 80 cm layer p 0 05 thereby indicating that the deeper soil layer had a wider psd range more particle groups and higher local and overall variability at each point the fv values in the whole soil layers were greater than 0 and they did not differ significantly thereby indicating that a large probability subset was dominant in the soil psd 3 3 relationships between smc and soil psd 3 3 1 correlation coefficients between smc and multifractal parameters of soil psd the correlation coefficients between the multifractal parameters and smc in different soil layers and sampling stages are shown in fig 6 the smc in the same soil layer was significantly correlated in different sampling stages which indicates that the smc had close relationships with the multifractal parameters of the soil psd smc in the 40 80 cm soil layer under es as well as in the 0 40 cm soil layer under ms and ls were significantly negatively correlated with av p 0 01 which indicates that av was more sensitive to the smc level smc in the 40 80 cm soil layer under es and ms were significantly negatively correlated with fv p 0 05 which indicates that the surface soil was more affected by external factors and thus fv was more sensitive to the soil depth dv was also affected by the smc level and soil depth where it had significant negative correlations with smc in the 40 80 cm layer under es and ms as well as in the whole soil layer under ls p 0 05 therefore the correlations between the multifractal parameters and smc varied under different sampling stages in the different soil layers 3 3 2 rf analysis between smc and multifractal parameters of soil psd rf was used in order to estimate the different effects of each multifractal parameter of the psd on the smc in the 0 40 cm and 40 80 cm soil layers and the results are shown in fig 7 a c in es the multifractal parameters that differed significantly in terms of their relative importance value incmse increase in mean squared error with respect to the smc were av 14 00 and fv 9 16 in the 0 40 cm soil layer and av 25 45 and dv 10 40 in the 40 80 cm soil layer p 0 05 in ms the multifractal parameters that differed significantly in terms of their relative importance value with respect to the smc were av 24 29 and dv 21 08 in the 0 40 cm soil layer and av 49 00 dv 13 51 and d2 12 88 in the 40 80 cm soil layer p 0 05 in ls the multifractal parameters that differed significantly in terms of their relative importance value with respect to the smc were av 32 90 and dv 15 37 in the 0 40 cm soil layer and av 46 07 dv 16 90 d2 14 58 and ds 12 23 in the 40 80 cm soil layer p 0 05 over time the multifractal parameters explained 7 9 36 6 and 40 07 of the variation in smc in es ms and ls in the 0 40 cm soil layer respectively and 29 63 79 98 and 75 75 in the 40 80 cm soil layer table 2 3 3 3 equations based on smc and multifractal parameters of soil psd the empirical regression equations between the smc and multifractal parameters of soil psd are shown in table 3 the empirical regression equations were all significant at all sampling stages in the different soil layers p 0 01 the r2 values for the 0 40 cm soil layer followed the order of ls 0 47 ms 0 30 es 0 16 the r2 values for the 40 80 cm soil layer were over 0 90 in ms and ls we found negative correlations between smc with av dv and ds but positive correlations between smc with fv and d2 the r2 values increased as the number of multifractal parameters of the soil psd increased 4 discussion in our study the soil psd differed between the different soil layers where the soil psd in the 0 40 cm layer had a finer fractal structure and it was more inhomogeneous in the large probability estimation regions whereas the soil psd in the 40 80 cm soil layer had a wider range with more particle groups and higher local and overall variability table 2 de et al 2008 obtained similar results for different land use types in addition it has been shown that the soil psd is constant over a long time period in each soil layer martı et al 2002 mohammadi et al 2019 montero 2005 previous studies have shown that soil psd had close relationships with the soil organic matter aggregates and pores wang et al 2015 in the absence of human interference the distribution and contents of the soil properties will remain relatively stable and they can directly or indirectly affect the smc distribution therefore the soil psd has a relatively stable effect on smc multifractal parameters can directly or indirectly capture the details of the soil properties multifractal parameters can directly describe the detailed distribution concentration local variability overall variability degree of symmetry and heterogeneity of the soil psd zeleke and si 2006 wang et al 2019 previous studies identified significant correlations between the multifractal parameters and the sand silt and clay contents de et al 2008 qi et al 2018 different proportions of sand silt and clay directly affect the soil pore types and distribution smc is mainly determined by the abundance of capillary pores jian et al 2015 liao et al 2017 in addition multifractal parameters can indirectly reflect other soil properties that greatly influence the distribution and average smc wang et al 2015 showed that d1 and av increased whereas fv decreased as soil bulk density organic matter total nitrogen and soil electrical conductivity increased as the ph and field water capacity decreased we found that av and dv had the most significant impacts on the smc in the whole soil layer in most sampling stages table 3 a lower av value indicates the lower heterogeneity of the whole fractal structure and a higher smc implies that greater heterogeneity enhances the smc retention capacity a higher dv value indicates the complexity or fineness characteristics of the psd fractal structure by contrast a psd fractal structure with roughness characteristics contributes to the conservation of smc the multifractal parameters used to describe the differences in the soil psd could directly reflect the smc in different sampling stages fig 7 and table 3 however the amounts of the variation in the smc explained by the multifractal parameters were affected by the smc level and soil layer depth we found that the variation in the smc was explained better by the multifractal parameters when smc was lower table 2 which may be explained as follows smc was mainly affected by the soil texture organic matter and aggregates after the loss of water as rainfall via gravity a relatively high smc was greatly affected by the soil organic matter and aggregates with a relatively low smc the effects of soil organic matter and aggregates on water retention decreased gradually and thus the smc was mainly controlled by the soil psd yang et al 2016 so the variation in the smc was explained by the increases in the multifractal parameters the multifractal parameters in the 0 40 cm soil layer explained less of the variation in the smc than those in the 40 80 cm soil layer at all sampling stages table 2 these results may be explained as follows 1 in contrast to the 40 80 cm soil layer the 0 40 cm soil layer was subjected to plowing and it had higher soil organic matter and aggregate contents and a greater underground biomass dou et al 2020 eapen et al 2017 jiang et al 2013 peng et al 2020 2 according to previous studies 80 of the root system of vegetation is mainly in 0 40 cm soil layer eapen et al 2017 gao et al 2014 ren et al 2018 wang et al 2018c and thus the consumption of smc by roots affects the distribution of smc 3 the smc in the 0 40 cm soil layer may have been affected more by the vegetation coverage and field management jian et al 2015 showed that vegetation coverage directly affects smc by affecting canopy interception in addition dong et al 2018 and tan et al 2017 showed that different agricultural techniques significantly affect smc by reducing water evaporation these results suggest that the variation in smc can be explained well by multifractal parameters and they can be used to optimize and improve the predictive accuracy of smc models our results are transferrable to many locations the multifractal parameters were significantly correlated with smc in the range from 14 92 to 25 30 g g 1 after rainfall table 3 and fig 4 which suggests that these results may be applicable to most conditions and regions in addition as the average smc decreased the correlations became much stronger between the multifractal parameters and smc table 3 thereby indicating that these results were more suitable for drier conditions however our results cannot be applied to areas with high smc such as marshland where the large amount of water has only a slight effect on the soil texture in addition these results cannot be applied to freezing thawing areas because the smc has a solid status in the capillary pores or macropores for most of the time in addition sun et al 2015 showed that the freezing thawing process can change the soil texture and affect the smc distribution 5 conclusion in this study we explored the relationships between the smc and multifractal parameters of the soil psd in the 0 40 cm and 40 80 cm soil layers at different sampling stages after rainfall in the hilly loess region of china the multifractal parameters used to describe the differences in the soil psd in multiple dimensions can directly reflect the smc and they are transferrable to many locations the explanation of the variation in the smc by the multifractal parameters increased as the smc value decreased the smc in the 0 40 cm soil layer was readily affected by external factors and thus the multifractal parameters could explain relatively less of the variation in the smc compared with those in the 40 80 cm soil layer the existing smc models also have many limitations such as the climate and region which affect the values of the parameters in our study the equations fitted between the multifractal parameters and smc for the whole soil layer were significant in all sampling stages thus smc was closely related to the multifractal parameters av dv ds d2 and fv and they could be applied to optimize smc models in future research the multifractal parameters of the psd should be introduced into smc models to verify the

4758,in the present paper a set of physically based expressions for estimating the infiltrated volume and the flow rate from hemispherical and disc sources are presented the proposed formula depends on four parameters the initial and the saturated soil water contents the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the wetting front suction head the developed models allow the accurate estimation of the infiltrated flow when compared with the same phenomena simulated with richardś equation dimensionless expressions were also deduced which help draw general conclusions on the infiltration processes taking advantage of the small number of parameters included in the developed expressions it was proposed a simple procedure for soils characterization the method requires measuring both the initial and saturated soil water content and the infiltrated volume over time from a disc source and aided with the developed expressions allows deducing both the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the wetting front suction head keywords infiltration soil water flux irrigation green ampt soil characterisation soil water content 1 introduction soil water flux has focused the interest of researchers for years a number of scientific works have addressed this issue with special attention to irrigation and agricultural applications darcy 1856 established the foundations of water infiltration for porous media buckingham 1907 defined the soil hydraulic conductivity as a function of moisture content these theories together with the continuity law gave rise to the filtration equation known as richards 1931 equation that allows modelling the soil water flux from a physically based approach different analytical and numerical solutions have been developed for solving richard s expression a comprehensive presentation of the most relevant solutions can be found in subbaiah 2013 despite the number of works carried out many questions still remain unsolved fernández gálvez and simmonds 2006 with regards to for example the difficulties to measure many input parameters required for numerical solutions the suitability of analytical solutions built upon linearized forms of the conductivity curve or the existence of convergence problems derived from the use of non linear expressions for conductivity and water retention curves from a different point of view and also based on a physical approach green and ampt green and ampt 1911 developed a simple model for vertical soil water infiltration the model relies on the assumption that water filters vertically defining a homogeneous saturated piston type wetting front green and ampt developed their formula by applying these assumptions to the darcýs expression the model is simple and depends on the initial and saturated soil water contents the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the wetting front suction head its simplicity and ability to simulate the infiltration motivated other authors to go further in developing solutions based on green ampt approach chu 1994 ogden and saghafian 1997 sepaskhah and chitsaz 2004 swamee et al 2012 ali et al 2013 almedeij and esen 2014 vatankhah 2015 in addition to its simplicity green ampt s approach has the advantage of requiring a reduced number of parameters compared to other theories for soil water movement modelling otherwise initial and saturated soil water contents and saturated hydraulic conductivity as well have a clear physical meaning and can be easily determined not only from a theoretical point of view but also in laboratory or field experiments different theories have been proposed for estimating the wetting front suction head as for example that developed by neuman 1976 while many studies have addressed the characterisation of parameters of the green ampt expression mein and farrell 1974 rawls et al 1983 zhang et al 1995a 1995b however there is still field for taking advantage of the simplicity and the physical meaning of the green ampt s approach it can help develop simple theories for characterizing different phenomena for soil water dynamics ease the deduction of dimensionless expressions that simplifies the theoretical analysis and help identify key factors in irrigation processes such advantages open the way for overcoming problems derived from the over parameterization of solutions based on richards equation with van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 expressions in this paper we focus on both hemispherical and disc sources which are of particular interest for trickle irrigation since they allow modelling for example the infiltration from either surface or subsurface drip emitters or from puddles appearing at the soil surface after a certain time of drip emitters operation in addition these sources are also relevant for many other applications related to hydrology as for example disc infiltrometers or surface irrigation otherwise green ampt s model has been widely used for studying a great variety of conditions ali et al 2016 such as uniform govindaraju et al 1996 or layered liu et al 2008 soils as well as steady or unsteady rainfall condition serrano 2001 chu and mariño 2005 loáiciga and huang 2007 so extending the range of applications from different insights can help provide new approaches for a number of potential applications the aforementioned ideas frame the present paper which is aimed at 1 developing novel approaches for studying soil water dynamics from either hemispherical or disc sources from darcýs equations based on green ampt s approach and 2 presenting a field procedure for soil characterization based on the developed expression for disc sources 2 materials and methods green and ampt 1911 original theory requires a homogeneity conditions for a semi infinite medium b a piston type wetting front and c negligible water height on the surface a 0 cm see fig 1 in addition the initial and saturated soil water contents θ 0 θ s cm3 cm3 and the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s cm min have to be known according to these assumptions the darcýs equation for the sketch drawn in fig 1 can be expressed as follows eq 1 1 i i k s a l τ f l k s 1 τ f δ θ i a where ii cm min refers to infiltration rate ia cm to cumulative infiltration τ f h f cm represents the suction matric head at the wetting front δ θ θ s θ 0 the difference between the saturated and the initial soil water contents and l cm the depth reached by the wetting front the expression for ia eq 2 is deduced by direct integration of i i eq 1 over the time t min 2 i a k s t τ f δ θ l n 1 i a τ f δ θ from eq 1 the expected behaviour at either earlier iie cm eq 3 or longer iil cm eq 4 times can be inferred 3 i ie k s τ f δ θ i a 4 i il k s hence ii can be supposed to be the summation of both components at earlier and longer times eq 5 5 i i i ie i il based on the exposed theoretical basis particular solutions for either hemispherical or disc sources were developed as follows 2 1 solution for hemispherical sources let s consider a saturated surface hemispherical source of radius r0 with neglectable surface water depth a 0 cm see fig 2 if pure radial flow can be assumed the darcýs equation for the radial coordinate r cm can be expressed as follows eq 6 6 v k s h r where v cm min represents velocity modulus and h suction matric head cm the flow rate q cm3 min discharging from the saturated source and crossing through any r radius hemispherical surface is given by eq 7 7 q v â 2 π r 2 replacing 7 in 6 and taking integrals with respect to both h and r yields eq 8 8 k s â 0 h f d h q 2 π â r 0 r f dr r 2 where r f and r o stands for the radii of the wetting front and the saturated source respectively solving the integrals of eq 8 yields eq 9 9 q t 2 π k s τ f r 0 r f t r f t r 0 it must be noted that since r f varies over the time q is a time function on the other hand the volume of water v t cm3 discharged from a hemispherical source when the wetting from reaches rf the product of a 2π r f 3 r 0 3 3 soil volume multiplied by δθ eq 10 10 v t 2 π 3 δ θ r f 3 t r 0 3 therefore taking the derivative of v t in eq 10 with respect to time yields an expression for the flow discharged from a hemispherical source eq 11 11 q t 2 π δ θ r f 2 â dr f dt replacing 9 in 11 and integrating with respect to t and r f yields eq 12a 12a t δ θ k s τ f r 0 1 3 r f 3 t r 0 3 r 0 2 r f

to the summand s t 1 2 of philiṕs infiltration equation philip 1957 influencing the infiltration at earlier times but referred to a asm power source at longer times hereinafter referred to as t q

longer times for the steady state it can be assumed that in eq 22b the τf r 0 friction slope at the emitter surface must be incremented by the amount of discharged water a force by weight unit of δθ s θ 0 therefore a corrective factor c increasing the flow rate was incorporated to eq 22b yielding eq 24 this factor ranges between 0 gravity forces negligible and 0 5 representing in this case the relationship between the areal and the projected hemispherical source areas supposing gravity exerts relevant effect we propose c 0 3 c 0 2 and c 0 1 for sandy loamy and clay loam soils respectively although the solution at the steady state does not depend on δθ the instant when both curves with and without gravity diverge does it what explains that making c δθ yield results accurate enough 24 q

from a disc source can be supposed to be similar to the vertical infiltration from a source of area a d π r o 2 cm2 so the expressions for the flow and volume are given by eqs 29 and 30 respectively 29 v t 0 π r 0 2 2 δ θ τ f k s t a d s t 30 q t 0 π 2 δ θ r 0 4 τ f k s v a d s 2 t since ad asm 2 it can be expected at earlier times the infiltrated volume from a disc source to be half of the infiltrated volume from a hemispherical source at longer times neglecting gravitational effects only vertical infiltration should be appearing from a disc source while both vertical and horizontal should be observed in a hemispherical source if we consider that the infiltration from a hemispherical source is compound of two horizontal and vertical projections of area π r 0 2 thus it can be expected the infiltration from the disc source to be 2 smaller than that from the hemispherical source therefore eqs 22b and 23b for longer times transform into eq 31 and 32 31 q t 2 π r 0 2 k s τ f r 0 32 v t 2 π r 0 τ f k s t following the same argument than that exposed for the hemispherical source the gravitational effect is incorporated by a term compensating the friction slope as follows eq 33 33 q t 2 π r 0 2 k s τ f r 0 1 2 δ θ r 0 τ f in this case the gravitational effect increasing the discharged flow at longer times is defined proportional to 2 δθ because the surface of the source is half the following reference variables for gravitational constant ćg volume v ref cm3 flow rate q ref cm3 min and time t ref min eqs 34 37 were used for deducing the expressions for dimensionless volume v and flow q eqs 38 41 similarly we also obtained for the disc source results accurate enough making c δθ however since c values yielding the better results depend on the soil type we recommend c 0 4 c 0 25 and c 0 1 for sandy loamy and clay soils respectively 34 c â g 1 2 c r 0 τ f 35 v ref 2 3 c g π δ θ r 0 3 36 q ref 2 π r 0 τ f k s c g 37 t ref v ref q ref 38 v â t 0 3 t â 39 q â t 0 3 2

1 m m 2 where α cm 1 m and n are parameters of each soil θ and θ r cm3 cm3 are respectively the standardized and residual soil water contents and λ is the so called tortuosity 2 4 soil characterisation the reduced number of unknown parameters of the proposed expressions opens the way for new soil characterisation techniques based on simple field experiments that overcome difficulties of the current methods based on van genutchen and mualem expressions let s suppose a soil with known initial and saturated soil water contents under the proposed framework only k s and τ f remain unknown the unknowns can be deduced by eq 42 just measuring the infiltrated volume over time from a disc source many field infiltrometers deliver water from a disc source both k s and τ f can be estimated for the infiltrated volume estimated with eq 42 to fit those obtained with richardś equation for fitting the parameters it can be supposed that residuals difference between measurements or estimates with eq 42 and values obtained richardś equation follow a zero average normal law and thus select the parameters maximising the likelihood function of residuals once θ s θ r θ o k s and τ f are known the parameter m of the van genutchen and mualem conductivity and retention curves can be deduced using the if function proposed by sayah et al 2016 as follows eqs 47 and 48 47 if k s 2 54 60 48 m 0 0736 l n if 0 4247 the previous expressions were fitted for the soil categories defined by carsel and parrish 1988 in case of field experiments particular functions should be fitted according to each soil characteristics finally once m has been estimated only the parameter α the van genutchen and mualem expressions remains unknown given the tortuosity λ is known we propose deducing this parameter from τ f from the conductivity curve aided by neuman 1976 expression who related τ f with conductivity curve as follows eq 49 49 τ f 1 k s h θ 0 0 kdh 3 results 3 1 hemispherical source 3 1 1 model validation fig 4 presents the infiltrated volume over time estimated with both the proposed expressions for a r 0 10 cm hemispherical source and richardś equation with the numerical routine presented in del vigo et al 2020 for a loamy soil using van genutchen and mualem expressions for conductivity and water retention curves and the required parameters retrieved from carsel and parrish 1988 θ s 0 43 θ r 0 078 ks 0 0173 cm min α 0 036 cm 1 m 0 359 neglecting the gravitational effect the wetting front suction head was estimated with neumańs equation neuman 1976 resulting τ f 6 93 cm the initial soil water content was set to θ 0 0 2 from fig 4 it can be observed the fairly good agreement between the infiltrated volume from the proposed general expression eq 12b and those deduced with richardś equation the estimates incorporating the gravitational effect from either the proposed expressions or the numerical solution of richardś equation have been displayed in fig 5 as it was predicted by many theories incorporating the gravitational effect increases the infiltrated volume at longer times while its influence can be neglected at earlier times from fig 5 it can also be observed the overlapping between continuous lines and single marks which proves the proper agreement between estimates from the proposed expressions and from richardś equation this also confirms the suitability of the assumption made regarding the proportionality of the gravitational effect to δθ by running the model with different source radii not displayed in the present paper we observed that the greater the radius of the hemispherical source the earlier the curves separate and the greater the difference between estimates with and without gravitaty 3 1 2 parameter discussion general conclusions on the infiltration process can be drawn by grouping individual variables in dimensionless ones with this aim it has been displayed in fig 6 the dimensionless infiltrated volume from two hemispherical sources r0 2 cm and r0 10 cm with and without the gravitational effect from fig 6 it can also be observed the good agreement between estimates from the proposed expression and those from the numerical solution of richardś equation the summation of eqs 20a and 23a for earlier and longer times also provides accurate estimation of the dimensionless infiltrated volume deduced with richardś equation as the overlapping curves blue circles and purple dashed line show the proximity of all the data series displayed in fig 6 demonstrates the suitability of the dimensionless expressions and the general behaviour of the infiltration process over the time 3 2 disc source 3 2 1 model validation fig 7 displays the infiltrated volume over time considering the gravitational effect from a saturated disc r 0 10 cm into a loamy soil estimated with both the proposed expressions and with richardś equation using van genutchen and mualem expressions for conductivity and water retention curves and the required parameters retrieved from carsel and parrish 1988 the wetting front suction head was also estimated with neumańs equation neuman 1976 the initial soil water content was set to θ 0 0 1 the estimated infiltrated volume with the proposed expressions reasonably fit the expectations numerical solution of richardś equation as it can be observed from fig 7 in this case the limits particularly when time approaches infinite provide accurate estimations of the infiltrated volume also the summation of eqs 38 and 40 fits the estimates properly the results presented in fig 7 also allow us concluding the suitability of the gravitational term proportional to 2 δθ incorporated into eq 33 3 2 2 parameters discussion since it is well known that the accuracy of the results obtained with numerical routines of richardś equation depends on the mesh spatial resolution the estimates from the proposed equations were confronted with estimates from richardś equation obtained with different mash sizes δr δz cm the results showed that the proposed expression fit properly any estimate from richardś equation above approximately 1 min as it can be concluded from fig 8 the simulations were also run for a sandy loam soil estimating τ f 4 94 cm with neuman 1976 and using van genutchen mualem curves retrieving the parameters from

once the disc radius is set dimensionless curves are expected to be reasonably homogeneous for any soil category or initial soil water content aiming at checking these expectations a set of simulations were also run for different soil categories loam sandy loam and clay loam parameters for clay loam soils deduced with the aforementioned models τ f 6 71 cm k s 0 0043 cm min θ s 0 41 θ r 0

equation are displayed in fig 10 from fig 10 it can be observed that dimensionless forms provide enough accuracy for any soil category initial soil water content and disc radius 3 3 soil characterisation both k s and τ f were deduced with the proposed routine using simulated data with different experiment durations the results are presented in fig 11 we have depicted results from t 100 since before it results do not depend on both parameters in isolation but on their product what generates large discrepancies between the estimates and the real values as it can be observed from fig 11 eq 43 yields results reasonably accurate in estimating the parameters for experiments longer than 200 min table 1 presents the estimates and the relative errors obtained with both equations for a 500 min duration experiment in this paper we have found parameterś values fitting the proposed expressions to simulations from numerical solution of richardś equation obviously simulations can differ largely from field behavior and the procedure using field data has to be carried out with additional precautions some external factors not initially considered in the simulations could condition the accuracy of the estimates as for example the local spatial heterogeneity the existence of preferential paths or even the existence of compacted soil layers following sayah et al 2016 we can link the previous estimates with the remaining parameters of van genutchen and mualem conductivity and retention curves aided by the if function as follows if 0 01729 2 54 60 0 41 3 4 m 0 0736 ln 0 41 0 4247 0 359 carsel and parrish 1988 found that for a loamy soil m 0 359 that coincides with the deduced estimate we obtained α 0 0367 cm 1 with θ s 0 43 θ r 0 078 θ o 0 2 k s 0 0173 cm min m 0 359 and τ f 6 79 cm and λ 0 5 following the exposed method that coincides with results from carsel and parrish 1988 for loamy soils 3 5 discussion 3 5 1 infiltration from hemispherical and disc sources since green ampt equation for horizontal infiltration coincides with the analytical expression from bruce and klute 1956 we can conclude that its validity does not strictly depend on the initial assumptions abrupt soil moisture gradient at the wetting front if we assume the previous statement is valid for 1d it also has to be valid for 3d flow if gravity is neglected fig 12 shows the infiltration simulated for three different soils and source radii estimating τ f with the expression presented in sayah et al 2016 we know from previous works see sayah et al 2016 that green ampt solution tends to overestimate the infiltration at intermediate stages while better fits it at either early or long times as a result of the previous arguments we can deduce that the main issue in simulating the infiltration without gravity should be the soil heterogeneity not addressed in this manuscript we have developed here expressions for the hemispherical source that coincide with those proposed by chu 1994 we believe that chús assumptions are questionable flow velocity inversely proportional to the radius since pure radial flow cannot be assumed if gravitational forces are considered on the contrary in this work we developed a general solution without gravity which allows the development of a solution with gravity just incorporating a corrective factor otherwise while checking our developed expressions we observed that our proposal better fit the estimates from richardś numerical solution than that from chu 1994 as it can be observed in fig 13 where the infiltrated volume over time for a loamy soil with r0 10 cm and θ 0 0 2 has been depicted we followed a similar argument for developing the solutions for a disc source once the exact solution for the initial instants is known the solution for longer times is developed and thus a general solution without gravity valid at any time is deduced by aggregation similarly a corrective factor was incorporated into this expression for considering gravitational forces we also checked our model for a disc source with that proposed by wooding 1968 assuming the interesting from our point of view recommendation made by warrick 1993 of replacing α gardneŕs constant by 1 τf to increase the applicability the developed analytical expressions under this assumption the discharged flow from a disc source at longer instants would be eq 50 50 q t π r 0 2 k s 4 k s τ f r 0 adding eqs 46 and 30 and taking derivatives with respect to time yields eq 51 51 q dv dt π r 0 2 2 θ s θ o τ f k s 2 t π r 0 2 k s 4 k s τ f r 0 eq 51 can be transformed into dimensionless expressions eqs 52 and 53 aided by the reference terms presented in eqs 54 55 and 56 52 q d v d t 1 t 1 53 v 2 t t 54 q e π r 0 2 k s 1 4 τ f π r 0 55 t e 1 1 4 τ f π r 0 2 θ s θ o τ f 2 k s 56 v e q e t e π r 0 2 1 1 4 τ f π r 0 θ s θ o τ f 2 however we did not obtained better fitting with eqs 52 and 53 than that obtained with the previously presented expressions for disc sources in the previous sections we have depicted the graphics comparing different model estimates using logarithmic scales in order to present a wide time range and to incorporate the simplified expressions for both earlier and longer times within the same graphic if we neglect very long times and focus on a more reasonable time period from an operational perspective we also observed that the proposed expressions fit numerical results properly as a matter of example we present below figs 14 16 the initial 1000 min for the experiments previously displayed in figs 4 6 and 7 in this regard it must also be taken into account that numerical solution of richardś equation is highly sensitive to the considered time step especially at longer times driving to very distant estimates 3 5 2 soil characterization soil characterization often called inverse problem faces many complexities derived from the soil heterogeneity the over parametrisation or the need to deal with parameters with questionable physical meaning it has forced different authors to use gardner type soils that allows for the linearization of the infiltration equation see for example philip 1968 1969 1971 1984a 1984b 1992 wooding 1968 warrick 1974 1992 warrick and lomen 1976 however it is well known that the gardner expression for the conductivity curve does not represent the reality as others expressions do it for that reason we selected the van genutchen model for developing a method for the soil characterisation hence of the four required parameters θ s θ o ks τf we have assumed that both θ s θ o can be easily determined in field experiments so only ks and τf have to be estimated however as it has been previously discussed this parameters are often correlated which complicates their accurate estimation to check the suitability of the developed method we made 15 simulations 0 1 1000 min with 5 different soil types and thus deduced the v t curves from disc sources from each 0 1 1000 simulation we generated different curves selecting ranges between 0 1 and 5 min 0 1 6 min and so on until 0 1 1000 and then we estimated the reference terms and subsequently the c values eqs 34 37 that better fitted the simulations from these experiments we extracted both the average c value and c value that yielded the best fit the results are displayed in tables 2 5 both the real and the estimated values for each experiment are displayed in fig 17 in three cases first making c δθ second using the average c value and third using the c value yielding the best fitting accuracy see table 6 as it can be observed from fig 17 using the c value yielding the best fitting results better approximates the real values however we must remark that the method is extremely sensitive to different factors as for example the integration method particularly when numerical methods are used or the δθ value we also repeated the same exercise based on the aforementioned approach derived from wooding 1968 theories eqs 50 56 obtaining the results presented in fig 18 4 conclusions a set of physically based expressions deduced following green ampt criteria were proposed for characterizing the infiltrated volume and the flow rate from both hemispherical and disc sources general expressions and particular ones for earlier and longer times were developed the results obtained with the developed expressions showed a good agreement with those obtained from numerical integration of richardś equation the experiments showed that general expressions combining both earlier and longer times terms yielded accurate results two terms incorporating the gravitational effect affecting long time infiltration were proposed for hemispherical and disc sources as function of the soil moisture gradient between the initial and the saturated soil water contents the developed expressions allow overcoming several problems numerical convergence stability computation efforts of numerical solutions of richardś equation for either soil water dynamics or soil characterization through inverse solutions the dimensionless forms were also checked with the equivalent simulations using richardś equation yielding accurate results what opens a field for irrigation recommendations based on a general set of expressions independent on the soil type and the

4758,in the present paper a set of physically based expressions for estimating the infiltrated volume and the flow rate from hemispherical and disc sources are presented the proposed formula depends on four parameters the initial and the saturated soil water contents the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the wetting front suction head the developed models allow the accurate estimation of the infiltrated flow when compared with the same phenomena simulated with richardś equation dimensionless expressions were also deduced which help draw general conclusions on the infiltration processes taking advantage of the small number of parameters included in the developed expressions it was proposed a simple procedure for soils characterization the method requires measuring both the initial and saturated soil water content and the infiltrated volume over time from a disc source and aided with the developed expressions allows deducing both the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the wetting front suction head keywords infiltration soil water flux irrigation green ampt soil characterisation soil water content 1 introduction soil water flux has focused the interest of researchers for years a number of scientific works have addressed this issue with special attention to irrigation and agricultural applications darcy 1856 established the foundations of water infiltration for porous media buckingham 1907 defined the soil hydraulic conductivity as a function of moisture content these theories together with the continuity law gave rise to the filtration equation known as richards 1931 equation that allows modelling the soil water flux from a physically based approach different analytical and numerical solutions have been developed for solving richard s expression a comprehensive presentation of the most relevant solutions can be found in subbaiah 2013 despite the number of works carried out many questions still remain unsolved fernández gálvez and simmonds 2006 with regards to for example the difficulties to measure many input parameters required for numerical solutions the suitability of analytical solutions built upon linearized forms of the conductivity curve or the existence of convergence problems derived from the use of non linear expressions for conductivity and water retention curves from a different point of view and also based on a physical approach green and ampt green and ampt 1911 developed a simple model for vertical soil water infiltration the model relies on the assumption that water filters vertically defining a homogeneous saturated piston type wetting front green and ampt developed their formula by applying these assumptions to the darcýs expression the model is simple and depends on the initial and saturated soil water contents the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the wetting front suction head its simplicity and ability to simulate the infiltration motivated other authors to go further in developing solutions based on green ampt approach chu 1994 ogden and saghafian 1997 sepaskhah and chitsaz 2004 swamee et al 2012 ali et al 2013 almedeij and esen 2014 vatankhah 2015 in addition to its simplicity green ampt s approach has the advantage of requiring a reduced number of parameters compared to other theories for soil water movement modelling otherwise initial and saturated soil water contents and saturated hydraulic conductivity as well have a clear physical meaning and can be easily determined not only from a theoretical point of view but also in laboratory or field experiments different theories have been proposed for estimating the wetting front suction head as for example that developed by neuman 1976 while many studies have addressed the characterisation of parameters of the green ampt expression mein and farrell 1974 rawls et al 1983 zhang et al 1995a 1995b however there is still field for taking advantage of the simplicity and the physical meaning of the green ampt s approach it can help develop simple theories for characterizing different phenomena for soil water dynamics ease the deduction of dimensionless expressions that simplifies the theoretical analysis and help identify key factors in irrigation processes such advantages open the way for overcoming problems derived from the over parameterization of solutions based on richards equation with van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 expressions in this paper we focus on both hemispherical and disc sources which are of particular interest for trickle irrigation since they allow modelling for example the infiltration from either surface or subsurface drip emitters or from puddles appearing at the soil surface after a certain time of drip emitters operation in addition these sources are also relevant for many other applications related to hydrology as for example disc infiltrometers or surface irrigation otherwise green ampt s model has been widely used for studying a great variety of conditions ali et al 2016 such as uniform govindaraju et al 1996 or layered liu et al 2008 soils as well as steady or unsteady rainfall condition serrano 2001 chu and mariño 2005 loáiciga and huang 2007 so extending the range of applications from different insights can help provide new approaches for a number of potential applications the aforementioned ideas frame the present paper which is aimed at 1 developing novel approaches for studying soil water dynamics from either hemispherical or disc sources from darcýs equations based on green ampt s approach and 2 presenting a field procedure for soil characterization based on the developed expression for disc sources 2 materials and methods green and ampt 1911 original theory requires a homogeneity conditions for a semi infinite medium b a piston type wetting front and c negligible water height on the surface a 0 cm see fig 1 in addition the initial and saturated soil water contents θ 0 θ s cm3 cm3 and the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s cm min have to be known according to these assumptions the darcýs equation for the sketch drawn in fig 1 can be expressed as follows eq 1 1 i i k s a l τ f l k s 1 τ f δ θ i a where ii cm min refers to infiltration rate ia cm to cumulative infiltration τ f h f cm represents the suction matric head at the wetting front δ θ θ s θ 0 the difference between the saturated and the initial soil water contents and l cm the depth reached by the wetting front the expression for ia eq 2 is deduced by direct integration of i i eq 1 over the time t min 2 i a k s t τ f δ θ l n 1 i a τ f δ θ from eq 1 the expected behaviour at either earlier iie cm eq 3 or longer iil cm eq 4 times can be inferred 3 i ie k s τ f δ θ i a 4 i il k s hence ii can be supposed to be the summation of both components at earlier and longer times eq 5 5 i i i ie i il based on the exposed theoretical basis particular solutions for either hemispherical or disc sources were developed as follows 2 1 solution for hemispherical sources let s consider a saturated surface hemispherical source of radius r0 with neglectable surface water depth a 0 cm see fig 2 if pure radial flow can be assumed the darcýs equation for the radial coordinate r cm can be expressed as follows eq 6 6 v k s h r where v cm min represents velocity modulus and h suction matric head cm the flow rate q cm3 min discharging from the saturated source and crossing through any r radius hemispherical surface is given by eq 7 7 q v â 2 π r 2 replacing 7 in 6 and taking integrals with respect to both h and r yields eq 8 8 k s â 0 h f d h q 2 π â r 0 r f dr r 2 where r f and r o stands for the radii of the wetting front and the saturated source respectively solving the integrals of eq 8 yields eq 9 9 q t 2 π k s τ f r 0 r f t r f t r 0 it must be noted that since r f varies over the time q is a time function on the other hand the volume of water v t cm3 discharged from a hemispherical source when the wetting from reaches rf the product of a 2π r f 3 r 0 3 3 soil volume multiplied by δθ eq 10 10 v t 2 π 3 δ θ r f 3 t r 0 3 therefore taking the derivative of v t in eq 10 with respect to time yields an expression for the flow discharged from a hemispherical source eq 11 11 q t 2 π δ θ r f 2 â dr f dt replacing 9 in 11 and integrating with respect to t and r f yields eq 12a 12a t δ θ k s τ f r 0 1 3 r f 3 t r 0 3 r 0 2 r f

longer times for the steady state it can be assumed that in eq 22b the τf r 0 friction slope at the emitter surface must be incremented by the amount of discharged water a force by weight unit of δθ s θ 0 therefore a corrective factor c increasing the flow rate was incorporated to eq 22b yielding eq 24 this factor ranges between 0 gravity forces negligible and 0 5 representing in this case the relationship between the areal and the projected hemispherical source areas supposing gravity exerts relevant effect we propose c 0 3 c 0 2 and c 0 1 for sandy loamy and clay loam soils respectively although the solution at the steady state does not depend on δθ the instant when both curves with and without gravity diverge does it what explains that making c δθ yield results accurate enough 24 q

from a disc source can be supposed to be similar to the vertical infiltration from a source of area a d π r o 2 cm2 so the expressions for the flow and volume are given by eqs 29 and 30 respectively 29 v t 0 π r 0 2 2 δ θ τ f k s t a d s t 30 q t 0 π 2 δ θ r 0 4 τ f k s v a d s 2 t since ad asm 2 it can be expected at earlier times the infiltrated volume from a disc source to be half of the infiltrated volume from a hemispherical source at longer times neglecting gravitational effects only vertical infiltration should be appearing from a disc source while both vertical and horizontal should be observed in a hemispherical source if we consider that the infiltration from a hemispherical source is compound of two horizontal and vertical projections of area π r 0 2 thus it can be expected the infiltration from the disc source to be 2 smaller than that from the hemispherical source therefore eqs 22b and 23b for longer times transform into eq 31 and 32 31 q t 2 π r 0 2 k s τ f r 0 32 v t 2 π r 0 τ f k s t following the same argument than that exposed for the hemispherical source the gravitational effect is incorporated by a term compensating the friction slope as follows eq 33 33 q t 2 π r 0 2 k s τ f r 0 1 2 δ θ r 0 τ f in this case the gravitational effect increasing the discharged flow at longer times is defined proportional to 2 δθ because the surface of the source

volume v and flow q eqs 38 41 similarly we also obtained for the disc source results accurate enough making c δθ however since c values yielding the better results depend on the soil type we recommend

characterisation the reduced number of unknown parameters of the proposed expressions opens the way for new soil characterisation techniques based on simple field experiments that overcome difficulties of the current methods based on van genutchen and mualem expressions let s suppose a soil with known initial and saturated soil water contents under the proposed framework only k s and τ f remain unknown the unknowns can be deduced by eq 42 just measuring the infiltrated volume over time from a disc source many field infiltrometers deliver water from a disc source both k s and τ f can be estimated for the infiltrated volume estimated with eq 42 to fit those obtained with richardś equation for fitting the parameters it can be supposed that residuals difference between measurements or estimates with eq 42 and values obtained richardś equation follow a zero average normal law and thus select the parameters maximising the likelihood function of residuals once θ s θ r θ o k s and τ f are known the parameter m of the van genutchen and mualem conductivity and retention curves can be deduced using the if function proposed by sayah et al 2016 as follows eqs 47 and 48 47 if k s 2 54 60 48 m 0 0736 l n if 0 4247 the previous expressions were fitted for the soil categories defined by carsel and parrish 1988 in case of field experiments particular functions should be fitted according to each soil characteristics finally once m has been estimated only the parameter α the van genutchen and mualem expressions remains unknown given the tortuosity λ is known we propose deducing this parameter from τ f from the conductivity curve aided by neuman 1976 expression who related τ f with conductivity curve as follows eq 49 49 τ f 1 k s h θ 0 0 kdh 3 results 3 1 hemispherical source 3 1 1 model validation fig 4 presents the infiltrated volume over time estimated with both the proposed expressions for a r 0 10 cm hemispherical source and richardś equation with the numerical routine presented in del vigo et al 2020 for a loamy soil using van genutchen and mualem expressions for conductivity and water retention curves and the required parameters retrieved from carsel and parrish 1988 θ s 0 43 θ r 0 078 ks 0 0173 cm min α 0 036 cm 1 m 0 359 neglecting the gravitational effect the wetting front suction head was estimated with neumańs equation neuman 1976 resulting τ f 6 93 cm the initial soil water content was set to θ 0 0 2 from fig 4 it can be observed the fairly good agreement between the infiltrated volume from the proposed general expression eq 12b and those deduced with richardś equation the estimates incorporating the gravitational effect from either the proposed expressions or the numerical solution of richardś equation have been displayed in fig 5 as it was predicted by many theories incorporating the gravitational effect increases the infiltrated volume at longer times while its influence can be neglected at earlier times from fig 5 it can also be observed the overlapping between continuous lines and single marks which proves the proper agreement between estimates from the proposed expressions and from richardś equation this also confirms the suitability of the assumption made regarding the proportionality of the gravitational effect to δθ by running the model with different source radii not displayed in the present paper we observed that the greater the radius of the hemispherical source the earlier the curves separate and the greater the difference between estimates with and without gravitaty 3 1 2 parameter discussion general conclusions on the infiltration process can be drawn by grouping individual variables in dimensionless ones with this aim it has been displayed in fig 6 the dimensionless infiltrated volume from two hemispherical sources r0 2 cm and r0 10 cm with and without the gravitational effect from fig 6 it can also be observed the good agreement between estimates from the proposed expression and those from the numerical solution of richardś equation the summation of eqs 20a and 23a for earlier and longer times also provides accurate estimation of the dimensionless infiltrated volume deduced with richardś equation as the overlapping curves blue circles and purple dashed line show the proximity of all the data series displayed in fig 6 demonstrates the suitability of the dimensionless expressions and the general behaviour of the infiltration process over the time 3 2 disc source 3 2 1 model validation fig 7 displays the infiltrated volume over time considering the gravitational effect from a saturated disc r 0 10 cm into a loamy soil estimated with both the proposed expressions and with richardś equation using van genutchen and mualem expressions for conductivity and water retention curves and the required parameters retrieved from carsel and parrish 1988 the wetting front suction head was also estimated with neumańs equation neuman 1976 the initial soil water content was set to θ 0 0 1 the estimated infiltrated volume with the proposed expressions reasonably fit the expectations numerical solution of richardś equation as it can be observed from fig 7 in this case the limits particularly when time approaches infinite provide accurate estimations of the infiltrated volume also the summation of eqs 38 and 40 fits the estimates properly the results presented in fig 7 also allow us concluding the suitability of the gravitational term proportional to 2 δθ incorporated into eq 33 3 2 2 parameters discussion since it is well known that the accuracy of the results obtained with numerical routines of richardś equation depends on the mesh spatial resolution the estimates from the proposed equations were confronted with estimates from richardś equation obtained with different mash sizes δr δz cm the results showed that the proposed expression fit properly any estimate from richardś equation above approximately 1 min as it can be concluded from fig 8 the simulations were also run for a sandy loam soil estimating τ f 4 94 cm with neuman 1976 and using van genutchen mualem curves retrieving the parameters from carsel and parrish 1988 k s 0 0736 cm min θ s 0 41 θ r 0 065 α 0 075 cm 1 m 0 471 with different disc radii achieving a fairly good overlap as it can be concluded from the graphics presented in fig 9 once the disc radius is set dimensionless curves are expected to be reasonably homogeneous for any soil category or initial soil water content aiming at checking these expectations a set of simulations were also run for different soil categories loam sandy loam and clay loam parameters for clay loam soils deduced with the aforementioned models τ f 6 71 cm k s 0 0043 cm min θ s 0 41 θ r 0

equation are displayed in fig 10 from fig 10 it can be observed that dimensionless forms provide enough accuracy for any soil category initial soil water content and disc radius 3 3 soil characterisation both k s and τ f were deduced with the proposed routine using simulated data with different experiment durations the results are presented in fig 11 we have depicted results from t 100 since before it results do not depend on both parameters in isolation but on their product what generates large discrepancies between the estimates and the real values as it can be observed from fig 11 eq 43 yields results reasonably accurate in estimating the parameters for experiments longer than 200 min table 1 presents the estimates and the relative errors obtained with both equations for a 500 min duration experiment in this paper we have found parameterś values fitting the proposed expressions to simulations from numerical solution of richardś equation obviously simulations can differ largely from field behavior and the procedure using field data has to be carried out with additional precautions some external factors not initially considered in the simulations could condition the accuracy of the estimates as for example the local spatial heterogeneity the existence of preferential paths or even the existence of compacted soil layers following sayah et al 2016 we can link the previous estimates with the remaining parameters of van genutchen and mualem conductivity and retention curves aided by the if function as follows if 0 01729 2 54 60 0 41 3 4 m 0 0736 ln 0 41 0 4247 0 359 carsel and parrish 1988 found that for a loamy soil m 0 359 that coincides with the deduced estimate we obtained α 0 0367 cm 1 with θ s 0 43 θ r 0 078 θ o 0 2 k s 0 0173 cm min m 0 359 and τ f 6 79 cm and λ 0 5 following the exposed method that coincides with results from carsel and parrish 1988 for loamy soils 3 5 discussion 3 5 1 infiltration from hemispherical and disc sources since green ampt equation for horizontal infiltration coincides with the analytical expression from bruce and klute 1956 we can conclude that its validity does not strictly depend on the initial assumptions abrupt soil moisture gradient at the wetting front if we assume the previous statement is valid for 1d it also has to be valid for 3d flow if gravity is neglected fig 12 shows the infiltration simulated for three different soils and source radii estimating τ f with the expression presented in sayah et al 2016 we know from previous works see sayah et al 2016 that green ampt solution tends to overestimate the infiltration at intermediate stages while better fits it at either early or long times as a result of the previous arguments we can deduce that the main issue in simulating the infiltration without gravity should be the soil heterogeneity not addressed in this manuscript we have developed here expressions for the hemispherical source that coincide with those proposed by chu 1994 we believe that chús assumptions are questionable flow velocity inversely proportional to the radius since pure radial flow cannot be assumed if gravitational forces are considered on the contrary in this work we developed a general solution without gravity which allows the development of a solution with gravity just incorporating a corrective factor otherwise while checking our developed expressions we observed that our proposal better fit the estimates from richardś numerical solution than that from chu 1994 as it can be observed in fig 13 where the infiltrated volume over time for a loamy soil with r0 10 cm and θ 0 0 2 has been depicted we followed a similar argument for developing the solutions for a disc source once the exact solution for the initial instants is known the solution for longer times is developed and thus a general solution without gravity valid at any time is deduced by aggregation similarly a corrective factor was incorporated into this expression for considering gravitational forces we also checked our model for a disc source with that proposed by wooding 1968 assuming the interesting from our point of view recommendation made by warrick 1993 of replacing α gardneŕs constant by 1 τf to increase the applicability the developed analytical expressions under this assumption the discharged flow from a disc source at longer instants would be eq 50 50 q t π r 0 2 k s 4 k s τ f r 0 adding eqs 46 and 30 and taking derivatives with respect to time yields eq 51 51 q dv dt π r 0 2 2 θ s θ o τ f k s 2 t π r 0 2 k s 4 k s τ f r 0 eq 51 can be transformed into dimensionless expressions eqs 52 and 53 aided by the reference terms presented in eqs 54 55 and 56 52 q d v d t 1 t 1 53 v 2 t t 54 q e π r 0 2 k s 1 4 τ f π r 0 55 t e 1 1 4 τ f π r 0 2 θ s θ o τ f 2 k s 56 v e q e t e π r 0 2 1 1 4 τ f π r 0 θ s θ o τ f 2 however we did not obtained better fitting with eqs 52 and 53 than that obtained with the previously presented expressions for disc sources in the previous sections we have depicted the graphics comparing different model estimates using logarithmic scales in order to present a wide time range and to incorporate the simplified expressions for both earlier and longer times within the same graphic if we neglect very long times and focus on a more reasonable time period from an operational perspective we also observed that the proposed expressions fit numerical results properly as a matter of example we present below figs 14 16 the initial 1000 min for the experiments previously displayed in figs 4 6 and 7 in this regard it must also be taken into account that numerical solution of richardś equation is highly sensitive to the considered time step especially at longer times driving to very distant estimates 3 5 2 soil characterization soil characterization often called inverse problem faces many complexities derived from the soil heterogeneity the over parametrisation or the need to deal with parameters with questionable physical meaning it has forced different authors to use gardner type soils that allows for the linearization of the infiltration equation see for example philip 1968 1969 1971 1984a 1984b 1992 wooding 1968 warrick 1974 1992 warrick and lomen 1976 however it is well known that the gardner expression for the conductivity curve does not represent the reality as others expressions do it for that reason we selected the van genutchen model for developing a method for the soil characterisation hence of the four required parameters θ s θ o ks τf we have assumed that both θ s θ o can be easily determined in field experiments so only ks and τf have to be estimated however as it has been previously discussed this parameters are often correlated which complicates their accurate estimation to check the suitability of the developed method we made 15 simulations 0 1 1000 min with 5 different soil types and thus deduced the v t curves from disc sources from each 0 1 1000 simulation we generated different curves selecting ranges between 0 1 and 5 min 0 1 6 min and so on until 0 1 1000 and then we estimated the reference terms and subsequently the c values eqs 34 37 that better fitted the simulations from these experiments we extracted both the average c value and c value that yielded the best fit the results are displayed in tables 2 5 both the real and the estimated values for each experiment are displayed in fig 17 in three cases first making c δθ second using the average c value and third using the c value yielding the best fitting accuracy see table 6 as it can be observed from fig 17 using the c value yielding the best fitting results better approximates the real values however we must remark that the method is extremely sensitive to different factors as for example the integration method particularly when numerical methods are used or the δθ value we also repeated the same exercise based on the aforementioned approach derived from wooding 1968 theories eqs 50 56 obtaining the results presented in fig 18 4 conclusions a set of physically based expressions deduced following green ampt criteria were proposed for characterizing the infiltrated volume and the flow rate from both hemispherical and disc sources general expressions and particular ones for earlier and longer times were developed the results obtained with the developed expressions showed a good agreement with those obtained from numerical integration of richardś equation the experiments showed that general expressions combining both earlier and longer times terms yielded accurate results two terms incorporating the gravitational effect affecting long time infiltration were proposed for hemispherical and disc sources as function of the soil moisture gradient between the initial and the saturated soil water contents the developed expressions allow overcoming several problems numerical convergence stability computation efforts of numerical solutions of richardś equation for either soil water dynamics or soil characterization through inverse solutions the dimensionless forms were also checked with the equivalent simulations using richardś equation yielding accurate results what opens a field for irrigation recommendations based on a general set of expressions independent on the soil type and the

4759,sources and co cycling of nitrogen species in arsenic prone groundwater remain poorly understood which could affect arsenic behavior here geochemical and multi isotopic characteristics of groundwater from various redox environments were investigated to reveal the effects of nitrogen cycling on arsenic mobility in groundwater systems from the hetao basin in china in deep groundwater along an approximate flow path from the alluvial fan zone i through the transition area zone ii and to the flat plain zone iii a progressive no3 depletion with gradually increased δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 occurred accompanied by increases in dissolved nh4 fe ii and arsenic concentrations and a decrease in δ15nnh4 shallow groundwater in the flat plain zone iv covered wider ranges of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 and relatively lower δ15nnh4 organic nitrogen mineralization contributed primarily to nh4 release in all zones and dissimilatory no3 reduction to nh4 dnra was an important nh4 source in zone iv while nh4 loss mainly occurred via nitrification in zone i anaerobic nh4 oxidation was coupled to fe iii oxide reduction feammox in zones ii and iii and to no2 reduction anammox in zones ii iii and iv groundwater no3 was reduced via heterotrophic denitrification in zones ii and iii while the dnra was favored over denitrification in zone iv with much higher doc no3 molar ratios feammox and heterotrophic dnra increased the dissolved fe ii and arsenic concentrations via the enhanced fe iii oxide reduction however anammox and fe ii fueled autotrophic dnra decreased their concentrations due to limited fe iii oxide reduction and or enhanced fe ii oxidation the influences of nitrogen cycling on arsenic behavior are mainly mediated by transformations between fe iii oxides and dissolved fe

smith et al 2017 weng et al 2017 du et al 2020 in groundwater systems no3 may be artificially sourced from manure and fertilizers or naturally from atmospheric deposition and nitrification processes zhang et al 2012 however nh4 contamination generally occurs artificially due to organic waste disposal and naturally from organic matter degradation böhlke et al 2006 naturally occurring high as 10 μg

reductive dissolution of as bearing fe iii oxides stimulated by organic matter including organic nitrogen mineralization has been accepted as the primary mechanism of as mobilization glodowska et al 2020 under redox changing environments as levels are generally regulated by microbially mediated fe iii oxide reduction and fe ii oxidation in groundwater systems schaefer et al 2016 transformations between fe iii oxides and dissolved fe ii species may be mediated by nitrogen cycling senn and hemond 2002 smith et al 2017 which thus influences as mobility in groundwater co cycling of nitrogen species are important biogeochemical processes in aquifers rivett et al 2008 canfield et al 2010 under oxic conditions nh4 is naturally sourced from progressive organic nitrogen mineralization which is further oxidized into no3 via nitrification processes kelley et al 2013 in suboxic to anoxic environments no3 is reduced via denitrification lutz et al 2020 dissimilatory no3 reduction to nh4 dnra may also occur under favorable conditions rütting et al 2011 nitrate denitrification typically occurs in groundwater with limited dissolved organic carbon doc while dnra is favored when no3 concentrations are limited rivett et al 2008 kraft et al 2014 nitrite produced from no3 denitrification may facilitate anaerobic nh4 oxidation coupled to no2 reduction termed anammox in the presence of anammox bacteria zhu et al 2013 however anaerobic nh4 oxidation coupled to fe iii oxide reduction termed feammox can be mediated by fe iii reducing bacteria yang et al 2012 ammonium adsorption is a ubiquitous nh4 retardation process in aquifers böhlke et al 2006 nikolenko et al 2018 characterizing sources and natural cycling processes with respect to no3 and nh4 in groundwater has been of

feammox and dnra processes were validated through microbiological techniques engström et al 2005 yang et al 2012 ding et al 2014 hardison et al 2015 however to the best of our knowledge few have

norrman et al 2015 smith et al 2017 weng et al 2017 xiu et al 2020 low dissolved as concentrations generally occur in oxic suboxic aquifers with elevated no3 concentrations due to strong as adsorption on fe iii oxides senn and hemond 2002 smith et al 2017 ammonium is believed to be primarily sourced from microbially mediated organic matter degradation which facilitates fe iii oxide reduction and thereby releases fe ii and as harvey et al 2002 elevated nh4 concentrations have been regarded as a proxy of high organic matter degradation rates and as concentrations dowling et al 2002 postma et al 2007 gao et al 2020 feammox anammox and dnra processes may take place in groundwater and influence nh4 concentrations a microbial study indicated that feammox may occur under favorable conditions in aquifers xiu et al 2020 however the distributions of feammox anammox and dnra in high as containing groundwater and their effects on dissolved fe ii and as concentrations remain unclear therefore knowledge of nitrogen species cycling is crucial in revealing the mechanisms of as enrichment in aquifer systems by using multi nitrogen isotopes most studies focused on delineating nitrogen behavior and fate nikolenko et al 2018 and references therein liang et al 2020 but few studies explained the relationship between nitrogen cycling and as enrichment processes smith et al 2017 weng et al 2017

from alluvial pluvial aquifers in the hetao basin of china were investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the hetao basin is a typical alluvial pluvial basin and is located north of the yellow river and south of the langshan mountains in the northwest of inner mongolia china fig 1 our previous studies have shown that aquifers in the study area can be divided into three redox zones the alluvial fan transition area and flat plain guo et al 2016a gao et al 2020 the alluvial fan is located in the recharge area under oxic conditions the transition area is situated between the alluvial fan and the flat plain under moderate reducing conditions and the flat plain lies far from the mountain under strong reducing conditions jia et al 2014 the depth of the water table is around 20 m below the land surface bls in the alluvial fan and decreases to approximately 1 m bls in the flat plain deep groundwater flows primarily from the alluvial fan through the transition area and to the flat plain fig 1c with flow rates from 0 002 to 0 2 m d guo et al 2016a in the alluvial fan near the mountain margin the lithology is mainly gravel and coarse and medium sand with a large hydraulic gradient high permeability and fast groundwater flow rates in the flat plain far from mountains the stratigraphic lithology is generally characterized as an interbedding of silt and fine sands rich in organic matter with a relatively low hydraulic gradient and groundwater flow rates borehole lithological data show that clay layers lie primarily at depths of 5 and 40 m bls therefore aquifers overlying clay layers at a depth of 40 m 40 m bls host shallow groundwater while aquifers beneath the clay layers are regarded as semi confined or confined aquifers and host deep groundwater gao et al 2020 groundwater is recharged mostly by vertical infiltration of precipitation irrigation channels and irrigation water and is discharged mainly via evapotranspiration drainage and pumping 2 2 water sampling and analysis one hundred and five water samples including 100 groundwater samples three drainage water samples one irrigation water sample and one lake water sample were collected in the study area in july 2017 fig 1 groundwater was mainly taken from deep irrigation and shallow domestic wells including nine deep groundwater samples in the alluvial fan zone i 21 deep groundwater samples in the transition area zone ii 23 deep groundwater samples in the flat plain zone iii and 47 shallow groundwater samples in the flat plain zone iv at the field site concentrations of h2s fe ii no2 and nh4 were determined using a portable spectrophotometer hach dr2800 the alkalinity was analyzed using a digital titrator hach model 16900 with a bromocresol green methyl red indicator all samples were filtered using 0 45 μm membrane filters the samples for detecting cations and trace elements were collected and preserved with 6 mol l hno3 ph 2 and samples for as species used 0 25 mol l edta 10 samples for anion detections were unacidified the samples for δdh2o and δ18oh2o analyses were collected in 2 ml glass bottles that were filled with no headspace for dissolved inorganic carbon dic and δ13cdic analyses samples were collected in amber glass bottles and preserved with 0 2 ml saturated hgcl2 the samples used for doc and δ13cdoc analyses and for nitrogen and oxygen isotope detections i e δ15nno3 δ18ono3 and δ15nnh4 were collected in 20 ml brown glass bottles and 125 ml polyethylene bottles respectively samples for doc analysis were acidified to a ph 2 using hcl and those for nitrogen isotope detections were acidified with hcl to avoid nh4 volatilization at the field site all groundwater samples were immediately stored in a mobile refrigerator 4 c and transported to the lab after returning to the laboratory samples for δ15nno3 δ18ono3 and δ15nnh4 analyses were frozen immediately and stored at 20 c all other samples were stored at 4 c before the analysis and were analyzed within one week details on sample collections and laboratory analyses are given in the supporting information 2 3 stable isotope analyses the stable isotopes of δdh2o and δ18oh2o were measured using a high precision laser isotope analyzer picarro l2120 i stable isotopes of δ13cdic and δ13cdoc were determined using isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms mat 253 thermo fisher scientific in conjunction with an online high precision gas headspace sampler gasbench thermo fisher scientific stable isotopes of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 for no3 were determined using the denitrifier method sigman et al 2001 briefly the no3 in water samples was first converted to n2o by the denitrifying bacteria that lack n2o reductase activity pseudomonas aureofaciens then n2o was transported to a trace gas analyzer using a gilson automatic sampler after being extracted and purified the isotope values of n2o were analyzed using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms in a laboratory of the environmental stable isotope chinese academy of agricultural sciences all samples were prepared in duplicate with batches containing water blanks and relevant international standards i e iaea n3 usgs 34 and usgs 35 the stable isotope δ15nnh4 was analyzed using a chemical conversion method zhang et al 2007 briefly the dissolved nh4 in the water samples was firstly oxidized to no2 through the addition of sodium bromate after removing the excessive bro with a 20 acetic acid solution no2 was further reduced to n2o using a 1 1 sodium azide and acetic acid the final product n2o was then analyzed for isotopic composition using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms in a laboratory of the third institute of oceanography ministry of natural resources of china isotope values for the water samples were reported as δ in relative to working standard eq 4 4 δ r sample r standard 1 1000 where rsample indicates the ratio of heavy to light isotopes in the water samples e g 18o 16o rstandard represents the ratio of heavy to light isotopes for working standard d and o isotopes relative to v smow c isotopes relative to v pdb and n isotopes relative to air n2 based on replicate measurements of a reference standard the analytical precisions of δdh2o and δ18oh2o were better than 1 and 0 1 respectively δ13cdic and δ13cdoc were within 0 2 δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 were within 0 5 and δ15nnh4 was within 0 3 in a mean standard deviation 2 4 rayleigh fractionation model and calculations in a closed system isotope fractionation can be evaluated using a rayleigh fractionation according

nitrogen species the physicochemical parameters of water samples are summarized in table s1 and fig 2 the groundwater ph spread over a wide range of 7 04 8 66 which generally increased from zones i to ii and slightly decreased in zone iii in deep groundwater the shallow groundwater in zone iv had relatively higher ph values compared with deep groundwater the total dissolved solids tds concentration varied by a factor of approximately 20 from 122 to 2 840 mg l in groundwater samples 40 of which had tds concentrations higher than 1 000 mg l the high tds groundwater was seen primarily in the flat plain zones iii and iv fig 2 in the alluvial fan zone i ca2 and so4 2 and hco3 were the primary cation and anions respectively while na and cl were generally the major associated ions in the flat plain zones iii and iv fig 2a both hco3 and so4 2 concentrations were relatively constant from zones i to ii and increased largely with a downward gradient in zone iii fig 2a the median tds concentration of the surface water 812 mg l fig 2b was close to that of all groundwater samples 827 mg l the doc concentrations were comparable in the deep groundwater from zones i and ii which were much lower than those in zones iii and iv table s1 the dic concentrations detected in the laboratory were strongly correlated to monitored hco3 concentrations in the field figure s1 therefore the dic was used instead of the hco3 concentrations in this study the redox conditions generally varied from oxic suboxic to anoxic with median oxidation reduction potential orp values decreasing from 52 7 mv in zones i to 80 5 mv in zone iv table s1 accordingly higher fe ii concentrations were observed in deep groundwater from zone iii than those from zone ii and zone i fig 3 a the total dissolved as concentrations were geochemically distinct with a wide range from 0 33 to 946 μg l which gradually increased from zones i to iii for deep groundwater fig 3b however shallow groundwater in zone iv with low and high as concentrations was randomly distributed across the study site figure s2 most groundwater samples with high as concentrations in zones ii and iii had as iii as the main species 60 surface water samples typically had high orp values median 116 mv and low as concentrations median 9 36 μg l the no3 concentration varied largely from 0 01 to 172 mg l in the groundwater samples table s1 figure s3 half of which had a 0 2 mg l no3 concentration high no3 concentrations generally occurred in zone i while those in zones ii iii and iv were relatively lower figs 3c and s3 the no2 concentrations were typically low with a range of 0 01 to 0 19 mg l table s1 the nh4 concentrations showed a gradually increasing trend from zones i to iii fig 3d while those in zone iv varied largely from 0 04 to 7 6 mg l figure s4 surface water generally had a no3 lower than 1 0 mg l except for irrigation water containing 7 65 mg l no3 the nh4 concentrations in surface water were generally lower than the detection limit 3 2 environmental stable isotopes 3 2 1 hydrogen and oxygen isotopic signatures most water samples appeared near or to the right of the local meteoric water line lmwl δdh2o 5 8 δ18oh2o 12 7 fig 4 indicating the meteoric origin and strong evaporation during infiltration and recharge mihajlov et al 2016 groundwater samples in zone i generally had higher δdh2o and δ18oh2o relative to zone ii fig 4 as groundwater flows from zones i to ii fig 1 slightly higher δdh2o and δ18oh2o in the former zone were possibly due to waters recharged from higher elevations contributing to downslope aquifers batlle et al 2017 however both deep zone iii and shallow zone iv groundwater in the flat plain spanned large ranges of δdh2o and δ18oh2o fig 4 most of which were impacted by evaporation before recharge as judged by their distances from the lmwl mihajlov et al 2016 few differences in δdh2o and δ18oh2o were observed between deep zone iii and shallow zone iv groundwater in the flat plain fig 4 surface water was more strongly affected by evaporation as reflected by the relatively higher δdh2o and δ18oh2o compared with groundwater samples fig 4 3 2 2 carbon isotopic signatures median δ13cdic was highest in the deep groundwater of zone i 7 7 and lowest in the shallow groundwater of zone iv 11 9 with the deep groundwater of zones ii 8 0 and iii 10 0 in between table s1 in the flat plain δ13cdic spanned a wider range from 20 8 to 7 2 in zone iv than those in zone iii from 14 2 to 7 4 despite the lower δ13cdic in irrigation water 12 0 lake and drainage water samples exhibited much higher median values of δ13cdic with 8 3 however the median δ13cdoc of the four zones were comparable in groundwater samples table s1 variations in δ13cdoc among the surface water samples were also limited from 23 8 to 20 8 3 2 3 isotopic signatures of nitrate and ammonium the δ15nno3 δ18ono3 and δ15nnh4 were not detected in samples with low dissolved no3 and nh4 concentrations see table s2 groundwater no3 isotopic signatures showed great variations with δ15nno3 from 0 19 to 45 5 and δ18ono3 from 2 5 to 34 5 higher δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 typically occurred in zones ii and iii in deep groundwater fig 3e the δ15nno3 9 7 to 19 and δ18ono3 2 9 to 13 2 of surface water were higher than those in zone i but lower than in zones ii iii and iv values of δ15nnh4 in zone ii covered a wide range from 2 7 to 12 4 which were much higher than those in zones iii 5 3 to 6 3 and iv 13 2 to 5 1 in the flat plain fig 3f table s1 these values were comparable to the δ15nnh4 range of 8 5 to 23 8 in aquifers from the sichuan basin li et al 2007 4 discussion 4 1 sources and fates of no3 in groundwater 4 1 1 nitrification in zone i extremely high dissolved no3 concentrations up to 172 mg l being associated with low δ15nno3 6 3 to 10 7 and δ18ono3 2 5 to 3 0 were obtained in deep groundwater from zone i fig 5 this suggests the occurrence of nh4 nitrification in zone i previous studies have shown that δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 of newly formed no3 from in situ nh4 nitrification should theoretically be in the ranges of 2 to 10 and 10 to 10 respectively kendall 1998 lohse et al 2013 kelley et al 2013 or lower than 13 and close to 0 respectively böhlke et al 2006 yue et al 2014 heaton et al 2012 also attributed groundwater no3 up to 155 mg l to nh4 nitrification from malta with δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 from 7 7 to 11 7 and 3 1 to 6 1 respectively during nh4 nitrification one oxygen atom in no3 is derived from o2 and the other two are from h2o with expected δ18ono3 of δ18ono3 2 3 δ18oh2o 1 3 δ18oo2 xuan et al 2020 atmospheric o2 typically has δ18o 24 luz and barkan 2011 while groundwater δ18oh2o ranged from 10 7 to 9 6 in zone i table s1 fig 4 based on this the expected δ18ono3 should range from 0 9 to 1 6 which falls within the measured δ18ono3 range of 2 5 to 3 0 fig 5a additionally the δ15nno3 were positively correlated with δ18ono3 spearman r 0 94 p 0 000 with a δ15nno3 to δ18ono3 ratio of 0 93 fig 5a which is close to the ratio of 0 73 observed in an nh4 polluted water plume böhlke et al 2006 both δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 were relatively constant although the no3 concentrations varied by two orders of magnitude figs 5b and c the concentrations of nh4 were relatively low in zone i suggesting near complete nitrification of nh4 which is supported by the fact that δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 of the produced no3 were independent of the no3 concentrations figs 5b and c in addition a relatively low ph was observed in zone i table s1 which was likely related to proton production during nitrification smith et al 2006 therefore groundwater no3 in zone i was most likely originated from nh4 nitrification 4 1 2 denitrification in zones ii and iii and dnra in zone iv most samples from zones ii iii and iv satisfied δ15nno3 δ18ono3 fig 6 a which is different from the signatures of chemical fertilizer and precipitation with much higher δ18ono3 than δ15nno3 kendall et al 2007 wexler et al 2011 2012 this indicates that groundwater no3 was not sourced from chemical fertilizer and precipitation due to the suboxic to anoxic environments prevailing in the three zones the no3 should be recharged from the upper reaches where both organic nitrogen mineralization and nh4 nitrification occurred denitrification of no3 was supposed to occur in deep groundwater from zones ii and iii the strong reducing conditions and much higher doc no3 molar ratios favored dnra processes over denitrification in shallow groundwater from zone iv as discussed in section 4 2 3 as the effects of denitrification and dnra on the no3 concentration and isotopic signatures of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 were similar rivett et al 2008 we discuss their fractionation effects on δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 together in this section in zones ii iii and iv low no3 concentrations were associated with high δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 and vice versa fig 6 the lower left corner of fig 6a generally corresponds to higher no3 concentrations and 15nno3 and 18ono3 were enriched linearly along with a decreased no3 concentration denitrifying bacteria preferentially utilizes lighter nitrogen isotopes and therefore the remaining no3 gradually enriches in the 15nno3 and 18ono3 as the no3 is reduced during denitrification or dnra lohse et al 2013 the slope of the best fit line for the correlations between δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 indicates that the 15nno3 enrichment during no3 reduction was 1 9 times that of 18ono3 r 0 593 p 0 000 fig 6a the linear relationship between δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 and the enrichment of 15nno3 and 18ono3 accompanied by the reduction of no3 supports the occurrence of denitrification or dnra böhlke et al 2006 the fractionation factor of 1 9 falls in the range of 1 3 to 2 1 for denitrification as reported in other studies böttcher et al 1990 fukada et al 2003 wunderlich et al 2012 yi et al 2020 the observed preferential enrichment in 15nno3 relative to 18ono3 may be related to differences in the binding strengths of the 15n 16o and 14n 18o bonds or the involvement of 17o in the process fukada et al 2003 according to the rayleigh fractionation the relationships between the no3 concentrations and their isotopic signatures indicate enrichment factors from 5 9 to 2 2 for ε15nno3 fig 6b and 3 1 for ε18ono3 r 0 619 p 0 000 fig 6c the calculated enrichment factors were identical to those for wetlands ε15nno3 2 5 lund et al 2000 subsurface soil waters ε15nno3 1 1 to 0 9 lohse et al 2013 lacustrine water column ε15nno3 7 6 ε18ono3 5 1 wenk et al 2014 and riparian groundwater ε15nno3 10 6 to 3 3 ε18ono3 10 3 to 3 4 lutz et al 2020 however the ε15nno3 for natural systems spread towards the less negative end of 30 to 2 for incubation systems granger et al 2008 and references therein these less negative enrichment factors in natural systems may be related to the limited no3 supply and near complete no3 consumption wenk et al 2014 or lower denitrification rates due to lower organic matter bioavailability mariotti et al 1988 lehmann et al 2003 lohse et al 2013 4 1 3 potential electron donors for denitrification or dnra an increase in δ15nno3 and a decrease in δ13cdic were observed in groundwater from zones ii to iv fig 7 a which is regarded as an indicator of heterotrophic denitrification or dnra coupled to organic matter degradation microbial organic matter degradation could be further verified from the negative correlations between the dic concentrations and δ13cdic showing an enrichment factor ε13cdic of 2 6 r 0 556 p 0 000 fig 7b aravena and robertson 1998 also attributed the decrease in δ13cdic from 1 9 to 8 6 and the increase in δ15nno3 from 6 4 to 58 3 to heterotrophic denitrification processes this relationship was roughly assessed using a simple calculation in this study calculations of m1 and m2 fig 7a in a closed system with an initial no3 concentration of 24 9 mg l the highest no3 concentration in zones ii to iv table s1 initial δ15nno3 of 10 the maximum δ15nno3 from nh4 nitrification kendall 1998 initial dic concentration of 32 mg l the lowest dic concentration in zones ii to iv table s1 and initial δ13cdic of 10 9 the median of δ13cdic in zones ii to iv table s1 the groundwater was processed for heterotrophic denitrification or dnra with an ε15nno3 of 5 9 m1 or 2 2 m2 for reduced no3 fig 6b and an ε13cdic of 2 6 for the produced dic fig 7b in the m1 and m2 calculations the δ13cdic decreased significantly with an increasing δ15nno3 fig 7a however the decreased δ13cdic became gentler when δ15nno3 15 which is mainly due to the very low enrichment factor of ε13cdic this is reasonable because the produced dic may show a lower effect on δ13cdic as the dic concentration gradually increased kendall et al 2010 this phenomenon was verified experimentally in a heterotrophic denitrification matrix hosono et al 2015 therefore we suggest that organic matter should be an important electron donor for denitrification in deep groundwater and dnra processes in shallow groundwater in the deep groundwater of zones ii and iii dissolved nh4 was significantly positively correlated with dic concentration r 0 706 p 0 000 figure s5a and negatively with δ13cdic r 0 449 p 0 002 figure s5b which supports organic matter as the primary electron donor the δ15nno3 slightly increased with dic and nh4 concentrations figures s5c and d which is also indicative of heterotrophic denitrification heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria reduce the no3 which utilize organic matter as the electron donor and produce a 13c depleted dic nh4 and 15n enriched no3 widory et al 2005 otero et al 2009 suggested a positive correlation between δ15nno3 and dic concentration during heterotrophic denitrification although so4 2 concentrations of deep groundwater increased from zones ii to iii table s1 an increase in δ34sso4 has been reported guo et al 2016b which is analogous to the δ15nno3 signatures hence the increased so4 2 concentration should not be related to autotrophic denitrification with no3 and fes2 eq 2 heterotrophic denitrification utilizing organic matter should be the dominant process for no3 depletion in the deep groundwater of zones ii and iii in the shallow groundwater of zone iv increases in δ15nno3 and nh4 concentration were associated with the decrease in dic concentration in some samples figure s6a which may be due to autotrophic dnra process the process utilizes dic as the carbon source during no3 reduction and leads to increases in δ15nno3 and nh4 concentration and a decrease in dic concentration hosono et al 2015 simultaneously groundwater ph gradually increased following the increased δ15nno3 figure s7a showing favorable for autotrophic dnra processes robertson et al 2016 in the samples with autotrophic dnra the dissolved fe ii figure s6c and so4 2 concentrations figure s7b were lower which confirms fe ii oxidation and the absence of so4 2 production therefore we suggest that dissolved fe ii should act as the electron donor in autotrophic dnra dissolved fe ii in groundwater should be sourced from fe iii oxide reduction stimulated by organic matter degradation the fe iii oxide reduction releases fe ii which thereafter facilitates the dnra process in general although organic matter was an important electron donor fe ii fueled autotrophic dnra processes also occurred in some samples in zone iv 4 2 sources and transformation of nh4 in groundwater 4 2 1 organic matter degradation as the primary source of groundwater nh4 good positive correlations between the doc and nh4 concentrations in both deep r 0 504 p 0 000 figure s8a and shallow r 0 313 p 0 032 figure s8b groundwater support that nh4 was mainly sourced from organic matter degradation in both deep zones i ii and iii and shallow zone iv groundwater in deep groundwater dissolved nh4 concentrations were significantly correlated with the dic r 0 706 p 0 000 figure s5a and fe ii concentrations r 0 634 p 0 000 figure s8c also suggesting that the nh4 enrichment should be related to organic matter degradation harvey et al 2002 postma et al 2007 gao et al 2020 qiao et al 2020 the nitrogen isotopic composition of fertilizers typically nh4 and ureic compounds and manures used in the hetao basin had δ15n from 3 4 to 1 1 and from 4 0 to 8 1 respectively these values were in the ranges of groundwater δ15nnh4 13 2 to 12 4 table s1 which may also act as nh4 sources however the relative contribution of fertilizers and manures in deep groundwater from zones ii and iii should be less important as there were negligible phosphate concentrations observed gao et al 2020 4 2 2 feammox and anammox in zones ii and iii the δ15nnh4 of deep groundwater from zones ii and iii ranged from 5 3 to 12 4 fig 8 a showing a wider range than that from organic nitrogen mineralization of 3 9 to 4 1 scheiber et al 2016 nikolenko et al 2018 an enrichment in 15nnh4 was observed along with a decreased nh4 concentration fig 8a this may be related to nh4 consumption via oxidation since organic nitrogen mineralization generally has no isotopic fractionation brandes and devol 1997 under anoxic conditions feammox and anammox are the two major nh4 elimination processes the increased δ15nnh4 up to 12 4 together with fluctuations in δ15nno3 supports the co occurrence of feammox and anammox fig 8b although the relative importance of the two processes could not be delineated feammox and anammox were previously reported to simultaneously contribute to nh4 loss in an intertidal wetland li et al 2015 the occurrence of feammox in deep groundwater from the hetao basin has been evidenced by the 16s rrna gene sequencing xiu et al 2020 groundwater in zone ii had higher δ15nnh4 than in zone iii fig 8a indicating stronger feammox there this is also supported by higher fe iii oxide contents and lower organic matter degradation rates in zone ii compared with zone iii gao et al 2020 a stronger feammox is typically related to lower organic matter degradation rates and higher sedimentary fe iii oxide contents ding et al 2014 the contribution of the feammox process to nh4 loss could be relatively high from 67 to 78 in uncultivated and paddy soils ding et al 2014 from 47 to 72 in tropical upland soil yang et al 2012 and from 80 to 86 5 in riparian zones ding et al 2017 anammox is also an important fate for deep groundwater nh4 from zones ii and iii the coexistence of nh4 and no3 and weak alkaline ph conditions table s1 are favorable for anammox process tomaszewski et al 2017 the increased δ15nnh4 along with nh4 consumption was precisely matched by rayleigh fractionation with an enrichment factor of 4 2 for ε15nnh4 r 0 752 p 0 000 fig 8a this is within the range of enrichment factors from 8 to 4 for anammox clark et al 2008 robertson et al 2012 nikolenko et al 2018 the anammox process has a stronger fractionation effect on δ18ono3 than δ15nno3 lamontagne et al 2018 this may explain the fact that the median δ15nno3 in zone iii 17 4 was lower than that in zone ii 19 7 while the median δ18ono3 in zone iii 9 4 vs 8 9 in zone ii was slightly higher table s1 the slightly lower δ15nnh4 5 3 can be explained by the isotopic fractionation ε15nnh4 of 1 0 böhlke et al 2006 of nh4 adsorption fig 8a 4 2 3 dnra and anammox in zone iv in the shallow groundwater of zone iv the δ15nnh4 ranged from 13 0 to 5 1 fig 8c which is lower than that expected from organic nitrogen mineralization scheiber et al 2016 nikolenko et al 2018 the limited fractionation effect of nh4 adsorption on the δ15nnh4 signature ε15nnh4 with 1 cannot explain these low δ15nnh4 fig 8c the dnra reaction was the only process that could result in a low δ15nnh4 with high nh4 concentrations although no fractionation data have been available until recently nikolenko et al 2018 much higher doc no3 molar ratios were observed in the shallow groundwater from zone iv median 161 mol mol than in the deep groundwater from zones i median 0 35 mol mol ii median 1 46 mol mol and iii median 3 63 mol mol fig 9 a previous studies have indicated that a high doc no3 molar ratio is favorable for the occurrence of dnra rütting et al 2011 hardison et al 2015 salk et al 2017 nikolenko et al 2018 porubsky et al 2009 suggested that dnra should be favored over denitrification with doc no3 molar ratios above 50 although a significantly lower threshold of 10 was reported hardison et al 2015 a positive correlation between δ15nnh4 and δ13cdic in most shallow groundwater samples fig 9b shows that δ15nnh4 is related to the extent of organic matter degradation suggesting heterotrophic dnra however the increased δ15nno3 and nh4 concentrations following the decreased dic concentrations of specific samples indicates the occurrence of autotrophic dnra figure s6a field data support that dissolved fe ii fueled the autotrophic dnra process figure s7 see section 4 1 3 therefore both heterotrophic and autotrophic dnra processes occurred in zone iv the availability of organic matter and fe ii determines whether the dnra process was heterotrophic or autotrophic robertson and thamdrup 2017 rahman et al 2019 lower nh4 concentrations with higher δ15nnh4 fig 8c occurred in groundwater samples with high no2 concentrations 0 11 to 0 19 mg l in zone iv figure s6b unlike deep groundwater from zones ii and iii low nh4 concentrations were associated with high δ15nno3 figure s6b the δ15nno3 was significantly positively correlated with δ15nnh4 in zone iv r 0 6 p 0 023 fig 8d these results support that nh4 and no3 are jointly processed via nh4 anammox which is consistent with the observations from others clark et al 2008 lamontagne et al 2018 during the process 15n depleted no3 was firstly reduced to no2 and was thereafter processed for reactions with nh4 oxidation brunner et al 2013 the no2 concentrations of these samples median 0 11 mg l figure s6b were one order of magnitude higher than those of the other samples median 0 02 mg l the no2 level in these samples may be sufficient to trigger anammox since the anammox rate is relatively high even at 0 15 mg l no2 based on incubation experiments thamdrup and dalsgaard 2002 trimmer et al 2003 concentrations of nh4 for these samples ranged from 1 to 2 mg l figure s6b which could support the high anammox rate babbin and ward 2013 in nh4 limited conditions anammox microbes can even mediate dnra to produce nh4 to facilitate the anammox process song et al 2016 the dnra coupled to anammox has also been observed in marine salk et al 2017 estuary plummer et al 2015 and riparian groundwaters wang et al 2019a a previous study has concluded that anammox could make a major contribution as a nitrogen sink from 36 8 to 79 5 in aquifer systems around the world wang et al 2019b 4 3 arsenic mobility in nitrogen cycling systems elevated dissolved as concentrations are typically found in no3 depleted and nh4 rich groundwater fig 10 in deep groundwater elevated as concentrations correspond to low dissolved no3 concentrations fig 10a and high δ15nno3 r 0 469 p 0 018 fig 10b which is consistent with previous studies senn and hemond 2002 weng et al 2017 among the high as groundwater samples 10 μg l 75 of samples contained 0 5 mg l no3 which is the threshold for the occurrence of fe iii oxide reduction mcmahon and chapelle 2007 dissolved as was strongly positively correlated with the fe ii concentration in zones ii and iii r 0 679 p 0 000 fig 10c suggesting the primary contribution of fe iii oxide reduction stimulated by organic matter degradation to as enrichment guo et al 2014 qiao et al 2020 this was further evidenced by the strong positive correlations between dissolved nh4 and as r 0 85 p 0 000 fig 10e and fe ii concentrations r 0 634 p 0 000 figure s8c and negative correlation between dissolved as concentrations and δ15nnh4 r 0 662 p 0 000 fig 10f this is because dissolved nh4 is considered as a proxy for organic matter degradation harvey et al 2002 postma et al 2007 during the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides stimulated by organic matter degradation both fe ii and nh4 may be released into groundwater the bounded as v is mobilized and simultaneously reduced to as iii fendorf et al 2010 which is more mobile under reducing conditions dixit and hering 2003 by using cross correlations among δ15nnh4 and fe ii and as concentrations as illustrated in fig 11 a conceptual model concerning the as mobility as influenced by different nitrogen cycling processes in various redox zones is proposed accordingly fig 12 in the alluvial fan under oxic conditions zone i electrons from sedimentary or dissolved organic matter degradation facilitates o2 reduction subsequently the released nh4 is oxidized into no3 via the nitrification process fig 12 dissolved fe ii and as were low in this zone which is mainly due to the strong as adsorption on fe iii oxides fig 12 the produced no3 was an important source of groundwater no3 in the zone ii down gradient in deep groundwater from zones ii and iii the groundwater environment evolved to suboxic anoxic conditions where organic matter degradation began to stimulate fe iii oxide reduction fig 12 nitrate was partially denitrified in these two zones leading to higher δ15nno3 in the residual no3 than the δ15nno3 produced from nh4 nitrification in zone i table s1 fig 12 during fe iii oxide reduction triggered by organic matter degradation fig 12 the groundwater fe ii nh4 and as concentrations gradually increased with a relatively constant δ15nnh4 pathway i fig 11a in addition nh4 oxidation was coupled to fe iii oxide reduction via a feammox process fig 12 which led to lower dissolved nh4 concentrations fig 8a slightly higher fe ii and as concentrations and much higher δ15nnh4 as denoted by pathway ii in fig 11a strong positive correlations have been observed between the fe iii oxide reduction and the nh4 feammox rate in incubations with paddy soils ding et al 2014 and wetland sediment li et al 2015 therefore higher feammox rates may indicate higher as concentrations due to stronger fe iii oxide reduction oxidation of nh4 coupled to no3 no2 reduction anammox may also occur fig 12 a stronger anammox is favored at higher no3 doc molar ratios kraft et al 2014 plummer et al 2015 smith et al 2015 although most of the groundwater in zones ii and iii had no3 doc molar ratios 0 4 much higher values up to 2 were observed in samples following the anammox pathway figure s9 higher no3 senn and hemond 2002 and lower doc concentrations guo et al 2019 are typically related to lower dissolved fe ii and as concentrations these are mainly due to fe ii oxidation into fe iii oxides from the high level of no3 which sequestered dissolved as smith et al 2017 in addition there are limited fe iii oxide reduction and as release with low doc concentrations mcarthur et al 2004 therefore samples encountering stronger anammox reactions should have lower fe ii nh4 and as concentrations and higher δ15nnh4 as shown by pathway iii in fig 11a herein the feammox and anammox processes shown in fig 8a are separated in terms of both dissolved fe ii and as concentrations and δ15nnh4 fig 11a furthermore δ15nnh4 seemed to be slightly lower following the nh4 and fe ii adsorption pathway in zone iii pathway iv figs 8a and 11a leaving the dissolved as concentration being less influenced fig 11a this suggests that dissolved nh4 fe ii and as should be not adsorbed on the same surface sites nguyen et al 2014 norrman et al 2015 in shallow groundwater from the flat plain zone iv nh4 oxidation via the anammox process also resulted in a high δ15nnh4 and low nh4 fe ii and as concentrations in zone iv pathway iii fig 11b following the anammox pathway as indicated by a decreased nh4 concentration and increased δ15nno3 both the dissolved fe ii and as concentrations decreased figures s6d and f the extent of anammox reactions in this zone appears to be much stronger than that in zones ii and iii as the dissolved as concentrations were much lower 10 μg l following pathway iii in zone iv fig 11b the low dissolved fe ii and as concentrations following the anammox pathway may be due to the relatively high dissolved no2 concentrations in these samples figures s6b although the no2 concentration shows little influence on the anammox process trimmer et al 2003 it may chemically or microbially oxidize fe ii to fe iii oxides and thereby sequester as park et al 2018 in addition a much lower δ15nnh4 was found in samples with either low or high nh4 fig 8c and fe ii concentrations fig 11b ammonium adsorption may explain the low δ15nnh4 and nh4 concentrations both nh4 and fe ii can be adsorbed onto the same adsorption sites on the sediment surface the extent to which is related to the clay mineral contents schubert and calvert 2001 therefore samples encountering nh4 and fe ii adsorption may have low nh4 and fe ii concentrations and a low δ15nnh4 but show little influence on the dissolved as concentrations pathway iv fig 11b nguyen et al 2014 have suggested that as iii adsorption onto the red river floodplain sediments should be uninfluenced by fe ii adsorption thus adsorptions of the two species were uncoupled however the association of a low δ15nnh4 with a high nh4 concentration fig 8c may be related to the dnra process which was associated with either low or high dissolved fe ii and as concentrations fig 11b the dnra organisms may be processed via heterotrophic or autotrophic pathways or both depending on the availability of organic matter and fe ii robertson and thamdrup 2017 if dnra processes are heterotrophically coupled to the organic matter degradation pathway v fig 11b the aquifers with a dnra imprint may have high fe iii oxide reduction rates as dnra occurs in environments with high organic matter degradation rates hardison et al 2015 therefore heterotrophic dnra leads to high fe ii and as concentrations due to the extensive reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides however if the dnra is autotrophically processed via fe ii oxidation pathway vi fig 11b the dnra rates increase significantly from the oxidation of dissolved fe ii robertson and thamdrup 2017 rahman et al 2019 li et al 2020 following the autotrophic dnra pathway indicated from high δ15nno3 and low dic concentrations both dissolved fe ii and as concentrations decreased significantly figures s6c and e roberts et al 2014 showed that the dissolved fe ii concentration decreased significantly during the autotrophic dnra process during autotrophic dnra fe ii was oxidized into fe iii oxides which sequestered the dissolved as to sum up organic matter degradation and fe iii oxide reduction should be the primary processes that control the groundwater nh4 fe ii and as concentrations which are thereafter influenced by anammox dnra and adsorption processes in zone iv fig 12 5 conclusions a detailed picture of the nitrogen cycling processes and their impacts on as mobility were presented based on multi isotopic signatures and cross correlations among dissolved nitrogen species fe ii and as concentrations in the study area groundwater nh4 was primarily sourced from organic nitrogen mineralization in the four considered zones negative δ15nnh4 low to 13 2 being associated with extremely high doc no3 molar ratios up to 406 mol mol supports dnra as an important nh4 source in zone iv gradually enriched 15nnh4 coupled to nh4 loss suggests nh4 removal via oxidation under anoxic conditions which were further distinguished as feammox in zones ii and iii and anammox in zones ii iii and iv from enriched 15nnh4 following increased and decreased fe ii concentrations respectively the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 signatures suggest that the high dissolved no3 concentration in zone i should be primarily derived from nh4 nitrification which was discharged to aquifers downstream nitrate reduction accompanied by linearly increases in δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 together with distinct groundwater doc no3 molar ratios identified dentrification in zones ii and iii and dnra in zone iv as no3 sinks the impacts of nitrogen cycling on as mobility were mainly mediated by the redox couple of fe iii oxides and dissolved fe ii under anoxic conditions organic matter including organic nitrogen mineralization facilitated fe iii oxide reduction and thereby release of fe ii and as the fe iii oxide reduction via nh4 feammox occurred in zones ii and iii and increased fe ii and as mobility however environments favored anammox under higher no3 doc molar ratio zones ii and iii or higher no2 concentrations zone iv favored fe ii oxidation to fe iii oxides which thus sequestered as heterotrophic dnra in zone iv with extremely high doc no3 molar ratio was conducive to fe iii oxide reduction and as release while fe ii fueled autotrophic dnra promoted as immobilization in groundwater systems quantifying relative importance of these coexisting nitrogen cycling processes in nitrogen species fe ii and as behavior is needed in future studies which could be accomplished by using multi process based reactive transport models and or in situ 15no3 and 15nh4 tracer tests credit authorship contribution statement zhipeng gao writing original draft visualization

4759,sources and co cycling of nitrogen species in arsenic prone groundwater remain poorly understood which could affect arsenic behavior here geochemical and multi isotopic characteristics of groundwater from various redox environments were investigated to reveal the effects of nitrogen cycling on arsenic mobility in groundwater systems from the hetao basin in china in deep groundwater along an approximate flow path from the alluvial fan zone i through the transition area zone ii and to the flat plain zone iii a progressive no3 depletion with gradually increased δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 occurred accompanied by increases in dissolved nh4 fe ii and arsenic concentrations and a decrease in δ15nnh4 shallow groundwater in the flat plain zone iv covered wider ranges of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 and relatively lower δ15nnh4 organic nitrogen mineralization contributed primarily to nh4 release in all zones and dissimilatory no3 reduction to nh4 dnra was an important nh4 source in zone iv while nh4 loss mainly occurred via nitrification in zone i anaerobic nh4 oxidation was coupled to fe iii oxide reduction feammox in zones ii and iii and to no2 reduction anammox in zones ii iii and iv groundwater no3 was reduced via heterotrophic denitrification in zones ii and iii while the dnra was favored over denitrification in zone iv with much higher doc no3 molar ratios feammox and heterotrophic dnra increased the dissolved fe ii and arsenic concentrations via the enhanced fe iii oxide reduction however anammox and fe ii fueled autotrophic dnra decreased their concentrations due to limited fe iii oxide reduction and or enhanced fe ii oxidation the influences of nitrogen cycling on arsenic behavior are mainly mediated by transformations between fe iii oxides and dissolved fe

concentrations are limited rivett et al 2008 kraft et al 2014 nitrite produced from no3 denitrification may facilitate anaerobic nh4 oxidation coupled to no2 reduction termed anammox in the presence

ubiquitous nh4 retardation process in aquifers böhlke et al 2006 nikolenko et al 2018 characterizing sources and natural cycling processes with respect to no3 and nh4 in groundwater has been of

norrman et al 2015 smith et al 2017 weng et al 2017 xiu et al 2020 low dissolved as concentrations generally occur in oxic suboxic aquifers with elevated no3 concentrations due to strong as adsorption on fe iii oxides senn and hemond 2002 smith et al 2017 ammonium is believed to be primarily sourced from microbially mediated organic matter degradation which facilitates fe iii oxide reduction and thereby releases fe ii and as harvey et al 2002 elevated nh4 concentrations have been regarded as a proxy of high organic matter degradation rates and as concentrations dowling et al 2002 postma et al 2007 gao et al 2020 feammox anammox and dnra processes may take place in groundwater and influence nh4 concentrations a microbial study indicated that feammox may occur under favorable conditions in aquifers xiu et al 2020 however the distributions of feammox anammox and dnra in high as containing groundwater and their effects on dissolved fe ii and as concentrations remain unclear therefore knowledge of nitrogen species cycling is crucial in revealing the mechanisms of as enrichment in aquifer systems by using multi nitrogen isotopes most studies focused on delineating nitrogen behavior and fate nikolenko et al 2018 and references therein liang et al 2020 but few studies explained the relationship between nitrogen cycling and as enrichment processes smith et al 2017 weng et al 2017

from alluvial pluvial aquifers in the hetao basin of china were investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the hetao basin is a typical alluvial pluvial basin and is located north of the yellow river and south of the langshan mountains in the northwest of inner mongolia china fig 1 our previous studies have shown that aquifers in the study area can be divided into three redox zones the alluvial fan transition area and flat plain guo et al 2016a gao et al 2020 the alluvial fan is located in the recharge area under oxic conditions the transition area is situated between the alluvial fan and the flat plain under moderate reducing conditions and the flat plain lies far from the mountain under strong reducing conditions jia et al 2014 the depth of the water table is around 20 m below the land surface bls in the alluvial fan and decreases to approximately 1 m bls in the flat plain deep groundwater flows primarily from the alluvial fan through the transition area and to the flat plain fig 1c with flow rates from 0 002 to 0 2 m d guo et al 2016a in the alluvial fan near the mountain margin the lithology is mainly gravel and coarse and medium sand with a large hydraulic gradient high permeability and fast groundwater flow rates in the flat plain far from mountains the stratigraphic lithology is generally characterized as an interbedding of silt and fine sands rich in organic matter with a relatively low hydraulic gradient and groundwater flow rates borehole lithological data show that clay layers lie primarily at depths of 5 and 40 m bls therefore aquifers overlying clay layers at a depth of 40 m 40 m bls host shallow groundwater while aquifers beneath the clay layers are regarded as semi confined or confined aquifers and host deep groundwater gao et al 2020 groundwater is recharged mostly by vertical infiltration of precipitation irrigation channels and irrigation water and is discharged mainly via evapotranspiration drainage and pumping 2 2 water sampling and analysis one hundred and five water samples including 100 groundwater samples three drainage water samples one irrigation water sample and one lake water sample were collected in the study area in july 2017 fig 1 groundwater was mainly taken from deep irrigation and shallow domestic wells including nine deep groundwater samples in the alluvial fan zone i 21 deep groundwater samples in the transition area zone ii 23 deep groundwater samples in the flat plain zone iii and 47 shallow groundwater samples in the flat plain zone iv at the field site concentrations of h2s fe ii no2 and nh4 were determined using a portable spectrophotometer hach dr2800 the alkalinity was analyzed using a digital titrator hach model 16900 with a bromocresol green methyl red indicator all samples were filtered using 0 45 μm membrane filters the samples for detecting cations and trace elements were collected and preserved with 6 mol l hno3 ph 2 and samples for as species used 0 25 mol l edta 10 samples for anion detections were unacidified the samples for δdh2o and δ18oh2o analyses were collected in 2 ml glass bottles that were filled with no headspace for dissolved inorganic carbon dic and δ13cdic analyses samples were collected in amber glass bottles and preserved with 0 2 ml saturated hgcl2 the samples used for doc and δ13cdoc analyses and for nitrogen and oxygen isotope detections i e δ15nno3 δ18ono3 and δ15nnh4 were collected in 20 ml brown glass bottles and 125 ml polyethylene bottles respectively samples for doc analysis were acidified to a ph 2 using hcl and those for nitrogen isotope detections were acidified with hcl to avoid nh4 volatilization at the field site all groundwater samples were immediately stored in a mobile refrigerator 4 c and transported to the lab after returning to the laboratory samples for δ15nno3 δ18ono3 and δ15nnh4 analyses were frozen immediately and stored at 20 c all other samples were stored at 4 c before the analysis and were analyzed within one week details on sample collections and laboratory analyses are given in the supporting information 2 3 stable isotope analyses the stable isotopes of δdh2o and δ18oh2o were measured using a high precision laser isotope analyzer picarro l2120 i stable isotopes of δ13cdic and δ13cdoc were determined using isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms mat 253 thermo fisher scientific in conjunction with an online high precision gas headspace sampler gasbench thermo fisher scientific stable isotopes of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 for no3 were determined using the denitrifier method sigman et al 2001 briefly the no3 in water samples was first converted to n2o by the denitrifying bacteria that lack n2o reductase activity pseudomonas aureofaciens then n2o was transported to a trace gas analyzer using a gilson automatic sampler after being extracted and purified the isotope values of n2o were analyzed using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms in a laboratory of the environmental stable isotope chinese academy of agricultural sciences all samples were prepared in duplicate with batches containing water blanks and relevant international standards i e iaea n3 usgs 34 and usgs 35 the stable isotope δ15nnh4 was analyzed using a chemical conversion method zhang et al 2007 briefly the dissolved nh4 in the water samples was firstly oxidized to no2 through the addition of sodium bromate after removing the excessive bro with a 20 acetic acid solution no2 was further reduced to n2o using a 1 1 sodium azide and acetic acid the final product n2o was then analyzed for isotopic composition using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms in a laboratory of the third institute of oceanography ministry of natural resources of china isotope values for the water samples were reported as δ in relative to working standard eq 4 4 δ r sample r standard 1 1000 where rsample indicates the ratio of heavy to light isotopes in the water samples e g 18o 16o rstandard represents the ratio of heavy to light isotopes for working standard d and o isotopes relative to v smow c isotopes relative to v pdb and n isotopes relative to air n2 based on replicate measurements of a reference standard the analytical precisions of δdh2o and δ18oh2o were better than 1 and 0 1 respectively δ13cdic and δ13cdoc were within 0 2 δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 were within 0 5 and δ15nnh4 was within 0 3 in a mean standard deviation 2 4 rayleigh fractionation model and calculations in a closed system isotope fractionation can be evaluated using a rayleigh fractionation according

nitrogen species the physicochemical parameters of water samples are summarized in table s1 and fig 2 the groundwater ph spread over a wide range of 7 04 8 66 which generally increased from zones i to ii and slightly decreased in zone iii in deep groundwater the shallow groundwater in zone iv had relatively higher ph values compared with deep groundwater the total dissolved solids tds concentration varied by a factor of approximately 20 from 122 to 2 840 mg l in groundwater samples 40 of which had tds concentrations higher than 1 000 mg l the high tds groundwater was seen primarily in the flat plain zones iii and iv fig 2 in the alluvial fan zone i ca2 and so4 2 and hco3 were the primary cation and anions respectively while na and cl were generally the major associated ions in the flat plain zones iii and iv fig 2a both hco3 and so4 2 concentrations were relatively constant from zones i to ii and increased largely with a downward gradient in zone iii fig 2a the median tds concentration of the surface water 812 mg l fig 2b was close to that of all groundwater samples 827 mg l the doc concentrations were comparable in the deep groundwater from zones i and ii which were much lower than those in zones iii and iv table s1 the dic concentrations detected in the laboratory were strongly correlated to monitored hco3 concentrations in the field figure s1 therefore the dic was used instead of the hco3 concentrations in this study the redox conditions generally varied from oxic suboxic to anoxic with median oxidation reduction potential orp values decreasing from 52 7 mv in zones i to 80 5 mv in zone iv table s1 accordingly higher fe ii concentrations were observed in deep groundwater from zone iii than those from zone ii and zone i fig 3 a the total dissolved as concentrations were geochemically distinct with a wide range from 0 33 to 946 μg l which gradually increased from zones i to iii for deep groundwater fig 3b however shallow groundwater in zone iv with low and high as concentrations was randomly distributed across the study site figure s2 most groundwater samples with high as concentrations in zones ii and iii had as iii as the main species 60 surface water samples typically had high orp values median 116 mv and low as concentrations median 9 36 μg l the no3 concentration varied largely from 0 01 to 172 mg l in the groundwater samples table s1 figure s3 half of which had a 0 2 mg l no3 concentration high no3 concentrations generally occurred in zone i while those in zones ii iii and iv were relatively lower figs 3c and s3 the no2 concentrations were typically low with a range of 0 01 to 0 19 mg l table s1 the nh4 concentrations showed a gradually increasing trend from zones i to iii fig 3d while those in zone iv varied largely from 0 04 to 7 6 mg l figure s4 surface water generally had a no3 lower than 1 0 mg l except for irrigation water containing 7 65 mg l no3 the nh4 concentrations in surface water were generally lower than the detection limit 3 2 environmental stable isotopes 3 2 1 hydrogen and oxygen isotopic signatures most water samples appeared near or to the right of the local meteoric water line lmwl δdh2o 5 8 δ18oh2o 12 7 fig 4 indicating the meteoric origin and strong evaporation during infiltration and recharge mihajlov et al 2016 groundwater samples in zone i generally had higher δdh2o and δ18oh2o relative to zone ii fig 4 as groundwater flows from zones i to ii fig 1 slightly higher δdh2o and δ18oh2o in the former zone were possibly due to waters recharged from higher elevations contributing to downslope aquifers batlle et al 2017 however both deep zone iii and shallow zone iv groundwater in the flat plain spanned large ranges of δdh2o and δ18oh2o fig 4 most of which were impacted by evaporation before recharge as judged by their distances from the lmwl mihajlov et al 2016 few differences in δdh2o and δ18oh2o were observed between deep zone iii and shallow zone iv groundwater in the flat plain fig 4 surface water was more strongly affected by evaporation as reflected by the relatively higher δdh2o and δ18oh2o compared with groundwater samples fig 4 3 2 2 carbon isotopic signatures median δ13cdic was highest in the deep groundwater of zone i 7 7 and lowest in the shallow groundwater of zone iv 11 9 with the deep groundwater of zones ii 8 0 and iii 10 0 in between table s1 in the flat plain δ13cdic spanned a wider range from 20 8 to 7 2 in zone iv than those in zone iii from 14 2 to 7 4 despite the lower δ13cdic in irrigation water 12 0 lake and drainage water samples exhibited much higher median values of δ13cdic with 8 3 however the median δ13cdoc of the four zones were comparable in groundwater samples table s1 variations in δ13cdoc among the surface water samples were also limited from 23 8 to 20 8 3 2 3 isotopic signatures of nitrate and ammonium the δ15nno3 δ18ono3 and δ15nnh4 were not detected in samples with low dissolved no3 and nh4 concentrations see table s2 groundwater no3 isotopic signatures showed great variations with δ15nno3 from 0 19 to 45 5 and δ18ono3 from 2 5 to 34 5 higher δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 typically occurred in zones ii and iii in deep groundwater fig 3e the δ15nno3 9 7 to 19 and δ18ono3 2 9 to 13 2 of surface water were higher than those in zone i but lower than in zones ii iii and iv values of δ15nnh4 in zone ii covered a wide range from 2 7 to 12 4 which were much higher than those in zones iii 5 3 to 6 3 and iv 13 2 to 5 1 in the flat plain fig 3f table s1 these values were comparable to the δ15nnh4 range of 8 5 to 23 8 in aquifers from the sichuan basin li et al 2007 4 discussion 4 1 sources and fates of no3 in groundwater 4 1 1 nitrification in zone i extremely high dissolved no3 concentrations up to 172 mg l being associated with low δ15nno3 6 3 to 10 7 and δ18ono3 2 5 to 3 0 were obtained in deep groundwater from zone i fig 5 this suggests the occurrence of nh4 nitrification in zone i previous studies have shown that δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 of newly formed no3 from in situ nh4 nitrification should theoretically be in the ranges of 2 to 10 and 10 to 10 respectively kendall 1998 lohse et al 2013 kelley et al 2013 or lower than 13 and close to 0 respectively böhlke et al 2006 yue et al 2014 heaton et al 2012 also attributed groundwater no3 up to 155 mg l to nh4 nitrification from malta with δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 from 7 7 to 11 7 and 3 1 to 6 1 respectively during nh4 nitrification one oxygen atom in no3 is derived from o2 and the other two are from h2o with expected δ18ono3 of δ18ono3 2 3 δ18oh2o 1 3 δ18oo2 xuan et al 2020 atmospheric o2 typically has δ18o 24 luz and barkan 2011 while groundwater δ18oh2o ranged from 10 7 to 9 6 in zone i table s1 fig 4 based on this the expected δ18ono3 should range from 0 9 to 1 6 which falls within the measured δ18ono3 range of 2 5 to 3 0 fig 5a additionally the δ15nno3 were positively correlated with δ18ono3 spearman r 0 94 p 0 000 with a δ15nno3 to δ18ono3 ratio of 0 93 fig 5a which is close to the ratio of 0 73 observed in an nh4 polluted water plume böhlke et al 2006 both δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 were relatively constant although the no3 concentrations varied by two orders of magnitude figs 5b and c the concentrations of nh4 were relatively low in zone i suggesting near complete nitrification of nh4 which is supported by the fact that δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 of the produced no3 were independent of the no3 concentrations figs 5b and c in addition a relatively low ph was observed in zone i table s1 which was likely related to proton production during nitrification smith et al 2006 therefore groundwater no3 in zone i was most likely originated from nh4 nitrification 4 1 2 denitrification in zones ii and iii and dnra in zone iv most samples from zones ii iii and iv satisfied δ15nno3 δ18ono3 fig 6 a which is different from the signatures of chemical fertilizer and precipitation with much higher δ18ono3 than δ15nno3 kendall et al 2007 wexler et al 2011 2012 this indicates that groundwater no3 was not sourced from chemical fertilizer and precipitation due to the suboxic to anoxic environments prevailing in the three zones the no3 should be recharged from the upper reaches where both organic nitrogen mineralization and nh4 nitrification occurred denitrification of no3 was supposed to occur in deep groundwater from zones ii and iii the strong reducing conditions and much higher doc no3 molar ratios favored dnra processes over denitrification in shallow groundwater from zone iv as discussed in section 4 2 3 as the effects of denitrification and dnra on the no3 concentration and isotopic signatures of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 were similar rivett et al 2008 we discuss their fractionation effects on δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 together in this section in zones ii iii and iv low no3 concentrations were associated with high δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 and vice versa fig 6 the lower left corner of fig 6a generally corresponds to higher no3 concentrations and 15nno3 and 18ono3 were enriched linearly along with a decreased no3 concentration denitrifying bacteria preferentially utilizes lighter nitrogen isotopes and therefore the remaining no3 gradually enriches in the 15nno3 and 18ono3 as the no3 is reduced during denitrification or dnra lohse et al 2013 the slope of the best fit line for the correlations between δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 indicates that the 15nno3 enrichment during no3 reduction was 1 9 times that of 18ono3 r 0 593 p 0 000 fig 6a the linear relationship between δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 and the enrichment of 15nno3 and 18ono3 accompanied by the reduction of no3 supports the occurrence of denitrification or dnra böhlke et al 2006 the fractionation factor of 1 9 falls in the range of 1 3 to 2 1 for denitrification as reported in other studies böttcher et al 1990 fukada et al 2003 wunderlich et al 2012 yi et al 2020 the observed preferential enrichment in 15nno3 relative to 18ono3 may be related to differences in the binding strengths of the 15n 16o and 14n 18o bonds or the involvement of 17o in the process fukada et al 2003 according to the rayleigh fractionation the relationships between the no3 concentrations and their isotopic signatures indicate enrichment factors from 5 9 to 2 2 for ε15nno3 fig 6b and 3 1 for ε18ono3 r 0 619 p 0 000 fig 6c the calculated enrichment factors were identical to those for wetlands ε15nno3 2 5 lund et al 2000 subsurface soil waters ε15nno3 1 1 to 0 9 lohse et al 2013 lacustrine water column ε15nno3 7 6 ε18ono3 5 1 wenk et al 2014 and riparian groundwater ε15nno3 10 6 to 3 3 ε18ono3 10 3 to 3 4 lutz et al 2020 however the ε15nno3 for natural systems spread towards the less negative end of 30 to 2 for incubation systems granger et al 2008 and references therein these less negative enrichment factors in natural systems may be related to the limited no3 supply and near complete no3 consumption wenk et al 2014 or lower denitrification rates due to lower organic matter bioavailability mariotti et al 1988 lehmann et al 2003 lohse et al 2013 4 1 3 potential electron donors for denitrification or dnra an increase in δ15nno3 and a decrease in δ13cdic were observed in groundwater from zones ii to iv fig 7 a which is regarded as an indicator of heterotrophic denitrification or dnra coupled to organic matter degradation microbial organic matter degradation could be further verified from the negative correlations between the dic concentrations and δ13cdic showing an enrichment factor ε13cdic of 2 6 r 0 556 p 0 000 fig 7b aravena and robertson 1998 also attributed the decrease in δ13cdic from 1 9 to 8 6 and the increase in δ15nno3 from 6 4 to 58 3 to heterotrophic denitrification processes this relationship was roughly assessed using a simple calculation in this study calculations of m1 and m2 fig 7a in a closed system with an initial no3 concentration of 24 9 mg l the highest no3 concentration in zones ii to iv table s1 initial δ15nno3 of 10 the maximum δ15nno3 from nh4 nitrification kendall 1998 initial dic concentration of 32 mg l the lowest dic concentration in zones ii to iv table s1 and initial δ13cdic of 10 9 the median of δ13cdic in zones ii to iv table s1 the groundwater was processed for heterotrophic denitrification or dnra with an ε15nno3 of 5 9 m1 or 2 2 m2 for reduced no3 fig 6b and an ε13cdic of 2 6 for the produced dic fig 7b in the m1 and m2 calculations the δ13cdic decreased significantly with an increasing δ15nno3 fig 7a however the decreased δ13cdic became gentler when δ15nno3 15 which is mainly due to the very low enrichment factor of ε13cdic this is reasonable because the produced dic may show a lower effect on δ13cdic as the dic concentration gradually increased kendall et al 2010 this phenomenon was verified experimentally in a heterotrophic denitrification matrix hosono et al 2015 therefore we suggest that organic matter should be an important electron donor for denitrification in deep groundwater and dnra processes in shallow groundwater in the deep groundwater of zones ii and iii dissolved nh4 was significantly positively correlated with dic concentration r 0 706 p 0 000 figure s5a and negatively with δ13cdic r 0 449 p 0 002 figure s5b which supports organic matter as the primary electron donor the δ15nno3 slightly increased with dic and nh4 concentrations figures s5c and d which is also indicative of heterotrophic denitrification heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria reduce the no3 which utilize organic matter as the electron donor and produce a 13c depleted dic nh4 and 15n enriched no3 widory et al 2005 otero et al 2009 suggested a positive correlation between δ15nno3 and dic concentration during heterotrophic denitrification although so4 2 concentrations of deep groundwater increased from zones ii to iii table s1 an increase in δ34sso4 has been reported guo et al 2016b which is analogous to the δ15nno3 signatures hence the increased so4 2 concentration should not be related to autotrophic denitrification with no3 and fes2 eq 2 heterotrophic denitrification utilizing organic matter should be the dominant process for no3 depletion in the deep groundwater of zones ii and iii in the shallow groundwater of zone iv increases in δ15nno3 and nh4 concentration were associated with the decrease in dic concentration in some samples figure s6a which may be due to autotrophic dnra process the process utilizes dic as the carbon source during no3 reduction and leads to increases in δ15nno3 and nh4 concentration and a decrease in dic concentration hosono et al 2015 simultaneously groundwater ph gradually increased following the increased δ15nno3 figure s7a showing favorable for autotrophic dnra processes robertson et al 2016 in the samples with autotrophic dnra the dissolved fe ii figure s6c and so4 2 concentrations figure s7b were lower which confirms fe ii oxidation and the absence of so4 2 production therefore we suggest that dissolved fe ii should act as the electron donor in autotrophic dnra dissolved fe ii in groundwater should be sourced from fe iii oxide reduction stimulated by organic matter degradation the fe iii oxide reduction releases fe ii which thereafter facilitates the dnra process in general although organic matter was an important electron donor fe ii fueled autotrophic dnra processes also occurred in some samples in zone iv 4 2 sources and transformation of nh4 in groundwater 4 2 1 organic matter degradation as the primary source of groundwater nh4 good positive correlations between the doc and nh4 concentrations in both deep r 0 504 p 0 000 figure s8a and shallow r 0 313 p 0 032 figure s8b groundwater support that nh4 was mainly sourced from organic matter degradation in both deep zones i ii and iii and shallow zone iv groundwater in deep groundwater dissolved nh4 concentrations were significantly correlated with the dic r 0 706 p 0 000 figure s5a and fe ii concentrations r 0 634 p 0 000 figure s8c also suggesting that the nh4 enrichment should be related to organic matter degradation harvey et al 2002 postma et al 2007 gao et al 2020 qiao et al 2020 the nitrogen isotopic composition of fertilizers typically nh4 and ureic compounds and manures used in the hetao basin had δ15n from 3 4 to 1 1 and from 4 0 to 8 1 respectively these values were in the ranges of groundwater δ15nnh4 13 2 to 12 4 table s1 which may also act as nh4 sources however the relative contribution of fertilizers and manures in deep groundwater from zones ii and iii should be less important as there were negligible phosphate concentrations observed gao et al 2020 4 2 2 feammox and anammox in zones ii and iii the δ15nnh4 of deep groundwater from zones ii and iii ranged from 5 3 to 12 4 fig 8 a showing a wider range than that from organic nitrogen mineralization of 3 9 to 4 1 scheiber et al 2016 nikolenko et al 2018 an enrichment in 15nnh4 was observed along with a decreased nh4 concentration fig 8a this may be related to nh4 consumption via oxidation since organic nitrogen mineralization generally has no isotopic fractionation brandes and devol 1997 under anoxic conditions feammox and anammox are the two major nh4 elimination processes the increased δ15nnh4 up to 12 4 together with fluctuations in δ15nno3 supports the co occurrence of feammox and anammox fig 8b although the relative importance of the two processes could not be delineated feammox and anammox were previously reported to simultaneously contribute to nh4 loss in an intertidal wetland li et al 2015 the occurrence of feammox in deep groundwater from the hetao basin has been evidenced by the 16s rrna gene sequencing xiu et al 2020 groundwater in zone ii had higher δ15nnh4 than in zone iii fig 8a indicating stronger feammox there this is also supported by higher fe iii oxide contents and lower organic matter degradation rates in zone ii compared with zone iii gao et al 2020 a stronger feammox is typically related to lower organic matter degradation rates and higher sedimentary fe iii oxide contents ding et al 2014 the contribution of the feammox process to nh4 loss could be relatively high from 67 to 78 in uncultivated and paddy soils ding et al 2014 from 47 to 72 in tropical upland soil yang et al 2012 and from 80 to 86 5 in riparian zones ding et al 2017 anammox is also an important fate for deep groundwater nh4 from zones ii and iii the coexistence of nh4 and no3 and weak alkaline ph conditions table s1 are favorable for anammox process tomaszewski et al 2017 the increased δ15nnh4 along with nh4 consumption was precisely matched by rayleigh fractionation with an enrichment factor of 4 2 for ε15nnh4 r 0 752 p 0 000 fig 8a this is within the range of enrichment factors from 8 to 4 for anammox clark et al 2008 robertson et al 2012 nikolenko et al 2018 the anammox process has a stronger fractionation effect on δ18ono3 than δ15nno3 lamontagne et al 2018 this may explain the fact that the median δ15nno3 in zone iii 17 4 was lower than that in zone ii 19 7 while the median δ18ono3 in zone iii 9 4 vs 8 9 in zone ii was slightly higher table s1 the slightly lower δ15nnh4 5 3 can be explained by the isotopic fractionation ε15nnh4 of 1 0 böhlke et al 2006 of nh4 adsorption fig 8a 4 2 3 dnra and anammox in zone iv in the shallow groundwater of zone iv the δ15nnh4 ranged from 13 0 to 5 1 fig 8c which is lower than that expected from organic nitrogen mineralization scheiber et al 2016 nikolenko et al 2018 the limited fractionation effect of nh4 adsorption on the δ15nnh4 signature ε15nnh4 with 1 cannot explain these low δ15nnh4 fig 8c the dnra reaction was the only process that could result in a low δ15nnh4 with high nh4 concentrations although no fractionation data have been available until recently nikolenko et al 2018 much higher doc no3 molar ratios were observed in the shallow groundwater from zone iv median 161 mol mol than in the deep groundwater from zones i median 0 35 mol mol ii median 1 46 mol mol and iii median 3 63 mol mol fig 9 a previous studies have indicated that a high doc no3 molar ratio is favorable for the occurrence of dnra rütting et al 2011 hardison et al 2015 salk et al 2017 nikolenko et al 2018 porubsky et al 2009 suggested that dnra should be favored over denitrification with doc no3 molar ratios above 50 although a significantly lower threshold of 10 was reported hardison et al 2015 a positive correlation between δ15nnh4 and δ13cdic in most shallow groundwater samples fig 9b shows that δ15nnh4 is related to the extent of organic matter degradation suggesting heterotrophic dnra however the increased δ15nno3 and nh4 concentrations following the decreased dic concentrations of specific samples indicates the occurrence of autotrophic dnra figure s6a field data support that dissolved fe ii fueled the autotrophic dnra process figure s7 see section 4 1 3 therefore both heterotrophic and autotrophic dnra processes occurred in zone iv the availability of organic matter and fe ii determines whether the dnra process was heterotrophic or autotrophic robertson and thamdrup 2017 rahman et al 2019 lower nh4 concentrations with higher δ15nnh4 fig 8c occurred in groundwater samples with high no2 concentrations 0 11 to 0 19 mg l in zone iv figure s6b unlike deep groundwater from zones ii and iii low nh4 concentrations were associated with high δ15nno3 figure s6b the δ15nno3 was significantly positively correlated with δ15nnh4 in zone iv r 0 6 p 0 023 fig 8d these results support that nh4 and no3 are jointly processed via nh4 anammox which is consistent with the observations from others clark et al 2008 lamontagne et al 2018 during the process 15n depleted no3 was firstly reduced to no2 and was thereafter processed for reactions with nh4 oxidation brunner et al 2013 the no2 concentrations of these samples median 0 11 mg l figure s6b were one order of magnitude higher than those of the other samples median 0 02 mg l the no2 level in these samples may be sufficient to trigger anammox since the anammox rate is relatively high even at 0 15 mg l no2 based on incubation experiments thamdrup and dalsgaard 2002 trimmer et al 2003 concentrations of nh4 for these samples ranged from 1 to 2 mg l figure s6b which could support the high anammox rate babbin and ward 2013 in nh4 limited conditions anammox microbes can even mediate dnra to produce nh4 to facilitate the anammox process song et al 2016 the dnra coupled to anammox has also been observed in marine salk et al 2017 estuary plummer et al 2015 and riparian groundwaters wang et al 2019a a previous study has concluded that anammox could make a major contribution as a nitrogen sink from 36 8 to 79 5 in aquifer systems around the world wang et al 2019b 4 3 arsenic mobility in nitrogen cycling systems elevated dissolved as concentrations are typically found in no3 depleted and nh4 rich groundwater fig 10 in deep groundwater elevated as concentrations correspond to low dissolved no3 concentrations fig 10a and high δ15nno3 r 0 469 p 0 018 fig 10b which is consistent with previous studies senn and hemond 2002 weng et al 2017 among the high as groundwater samples 10 μg l 75 of samples contained 0 5 mg l no3 which is the threshold for the occurrence of fe iii oxide reduction mcmahon and chapelle 2007 dissolved as was strongly positively correlated with the fe ii concentration in zones ii and iii r 0 679 p 0 000 fig 10c suggesting the primary contribution of fe iii oxide reduction stimulated by organic matter degradation to as enrichment guo et al 2014 qiao et al 2020 this was further evidenced by the strong positive correlations between dissolved nh4 and as r 0 85 p 0 000 fig 10e and fe ii concentrations r 0 634 p 0 000 figure s8c and negative correlation between dissolved as concentrations and δ15nnh4 r 0 662 p 0 000 fig 10f this is because dissolved nh4 is considered as a proxy for organic matter degradation harvey et al 2002 postma et al 2007 during the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides stimulated by organic matter degradation both fe ii and nh4 may be released into groundwater the bounded as v is mobilized and simultaneously reduced to as iii fendorf et al 2010 which is more mobile under reducing conditions dixit and hering 2003 by using cross correlations among δ15nnh4 and fe ii and as concentrations as illustrated in fig 11 a conceptual model concerning the as mobility as influenced by different nitrogen cycling processes in various redox zones is proposed accordingly fig 12 in the alluvial fan under oxic conditions zone i electrons from sedimentary or dissolved organic matter degradation facilitates o2 reduction subsequently the released nh4 is oxidized into no3 via the nitrification process fig 12 dissolved fe ii and as were low in this zone which is mainly due to the strong as adsorption on fe iii oxides fig 12 the produced no3 was an important source of groundwater no3 in the zone ii down gradient in deep groundwater from zones ii and iii the groundwater environment evolved to suboxic anoxic conditions where organic matter degradation began to stimulate fe iii oxide reduction fig 12 nitrate was partially denitrified in these two zones leading to higher δ15nno3 in the residual no3 than the δ15nno3 produced from nh4 nitrification in zone i table s1 fig 12 during fe iii oxide reduction triggered by organic matter degradation fig 12 the groundwater fe ii nh4 and as concentrations gradually increased with a relatively constant δ15nnh4 pathway i fig 11a in addition nh4 oxidation was coupled to fe iii oxide reduction via a feammox process fig 12 which led to lower dissolved nh4 concentrations fig 8a slightly higher fe ii and as concentrations and much higher δ15nnh4 as denoted by pathway ii in fig 11a strong positive correlations have been observed between the fe iii oxide reduction and the nh4 feammox rate in incubations with paddy soils ding et al 2014 and wetland sediment li et al 2015 therefore higher feammox rates may indicate higher as concentrations due to stronger fe iii oxide reduction oxidation of nh4 coupled to no3 no2 reduction anammox may also occur fig 12 a stronger anammox is favored at higher no3 doc molar ratios kraft et al 2014 plummer et al 2015 smith et al 2015 although most of the groundwater in zones ii and iii had no3 doc molar ratios 0 4 much higher values up to 2 were observed in samples following the anammox pathway figure s9 higher no3 senn and hemond 2002 and lower doc concentrations guo et al 2019 are typically related to lower dissolved fe ii and as concentrations these are mainly due to fe ii oxidation into fe iii oxides from the high level of no3 which sequestered dissolved as smith et al 2017 in addition there are limited fe iii oxide reduction and as release with low doc concentrations mcarthur et al 2004 therefore samples encountering stronger anammox reactions should have lower fe ii nh4 and as concentrations and higher δ15nnh4 as shown by pathway iii in fig 11a herein the feammox and anammox processes shown in fig 8a are separated in terms of both dissolved fe ii and as concentrations and δ15nnh4 fig 11a furthermore δ15nnh4 seemed to be slightly lower following the nh4 and fe ii adsorption pathway in zone iii pathway iv figs 8a and 11a leaving the dissolved as concentration being less influenced fig 11a this suggests that dissolved nh4 fe ii and as should be not adsorbed on the same surface sites nguyen et al 2014 norrman et al 2015 in shallow groundwater from the flat plain zone iv nh4 oxidation via the anammox process also resulted in a high δ15nnh4 and low nh4 fe ii and as concentrations in zone iv pathway iii fig 11b following the anammox pathway as indicated by a decreased nh4 concentration and increased δ15nno3 both the dissolved fe ii and as concentrations decreased figures s6d and f the extent of anammox reactions in this zone appears to be much stronger than that in zones ii and iii as the dissolved as concentrations were much lower 10 μg l following pathway iii in zone iv fig 11b the low dissolved fe ii and as concentrations following the anammox pathway may be due to the relatively high dissolved no2 concentrations in these samples figures s6b although the no2 concentration shows little influence on the anammox process trimmer et al 2003 it may chemically or microbially oxidize fe ii to fe iii oxides and thereby sequester as park et al 2018 in addition a much lower δ15nnh4 was found in samples with either low or high nh4 fig 8c and fe ii concentrations fig 11b ammonium adsorption may explain the low δ15nnh4 and nh4 concentrations both nh4 and fe ii can be adsorbed onto the same adsorption sites on the sediment surface the extent to which is related to the clay mineral contents schubert and calvert 2001 therefore samples encountering nh4 and fe ii adsorption may have low nh4 and fe ii concentrations and a low δ15nnh4 but show little influence on the dissolved as concentrations pathway iv fig 11b nguyen et al 2014 have suggested that as iii adsorption onto the red river floodplain sediments should be uninfluenced by fe ii adsorption thus adsorptions of the two species were uncoupled however the association of a low δ15nnh4 with a high nh4 concentration fig 8c may be related to the dnra process which was associated with either low or high dissolved fe ii and as concentrations fig 11b the dnra organisms may be processed via heterotrophic or autotrophic pathways or both depending on the availability of organic matter and fe ii robertson and thamdrup 2017 if dnra processes are heterotrophically coupled to the organic matter degradation pathway v fig 11b the aquifers with a dnra imprint may have high fe iii oxide reduction rates as dnra occurs in environments with high organic matter degradation rates hardison et al 2015 therefore heterotrophic dnra leads to high fe ii and as concentrations due to the extensive reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides however if the dnra is autotrophically processed via fe ii oxidation pathway vi fig 11b the dnra rates increase significantly from the oxidation of dissolved fe ii robertson and thamdrup 2017 rahman et al 2019 li et al 2020 following the autotrophic dnra pathway indicated from high δ15nno3 and low dic concentrations both dissolved fe ii and as concentrations decreased significantly figures s6c and e roberts et al 2014 showed that the dissolved fe ii concentration decreased significantly during the autotrophic dnra process during autotrophic dnra fe ii was oxidized into fe iii oxides which sequestered the dissolved as to sum up organic matter degradation and fe iii oxide reduction should be the primary processes that control the groundwater nh4 fe ii and as concentrations which are thereafter influenced by anammox dnra and adsorption processes in zone iv fig 12 5 conclusions a detailed picture of the nitrogen cycling processes and their impacts on as mobility were presented based on multi isotopic signatures and cross correlations among dissolved nitrogen species fe ii and as concentrations in the study area groundwater nh4 was primarily sourced from organic nitrogen mineralization in the four considered zones negative δ15nnh4 low to 13 2 being associated with extremely high doc no3 molar ratios up to 406 mol mol supports dnra as an important nh4 source in zone iv gradually enriched 15nnh4 coupled to nh4 loss suggests nh4 removal via oxidation under anoxic conditions which were further distinguished as feammox in zones ii and iii and anammox in zones ii iii and iv from enriched 15nnh4 following increased and decreased fe ii concentrations respectively the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 signatures suggest that the high dissolved no3 concentration in zone i should be primarily derived from nh4 nitrification which was discharged to aquifers downstream nitrate reduction accompanied by linearly increases in δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 together with distinct groundwater doc no3 molar ratios identified dentrification in zones ii and iii and dnra in zone iv as no3 sinks the impacts of nitrogen cycling on as mobility were mainly mediated by the redox couple of fe iii oxides and dissolved fe ii under anoxic conditions organic matter including organic nitrogen mineralization facilitated fe iii oxide reduction and thereby release of fe ii and as the fe iii oxide reduction via nh4 feammox occurred in zones ii and iii and increased fe ii and as mobility however environments favored anammox under higher no3 doc molar ratio zones ii and iii or higher no2 concentrations zone iv favored fe ii oxidation to fe iii oxides which thus sequestered as heterotrophic dnra in zone iv with extremely high doc no3 molar ratio was conducive to fe iii oxide reduction and as release while fe ii fueled autotrophic dnra promoted as immobilization in groundwater systems quantifying relative importance of these coexisting nitrogen cycling processes in nitrogen species fe ii and as behavior is needed in future studies which could be accomplished by using multi process based reactive transport models and or in situ 15no3 and 15nh4 tracer tests credit authorship contribution statement zhipeng gao writing original draft visualization
