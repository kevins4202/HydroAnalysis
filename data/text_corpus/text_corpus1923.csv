9615,australia in particular the southern murray darling basin has the most advanced water market in the world however there is still much to be understood as to how and why irrigators use the water market and in what combination with other farm management strategies this study used principal component analysis to identify five clusters of southern murray darling basin irrigators from a set of twenty possible farm and water strategies during 2015 16 n 977 multinomial logit regression was then used to identify influences associated with each cluster the five clusters of irrigators include those expanding the farm includes buying temporary water expanding and diversifying includes buying permanent water downsizing selling both temporary and permanent water transitioning switching away from irrigation to dryland and saving using carryover water saved in storages for the following year around a third of irrigators can be classified as trying to expand the farm the expanders and the expanders diversifiers another third of typically older irrigators have lower levels of debt and excess water the savers while a final third who also tend to be older but also face financial and or psychological stress are placing more emphasis on dryland production away from irrigation or decreasing agricultural production altogether the transitioners and downsizers higher long term temperature of a farm area s location increased the probability of the irrigator being a downsizer indicating a future trend of irrigation farm exit given the predicted rise in temperature from climate change in the murray darling basin keywords murray darling basin water markets principal component analysis adaptation multinomial logit regression 1 introduction irrigators in australia s murray darling basin mdb employ a range of management strategies to deal with water scarcity and to maximize farm profitability future climate change csiro 2020 increasing input costs and falling output prices means increased uncertainty for many agricultural industries wheeler et al 2020a within australia s largest irrigation area the mdb irrigators also have to face increased water allocation uncertainty changing rules and reallocation of water from consumptive to environmental use as part of the mdb plan grafton 2019 hence understanding farm management adaptation strategies is important both from a perspective of designing policies to maximize farm profitability but also in terms of designing policies for future adaptation change and potential exit in the face of increased climate change or wide scale restructure zuo et al 2015 although the literature to date has tended to focus more on farmer adoption behaviour e g pannell et al 2006 wheeler et al 2009 there is increasing research examining adaptation processes below et al 2012 seidl et al 2021 wheeler et al 2013 in this context water markets together with other management strategies have been increasingly utilized by irrigators for farm planning and adaptation however studies focussing on understanding water trade strategies of irrigators and profiling irrigators to understand motives and drivers of such trade strategies are less common within the literature understanding water trade as a management strategy may become increasingly important given the prediction that the mdb will become increasingly hotter and drier in future csiro 2020 and that water markets represent a key tool to deal with water scarcity wheeler and xu 2021 economists have long advocated water markets as a valuable instrument to enhance productive dynamic and allocative efficiency in water use easter et al 1999 grafton and wheeler 2018 howe et al 1986 randall 1981 wheeler 2021 the mdb provides a valuable case study to investigate and profile irrigator water trade management strategies as the southern mdb has the most sophisticated and highly adopted water market in the world in contrast international water markets are typically not anywhere near the same level of development wheeler 2021 other prominent countries with growing formal water markets include the us bruno and sexton 2020 schwabe et al 2020 china zuo et al 2021a and spain wheeler et al 2017 although informal water markets are increasingly prevalent in other countries this paper focusses on the australian experience however wheeler 2021 provides an analysis of water market development and presence around the world in the mdb there are two main types of water trade i short term or temporary transfers of water known as water allocation trade and ii permanent transfers of water entitlements water entitlement trade transfers the ongoing right to either a proportion or fixed quantity of the available water at a given source along with water delivery rights i e the right to have water delivered wheeler and garrick 2020 water markets have been formally implemented in the mdb since the 1980s although adoption has been relatively slow wheeler and garrick 2020 illustrate that adoption has followed the pattern of a s curve with minimal adoption at first then accelerating over several years before tailing off again by 2000 even though water markets had been in operation for almost two decades less than 10 of irrigators had conducted any type of water trade bjornlund et al 2013 by 2015 16 around half of all irrigators in the southern mdb had made at least one water entitlement trade while 78 had conducted at least one water allocation trade grafton and wheeler 2018 however there is significant difference within the mdb regarding water market adoption water markets are far less prevalent in the northern part of the mdb with the reasons including a lack of regulated water rights institutional strength in terms of monitoring metering and compliance and less public storage wheeler and garrick 2020 although adoption of water markets has been widespread in the southern basin it has not been without controversy or concerns regarding their impact e g bjornlund 2002 seidl et al 2020 recent concerns resulted in one of the most thorough reviews of the water market to date by the australian competition and consumer commission accc 2021 which recommended wide ranging reforms were needed to ensure continued net social benefits from water markets although the water market literature has expanded significantly over time wheeler and xu 2021 only a few studies have provided evidence regarding the influence participation has on water trading strategies within australia wheeler et al 2009 investigated the characteristics of initial adopters of water allocation trading in victoria while wheeler et al 2010 further analysed the changing profile of victorian water allocation traders in an early to mature water market stage haensch et al 2021 found that temporary water market trade volumes were predominantly related to water scarcity factors while zuo et al 2015 and nauges et al 2016 both confirmed the risk reducing effect of buying temporary water particularly for horticultural farmers the literature also suggests that permanent water trading is driven by the aim of long term structural changes on the farm to control significant risk exposure or improve productivity e g to secure a particular level of water availability or change farm location or type which may be followed by the use of the temporary water market to adjust for the new risk position alankarage et al 2002 bjornlund 2006 turral et al 2005 wheeler et al 2010 2012 2014 wheeler and cheesman 2013 to date there has been no detailed understanding of the many permutations of water trade participation strategies and how those water strategies are interrelated both between themselves and other farm management strategies in particular can clusters of irrigators based on their specific water management strategies be identified since irrigators often undertake multiple strategies on their farm identifying irrigator clusters based on their water dominant strategies offer more nuanced insights into how irrigators utilize different combinations of water and farm strategies to best cater to their external environment and individual circumstances the only other studies that have attempted to model farm adaptation in the mdb incorporating water market strategies include wheeler et al 2013 and seidl et al 2021 however these studies arbitrarily grouped southern mdb irrigators into three broad sets of farm adaptation strategies namely expansive accommodating and contractive and were not focussed specifically on water trade motivations and the combinations of other farm management strategies that irrigators employ as part of their water trade motivations this study aims to investigate the influences associated with southern mdb irrigators n 977 from a survey done in 2015 16 trade and farm adaptation choices more rigorously employing a statistical procedure to cluster strategies into groups rather than simple counting and summation and then modelling the strategy group membership as mutually exclusive using multinomial logit regression such analysis provides useful information for policymakers needing to understand who uses water markets why water markets are used and in what conjunction with other farm strategies and what drives the strategies of various water users 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area the mdb is more than a million square kilometres in size contains two of australia s largest rivers the darling and the river murray and covers 20 of australia s total agricultural land the mdb comprises areas within new south wales nsw 75 victoria vic more than 50 queensland 15 south australia sa 8 and the entire australian capital territory the study area here covers the southern mdb which includes the three states of nsw victoria and sa there is a wide diversity of crops grown in the southern mdb ranging from predominantly broadacre and permanent crops in nsw to dairy and permanent crops in victoria to mainly permanent crops in sa wheeler and garrick 2020 in 2015 2016 just over 9200 irrigation businesses operated across the mdb with the majority of these in the southern mdb in the mdb water availability is highly variable and due to climate change historical over allocation and drought water has become increasingly scarce and traded at ever higher prices especially permanent water on the water market zuo et al 2019 2 2 survey design we used survey data from a 2015 16 october to november 2015 telephone survey that was randomly sampled from a given irrigator population across three states nsw vic and sa a professional survey organisation implemented the survey using computer assisted telephone interviewing methodology on behalf of the researchers ethics approval from the authors organization was granted prior to the survey respondents were randomly sampled from lists of irrigator names sourced from irrigation infrastructure operators professional farming mailing lists and other publicly available sources given different sizes of irrigator populations in the three states the final state sample sizes resulted in relative standard errors rse of 4 7 5 1 and 6 6 for nsw vic and sa respectively which indicate low rses for an estimated proportion of 0 5 the abs 2020 suggests that rses 10 are subject to high sampling error and should be used with caution the survey responses can be regarded as representative for example average age industry and farm size are similar to abs agricultural census and abares irrigation farm survey descriptive statistics there were 1000 responses in total and the overall response rate was 51 or 73 which includes those who agreed to be surveyed but were not due to the final quota being fulfilled given that not every irrigator answered all questions the sample size used in the principal component analysis included 977 responses and the sample size used in the regression analysis was 885 as it had additional missing responses in the other independent variable questions a wide range of information was collected on irrigators attitudes socio economic and farm characteristics past and future water trading and farm management strategies previous studies using some of this survey data include wheeler et al 2018 2020a 2021 daghagh yazd et al 2019 seidl et al 2021 and zuo et al 2021b appendix a provides the summary statistics and definition of variables used and appendix b provides an example of the key farm management survey questions 2 3 principal component analysis methodology principal component analysis pca for short e g see hamilton 2009 is a dimension reducing statistical technique that uses a small number of derived variables which are linear combinations of the original variables also called indicators to replace originally measured variables with little loss of information joliffe and morgan 1992 4 4 pca is used in this study instead of latent class analysis lca due to two main reasons 1 lca is to identify unmeasured class membership among subjects using observed variables however the aim of our study is not to identify unmeasured class membership among subjects but instead to use smaller number of variables to explain complicated original variables twenty possible strategies and 2 lca has high computation demand and could not converge for certain class numbers making it difficult to justify the final number of classes chosen by information criterion the derived variables are the principal components pcs which are commonly called factors accounting for as much of the total variation in the dataset as possible measured by variance since water trade and management strategies are rarely adopted separately and irrigators often use these strategies in combination with other strategies to manage their farms a set of factors were extracted based on a variety of strategies irrigators undertook over the past five years since all strategy variables are binary in nature 1 indicating such a strategy was undertaken in the past five years and 0 otherwise a tetrachoric correlation matrix edwards and edwards 1984 that is appropriate to measure correlations among binary variables was generated and used in the pca in general tetrachoric correlation coefficients are larger in absolute value and more dispersed than the pearson correlations that are more appropriate for continuous variables specifically the full list of twenty water trade and management strategies included purchased water entitlements sold water entitlements purchased water allocations sold water allocations carried over water into 2014 15 season carried over water into 2015 16 season increased irrigated area decreased irrigated area changed irrigated production such as mix of crops and varieties grown purchased any farm land near current properties purchased any farm land in different regions for risk purposes sold any farm land diversified production changed farm ownership structures increased farm insurance increased any collective bargaining or collaboration with other farmers improved the efficiency of irrigation infrastructure increased area of dryland production decreased area of dryland production and thought about selling the whole farm it should be noted that not every strategy was retained in the final pca model as some did not have internal consistency with the remaining strategies and therefore needed to be dropped in order to improve the model fit and explanatory power of the extracted factors after applying the pca each of the extracted factors was given an identity based on the nature of the strategies with high factor loadings contributing to it promax rotation was used and factor loadings below 0 40 were considered as insignificant both statistically stevens 2002 and practically hair et al 1998 and thus dropped bartlett s test and the kaiser meyer olkin measure of sampling adequacy kaiser 1974 were used to test the suitability of the variables for pca thomson s regression method thomson 1951 was subsequently used to predict the factor scores for each irrigator and assign each irrigator into cluster membership based on the factor score 5 5 since irrigator cluster membership assigned by thomson s regression method was used in the subsequent regression analysis to identify the characteristics associated with each cluster membership we used irrigators next five years strategies to predict their factor scores and thus their cluster memberships therefore regression analysis using current characteristics as independent variables for membership based on future strategies will not be subject to the reverse causality problem specifically according to the n factor scores for each irrigator each irrigator was then classified into the cluster having the largest factor score and the strategies consisting of that factor are considered as the irrigator s dominant ones factors are in reference to the 20 strategies being reduced to n factors while clusters are concerning each irrigator being grouped into one of the n clusters according to his her factor score 2 4 multinomial logit regression analysis following on from a the pca which extracted five factors using strategies data that irrigators undertook over the past five years b thomson s regression method using irrigators strategy data over the next five years which was applied to assign irrigators into different cluster memberships we then employed a multinomial logit model this model was to help identify the explanatory variables associated with each irrigator s cluster membership the hausman test tested the independence of irrelevant alternatives iia assumption the results suggest that the iia assumption was not violated i e inclusion or exclusion of one particular choice alternative did not impact the relative probabilities of choosing other alternatives lr likelihood ratio and wald tests were also conducted and suggest that no dependent variable categories could be combined supporting that all pairs of alternatives are distinguishable with respect to the independent variables in the model summary statistics of the dependent variables used in the multinomial logit model are listed in table a1 in appendix a as such the choice of being in one cluster was the optimization where irrigators maximize their utility function subject to constraints for the i th irrigator faced with j clusters their utility of choosing to be in cluster j j 1 2 n was u ij x i θ ε ij if u ij is the maximum among the j utilities then irrigator i will choose the cluster j following greene 2005 y i is a random variable which indicates the choice that irrigator i made therefore the probabilities were determined by p ij prob y i k x i exp x i θ k j 1 j exp x i θ j j 1 2 j where k is one of the j clusters and p y i j was the probability that the i th irrigator chooses k cluster x i was the business farm and location characteristics which determine an irrigator s choice in order to identify the model constraints must be imposed a common approach is to assume that β1 0 greene 2005 long 1997 this normalisation makes it possible to identify the coefficients relative to the base outcome the model can be therefore written as p ij prob y i k x i exp x i θ k 1 j 2 j exp x i θ j for k 1 prob y i 1 x i 1 1 j 2 j exp x i θ j the multinomial logit model was estimated using maximum likelihood the log likelihood was derived by defining for each individual d ij 1 if alternative j is chosen by individual i and 0 if not the log likelihood is therefore ln l i 1 n j 0 j d ij prob y i 1 x i the coefficient is difficult to interpret as it is relative to the base group therefore marginal effects are recommended and defined as δ ij p ij x i p ij θ j θ the choice of independent variables was based on findings from previous literature following previous studies e g see wheeler et al 2013 seidl et al 2021 variables include farmer characteristics e g age irrigators various attitudes towards farming technology and risk taking stress issues and self assessed overall psychological distress level farm characteristics e g net farm income total area of irrigated land number of full time employees category of industry and farm location characteristics e g drought long term average annual temperature more specifically table 1a in appendix a provides the variable list definition and summary statistics for each cluster and independent variables collinearity checks ensured that there was no serious multicollinearity among the independent variables i e correlation coefficients within an absolute 0 80 and variance inflation factors less than five pre testing of a variety of independent variables was undertaken and a few variables such as education level re use irrigation system laser grading state location etc were dropped due to statistical insignificance the final regressions used robust standard errors to mitigate heteroscedasticity issues 3 results 3 1 pca results of the total twenty possible strategies fourteen strategies remained in the final pca model as the dropped strategies either did not have a loading greater than 0 4 onto any of the factors identified or were loaded onto more than one factor which made the factor association not clear the diagnosis indicated the appropriateness of the retained variables for pca specifically the determinant of the correlation matrix was 0 09 this determinant will equal 1 0 only if all correlations equal 0 which indicates inappropriateness of the variables for pca bartlett s test for sphericity the null hypothesis is that the inter correlation matrix comes from a population in which the variables are non collinear and that the non zero correlations in the sample matrix are due to sampling error was rejected and the kaiser meyer olkin measure of sampling adequacy was 0 64 hence acceptable as it was above 0 5 kaiser 1974 five factors were identified and jointly they explained 87 of the variance of water and farm management strategies factor 1 24 factor 2 21 factor 3 11 factor 4 13 and factor 5 18 which is considered very high after factor loading rotation table 1 presents the factor loadings greater than 0 40 five factor scores were predicted and irrigators were then assigned to a cluster with the highest factor score from the five factors the five clusters are displayed in fig 1 and named here as expanders cluster 1 expanders and diversifiers cluster 2 downsizers cluster 3 transitioners cluster 4 and savers cluster 5 respectively according to the dominant strategies loading onto the factor with the highest factor score e g cluster 1 s factor 1 score was the highest among the five factor scores cluster 2 s factor 2 score is the highest among the five factor scores which was confirmed by the tukey s honestly significantly difference test that suggested the factor score with the assigned cluster was statistically significantly higher than that of any other clusters predicting irrigators cluster membership using their strategies over the next five years avoids the problem of reverse causality in the subsequent regression analysis given it was not appropriate to use current characteristics to explain irrigator cluster membership based on strategies over the previous five years carry over is the only exemption since we do not have information on future carry over plans however irrigators are most likely to continue to carry over if they have done so in the past three out of the five clusters have water trading as dominant strategies cluster 1 30 mainly purchased water allocations in combination with increasing irrigated area and accommodating strategies such as changes in irrigation production and improvements in irrigation efficiency and therefore is named expanders cluster 2 7 mainly purchase water entitlements which is accompanied by farm land purchases named expanders diversifiers cluster 3 7 clearly identifies a group that are downsizing or exiting by selling both water allocations and entitlements downsizers the other two clusters do not have buying and selling water trading in their dominant actions cluster 4 18 are mainly in the process of switching from irrigation to dryland production transitioners while cluster 5 38 are those irrigators that mainly use carryover named savers 3 2 multinomial regression results multinomial regression was used to identify the characteristics that are significantly associated with the membership of the five cluster overall the regression model achieved a reasonable prediction power with the adjusted r2 being 0 18 table 2 presents the marginal effects for a continuous variable the marginal effect is interpreted as the change in probability when the independent variable changes by one unit or by one percent for natural logged variables for example the probability of an irrigator being in cluster 1 expanders increases by 1 28 points when full time employment increases by one employee for a dummy variable the marginal effect is interpreted as the change in probability when the dummy variable changes from 0 to 1 for example being in the broadacre industry increases the probability of cluster 2 expanders diversifiers membership by 8 13 points relative to the horticulture industry note that since the probability of being in each of the clusters adds up to one the marginal effects sum up to zero implying that any increase in the probability of being in one cluster must be accompanied by a decrease in the probability of being in the remaining one or more clusters overall the multinomial regression results highlight the importance of water scarcity in driving irrigator water and farm management strategies variables such as end of season allocations drought temperature water entitlement ownership and irrigation infrastructure adoption all drove irrigator water trading and farm management behaviour 4 discussion overall the results indicate that around a third of southern mdb irrigators can be classified as trying to expand the farm e g the expanders and the expanders diversifiers a third whom tend to be older are sitting more comfortable with lower debt and have spare water savers and a third are putting more emphasis on dryland production away from irrigation or decreasing agricultural production altogether the transitioners and downsizers 4 1 water and climate variables higher agreement with water stress was statistically significantly and positively associated with being an expander ie those stating water stress were purchasing water allocations and improving their irrigation efficiency while those stating higher agreement with financial stress were negatively associated with being an expander conversely the transitioner cluster was negatively associated with water stress while positively associated with increased finance stress this was supported by the result that higher water ownership and greater seasonal water allocations implying less water security scarcity issues were negatively associated with being an expander while finance stress may prevent irrigators from expanding one of the biggest concerns around expansion for many irrigators is water security however neither water nor finance stress was associated with being an expander diversifier suggesting a mitigating effect of diversifying with regard to those stresses regarding climate conditions of the region drought was negatively associated with being a transitioner probably because dryland agriculture is highly dependent on local rainfall and irrigators are unlikely to switch to dryland production if their region is in drought increases in long term annual temperature was positively associated with being a downsizer and negatively associated with being a saver this is probably largely due to the fact that availability of irrigation water is less determined by local rainfall and local temperature was more relevant to local farms wheeler et al 2020b also found that long term increase in temperature was associated with increased farm exit in the mdb from 1991 2011 in particular irrigated agricultural industries that are very sensitive to rising temperature include the dairy industry due to the sensitivity of dairy cattle to heat stress and the horticultural industry such as viticulture steffen et al 2011 in addition greater adoption of spray drip and sprinkler irrigation infrastructure was statistically significantly positively associated with two clusters expanders diversifiers and transitioners such a result for the expanders diversifiers cluster is somewhat similar to findings by niles and mueller 2016 who found evidence to suggest that the presence of infrastructure potentially positively influenced farmer attitudes that annual rainfall had increased over time in addition improving irrigation infrastructure was one of the farm strategies most linked to being an expander factor 1 in table 1 which is similar to results found by wheeler et al 2020a that identified from a panel dataset of irrigators in the southern mdb a significant increase in water extraction of up to 28 by those irrigators that had received a subsidy to upgrade irrigation infrastructure similarly wheeler et al 2021 that used a panel dataset of 275 irrigators in the southern mdb over a five year time period from 2010 11 to 2015 16 suggested that mdb farmers in higher debt with greater permanent crops in areas that have had higher temperatures and less rainfall were all more likely to accept climate change poses a risk to their region and hence more likely to be considering downsizing 4 2 socio economic and farm variables in addition socio demographic variables and attitudes of irrigators are significantly associated with their cluster membership younger irrigators and just as importantly irrigators with identified successors are more likely to be expanders while older ones are more likely to be transitioners or savers intuitively having a successor was statistically significantly positively associated with being an expander while negatively associated with being a transitioner this finding coincides with seidl et al 2021 that found a positive influence of having a nominated successor on expansive adaptation it also makes sense as irrigators planning their succession would prefer to hand over a larger or improved farm rather than a smaller one li et al 2017 a higher off farm income percentage was statistically significantly positively associated with downsizers similar to results found by wheeler and zuo 2017 irrigators favourable attitudes towards farming as an occupation new technology and risk taking are mainly seen to be positively associated with being an expander diversifier while new technology was also negatively associated with being a transitioner a larger farm in terms of more irrigated area and more employees was less likely to be in the transitioner cluster more employees were also associated with being an expander or an expander diversifier such results are very similar to past research on irrigator behaviour for example wheeler et al 2013 used historical surveys n 1510 that were conducted five years apart 1998 1999 2003 2004 2008 2009 and 2010 2011 and found that incremental adaptations e g irrigators buying land and water increasing their irrigated area were positively associated with younger farmers farmers that have identified successors and more productive farms a higher debt to equity ratio was statistically significantly and positively associated with expanders while negatively associated with savers this suggests that finance stress was likely to stem from an inability to secure finance rather than from debt especially for the expanders we were also interested in understanding the association between higher psychological distress and future planned strategies wheeler et al 2018 found that mdb irrigators in a number of key irrigation industries recorded a very high level of psychological distress much higher than other dryland farmers higher psychological distress measured by the kessler psychological distress scale k10 was positively associated with being a downsizer or transitioner and lower distress level was associated with being an expander diversifier it is highly likely that given future predicted climate change and increasing pressure on water allocations farm input prices and output prices that farming stress will continue as noted by wheeler et al 2018 one of the most important policy responses to such a situation is the need to remove farm exit barriers and allow for dignified exit and to remove subsidies that help lock farmers into unsustainable production wheeler et al 2020a wheeler and zuo 2017 modelled irrigator n 2631 farm exit intentions from 2006 07 to 2012 13 from abares irrigator survey data and suggested that although water scarcity was associated with intentions to leave it was only those irrigators with lower rates of return and higher debt that intended to leave in times of drought the results of this study support previous findings as it found that drought and higher long term annual temperatures increased the likelihood of an irrigator being a transitioner or a downsizer implications of these results are that irrigation farm exit will continue to increase in the future as the mdb sees further impact of climate change as predicted by csiro 2020 although we suggest that it will only be irrigators in a poorer financial state that are forced to leave rather than planning to leave at some stage like others in less financial stress 5 conclusion this study has profiled the different typologies of irrigators in terms of the water and farm management actions undertaken on irrigation farms across the southern mdb the southern mdb has the most advanced water market globally and water markets are now a standard tool used by irrigators however there is a huge diversity in how irrigators use the water market what influences permanent versus temporary water market participation whether irrigators are buyers or sellers of water and how these water trade choices combine with other potential farm management strategies this study sought to explain what influences are associated with such clusters of strategies allowing policymakers a greater understanding of water market trading behaviour and corresponding farm actions principal component factor analysis was used to create a typology of water market participants using 977 representative irrigators across the southern mdb nsw victoria and sa in 2015 to 16 five irrigator typologies or clusters were extrapolated from twenty farm strategies and thomson s regression method was used to predict five factor scores for each irrigator each irrigator was assigned to one of the five clusters based on the highest factor score the five strategy clusters were cluster 1 expanders are younger and mainly purchase temporary water in combination with increasing irrigated area and accommodating strategies such as changes in irrigation production and improvements in irrigation efficiency cluster 2 expanders and diversifiers mainly purchase permanent water often accompanied by farmland purchases cluster 3 downsizers clearly identifies a group that are downsizing or exiting by selling both temporary and permanent water cluster 4 transitioners are older and appear to be in the process of switching from irrigation to dryland production the transitioners are likely to be future water market participants and that the existence of water markets is one rationale for this strategy as they can realize their water asset once they have transitioned and cluster 5 savers are those mainly using carryover and are also older carryover allows irrigators not to use water markets for buying and selling water because they can manage their risk by using carryover across different water seasonal years overall a third of irrigators can be classified as trying to expand the farm e g the expanders and the expanders diversifiers a third who tend to be older have lower debt and excess water savers and a third are putting more emphasis on dryland production away from irrigation or decreasing agricultural production altogether the transitioners and downsizers our results highlight the significance of water scarcity in driving irrigator water trade behaviour and farm strategies with scarcity issues increasing the likelihood of being an expander expander diversifier or a downsizer on the other hand increases in water availability were more associated with being a saver while increases in the long term temperature of the farm s location an influence that might increase the volumetric need for water led to a greater likelihood of being a downsizer such results reveal important insights for the future the prediction of increased adverse climate change impacts is likely to further fuel increased farm exit in the future from irrigation in the southern mdb declaration of competing interest the

9615,australia in particular the southern murray darling basin has the most advanced water market in the world however there is still much to be understood as to how and why irrigators use the water market and in what combination with other farm management strategies this study used principal component analysis to identify five clusters of southern murray darling basin irrigators from a set of twenty possible farm and water strategies during 2015 16 n 977 multinomial logit regression was then used to identify influences associated with each cluster the five clusters of irrigators include those expanding the farm includes buying temporary water expanding and diversifying includes buying permanent water downsizing selling both temporary and permanent water transitioning switching away from irrigation to dryland and saving using carryover water saved in storages for the following year around a third of irrigators can be classified as trying to expand the farm the expanders and the expanders diversifiers another third of typically older irrigators have lower levels of debt and excess water the savers while a final third who also tend to be older but also face financial and or psychological stress are placing more emphasis on dryland production away from irrigation or decreasing agricultural production altogether the transitioners and downsizers higher long term temperature of a farm area s location increased the probability of the irrigator being a downsizer indicating a future trend of irrigation farm exit given the predicted rise in temperature from climate change in

mdb employ a range of management strategies to deal with water scarcity and to maximize farm profitability future climate change csiro 2020 increasing input costs and falling output prices means increased uncertainty for many agricultural industries wheeler et al 2020a within australia s largest irrigation area the mdb irrigators also have to face increased water allocation uncertainty changing rules and reallocation of water from consumptive to environmental use as part of the mdb plan grafton 2019 hence understanding farm management adaptation strategies is important both from a perspective of designing policies to maximize farm profitability but also in terms of designing policies for future adaptation change and potential exit in the face of increased climate change or wide scale restructure zuo et al 2015 although the literature to date has tended to focus more on farmer adoption behaviour e g pannell et al 2006 wheeler et al 2009 there is increasing research examining adaptation processes below et al 2012 seidl et al 2021 wheeler et al 2013 in this context water markets together with other management strategies have been increasingly utilized by irrigators for farm planning and adaptation however studies focussing on understanding water trade strategies of irrigators and profiling irrigators to understand motives and drivers of such trade strategies are less common within the literature understanding water trade as a management strategy may become increasingly important given the prediction that the mdb will become increasingly hotter and drier in future csiro 2020 and that water markets represent a key tool to deal with water scarcity wheeler and xu 2021 economists have long advocated water markets as a valuable instrument to enhance productive dynamic and allocative efficiency in water use easter et al 1999 grafton and wheeler 2018 howe et al 1986 randall 1981 wheeler 2021 the mdb provides a valuable case study to investigate and profile irrigator water trade management strategies as the southern mdb has the most sophisticated and highly adopted water market in the world in contrast international water markets are typically not anywhere near the same level of development wheeler 2021 other prominent countries with growing formal water markets include the us bruno and sexton 2020 schwabe et al 2020 china zuo et al 2021a and spain wheeler et al 2017 although informal water markets are increasingly prevalent in other countries this paper focusses on the australian experience however wheeler 2021 provides an analysis of water market development and presence around the world in the mdb there are two main types of water trade i short term or temporary transfers of water known as water allocation trade and ii permanent transfers of water entitlements water entitlement trade transfers the ongoing right to either a proportion or fixed quantity of the available water at a given source along with water delivery rights i e the right to have water delivered wheeler and garrick 2020 water markets have been formally implemented in the mdb since the 1980s although adoption has been relatively slow wheeler and garrick 2020 illustrate that adoption has followed the pattern of a s curve with minimal adoption at first then accelerating over several years before tailing off again by 2000 even though water markets had been in operation for almost two decades less than 10 of irrigators had conducted any type of water trade bjornlund et al 2013 by 2015 16 around half of all irrigators in the southern mdb had made at least one water entitlement trade while 78 had conducted at least one water allocation trade grafton and wheeler 2018 however there is significant difference within the mdb regarding water market adoption water markets are far less prevalent in the northern part of the mdb with the reasons including a lack of regulated water rights institutional strength in terms of monitoring metering and compliance and less public storage wheeler and garrick 2020 although adoption of water markets has been widespread in the southern basin it has not been without controversy or concerns regarding their impact e g bjornlund 2002 seidl et al 2020 recent concerns resulted in one of the most thorough reviews of the water market to date by the australian competition and consumer commission accc 2021 which recommended wide ranging reforms were needed to ensure continued net social benefits from water markets although the water market literature has expanded significantly over time wheeler and xu 2021 only a few studies have provided evidence regarding the influence participation has on water trading strategies within australia wheeler et al 2009 investigated the characteristics of initial adopters of water allocation trading in victoria while wheeler et al 2010 further analysed the changing profile of victorian water allocation traders in an early to mature water market stage haensch et al 2021 found that temporary water market trade volumes were predominantly related to water scarcity factors while zuo et al 2015 and nauges et al 2016 both confirmed the risk reducing effect of buying temporary water particularly for horticultural farmers the literature also suggests that permanent water trading is driven by the aim of long term structural changes on the farm to control significant risk exposure or improve productivity e g to secure a particular level of water availability or change farm location or type which may be followed by the use of the temporary water market to adjust for the new risk position alankarage et al 2002 bjornlund 2006 turral et al 2005 wheeler et al 2010 2012 2014 wheeler and cheesman 2013 to date there has been no detailed understanding of the many permutations of water trade participation strategies and how those water strategies are interrelated both between themselves and other farm management strategies in particular can clusters of irrigators based on their specific water management strategies be identified since irrigators often undertake multiple strategies on their farm identifying irrigator clusters based on their water dominant strategies offer more nuanced insights into how irrigators utilize different combinations of water and farm strategies to best cater to their external environment and individual circumstances the only other studies that have attempted to model farm adaptation in the mdb incorporating water market strategies include wheeler et al 2013 and seidl et al 2021 however these studies arbitrarily grouped southern mdb irrigators into three broad sets of farm adaptation strategies namely expansive accommodating and contractive and were not focussed specifically on water trade motivations and the combinations of other farm management strategies that irrigators employ as part of their water trade motivations this study aims to investigate the influences associated with southern mdb irrigators n 977 from a survey done in 2015 16 trade and farm adaptation choices more rigorously employing a statistical procedure to cluster strategies into groups rather than simple counting and summation and then modelling the strategy group membership as mutually exclusive using multinomial logit regression such analysis provides useful information for policymakers needing to understand who uses water markets why water markets are used and in what conjunction with other farm strategies and what drives the strategies of various water users 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area the mdb is more than a million square kilometres in size contains two of australia s largest rivers the darling and the river murray and covers 20 of australia s total agricultural land the mdb comprises areas within new south wales nsw 75 victoria vic more than 50 queensland 15 south australia sa 8 and the entire australian capital territory the study area here covers the southern mdb which includes the three states of nsw victoria and sa there is a wide diversity of crops grown in the southern mdb ranging from predominantly broadacre and permanent crops in nsw to dairy and permanent crops in victoria to mainly permanent crops in sa wheeler and garrick 2020 in 2015 2016 just over 9200 irrigation businesses operated across the mdb with the majority of these in the southern mdb in the mdb water availability is highly variable and due to climate change historical over allocation and drought water has become increasingly scarce and traded at ever higher prices especially permanent water on the water market zuo et al 2019 2 2 survey design we used survey data from a 2015 16 october to november 2015 telephone survey that was randomly sampled from a given irrigator population across three states nsw vic and sa a professional survey organisation implemented the survey using computer assisted telephone interviewing methodology on behalf of the researchers ethics approval from the authors organization was granted prior to the survey respondents were randomly sampled from lists of irrigator names sourced from irrigation infrastructure operators professional farming mailing lists and other publicly available sources given different sizes of irrigator populations in the three states the final state sample sizes resulted in relative standard errors rse of 4 7 5 1 and 6 6 for nsw vic and sa respectively which indicate low rses for an estimated proportion of 0 5 the abs 2020 suggests that rses 10 are subject to high sampling error and should be used with caution the survey responses can be regarded as representative for example average age industry and farm size are similar to abs agricultural census and abares irrigation farm survey descriptive statistics there were 1000 responses in total and the overall response rate was 51 or 73 which includes those who agreed to be surveyed but were not due to the final quota being fulfilled given that not every irrigator answered all questions the sample size used in the principal component analysis included 977 responses and the sample size used in the regression analysis was 885 as it had additional missing responses in the other independent variable questions a wide range of information was collected on irrigators attitudes socio economic and farm characteristics past and future water trading and farm management strategies previous studies using some of this survey data include wheeler et al 2018 2020a 2021 daghagh yazd et al 2019 seidl et al 2021 and zuo et al 2021b appendix a provides the summary statistics and definition of variables used and appendix b provides an example of the key farm management survey questions 2 3 principal component analysis methodology principal component analysis pca for short e g see hamilton 2009 is a dimension reducing statistical technique that uses a small number of derived variables which are linear combinations of the original variables also called indicators to replace originally measured variables with little loss of information joliffe and morgan 1992 4 4 pca is used in this study instead of latent class analysis lca due to two main reasons 1 lca is to identify unmeasured class membership among subjects using observed variables however the aim of our study is not to identify unmeasured class membership among subjects but instead to use smaller number of variables to explain complicated original variables twenty possible strategies and 2 lca has high computation demand and could not converge for certain class numbers making it difficult to justify the final number of classes chosen by information criterion the derived variables are the principal components pcs which are commonly called factors accounting for as much of the total variation in the dataset as possible measured by variance since water trade and management strategies are rarely adopted separately and irrigators often use these strategies in combination with other strategies to manage their farms a set of factors were extracted based on a variety of strategies irrigators undertook over the past five years since all strategy variables are binary in nature 1 indicating such a strategy was undertaken in the past five years and 0 otherwise a tetrachoric correlation matrix edwards and edwards 1984 that is appropriate to measure correlations among binary variables was generated and used in the pca in general tetrachoric correlation coefficients are larger in absolute value and more dispersed than the pearson correlations that are more appropriate for continuous variables specifically the full list of twenty water trade and management strategies included purchased water entitlements sold water entitlements purchased water allocations sold water allocations carried over water into 2014 15 season carried over water into 2015 16 season increased irrigated area decreased irrigated area changed irrigated production such as mix of crops and varieties grown purchased any farm land near current properties purchased any farm land in different regions for risk purposes sold any farm land diversified production changed farm ownership structures increased farm insurance increased any collective bargaining or collaboration with other farmers improved the efficiency of irrigation infrastructure increased area of dryland production decreased area of dryland production and thought about selling the whole farm it should be noted that not every strategy was retained in the final pca model as some did not have internal consistency with the remaining strategies and therefore needed to be dropped in order to improve the model fit and explanatory power of the extracted factors after applying the pca each of the extracted factors was given an identity based on the nature of the strategies with high factor loadings contributing to it promax rotation was used and factor loadings below 0 40 were considered as insignificant both statistically stevens 2002 and practically hair et al 1998 and thus dropped bartlett s test and the kaiser meyer olkin measure of sampling adequacy kaiser 1974 were used to test the suitability of the variables for pca thomson s regression method thomson 1951 was subsequently used to predict the factor scores for each irrigator and assign each irrigator into cluster membership based on the factor score 5 5 since irrigator cluster membership assigned by thomson s regression method was used in the subsequent regression analysis to identify the characteristics associated with each cluster membership we used irrigators next five years strategies to predict their factor scores and thus their cluster memberships therefore regression analysis using current characteristics as independent variables for membership based on future strategies will not be subject to the reverse causality problem specifically according to the n factor scores for each irrigator each irrigator was then classified into the cluster having the largest factor score and the strategies consisting of that factor are considered as the irrigator s dominant ones factors are in reference to the 20 strategies being reduced to n factors while clusters are concerning each irrigator being grouped into one of the n clusters according to his her factor score 2 4 multinomial logit regression analysis following on from a the pca which extracted five factors using strategies data that irrigators undertook over the past five years b thomson s regression method using irrigators strategy data over the next five years which was applied to assign irrigators into different cluster memberships we then employed a multinomial logit model this model was to help identify the explanatory variables associated with each irrigator s cluster membership the hausman test tested the independence of irrelevant alternatives iia assumption the results suggest that the iia assumption was not violated i e inclusion or exclusion of one particular choice alternative did not impact the relative probabilities of choosing other alternatives lr likelihood ratio and wald tests were also conducted and suggest that no dependent variable categories could be combined supporting that all pairs of alternatives are distinguishable with respect to the independent variables in the model summary statistics of the dependent variables used in the multinomial logit model are listed in table a1 in appendix a as such the choice of being in one cluster was the optimization where irrigators maximize their utility function subject to constraints for the i th irrigator faced with j clusters their utility of choosing to be in cluster j j 1 2 n was u ij x i θ ε ij if u ij is the maximum among the j utilities then irrigator i will choose the cluster j following greene 2005 y i is a random variable which indicates the choice that irrigator i made therefore the probabilities were determined by p ij prob y i k x i exp x i θ k j 1 j exp x i θ j j 1 2 j where k is one of the j clusters and p y i j was the probability that the i th irrigator chooses k cluster x i was the business farm and location characteristics which determine an irrigator s choice in order to identify the model constraints must be imposed a common approach is to assume that β1 0 greene 2005 long 1997 this normalisation makes it possible to identify the coefficients relative to the base outcome the model can be therefore written as p ij prob y i k x i exp x i θ k 1 j 2 j exp x i θ j for k 1 prob y i 1 x i 1 1 j 2 j exp x i θ j the multinomial logit model was estimated using maximum likelihood the log likelihood was derived by defining for each individual d ij 1 if alternative j is chosen by individual i and 0 if not the log likelihood is therefore ln l i 1 n j 0 j d ij prob y i 1 x i the coefficient is difficult to interpret as it is relative to the base group therefore marginal effects are recommended and defined as δ ij p ij x i p ij θ j θ the choice of independent variables was based on findings from previous literature following previous studies e g see wheeler et al 2013 seidl et al 2021 variables include farmer characteristics e g age irrigators various attitudes towards farming technology and risk taking stress issues and self assessed overall psychological distress level farm characteristics e g net farm income total area of irrigated land number of full time employees category of industry and farm location characteristics e g drought long term average annual temperature more specifically table 1a in appendix a provides the variable list definition and summary statistics for each cluster and independent variables collinearity checks ensured that there was no serious multicollinearity among the independent variables i e correlation coefficients within an absolute 0 80 and variance inflation factors less than five pre testing of a variety of independent variables was undertaken and a few variables such as education level re use irrigation system laser grading state location etc were dropped due to statistical insignificance the final regressions used robust standard errors to mitigate heteroscedasticity issues 3 results 3 1 pca results of the total twenty possible strategies fourteen strategies remained in the final pca model as the dropped strategies either did not have a loading greater than 0 4 onto any of the factors identified or were loaded onto more than one factor which made the factor association not clear the diagnosis indicated the appropriateness of the retained variables for pca specifically the determinant of the correlation matrix was 0 09 this determinant will equal 1 0 only if all correlations equal 0 which indicates inappropriateness of the variables for pca bartlett s test for sphericity the null hypothesis is that the inter correlation matrix comes from a population in which the variables are non collinear and that the non zero correlations in the sample matrix are due to sampling error was rejected and the kaiser meyer olkin measure of sampling adequacy was 0 64 hence acceptable as it was above 0 5 kaiser 1974 five factors were identified and jointly they explained 87 of the variance of water and farm management strategies factor 1 24 factor 2 21 factor 3 11 factor 4 13 and factor 5 18 which is considered very high after factor loading rotation table 1 presents the factor loadings greater than 0 40 five factor scores were predicted and irrigators were then assigned to a cluster with the highest factor score from the five factors the five clusters are displayed in fig 1 and named here as expanders cluster 1 expanders and diversifiers cluster 2 downsizers cluster 3 transitioners cluster 4 and savers cluster 5 respectively according to the dominant strategies loading onto the factor with the highest factor score e g cluster 1 s factor 1 score was the highest among the five factor scores cluster 2 s factor 2 score is the highest among the five factor scores which was confirmed by the tukey s honestly significantly difference test that suggested the factor score with the assigned cluster was statistically significantly higher than that of any other clusters predicting irrigators cluster membership using their strategies over the next five years avoids the problem of reverse causality in the subsequent regression analysis given it was not appropriate to use current characteristics to explain irrigator cluster membership based on strategies over the previous five years carry over is the only exemption since we do not have information on future carry over plans however irrigators are most likely to continue to carry over if they have done so in the past three out of the five clusters have water trading as dominant strategies cluster 1 30 mainly purchased water allocations in combination with increasing irrigated area and accommodating strategies such as changes in irrigation production and improvements in irrigation efficiency and therefore is named expanders cluster 2 7 mainly purchase water entitlements which is accompanied by farm land purchases named expanders diversifiers cluster 3 7 clearly identifies a group that are downsizing or exiting by selling both water allocations and entitlements downsizers the other two clusters do not have buying and selling water trading in their dominant actions cluster 4 18 are mainly in the process of switching from irrigation to dryland production transitioners while cluster 5 38 are those irrigators that mainly use carryover named savers 3 2 multinomial regression results multinomial regression was used to identify the characteristics that are significantly associated with the membership of the five cluster overall the regression model achieved a reasonable prediction power with the adjusted r2 being 0 18 table 2 presents the marginal effects for a continuous variable the marginal effect is interpreted as the change in probability when the independent variable changes by one unit or by one percent for natural logged variables for example the probability of an irrigator being in cluster 1 expanders increases by 1 28 points when full time employment increases by one employee for a dummy variable the marginal effect is interpreted as the change in probability when the dummy variable changes from 0 to 1 for example being in the broadacre industry increases the probability of cluster 2 expanders diversifiers membership by 8 13 points relative to the horticulture industry note that since the probability of being in each of the clusters adds up to one the marginal effects sum up to zero implying that any increase in the probability of being in one cluster must be accompanied by a decrease in the probability of being in the remaining one or more clusters overall the multinomial regression results highlight the importance of water scarcity in driving irrigator water and farm management strategies variables such as end of season allocations drought temperature water entitlement ownership and irrigation infrastructure adoption all drove irrigator water trading and farm management behaviour 4 discussion overall the results indicate that around a third of southern mdb irrigators can be classified as trying to expand the farm e g the expanders and the expanders diversifiers a third whom tend to be older are sitting more comfortable with lower debt and have spare water savers and a third are putting more emphasis on dryland production away from irrigation or decreasing agricultural production altogether the transitioners and downsizers 4 1 water and climate variables higher agreement with water stress was statistically significantly and positively associated with being an expander ie those stating water stress were purchasing water allocations and improving their irrigation efficiency while those stating higher agreement with financial stress were negatively associated with being an expander conversely the transitioner cluster was negatively associated with water stress while positively associated with increased finance stress this was supported by the result that higher water ownership and greater seasonal water allocations implying less water security scarcity issues were negatively associated with being an expander while finance stress may prevent irrigators from expanding one of the biggest concerns around expansion for many irrigators is water security however neither water nor finance stress was associated with being an expander diversifier suggesting a mitigating effect of diversifying with regard to those stresses regarding climate conditions of the region drought was negatively associated with being a transitioner probably because dryland agriculture is highly dependent on local rainfall and irrigators are unlikely to switch to dryland production if their region is in drought increases in long term annual temperature was positively associated with being a downsizer and negatively associated with being a saver this is probably largely due to the fact that availability of irrigation water is less determined by local rainfall and local temperature was more relevant to local farms wheeler et al 2020b also found that long term increase in temperature was associated with increased farm exit in the mdb from 1991 2011 in particular irrigated agricultural industries that are very sensitive to rising temperature include the dairy industry due to the sensitivity of dairy cattle to heat stress and the horticultural industry such as viticulture steffen et al 2011 in addition greater adoption of spray drip and sprinkler irrigation infrastructure was statistically significantly positively associated with two clusters expanders diversifiers and transitioners such a result for the expanders diversifiers cluster is somewhat similar to findings by niles and mueller 2016 who found evidence to suggest that the presence of infrastructure potentially positively influenced farmer attitudes that annual rainfall had increased over time in addition improving irrigation infrastructure was one of the farm strategies most linked to being an expander factor 1 in table 1 which is similar to results found by wheeler et al 2020a that identified from a panel dataset of irrigators in the southern mdb a significant increase in water extraction of up to 28 by those irrigators that had received a subsidy to upgrade irrigation infrastructure similarly wheeler et al 2021 that used a panel dataset of 275 irrigators in the southern mdb over a five year time period from 2010 11 to 2015 16 suggested that mdb farmers in higher debt with greater permanent crops in areas that have had higher temperatures and less rainfall were all more likely to accept climate change poses a risk to their region and hence more likely to be considering downsizing 4 2 socio economic and farm variables in addition socio demographic variables and attitudes of irrigators are significantly associated with their cluster membership younger irrigators and just as importantly irrigators with identified successors are more likely to be expanders while older ones are more likely to be transitioners or savers intuitively having a successor was statistically significantly positively associated with being an expander while negatively associated with being a transitioner this finding coincides with seidl et al 2021 that found a positive influence of having a nominated successor on expansive adaptation it also makes sense as irrigators planning their succession would prefer to hand over a larger or improved farm rather than a smaller one li et al 2017 a higher off farm income percentage was statistically significantly positively associated with downsizers similar to results found by wheeler and zuo 2017 irrigators favourable attitudes towards farming as an occupation new technology and risk taking are mainly seen to be positively associated with being an expander diversifier while new technology was also negatively associated with being a transitioner a larger farm in terms of more irrigated area and more employees was less likely to be in the transitioner cluster more employees were also associated with being an expander or an expander diversifier such results are very similar to past research on irrigator behaviour for example wheeler et al 2013 used historical surveys n 1510 that were conducted five years apart 1998 1999 2003 2004 2008 2009 and 2010 2011 and found that incremental adaptations e g irrigators buying land and water increasing their irrigated area were positively associated with younger farmers farmers that have identified successors and more productive farms a higher debt to equity ratio was statistically significantly and positively associated with expanders while negatively associated with savers this suggests that finance stress was likely to stem from an inability to secure finance rather than from debt especially for the expanders we were also interested in understanding the association between higher psychological distress and future planned strategies wheeler et al 2018 found that mdb irrigators in a number of key irrigation industries recorded a very high level of psychological distress much higher than other dryland farmers higher psychological distress measured by the kessler psychological distress scale k10 was positively associated with being a downsizer or transitioner and lower distress level was associated with being an expander diversifier it is highly likely that given future predicted climate change and increasing pressure on water allocations farm input prices and output prices that farming stress will continue as noted by wheeler et al 2018 one of the most important policy responses to such a situation is the need to remove farm exit barriers and allow for dignified exit and to remove subsidies that help lock farmers into unsustainable production wheeler et al 2020a wheeler and zuo 2017 modelled irrigator n 2631 farm exit intentions from 2006 07 to 2012 13 from abares irrigator survey data and suggested that although water scarcity was associated with intentions to leave it was only those irrigators with lower rates of return and higher debt that intended to leave in times of drought the results of this study support previous findings as it found that drought and higher long term annual temperatures increased the likelihood of an irrigator being a transitioner or a downsizer implications of these results are that irrigation farm exit will continue to increase in the future as the mdb sees further impact of climate change as predicted by csiro 2020 although we suggest that it will only be irrigators in a poorer financial state that are forced to leave rather than planning to leave at some stage like others in less financial stress 5 conclusion this study has profiled the different typologies of irrigators in terms of the water and farm management actions undertaken on irrigation farms across the southern mdb the southern mdb has the most advanced water market globally and water markets are now a standard tool used by irrigators however there is a huge diversity in how irrigators use the water market what influences permanent versus temporary water market participation whether irrigators are buyers or sellers of water and how these water trade choices combine with other potential farm management strategies this study sought to explain what influences are associated with such clusters of strategies allowing policymakers a greater understanding of water market trading behaviour and corresponding farm actions principal component factor analysis was used to create a typology of water market participants using 977 representative irrigators across the southern mdb nsw victoria and sa in 2015 to 16 five irrigator typologies or clusters were extrapolated from twenty farm strategies and thomson s regression method was used to predict five factor scores for each irrigator each irrigator was assigned to one of the five clusters based on the highest factor score the five strategy clusters were cluster 1 expanders are younger and mainly purchase temporary water in combination with increasing irrigated area and accommodating strategies such as changes in irrigation production and improvements in irrigation efficiency cluster 2 expanders and diversifiers mainly purchase permanent water often accompanied by farmland purchases cluster 3 downsizers clearly identifies a group that are downsizing or exiting by selling both temporary and permanent water cluster 4 transitioners are older and appear to be in the process of switching from irrigation to dryland production the transitioners are likely to be future water market participants and that the existence of water markets is one rationale for this strategy as they can realize their water asset once they have transitioned and cluster 5 savers are those mainly using carryover and are also older carryover allows irrigators not to use water markets for buying and selling water because they can manage their risk by using carryover across different water seasonal years overall a third of irrigators can be classified as trying to expand the farm e g the expanders and the expanders diversifiers a third who tend to be older have lower debt and excess water savers and a third are putting more emphasis on dryland production away from irrigation or decreasing agricultural production altogether the transitioners and downsizers our results highlight the significance of water scarcity in driving irrigator water trade behaviour and farm strategies with scarcity issues increasing the likelihood of being an expander expander diversifier or a downsizer on the other hand increases in water availability were more associated with being a saver while increases in the long term temperature of the farm s location an influence that might increase the volumetric need for water led to a greater likelihood of being a downsizer such results reveal important insights for the future the prediction of increased adverse climate change impacts is likely to further fuel increased farm exit in the future from irrigation in the southern mdb declaration of competing interest the

university yangling shaanxi 712100 pr china handling editor dr r thompson groundwater resources carrying capacity grcc is defined as the capacity of groundwater resources for supporting social economic development which has been incredibly reduced in groundwater depended agricultural regions due to unreasonable use of groundwater resources identifying the key factors influencing grcc and providing the optimal strategy is critical for sustainable use of groundwater resources the present study used the improved grcc index regression functions and random forest to identify the key factors influencing the grcc in a groundwater over exploited area zhangjiakou hebei province china zjk and the particle swarm optimization and optimal water allocation model were used to select the best crop distribution scenarios for improving the grcc the results showed that incmse index random forest for each influencing factors ranging from 3 4 8 9 indicating that crop distribution is the most important factor affecting the grcc therefore changing the crop distribution is the key factor to improve the grcc in zjk the results of optimizing crop distribution scenarios showed the total water use for optimized crop distribution o26 potato and cabbage planting area were 36 885 and 362 936 ha was 713 701 500 m3 which was reduced by 14 compared to base scenarios in 2016 furthermore the grcc index d has decreased by 53 83 which means the groundwater resources would be sustainable by using this crop distribution with irrigation quotas are 900 and 1875 m3 ha respectively the results can provide decision making references for sustainable use of groundwater resources in groundwater over exploitation regions keywords groundwater resources management crop distribution agriculture water use random forest 1 introduction groundwater resources play an important role in irrigating crops dalin et al 2017 zhao et al 2021 supporting biodiversity he et al 2018 protecting environment graaf et al 2019 and boosting economy gao et al 2020 especially in semi arid regions where surface water resources is indeed limited zhou et al 2019 however groundwater resources have been over abstracted and the groundwater level have declined incredibly due to agriculture irrigation for many parts of the world studies have showed that the global total consumptive groundwater use for irrigation is estimated as 545 km3 yr 1 or 43 of the total consumptive irrigation water use of 1277 km3 yr 1 faures et al 2010 as a result groundwater level has declined in many parts of the world for example groundwater level has declined at 0 5 2 0 m yr 1 in north china plain ncp due to the unsustainable over exploitation of groundwater resources since 1970 s zhang et al 2021 and numerous cones of depression were detected across ncp with a maximum depth of 62 m in the unconfined aquifers and 110 m in the confined ones wang et al 2018 groundwater resources carrying capacity grcc is defined as the capacity of groundwater resources for supporting social economic development with the continuous depletion of groundwater resources the capacity of groundwater resources for supporting the social economic development has been incredibly reduced qiu et al 2018 reported that there had been economic loss of 7 billion yuan of ncp in 2013 due to overdraft of groundwater resources therefore improving groundwater resources carrying capacity grcc is an important way to reverse declining trend of groundwater level and achieve social sustainable development over the past years although many methods have been constructed for assessing the grcc the concept of grcc has not been unified chen and qu 2012 defined grcc as the ability to support the coordinated development of population resources ecological environment and social economy in the irrigation areas while liu et al 2017 defined grcc as the maximum support capacity of groundwater resources for regional socio economic development expressed in terms of the sustainable socio economic development scale population gdp as the water resources consisted of surface and groundwater resources some researchers have used the water resources carrying capacity to describe grcc lu et al 2017 defined the agricultural water resource carrying capacity awrcc as the maximum crop production that a regional water resource can support without environmental degradation and qi et al 2021 used this definition to analyze the spatiotemporal variations of awrcc and investigate the impact of climatic factors on the awrcc zhang et al 2019 used the water resources water environment carrying capacity wr wecc to judge the regional macro control ability of water resources however these definitions and methods are not able to integrate hydrological variables and economic variables and cannot reflect the relationship between groundwater withdrawal and the stage of regional economic development therefore it is critical to construct an improved index for assessing grcc considering both hydrological variables and economic variables gao et al 2020 constructed an improved index based on the report of liu et al 2017 for assessing grcc in zhangjiakou hebei province china zjk and reported that over exploitation of groundwater for irrigation accelerated the decline of grcc this improved index integrated hydrological and economic variables which can reflect relationship between the groundwater withdrawal and the stage of regional economic development also this index constructed a parameter estimation model using budyko equation which provides new ideas and methods for evaluating grcc in large areas grcc is an important index for assessing the status of the groundwater resources which would be influenced by many factors dai et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 sun et al 2019 studied the effects of reservoir interception on grcc and reported that the construction of underground reservoirs can reduce the evaporation and improve water use efficiency and grcc liu 2003 explained the potential ecological effects of the south to north water transfer project on the groundwater depletion in the north china plain and reported that this project can save groundwater resources and restore ecology mou and liu 1994 also demonstrated that reasonable urban planning can improve the regional grcc the above studies showed that the improvement of the regional grcc is a systematic project the grcc could be improved by taking different measures based on the regional characteristics of the natural environment and social economic development stage therefore identifying the key factors influencing grcc is critical for improving grcc in surface water limited regions the north china plain is one of the hot spot areas where groundwater resources depleted rapidly all over the world studies have shown that there would be 6 8 billion tons of groundwater loss annually in ncp gong et al 2018 as an important water conservation functional area and ecological environment support area for beijing china zjk is one of the typical groundwater over exploitation areas in ncp due to the limited surface water resources extensive groundwater extraction and unreasonable crop distribution nearly 46 million m3 of groundwater has been over exploited and the grcc in zjk has been reduced and it is critical to improve the grcc in zjk for the regional ecological civilization construction and sustainable development the crop distribution of zjk have changed from rain fed agriculture to irrigated agriculture since 1960 s with the improvement of irrigation conditions the major crop distribution in zjk were planting three crops in two years four crops in three years and one crop in one year while these crop distributions were high intensity irrigated agricultural production mode in zjk therefore the crop distribution of zjk has changed incredibly with planting area decline of low water consumed crops and increasing of high water consumed crops vegetable fruits etc the super scale and high intensity production mode caused by the transformation of crop distribution is the root cause of the consumption of groundwater in irrigated agriculture therefore the determination of the relationship between crop distribution and grcc is critical for developing water saving agriculture formulating feasible regional irrigation schemes and protecting limited groundwater resources however the drivers and mechanisms of grcc variation remain unknown therefore the major objectives of this study were to 1 identify the key influencing factors of grcc in zjk 2 quantify and optimize the key influencing factors 3 determine the relationship between crop distribution and grcc 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data sources the study region zjk is located in the northwest of beijing china with a total area of 37 000 km2 and zjk constitutes two different regions namely bashang bs and baxia bx based on the elevation zjk is the major groundwater overexploited area in hebei province china and also the important water conservation functional area and ecological environment support area of beijing fig 1 land use in zjk is mainly divided into farmland woodland grassland water bodies urban area and unused land the climate of zjk is continental semi arid monsoon with the annual average temperature of 8 6 the average annual rainfall is about 300 400 mm and mainly concentrated in june to september accounting for 78 of the total annual rainfall fig 1 the annual average groundwater resources in bs is 3 7 108 m3 which were mainly used for irrigation and domestic use the annual average total groundwater recharge in bs is about 3 7 108 m³ of which the rainfall recharge accounts for 86 of the total recharge the lateral recharge accounts for 13 and the other recharge accounts for 1 while in bx 84 of domestic and industrial water comes from groundwater and 64 of agricultural water comes from groundwater the groundwater recharge in bx is mainly including rainfall infiltration recharge 28 lateral runoff recharge at the entrance of the river valley 14 yanghe tributary inlet base flow recharge 18 river leakage replenishment 2 4 channel leakage replenishment 6 3 canal irrigation field infiltration replenishment 14 and well irrigation return replenishment 6 2 2 2 framework of grcc in this study the definition of grcc is the ability of groundwater resources to support regional social and economic development under certain industrial water efficiency conditions which expressed in terms of supporting gdp yuan gao et al 2020 defined grcc as the function of allowable groundwater withdrawal w ke and comprehensive water use efficiency η and the grcc is calculated as 1 g r c c η w k e η a η i n d u b η a g r i c η t h i r d 2 η a g r i g a g r i q a g r i η i n d u g i n d u q i n d u η t h i r d g t h i r d q t h i r d where η is the comprehensive water use efficiency yuan mm 1 which can be calculated by agriculture water use efficiency η agri industry water use efficiency η indu and service water use η third gagri gindu and gthird are gdp for agriculture industry and service industry yuan qagri qindu and qthird are water consumption for agriculture industry and service industry mm a b c are ratio between water consumption for agriculture industry and service industry to the total water consumption wke of zjk were estimated as 5 66 108 m3 in 1970 s 8 52 108 m3 in 1980 s 9 77 108 m3 in 1990 s and 10 5 108 m3 in 2000 s respectively zhang and li 2005 the annual actual grcc grcca and maximum grcc grccmax can be calculated using wke and maximum annual η ηmax 3 g r c c a η w k e g r c c max η max w k e in order to assess relationship between degree of groundwater exploitation and economic development grcc index is defined as 4 d r g r q r g g r c c a g r c c max r q w w k e where d is the grcc index which is used to assess whether the economic development supported by groundwater resources has exceed theoretical maximum grccmax rg is the degree of economic development supported by groundwater resources rq is degree of groundwater withdrawal w is the annual actual groundwater withdrawal and the higher d value indicates lower grcc which means the local economic development depend much more on groundwater resources the status of grcc is defined as no overload d 30 overload 30 d 50 and heavy overload d 50 the detail information for calculating the w and w ke are reported by gao et al 2020 2 3 identification of key factors influencing grcc 2 3 1 selection of the influencing factors the data used to identify the key influencing factors of grcc in this study consisted of water resources factors eco environmental factors and social factors table 1 rainfall and et are selected to assess the grcc since they are major sources of water supply and consumption in zjk gwc can be used to reflect the change trend of groundwater resources and crop distribution can also reflect the spatial and temporal variation in agriculture water use and irrigation water use and further influencing the agriculture gdp and grcc xie et al 2012 also reported that population can also influence the water resources carrying capacity and therefore was selected for assessing the grcc in this study population were obtained from zjk economic yearbook zhangjiakou municipal people s government 2018 rainfall and et were obtained from global land data assimilation system gldas https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets keywords gldas before we input the et data from gldas into the grcc assessment the hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1985 were used to verify the et data from the gldas since our study region is located in the semi arid region and the results were showed in fig s1 gwc is groundwater storage change and were obtained from nasa jet propulsion laboratory s tellus website http grace jpl nasa gov and the results of gao et al 2020 leaf area index lai were obtained from inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project https www isimip org the time periods of the above data ranged from 1995 to 2018 and the spatial resolution was 0 5 0 5 all these data were used to analyze and identify the key factors affecting the grcc variation the crop planting areas were obtained from hebei rural statistical yearbook zjk economic yearbook zjk yearbook and the land use data was obtained from resource and environmental science data center of chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn data aspx dataid 125 2 3 2 correlation analysis correlation between d and influencing factors were analyzed using multiple linear regression equation 5 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β m x m ε where β 0 β 1 β m are parameters to be estimated ε is the random variable subject to n 0 σ 2 set the dependent variable y and the independent variable to obtain a set of data through n observations 6 y α x α 1 x α 2 x α m α 1 2 3 n where the subscript of x α j are observation number and the number of the independent variable substitute this set of data into eq 2 to get 7 y 1 β 0 β 1 x 11 β 2 x 12 β m x 1 m ε 1 y 2 β 0 β 1 x 21 β 2 x 22 β m x 2 m ε 2 y n β 0 β 1 x n 1 β 2 x n 2 β m x n m ε n to simplify the expression the following matrix notation is used 8 y y 1 y 2 y n x 1 x 11 x 12 x 1 m 1 x 21 x 22 x 2 m 1 x n 1 x n 2 x n m 9 β β 1 β 2 β n ε ε 1 ε 2 ε n it can then be abbreviated as 10 y x β ε in order to estimate β the least square method is used suppose b 0 b 1 b m that are the least squares estimates of β 0 β 1 β m respectively then the estimated equation is 11 y ˆ b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b m x m similar to one variable linear regression the so called least squares estimation β 0 β 1 β m of b 0 b 1 b m means that they can minimize the following residual sum of squares q 12 q α y α y ˆ α 2 α y α b 0 b 1 x α 1 b 2 x α 1 b m x α m 2 min b 0 b 1 b m can be solved by the following equations

filter a certain number of sample combinations from the original data to obtain different training sets and generate a decision tree for each training set the random forest model can discriminate the importance of the independent variable to change the dependent variable and sort it in the regression analysis díaz uriarte and de andres 2006 the incmse index of random forest is used to assess the importance of each independent variable in the decision making of the dependent variable the higher incmse value the more important relationship between d and the corresponding factors and the major calculation process of incmse are as follows firstly classifying and selecting the factors that affect the grcc in zjk for importance analysis secondly normalizing the time series of each factor eliminating the problem of inconsistent units of different factors and analyzing the fluctuation characteristics of each factor thirdly the multiple regression model was used to establish the regression equation between different factors and d and the correlation coefficient between each factor and d was analyzed finally the error for each independent variable were calculated using the independent variable time series data respectively denoted as f1 f2 fn and randomly transform the index data to form new index data f11 f12 f1n then incmse were calculated as 14 i n c m s e f j j 1 k f i j f j b 1 2 4 optimal allocation model of crop distribution the objective of the crop distribution optimization in zjk was to use minimum water and obtain maximum profits in this study we defined s ij as the planting area for the j crop in the i county of zjk and i ij and p ij are the irrigation quota and income per unit area p ij y ij m ij y ij and m ij are crop yield and the unit price the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of china issued the national crop distribution adjustment plan in 2016 therefore we set 2016 as the base year to see whether the water use and economic profits have been improved after implement of crop distribution adjustment plan therefore objective functions are defined as 1 minimum water use 15 min w i 1 m j 1 n i i j s i j 2 maximum economic profits 16 max e i 1 m j 1 n p i j s i j the optimized total planting area is less than the current total planting area the base year is 2016 17 i 1 m j 1 n s i j s 2016 the optimized total water consumption is less than the current total water consumption the base year is 2016 18 i 1 m j 1 n i i j s i j w 2016 where minw is the minimum water use m3 maxe is the maximum economic profits yuan s 2016 and w 2016 are crop total planting area m 2 and water consumption of each county in 2016 m 3 the decision variables are crop planting area spring wheat spring maize potato and cabbage the crop yield in 2016 for each county are showed in table 2 there is the possibility that the planting areas are the same but water use is different because of the crop distribution therefore different counties of zjk may have different crop distribution based on the objective function one of the objectives of this study is to select the suitable crop distribution with minimum water use and maximum economic profits also we set another objective function lowest grcc index therefore although different water use and economic profits may occurred the grcc index can be used to determine which crop distribution should be selected 2 5 optimizing crop distribution scenarios different crop distribution may have different water consumption economic profits and water use efficiency the grcc defined in this study integrated the water consumption data water use efficiency and economic profits therefore grcc would be different if the crop distribution are changed the optimal scenario was determined when d and water consumption obtained lowest values while economic profits obtained the highest values based on the objective functions eqs 15 18 in order to determine the impacts of crop distribution on grcc 30 different crop distribution scenarios were set up based on the reduction of irrigation quota and crop planting types information of the crop distribution scenarios are shown in table 3 irrigation water quota reduced by 20 s20 and 50 s50 for four three two one crops of spring wheat spring corn potato and cabbage specifically the base year is set as 2016 and the irrigation quotas for spring wheat spring corn potatoes and cabbage were 2370 1665 1800 and 3750 m3 ha respectively li 2016 2 6 particle swarm optimization according to the optimal allocation model we constructed in section 2 4 particle swarm optimization algorithm pso was used to optimize the crop distribution eberhart and kennedy 1995 constructed the pso algorithm and the optimal solution can be obtained by random solution and iterative method specifically the spatial location of the idealized massless particles were assumed as the optimized solution and all particles are given a fitness value determined by an optimization function while each particle also has a velocity value including direction and velocity all particles search for the optimal solution in space through the current optimal particle the initial solution of the pso algorithm is a set of random solutions which achieved through multiple iterations to find the optimal solution for a single bird to find food pbest and the optimal solution for the entire group to find food gbest specifically each particle uses the following formula to update its own speed and position 19 v i 1 ω v i c 1 r a n d p b e s t i x i c 2 r a n d g b e s t i x i 20 x i 1 x i v i where v i is the particle velocity rand is the random number between 0 1 w is the inertia factor and the higher value of w is the stronger ability global optimization have x i is the current position of the particle pbest and gbest are the individual optimal solutions and group optimal solutions of particles respectively c 1 and c 2 are learning factor c 1 c 2 2 based on optimal allocation model constructed in section 2 4 x ij is defined as the particles representing the crop planting area of each crop in each county each particle is coded according to a two dimensional array and the particle swarm set can be expressed as 21 p s 11 s 1 n s m 1 s m n where n is the number of crops n 4 in this study crops include wheat maize potato and cabbage m is the number of counties 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of key factors influencing grcc table 4 shows the value of eight normalized influencing factors in zjk between 1995 and 2018 the results showed that both f4 and f6 gave a downward trend ranging from 0 9 to 0 4 and from 1 0 to 0 02 while f5 and f8 gave an upward trend from 0 0 to 1 0 and from 0 0 to 0 9 it revealed that the crop distribution in zjk have been changed from grain crops dominated pattern to vegetable crops dominated pattern with the increasing population farmers in zjk prefer planting vegetables to grain crops over the past 20 years due to its high profits other hydrological factors f1 f2 and f3 showed less variation during 1995 and 2018 leaf area index f7 also showed less variation in order to identify the key factors influencing grcc in zjk the multiple regression analysis was used to clarify whether there was correlation between these factors and d and random forest method was used to identify the key factors influencing grcc as shown in table 5 the coefficient of correlation r for the linear regression equation between d and influencing factors were very low ranging from 0 01 to 0 26 compared to the quantic function r value ranging from 0 32 to 0 65 the results indicated that linear regression equation is not suitable for reflecting the relationship between d and these influencing factors while quantic function can well capture this statistical relationship especially for factors f4 and f6 fig 2 displayed incmse index for each influencing factor ranging from 3 4 8 9 compared to other factors crop distribution f4 and f6 had relative high correlation with d based on the multiple regression analysis table 5 furthermore the incmse index of f4 and f6 obtained the highest value fig 2 based on the random forest importance analysis see 2 3 3 since the random forest model can discriminate the impacts of the independent variable on dependent variable the higher incmse value have the more important relationship between d and the corresponding factors in a word the results showed crop distribution is the key factor influencing grcc therefore changing the original crop distribution is critical for improving the grcc in zjk 3 2 variation in crop distribution and agriculture water use 3 2 1 land use change and crop distribution the results indicated that crop distribution is the key factors influencing grcc of zjk therefore the variation of crop distribution should be analyzed firstly the major land use type in zjk is consisted of farmlands forests grasslands water body and urban areas farmlands forests un used lands accounts for 48 19 2 of the total area while grassland water bodies and urban areas do not exceed 30 of the total area the urban area has increased significantly from 748 to 890 km2 and the farmland area increased from 17 595 to17 686 km2 forest area decreased from7119 to 6864 km2 between 1970 and 2015 fig 3 table 6 fig 4 showed that grain crop ratio decreased from 76 to 68 while the vegetable ratio increased from 6 to 18 due to the higher profit obtaining from planting vegetable in this study region as shown in fig 4 the major grain crops in zjk are wheat maize and potato which account for 21 29 and 19 of the total grain crops the planting area of wheat decreased from 34 to 14 while maize and potato increased from 14 to 36 and 14 22 respectively between 1995 and 2016 and the proportion of other grain crops dropped from 37 to 28 between 1995 and 2016 fig 4 showed that the major vegetables type in zjk are leaf vegetables roots crops melons beans and nightshade and the most planted vegetable crops is chinese cabbage which accounts for 42 in 2010 and 33 in 2016 to the total vegetables planting areas table 7 showed the crop planting area and percent in bs and bx of zjk in 2016 the major crops are spring wheat 41 and potato 46 in bs while are spring maize 67 and spring wheat 16 in bx respectively 3 2 2 agricultural water use change the area with low agricultural water use efficiency has extended from bx to bs fig 5 the reason for this extension may attribute to increasing planting area of water intensive crops before 2000 s the major crops in zjk were wheat and potato and the utilization rate of water resources was less than 20 of the total water resources however the planting area of water intensive crops especially the chinese cabbage has increased by 120 since 2001 from bx to bs ma et al 2014 and all these crops are irrigated with groundwater therefore the long term and disorderly expansion of planting area is extremely incompatible with the limited local water resources which has led to the expansion of low agricultural water use efficiency from bx to bs in zjk fig 6 showed the average gridded sector water use efficiency with stable trends from 1949 to 1979 increasing trends from 1980 to 2005 and decreasing trends from 2006 to 2018 in general agricultural water use efficiency has increased from 50 million yuan mm 1 to 200 million yuan mm 1 the agricultural water use efficiency stays stable from 1949 to 1980 before the significant increase from 1980 to 2005 the comprehensive water use efficiency stayed low value of 4 107 billon yuan mm 1 and showed significant increase between 1980 and 2005 while gave decrease trends after 2006 fig 6 although the water use efficiency has increased between 1980 and 2018 gao et al 2020 reported the total water use has increased accordingly in zjk it is indicated the water use in zjk has not been reduced with increasing trend of water use efficiency due to the expansion of planting area of water intensive crops the results agreed well with grafton et al 2018 which reported that only improving the irrigation water use efficiency or water use efficiency cannot alleviate the paradox between higher water demand and limited water resources applied 3 3 influencing of crop distribution on grcc fig 7 showed the d value for 30 crop distribution scenarios o1 o30 and base scenario b in zjk under two different irrigation reduction schemes s20 and s50 d was 60 in 2016 indicating the groundwater resources in zjk was in the state of heavy overload the average d for o1 o15 and o16 o30 were 45 and 21 indicating that these 30 crop distribution scenarios can improve the grcc with different range while the grcc for o1 o15 were still in the state of overload the average d for crop distribution scenarios o16 o30 had decreased to 30 indicating that these crop distribution scenarios can improve grcc in zjk the reduction in d for o16 o30 ranged from 53 to 83 compared to the base year in 2016 especially reduced by 83 for crop distribution scenarios o26 with d 10 therefore crop distribution scenarios o26 is the most suitable crop distribution in zjk and accordingly the irrigation water quota were 900 and 1875 m3 ha the planting area of potato and chinese cabbage were 36 885 and 362 936 ha improving the grcc is a systematic project and we need to take different strategies for different regions based on the characteristics of climate water resources and human activities han et al 2018 studied the impact of water diversion on grcc in jing jin ji region and reported that the grcc could be improved by 5 13 while mou and liu 1994 reported that reasonable urban planning is also important way to improve the grcc in this study the major reason for decline of grcc in zjk is the unreasonable crop distribution which lead to unreasonable use of groundwater resources therefore exploring the crop distribution in a proper way is useful for improving the regional grcc in zjk fig 8 showed the optimized crop distribution scenarios in each county of bs under two different irrigation reduction schemes all these 30 crop distribution scenarios have already been optimized based on the optimal allocation model see 2 4 the planting area in fig 8 for each crop distribution scenario are based on the objectives of maximum economic profits and minimum water use originally crop distribution scenarios should have four different crops for each irrigation schemes table 3 the optimized crop distribution have been changed after using optimal allocation model the optimized crop distribution o1 o30 in kangbao and zhangbei showed that only planting cabbage can achieve the objectives of maximum economic profits and minimum water use and the major reasons are 1 the average temperature and soil type in bs is suitable for planting cabbage 2 the transportation in bs is convenient to transport cabbage in shangyi and guyuan the optimized crop distribution scenarios o20 o22 o24 and o29 under irrigation reduction schemes s50 can obtain the highest economic profits and lowest water use compared to irrigation reduction schemes s20 the total crop planting area under irrigation scheme s50 has increased slightly for all the crop distribution scenarios specifically cabbage optimized planting area was 30 552 ha and is not influenced by the two different irrigation reduction schemes in zhangbei cabbage optimized planting area were 29 441 and 36 619 ha for s20 and s50 of the averaged crop distribution scenarios o1 o30 in shangyi the cabbage planting area for s50 has increased by 34 compared to s20 specifically the potato planting area for o20 o22 o24 and o29 for s50 was 9103 ha in guyuan planting area for s50 has increased by 30 compared to s20 specifically the potato planting area for o20 o22 o24 and o29 for s50 was 25 765 ha compared to the bs the potato planting area for the 30 crop distribution scenarios has increased in bx fig 9 since potato is suitable for planting in cooling environment and the temperature in bs is lower than in bx therefore farmers tend to plant more potatos in bs after implementation of national crop distribution adjustment plan in 2016 especially under irrigation reduction scheme s50 crop distribution scenarios o21 should plant spring wheat 17 236 ha and o28 should plant potato 8702 ha the total planting area in district ranged from 1610 to 3249 ha under irrigation reduction schemes s20 and s50 the potato planting area at chicheng wanquan and zhulu under irrigation reduction schemes s20 11 940 ha 15 579 ha 20 789 ha were higher than s50 7634 ha 7296 ha 8986 ha the optimal crop distribution for the whole zjk based on the total water use and economic profits were shown in fig 10 the average economic profits for all the crop distribution scenarios under irrigation reduction schemes s50 2 3 1010 yuan were higher than s20 1 8 1010 yuan based on the objective functions the crop distribution scenarios o26 obtained the highest economic profits of 2 8 1010 yuan and lowest water use of 7 1 108 m 3 and accordingly the potato and cabbage planting area were 36 885 and 362 936 ha respectively we compared the planting area between o26 and the base data in 2016 the potato planting area decreased by 65 780 ha and the cabbage increased by 324 839 ha and the total water use reduced by 14 o26 713 701 500 m 3 data in 2016 811 745 295 m 3 it is revealed that the change in regional crop distribution will not only influence the agricultural water use but also influence the regional economic development 4 conclusions owing to the spatial heterogeneity of climate water resources and human activities the assessment of sustainable use of groundwater is extremely complicated furthermore the identification of key factors influencing sustainable use of groundwater is also the major concern in agriculture depended regions in this study we used the improved constructed groundwater resources carrying capacity grcc index d for assessing the sustainable use of groundwater and identify the key factors influencing grcc in a typical groundwater overexploitation area zjk grcc integrates hydrological variables and economic variables and thus reflects the adaptive relationship between the utilization degree of groundwater resources and the degree of economic development the regression method and random forest method can well identify the key factors influencing grcc in groundwater depended regions and in this study crop distribution was identified as the key factor influencing grcc and sustainable use of groundwater in zjk therefore the key objective of this study is to reveal how crop distribution can improve the grcc and keep the sustainable use of groundwater resources in comparison with the irrigation reduction schemes irrigation water quota reduced by 20 s20 and 50 s50 the average economic profits for all the crop distribution scenarios under irrigation reduction schemes s50 2 3 1010 yuan were higher than that under s20 1 8 1010 yuan furthermore the total water use for optimized crop distribution o26 potato and cabbage planting area were 36 885 and 362 936 ha was 713 701 500 m 3 which was reduced by 14 compared to base scenarios in 2016 furthermore the d value o16 to o30 has decreased by 53 83 which means the groundwater would be sustainable by using this crop distribution with irrigation quotas are 900 and 1875 m3 ha respectively the results can provide decision making references for sustainable use

university yangling shaanxi 712100 pr china handling editor dr r thompson groundwater resources carrying capacity grcc is defined as the capacity of groundwater resources for supporting social economic development which has been incredibly reduced in groundwater depended agricultural regions due to unreasonable use of groundwater resources identifying the key factors influencing grcc and providing the optimal strategy is critical for sustainable use of groundwater resources the present study used the improved grcc index regression functions and random forest to identify the key factors influencing the grcc in a groundwater over exploited area zhangjiakou hebei province china zjk and the particle swarm optimization and optimal water allocation model were used to select the best crop distribution scenarios for improving the grcc the results showed that incmse index random forest for each influencing factors ranging from 3 4 8 9 indicating that crop distribution is the most important factor affecting the grcc therefore changing the crop distribution is the key factor to improve the grcc in zjk the results of optimizing crop distribution scenarios showed the total water use for optimized crop distribution o26 potato and cabbage planting area were 36 885 and 362 936 ha was 713 701 500 m3 which was reduced by 14 compared to base scenarios in 2016 furthermore the grcc index d has decreased by 53 83 which means the groundwater resources would be sustainable by using this crop distribution with irrigation quotas are 900 and 1875 m3 ha respectively the results can provide decision making references for sustainable use of groundwater resources in groundwater over exploitation regions keywords groundwater resources management crop distribution agriculture water use random forest 1 introduction groundwater resources play an important role in irrigating crops dalin et al 2017 zhao et al 2021 supporting biodiversity he et al 2018 protecting environment graaf et al 2019 and boosting economy gao et al 2020 especially in semi arid regions where surface water resources is indeed limited zhou et al 2019 however groundwater resources have been over abstracted and the groundwater level have declined incredibly due to agriculture irrigation for many parts of the world studies have showed that the global total consumptive groundwater use for irrigation is estimated as 545 km3 yr 1 or 43 of the total consumptive irrigation water use of 1277 km3 yr 1 faures et al 2010 as a result groundwater level has declined in many parts of the world for example groundwater level has declined at 0 5 2 0 m yr 1 in north china plain ncp due to the unsustainable over exploitation of groundwater resources since 1970 s zhang et al 2021 and numerous cones of depression were detected across ncp with a maximum depth of 62 m in the unconfined aquifers and 110 m in the confined ones wang et al 2018 groundwater resources carrying capacity grcc is defined as the capacity of groundwater resources for supporting social economic development with the continuous depletion of groundwater resources the capacity of groundwater resources for supporting the social economic development has been incredibly reduced qiu et al 2018 reported that there had been economic loss of 7 billion yuan of ncp in 2013 due to overdraft of groundwater resources therefore improving groundwater resources carrying capacity grcc is an important way to reverse declining trend of groundwater level and achieve social sustainable development over the past years although many methods have been constructed for assessing the grcc the concept of grcc has not been unified chen and qu 2012 defined grcc as the ability to support the coordinated development of population resources ecological environment and social economy in the irrigation areas while liu et al 2017 defined grcc as the maximum support capacity of groundwater resources for regional socio economic development expressed in terms of the sustainable socio economic development scale population gdp as the water resources consisted of surface and groundwater resources some researchers have used the water resources carrying capacity to describe grcc lu et al 2017 defined the agricultural water resource carrying capacity awrcc as the maximum crop production that a regional water resource can support without environmental degradation and qi et al 2021 used this definition to analyze the spatiotemporal variations of awrcc and investigate the impact of climatic factors on the awrcc zhang et al 2019 used the water resources water environment carrying capacity wr wecc to judge the regional macro control ability of water resources however these definitions and methods are not able to integrate hydrological variables and economic variables and cannot reflect the relationship between groundwater withdrawal and the stage of regional economic development therefore it is critical to construct an improved index for assessing grcc considering both hydrological variables and economic variables gao et al 2020 constructed an improved index based on the report of liu et al 2017 for assessing grcc in zhangjiakou hebei province china zjk and reported that over exploitation of groundwater for irrigation accelerated the decline of grcc this improved index integrated hydrological and economic variables which can reflect relationship between the groundwater withdrawal and the stage of regional economic development also this index constructed a parameter estimation model using budyko equation which provides new ideas and methods for evaluating grcc in large areas grcc is an important index for assessing the status of the groundwater resources which would be influenced by many factors dai et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 sun et al 2019 studied the effects of reservoir interception on grcc and reported that the construction of underground reservoirs can reduce the evaporation and improve water use efficiency and grcc liu 2003 explained the potential ecological effects of the south to north water transfer project on the groundwater depletion in the north china plain and reported that this project can save groundwater resources and restore ecology mou and liu 1994 also demonstrated that reasonable urban planning can improve the regional grcc the above studies showed that the improvement of the regional grcc is a systematic project the grcc could be improved by taking different measures based on the regional characteristics of the natural environment and social economic development stage therefore identifying the key factors influencing grcc is critical for improving grcc in surface water limited regions the north china plain is one of the hot spot areas where groundwater resources depleted rapidly all over the world studies have shown that there would be 6 8 billion tons of groundwater loss annually in ncp gong et al 2018 as an important water conservation functional area and ecological environment support area for beijing china zjk is one of the typical groundwater over exploitation areas in ncp due to the limited surface water resources extensive groundwater extraction and unreasonable crop distribution nearly 46 million m3 of groundwater has been over exploited and the grcc in zjk has been reduced and it is critical to improve the grcc in zjk for the regional ecological civilization construction and sustainable development the crop distribution of zjk have changed from rain fed agriculture to irrigated agriculture since 1960 s with the improvement of irrigation conditions the major crop distribution in zjk were planting three crops in two years four crops in three years and one crop in one year while these crop distributions were high intensity irrigated agricultural production mode in zjk therefore the crop distribution of zjk has changed incredibly with planting area decline of low water consumed crops and increasing of high water consumed crops vegetable fruits etc the super scale and high intensity production mode caused by the transformation of crop distribution is the root cause of the consumption of groundwater in irrigated agriculture therefore the determination of the relationship between crop distribution and grcc is critical for developing water saving agriculture formulating feasible regional irrigation schemes and protecting limited groundwater resources however the drivers and mechanisms of grcc variation remain unknown therefore the major objectives of this study were to 1 identify the key influencing factors of grcc in zjk 2 quantify and optimize the key influencing factors 3 determine the relationship between crop distribution and grcc 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data sources the study region zjk is located in the northwest of beijing china with a total area of 37 000 km2 and zjk constitutes two different regions namely bashang bs and baxia bx based on the elevation zjk is the major groundwater overexploited area in hebei province china and also the important water conservation functional area and ecological environment support area of beijing fig 1 land use in zjk is mainly divided into farmland woodland grassland water bodies urban area and unused land the climate of zjk is continental semi arid monsoon with the annual average temperature of 8 6 the average annual rainfall is about 300 400 mm and mainly concentrated in june to september accounting for 78 of the total annual rainfall fig 1 the annual average groundwater resources in bs is 3 7 108 m3 which were mainly used for irrigation and domestic use the annual average total groundwater recharge in bs is about 3 7 108 m³ of which the rainfall recharge accounts for 86 of the total recharge the lateral recharge accounts for 13 and the other recharge accounts for 1 while in bx 84 of domestic and industrial water comes from groundwater and 64 of agricultural water comes from groundwater the groundwater recharge in bx is mainly including rainfall infiltration recharge 28 lateral runoff recharge at the entrance of the river valley 14 yanghe tributary inlet base flow recharge 18 river leakage replenishment 2 4 channel leakage replenishment 6 3 canal irrigation field infiltration replenishment 14 and well irrigation return replenishment 6 2 2 2 framework of grcc in this study the definition of grcc is the ability of groundwater resources to support regional social and economic development under certain industrial water efficiency conditions which expressed in terms of supporting gdp yuan gao et al 2020 defined grcc as the function of allowable groundwater withdrawal w ke and comprehensive water use efficiency η and the grcc is calculated as 1 g r c c η w k e η a η i n d u b η a g r i c η t h i r d 2 η a g r i g a g r i q a g r i η i n d u g i n d u q i n d u η t h i r d g t h i r d q t h i r d where η is the comprehensive water use efficiency yuan mm 1 which can be calculated by agriculture water use efficiency η agri industry water use efficiency η indu and service water use η third gagri gindu and gthird are gdp for agriculture industry and service industry yuan qagri qindu and qthird are water consumption for agriculture industry and service industry mm a b c are ratio between water consumption for agriculture industry and service industry to the total water consumption wke of zjk were estimated as 5 66 108 m3 in 1970 s 8 52 108 m3 in 1980 s 9 77 108 m3 in 1990 s and 10 5 108 m3 in 2000 s respectively zhang and li 2005 the annual actual grcc grcca and maximum grcc grccmax can be calculated using wke and maximum annual η ηmax 3 g r c c a η w k e g r c c max η max w k e in order to assess relationship between degree of groundwater exploitation and economic development grcc index is defined as 4 d r g r q r g g r c c a g r c c max r q w w k e where d is the grcc index which is used to assess whether the economic development supported by groundwater resources has exceed theoretical maximum grccmax rg is the degree of economic development supported by groundwater resources rq is degree of groundwater withdrawal w is the annual actual groundwater withdrawal and the higher d value indicates lower grcc which means the local economic development depend much more on groundwater resources the status of grcc is defined as no overload d 30 overload 30 d 50 and heavy overload d 50 the detail information for calculating the w and w ke are reported by gao et al 2020 2 3 identification of key factors influencing grcc 2 3 1 selection of the influencing factors the data used to identify the key influencing factors of grcc in this study consisted of water resources factors eco environmental factors and social factors table 1 rainfall and et are selected to assess the grcc since they are major sources of water supply and consumption in zjk gwc can be used to reflect the change trend of groundwater resources and crop distribution can also reflect the spatial and temporal variation in agriculture water use and irrigation water use and further influencing the agriculture gdp and grcc xie et al 2012 also reported that population can also influence the water resources carrying capacity and therefore was selected for assessing the grcc in this study population were obtained from zjk economic yearbook zhangjiakou municipal people s government 2018 rainfall and et were obtained from global land data assimilation system gldas https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets keywords gldas before we input the et data from gldas into the grcc assessment the hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1985 were used to verify the et data from the gldas since our study region is located in the semi arid region and the results were showed in fig s1 gwc is groundwater storage change and were obtained from nasa jet propulsion laboratory s tellus website http grace jpl nasa gov and the results of gao et al 2020 leaf area index lai were obtained from inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project https www isimip org the time periods of the above data ranged from 1995 to 2018 and the spatial resolution was 0 5 0 5 all these data were used to analyze and identify the key factors affecting the grcc variation the crop planting areas were obtained from hebei rural statistical yearbook zjk economic yearbook zjk yearbook and the land use data was obtained from resource and environmental science data center of chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn data aspx dataid 125 2 3 2 correlation analysis correlation between d and influencing factors were analyzed using multiple linear regression equation 5 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β m x m ε where β 0 β 1 β m are parameters to be estimated ε is the random variable subject to n 0 σ 2 set the dependent variable y and the independent variable to obtain a set of data through n observations 6 y α x α 1 x α 2 x α m α 1 2 3 n where the subscript of x α j are observation number and the number of the independent variable substitute this set of data into eq 2 to get 7 y 1 β 0 β 1 x 11 β 2 x 12 β m x 1 m ε 1 y 2 β 0 β 1 x 21 β 2 x 22 β m x 2 m ε 2 y n β 0 β 1 x n 1 β 2 x n 2 β m x n m ε n to simplify the expression the following matrix notation is used 8 y y 1 y 2 y n x 1 x 11 x 12 x 1 m 1 x 21 x 22 x 2 m 1 x n 1 x n 2 x n m 9 β β 1 β 2 β n ε ε 1 ε 2 ε n it can then be abbreviated as 10 y x β ε in order to estimate β the least square method is used suppose b 0 b 1 b m that are the least squares estimates of β 0 β 1 β m respectively then the estimated equation is 11 y ˆ b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b m x m similar to one variable linear regression the so called least squares estimation β 0 β 1 β m of

filter a certain number of sample combinations from the original data to obtain different training sets and generate a decision tree for each training set the random forest model can discriminate the importance of the independent variable to change the dependent variable and sort it in the regression analysis díaz uriarte and de andres 2006 the incmse index of random forest is used to assess the importance of each independent variable in the decision making of the dependent variable the higher incmse value the more important relationship between d and the corresponding factors and the major calculation process of incmse are as follows firstly classifying and selecting the factors that affect the grcc in zjk for importance analysis secondly normalizing the time series of each factor eliminating the problem of inconsistent units of different factors and analyzing the fluctuation characteristics of each factor thirdly the multiple regression model was used to establish the regression equation between different factors and d and the correlation coefficient between each factor and d was analyzed finally the error for each independent variable were calculated using the independent variable time series data respectively denoted as f1 f2 fn and randomly transform the index data to form new index data f11 f12 f1n then incmse were calculated as 14 i n c m s e f j j 1 k f i j f j b 1 2 4 optimal allocation model of crop distribution the objective of the crop distribution optimization in zjk was to use minimum water and obtain maximum profits in this study we defined s ij as the planting area for the j crop in the i county of zjk and i ij and p ij are the irrigation quota and income per unit area p ij y ij m ij y ij and m ij are crop yield and the unit price the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of china issued the national crop distribution adjustment plan in 2016 therefore we set 2016 as the base year to see whether the water use and economic profits have been improved after implement of crop distribution adjustment plan therefore objective functions are defined as 1 minimum water use 15 min w i 1 m j 1 n i i j s i j 2 maximum economic profits 16 max e i 1 m j 1 n p i j s i j the optimized total planting area is less than the current total planting area the base year is 2016 17 i 1 m j 1 n s i j s 2016 the optimized total water consumption is less than the current total water consumption the base year is 2016 18 i 1 m j 1 n i i j s i j w 2016 where minw is the minimum water use m3 maxe is the maximum economic profits yuan s 2016 and w 2016 are crop total planting area m 2 and water consumption of each county in 2016 m 3 the decision variables are crop planting area spring wheat spring maize potato and cabbage the crop yield in 2016 for each county are showed in table 2 there is the possibility that the planting areas are the same but water use is different because of the crop distribution therefore different counties of zjk may have different crop distribution based on the objective function one of the objectives of this study is to select the suitable crop distribution with minimum water use and maximum economic profits also we set another objective function lowest grcc index therefore although different water use and economic profits may occurred the grcc index can be used to determine which crop distribution should be selected 2 5 optimizing crop distribution scenarios different crop distribution may have different water consumption economic profits and water use efficiency the grcc defined in this study integrated the water consumption data water use efficiency and economic profits therefore grcc would be different if the crop distribution are changed the optimal scenario was determined when d and water consumption obtained lowest values while economic profits obtained the highest values based on the objective functions eqs 15 18 in order to determine the impacts of crop distribution on grcc 30 different crop distribution scenarios were set up based on the reduction of irrigation quota and crop planting types information of the crop distribution scenarios are shown in table 3 irrigation water quota reduced by 20 s20 and 50 s50 for four three two one crops of spring wheat spring corn potato and cabbage specifically the base year is set as 2016 and the irrigation quotas for spring wheat spring corn potatoes and cabbage were 2370 1665 1800 and 3750 m3 ha respectively li 2016 2 6 particle swarm optimization according to the optimal allocation model we constructed in section 2 4 particle swarm optimization algorithm pso was used to optimize the crop distribution eberhart and kennedy 1995 constructed the pso algorithm and the optimal solution can be obtained by random solution and iterative method specifically the spatial location of the idealized massless particles were assumed as the optimized solution and all particles are given a fitness value determined by an optimization function while each particle also has a velocity value including direction and velocity all particles search for the optimal solution in space through the current optimal particle the initial solution of the pso algorithm is a set of random solutions which achieved through multiple iterations to find the optimal solution for a single bird to find food pbest and the optimal solution for the entire group to find food gbest specifically each particle uses the following formula to update its own speed and position 19 v i 1 ω v i c 1 r a n d p b e s t i x i c 2 r a n d g b e s t i x i 20 x i 1 x i v i where v i is the particle velocity rand is the random number between 0 1 w is the inertia factor and the higher value of w is the stronger ability global optimization have x i is the current position of the particle pbest and gbest are the individual optimal solutions and group optimal solutions of particles respectively c 1 and c 2 are learning factor c 1 c 2 2 based on optimal allocation model constructed in section 2 4 x ij is defined as the particles representing the crop planting area of each crop in each county each particle is coded according to a two dimensional array and the particle swarm set can be expressed as 21 p s 11 s 1 n s m 1 s m n where n is the number of crops n 4 in this study crops include wheat maize potato and cabbage m is the number of counties 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of key factors influencing grcc table 4 shows the value of eight normalized influencing factors in zjk between 1995 and 2018 the results showed that both f4 and f6 gave a downward trend ranging from 0 9 to 0 4 and from 1 0 to 0 02 while f5 and f8 gave an upward trend from 0 0 to 1 0 and from 0 0 to 0 9 it revealed that the crop distribution in zjk have been changed from grain crops dominated pattern to vegetable crops dominated pattern with the increasing population farmers in zjk prefer planting vegetables to grain crops over the past 20 years due to its high profits other hydrological factors f1 f2 and f3 showed less variation during 1995 and 2018 leaf area index f7 also showed less variation in order to identify the key factors influencing grcc in zjk the multiple regression analysis was used to clarify whether there was correlation between these factors and d and random forest method was used to identify the key factors influencing grcc as shown in table 5 the coefficient of correlation r for the linear regression equation between d and influencing factors were very low ranging from 0 01 to 0 26 compared to the quantic function r value ranging from 0 32 to 0 65 the results indicated that linear regression equation is not suitable for reflecting the relationship between d and these influencing factors while quantic function can well capture this statistical relationship especially for factors f4 and f6 fig 2 displayed incmse index for each influencing factor ranging from 3 4 8 9 compared to other factors crop distribution f4 and f6 had relative high correlation with d based on the multiple regression analysis table 5 furthermore the incmse index of f4 and f6 obtained the highest value fig 2 based on the random forest importance analysis see 2 3 3 since the random forest model can discriminate the impacts of the independent variable on dependent variable the higher incmse value have the more important relationship between d and the corresponding factors in a word the results showed crop distribution is the key factor influencing grcc therefore changing the original crop distribution is critical for improving the grcc in zjk 3 2 variation in crop distribution and agriculture water use 3 2 1 land use change and crop distribution the results indicated that crop distribution is the key factors influencing grcc of zjk therefore the variation of crop distribution should be analyzed firstly the major land use type in zjk is consisted of farmlands forests grasslands water body and urban areas farmlands forests un used lands accounts for 48 19 2 of the total area while grassland water bodies and urban areas do not exceed 30 of the total area the urban area has increased significantly from 748 to 890 km2 and the farmland area increased from 17 595 to17 686 km2 forest area decreased from7119 to 6864 km2 between 1970 and 2015 fig 3 table 6 fig 4 showed that grain crop ratio decreased from 76 to 68 while the vegetable ratio increased from 6 to 18 due to the higher profit obtaining from planting vegetable in this study region as shown in fig 4 the major grain crops in zjk are wheat maize and potato which account for 21 29 and 19 of the total grain crops the planting area of wheat decreased from 34 to 14 while maize and potato increased from 14 to 36 and 14 22 respectively between 1995 and 2016 and the proportion of other grain crops dropped from 37 to 28 between 1995 and 2016 fig 4 showed that the major vegetables type in zjk are leaf vegetables roots crops melons beans and nightshade and the most planted vegetable crops is chinese cabbage which accounts for 42 in 2010 and 33 in 2016 to the total vegetables planting areas table 7 showed the crop planting area and percent in bs and bx of zjk in 2016 the major crops are spring wheat 41 and potato 46 in bs while are spring maize 67 and spring wheat 16 in bx respectively 3 2 2 agricultural water use change the area with low agricultural water use efficiency has extended from bx to bs fig 5 the reason for this extension may attribute to increasing planting area of water intensive crops before 2000 s the major crops in zjk were wheat and potato and the utilization rate of water resources was less than 20 of the total water resources however the planting area of water intensive crops especially the chinese cabbage has increased by 120 since 2001 from bx to bs ma et al 2014 and all these crops are irrigated with groundwater therefore the long term and disorderly expansion of planting area is extremely incompatible with the limited local water resources which has led to the expansion of low agricultural water use efficiency from bx to bs in zjk fig 6 showed the average gridded sector water use efficiency with stable trends from 1949 to 1979 increasing trends from 1980 to 2005 and decreasing trends from 2006 to 2018 in general agricultural water use efficiency has increased from 50 million yuan mm 1 to 200 million yuan mm 1 the agricultural water use efficiency stays stable from 1949 to 1980 before the significant increase from 1980 to 2005 the comprehensive water use efficiency stayed low value of 4 107 billon yuan mm 1 and showed significant increase between 1980 and 2005 while gave decrease trends after 2006 fig 6 although the water use efficiency has increased between 1980 and 2018 gao et al 2020 reported the total water use has increased accordingly in zjk it is indicated the water use in zjk has not been reduced with increasing trend of water use efficiency due to the expansion of planting area of water intensive crops the results agreed well with grafton et al 2018 which reported that only improving the irrigation water use efficiency or water use efficiency cannot alleviate the paradox between higher water demand and limited water resources applied 3 3 influencing of crop distribution on grcc fig 7 showed the d value for 30 crop distribution scenarios o1 o30 and base scenario b in zjk under two different irrigation reduction schemes s20 and s50 d was 60 in 2016 indicating the groundwater resources in zjk was in the state of heavy overload the average d for o1 o15 and o16 o30 were 45 and 21 indicating that these 30 crop distribution scenarios can improve the grcc with different range while the grcc for o1 o15 were still in the state of overload the average d for crop distribution scenarios o16 o30 had decreased to 30 indicating that these crop distribution scenarios can improve grcc in zjk the reduction in d for o16 o30 ranged from 53 to 83 compared to the base year in 2016 especially reduced by 83 for crop distribution scenarios o26 with d 10 therefore crop distribution scenarios o26 is the most suitable crop distribution in zjk and accordingly the irrigation water quota were 900 and 1875 m3 ha the planting area of potato and chinese cabbage were 36 885 and 362 936 ha improving the grcc is a systematic project and we need to take different strategies for different regions based on the characteristics of climate water resources and human activities han et al 2018 studied the impact of water diversion on grcc in jing jin ji region and reported that the grcc could be improved by 5 13 while mou and liu 1994 reported that reasonable urban planning is also important way to improve the grcc in this study the major reason for decline of grcc in zjk is the unreasonable crop distribution which lead to unreasonable use of groundwater resources therefore exploring the crop distribution in a proper way is useful for improving the regional grcc in zjk fig 8 showed the optimized crop distribution scenarios in each county of bs under two different irrigation reduction schemes all these 30 crop distribution scenarios have already been optimized based on the optimal allocation model see 2 4 the planting area in fig 8 for each crop distribution scenario are based on the objectives of maximum economic profits and minimum water use originally crop distribution scenarios should have four different crops for each irrigation schemes table 3 the optimized crop distribution have been changed after using optimal allocation model the optimized crop distribution o1 o30 in kangbao and zhangbei showed that only planting cabbage can achieve the objectives of maximum economic profits and minimum water use and the major reasons are 1 the average temperature and soil type in bs is suitable for planting cabbage 2 the transportation in bs is convenient to transport cabbage in shangyi and guyuan the optimized crop distribution scenarios o20 o22 o24 and o29 under irrigation reduction schemes s50 can obtain the highest economic profits and lowest water use compared to irrigation reduction schemes s20 the total crop planting area under irrigation scheme s50 has increased slightly for all the crop distribution scenarios specifically cabbage optimized planting area was 30 552 ha and is not influenced by the two different irrigation reduction schemes in zhangbei cabbage optimized planting area were 29 441 and 36 619 ha for s20 and s50 of the averaged crop distribution scenarios o1 o30 in shangyi the cabbage planting area for s50 has increased by 34 compared to s20 specifically the potato planting area for o20 o22 o24 and o29 for s50 was 9103 ha in guyuan planting area for s50 has increased by 30 compared to s20 specifically the potato planting area for o20 o22 o24 and o29 for s50 was 25 765 ha compared to the bs the potato planting area for the 30 crop distribution scenarios has increased in bx fig 9 since potato is suitable for planting in cooling environment and the temperature in bs is lower than in bx therefore farmers tend to plant more potatos in bs after implementation of national crop distribution adjustment plan in 2016 especially under irrigation reduction scheme s50 crop distribution scenarios o21 should plant spring wheat 17 236 ha and o28 should plant potato 8702 ha the total planting area in district ranged from 1610 to 3249 ha under irrigation reduction schemes s20 and s50 the potato planting area at chicheng wanquan and zhulu under irrigation reduction schemes s20 11 940 ha 15 579 ha 20 789 ha were higher than s50 7634 ha 7296 ha 8986 ha the optimal crop distribution for the whole zjk based on the total water use and economic profits were shown in fig 10 the average economic profits for all the crop distribution scenarios under irrigation reduction schemes s50 2 3 1010 yuan were higher than s20 1 8 1010 yuan based on the objective functions the crop distribution scenarios o26 obtained the highest economic profits of 2 8 1010 yuan and lowest water use of 7 1 108 m 3 and accordingly the potato and cabbage planting area were 36 885 and 362 936 ha respectively we compared the planting area between o26 and the base data in 2016 the potato planting area decreased by 65 780 ha and the cabbage increased by 324 839 ha and the total water use reduced by 14 o26 713 701 500 m 3 data in 2016 811 745 295 m 3 it is revealed that the change in regional crop distribution will not only influence the agricultural water use but also influence the regional economic development 4 conclusions owing to the spatial heterogeneity of climate water resources and human activities the assessment of sustainable use of groundwater is extremely complicated furthermore the identification of key factors influencing sustainable use of groundwater is also the major concern in agriculture depended regions in this study we used the improved constructed groundwater resources carrying capacity grcc index d for assessing the sustainable use of groundwater and identify the key factors influencing grcc in a typical groundwater overexploitation area zjk grcc integrates hydrological variables and economic variables and thus reflects the adaptive relationship between the utilization degree of groundwater resources and the degree of economic development the regression method and random forest method can well identify the key factors influencing grcc in groundwater depended regions and in this study crop distribution was identified as the key factor influencing grcc and sustainable use of groundwater in zjk therefore the key objective of this study is to reveal how crop distribution can improve the grcc and keep the sustainable use of groundwater resources in comparison with the irrigation reduction schemes irrigation water quota reduced by 20 s20 and 50 s50 the average economic profits for all the crop distribution scenarios under irrigation reduction schemes s50 2 3 1010 yuan were higher than that under s20 1 8 1010 yuan furthermore the total water use for optimized crop distribution o26 potato and cabbage planting area were 36 885 and 362 936 ha was 713 701 500 m 3 which was reduced by 14 compared to base scenarios in 2016 furthermore the d value o16 to o30 has decreased by 53 83 which means the groundwater would be sustainable by using this crop distribution with irrigation quotas are 900 and 1875 m3 ha respectively the results can provide decision making references for sustainable use

was one of the major food crops grown there the water required for the growth of dryland winter wheat is mainly derived from precipitation but the plateau region receives little precipitation with an uneven seasonal distribution the average annual precipitation was 400 600 mm primarily concentrated in june september because the precipitation and winter wheat growth stage are mismatched water has

2020 dong et al 2018 both pfm and sm are widespread practices that is applied globally previous studies discussed about the effects of straw and plastic film mulching on wheat yield or yield and water use efficiency globally qin et al 2015 wang et al 2021 however whether pfm or sm is used their effects on the yield increase vary distinctly across regions using meta analysis to explain the situation across different climate regions can reflect the effect of mulching globally in some aspect but the results based on relatively limited data is of limited accuracy it can hardly provide guidance for decision for wheat cultivation for example pfm and sm both exhibit a yield reducing effect in certain areas due to reduce soil temperature delay crop growth stunt reproductive organ development zhang et al 2021 liu et al 2017 therefore there exist uncertainties in the effects of mulching practices on the potential productivity of dryland wheat considering that the effects of mulching on the farmland microenvironment come mainly from two aspects temperature and precipitation yu et al 2018 huang et al 2021 the effects of mulching practices on the yield and water use of dryland wheat under different hydrothermal conditions also need to be further studied to determine their applicability the large number of relevant papers published in recent years make it capable for a meta analysis in the loess plateau hence in this study we focused on the situation in the loess plateau to study the effects of mulching on yield water consumption and water use efficiency under different temperatures and precipitation situation the results can provide guidance for regional agricultural production and can also provide reference for similar climate regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sources a literature search was conducted to retrieve articles published from 1997 to 2021 on mulching and the yield and water use efficiency wue of winter wheat in the dryland area of the loess plateau the web of science https webofknowledge com and china national knowledge infrastructure cnki https cnki com cn databases were searched with the following keywords winter wheat and plastic film mulching straw mulching mulching and yield water use efficiency the retrieved articles were selected for inclusion by the following criteria 1 the experimental locations were in the loess plateau 2 the experimental method was a field trial with no irrigation throughout the crop growth stage 3 the experimental treatments included plastic film mulching or straw mulching with no mulching as the control for each treatment 4 the yield wue and other indicators of winter wheat were reported in the form of digits figures or tables and 5 articles with repeat data the same experimental locations years and results were excluded after selection a total of 74 articles met the requirements their data including experimental locations mulching treatments yield wue and crop water consumption were extracted from the selected articles the data presented in the form of histograms or line charts were extracted after digitization using getdata graph digitizer 2 24 http www getdata graph digitizer com 2 2 boundary analysis of the water yield relationship and yield gap analysis boundary analysis is based on the concept raised by french schultz french and schultz 1984 all the yield and et data are illustrated in a scatter diagram the up boundary of the scatter dots is defined using an elasticity method proposed by lin and liu 2016b yield on the boundary line is the maximum yield under a specific et and is defined as the potential yield of the et yield gap is defined as the difference between actual yield and potential yield under the same et 2 3 data classification and database construction the geographical distribution of the experimental locations included in the 74 articles across the loess plateau is shown in fig 1 winter wheat is mainly distributed in the southern part of the loess plateau yang et al 2011 chen et al 2020b hence the data we collected is representative for winter wheat production in the loess plateau the mulching treatments included both sm wheat straw corn stalk and pfm degradable film ordinary film the precipitation and temperature in growth period were grouped according to the average precipitation or temperature round off number in growth period of experimental sites during 1995 2019 precipitation was grouped as 350 mm and 350 mm temperature group as 10 c and 10 c each group was further divided into different subgroups table 1 to study the impact of growth stage precipitation temperature and their combined effect on wheat yield 2 4 statistical data analysis for meta analysis when the experimental results are physical dimensional measurements and a result cannot be 0 the ratio between the mean values of two groups can be used as the effect size namely the response ratio r hedges and curtis 1999 here the response ratio r was used to calculate the effect size m linquist et al 2012 with the following eq 1 1 m ln r ln x e x c where m is the effect size of the experiment x e is the mean value of crop yield or wue corresponding to the experimental group with mulching and x c is the mean value of crop yield or wue corresponding to the control group with no mulching to facilitate the use of the relative change rate of crop yield and wue to explain the effects of mulching on these two outputs the results were converted into the relative change rate y with the following eqs 2 and 3 ainsworth et al 2002 2 y r 1 100 3 that is y exp m 1 100 because most of the studies did not provide variance an unweighted method chen et al 2013 was adopted and meta win 2 1 was used to bias correct the 95 confidence intervals cis rosenberg et al 2000 differences in mean effect size among groups were calculated using random effect models borenstein et al 2009 a bootstrapping procedure 9999 iterations was used to improve the probability that the confidence interval was calculated around the cumulative mean effect size for each categorical variable daryanto et al 2017 if the 95 confidence interval did not overlap with zero there are significant positive or negative differences between mulching and no mulching treatments p 0 05 otherwise the treatment effect was not considered significant between methods curtis and wang 1998 additionally the means standard deviations or standard errors and sample sizes of the variables concerned had to be directly available or able to be calculated from the

1 water yield relationship of winter wheat in the loess plateau under mulching conditions winter wheat yield shows a positive correlation with water consumption the boundary equation of yield and water consumption was obtained by quantile regression when water consumption was less than 353 8 mm the boundary equation of winter wheat yield and water consumption was a straight line with a slope of 33 13 and an x intercept of 67 8 mm when the water consumption was higher than 353 8 mm the yield reached 9474 2 kg ha and no longer increased with increasing water consumption the different yields were dominated by the data points of pfm treatment being near the lower and upper horizontal boundaries fig 2 the analysis of the yield gap under different mulching practices indicated a decreasing trend under pfm conditions whereas little difference was observed under sm compared with no mulching treatment when the yield gap change rates under pfm and sm conditions were analysed with no mulching treatment as the control both pfm and sm reduced the yield gap significantly fig 3 3 2 effects of different mulching practices on wheat yield water consumption and wue pfm increased wheat yield by 24 while straw mulching resulted in a yield increase of 12 fig 4a pfm also raised the water consumption of wheat by 3 but sm had no effect on water consumption fig 4b furthermore pfm increased the wue of wheat by 19 while sm increased it by 13 fig 4c the above mentioned increases were all significant 3 3 effects of mulching practices on wheat yield water consumption and wue under different precipitation conditions when there was 350 mm precipitation in the growth stage pfm significantly increased wheat yield by 22 and sm increased it by 14 when 350 mm precipitation occurred in the growth stage wheat yield showed an increase of 28 and 8 under pfm and sm respectively fig 5a under different precipitation conditions water consumption in the growth stage of winter wheat treated with pfm increased significantly but sm had no such effect fig 5b in terms of wue sm had no significant effect on it while pfm significantly increased it when there was 350 mm precipitation both pfm and sm significantly improved wue when the precipitation was 350 mm fig 5c 3 4 effects of mulching on wheat yield water consumption and wue under different average temperatures in the growth stage when the average temperature of the growth stage was 10 c pfm and sm significantly increased wheat yield by 21 and 14 respectively when the average temperature in the growth stage was 10 c pfm resulted in a significant yield increase of 18 and sm achieved a significant yield increase of 9 fig 6a in the case of a 10 c average temperature in the growth stage water consumption of wheat treated with pfm was increased by 5 but water consumption under sm exhibited a decreasing trend albeit not significant with a 10 c average temperature in the growth stage pfm and sm had no significant effects on water consumption fig 6b with a 10 c average temperature in the growth stage the wue of wheat under both pfm and sm conditions was significantly increased by 17 and 14 respectively fig 6c 3 5 comprehensive effects of mulching on wheat yield water consumption and wue under different hydrothermal conditions under 350 mm precipitation and 10 c average temperature in the growth stage pfm and sm increased wheat yield by 25 and 15 respectively both significant fig 7a sm had no significant effect on water consumption while pfm significantly increased water consumption in the growth stage fig 7b wue was significantly improved by the two mulching practices fig 7c under 350 mm precipitation and 10 c average temperature in the growth stage pfm significantly increased wheat yield by 16 while the yield increasing effect of sm was not significant fig 7a there was no significant difference in water consumption or wue under straw mulching fig 7b c pfm also had no significant effect on water consumption but it significantly increased wue by 19 with 350 mm precipitation and 10 c average temperature in the growth stage sm had no significant effects on the yield water consumption or wue while pfm increased the yield by 40 and wue by 31 fig 7 in the case of 350 mm precipitation and 10 c average temperature in the growth stage pfm and sm increased wheat yield by 20 and 10 respectively fig 7a water consumption and wue were respectively increased by 3 and 20 under pfm but sm had no significant effect on water consumption or wue fig 7b c 4 discussion 4 1 effects of mulching practices on water use of dryland winter wheat the results of this study indicated that both pfm and sm increased the yield of dryland wheat and the yield increase rate achieved by pfm was twice that obtained by sm fig 4a pfm significantly enhanced crop water consumption while sm had no such effect fig 4b a possible reason is that although pfm reduces soil surface evaporation while under pfm crop growth accelerates and biomass increases which increased water consumption used by transpiration li et al 2013 ding et al 2018 on the one hand sm can reduce soil water evaporation in farmland on the other hand it has a double edged effect on rainfall infiltration namely preventing infiltration when the rainfall intensity and amount are low and promoting infiltration when the rainfall intensity is high rahma et al 2017 consequently there is a large uncertainty in the effects of sm on water consumption in farmland the present research summarizes the results of different studies so the balance of effects on water consumption was not significant either pfm or sm promoted the effective use of water by crops therefore mulching can considerably improve the farmland wue of dryland winter wheat boundary analysis showed that the data points located near the boundary lines were mainly associated with pfm the low yields under different water consumption levels came mainly from the ck and the yields of sm treatment were located between those of pfm and ck this distribution further suggests that mulching treatment especially pfm can effectively increase the yield of winter wheat and reduce its yield gap under different water consumption levels in addition although the study areas were all in the loess plateau the boundary equation established in this study had a larger slope but an increased intercept than the equation derived by zhang 2013 one of the reasons is method used may lead to part of the difference more importantly the current study involved relevant results published in recent years improved agronomy practices and water efficient varieties in recent years may lead to improved wue 4 2 impact of hydrothermal conditions on the water use and yield of dryland wheat under mulching conditions the present results showed that with different precipitation levels in the growth stage both pfm and sm increased the yield and wue of wheat and the effects of pfm were better than those of sm under the two mulching practices wheat yield and wue under 350 mm precipitation in the growth stage were higher than those under 350 mm fig 5 meanwhile we also analysed the influence of average annual precipitation on water use and yield the yield and et variations among different treatments were similar to those in the growth stage fig s1 which means mulching method influence yield and water use by influence precipitation use in growth period this is because under low precipitation part of the rainwater is intercepted by straw mulch this water may be lost via ineffective evaporation so less water can be absorbed and used by wheat hu et al 2018 wang et al 2015 this mechanism is consistent with the results of the present research that is with 350 mm precipitation in the growth stage the wheat yield and its increase rate obtained under pfm were significantly higher than those obtained under sm with different average temperatures in the growth stage both pfm and sm increased wheat yield and wue under either mulching practices wheat yield and wue were both higher with a 10 c average temperature in the growth stage than with 10 c fig 6 pfm and sm showed variable effects under different average temperatures in the growth stage when the average temperature in the growth stage was 10 c the yield wue and their change rates under pfm were all significantly higher than those under sm at the same time we also analysed the influence of autumn and spring temperature on water use and yield the results showed that no matter yield or wue the change of effect size was similar in autumn temperature and spring temperature groups compared with the average temperatures in the growth stage there is no difference in the overall trend but there are some differences in the rate of change fig s2 this difference may arise because pfm could increase the topsoil temperature li et al 2021 although the amount of solar radiation that directly reaches the soil surface of farmland is decreased by pfm soil heat loss occurs very slowly due to the blocking effect of the plastic film so the soil temperature is maintained meanwhile owing to the reduction in soil evaporation the heat loss from water vaporization is also reduced liu et al 2020 yang et al 2018 under lower temperatures the warming effect of pfm is more important for wheat so its yield increasing effect is more pronounced in contrast sm has a more distinct effect of increasing yield under higher temperatures perhaps because sm has an evident cooling effect chen et al 2016 this effect is large in the early stages and small in the later stages of the growth stage the more straw mulch applied the more pronounced the cooling effect dai and dong 2009 and zhou et al 2009 also indicated that in the northwest dryland region of china with little precipitation and insufficient accumulated temperature sm lowers the ground temperature so lower soil temperature impairs seedling emergence and growth and causes slow development which ultimately lead to nonsignificant increases or even decreases in crop yield therefore at higher temperatures the cooling effect caused by sm has less adverse influence on crops and thus results in a greater increase in yield based on a comprehensive consideration of the benefits of water and temperature the yield increasing effect of pfm was greater than that of sm the primary reason for this phenomenon is that pfm promotes water retention better than sm while the warming effect of pfm facilitates crop growth the effect of sm on wheat yield showed greater variability when the growth stage had 350 mm precipitation with 10 c average temperature or 350 mm precipitation with 10 c average temperature the yield increasing effect was not significant and there was a possible yield reduction fig 7 one possible reason is that under high temperature and low precipitation crop straw intercepts part of the low precipitation at higher temperatures this part of the precipitation cannot pass through the mulch layer to evaporate thus further reducing the replenishment of soil moisture by precipitation he et al 2018 which reduces the yield due to insufficient water under high precipitation and low temperature excessive soil water further magnifies the cooling effect of crop straw thereby reducing the yield due to low soil temperature wang et al 2021 pfm showed a yield increasing effect under different hydrothermal conditions the largest yield increase rate was obtained under the low temperature conditions of 10 c while the yield increase rate was relatively low under high temperature and low precipitation 10 c and 350 mm these results indicate that the importance of pfm for soil warming is greater than its importance for water retention during the production of dryland winter wheat in the loess plateau 5 conclusions this study explored the effects of pfm and sm on water use and the yield of wheat in the loess plateau through boundary analysis and meta analysis both pfm and sm effectively reduced the difference between actual yield and potential yield under different water consumption levels pfm and sm prominently improved the yield and water use efficiency of winter wheat in the loess plateau area the hydrothermal conditions impacted the water use and yield increasing effect under different mulching practices from an overall perspective pfm achieved a large yield increase under lower temperatures 10 c while the yield under sm was considerably impacted by temperature and precipitation compared with pfm sm showed no yield or wue increasement effect under high temperature with low precipitation 10 c 350 mm or low temperature with high precipitation 10 c 350 mm funding sources funding

2020 dong et al 2018 both pfm and sm are widespread practices that is applied globally previous studies discussed about the effects of straw and plastic film mulching on wheat yield or yield and water use efficiency globally qin et al 2015 wang et al 2021 however whether pfm or sm is used their effects on the yield increase vary distinctly across regions using meta analysis to explain the situation across different climate regions can reflect the effect of mulching globally in some aspect but the results based on relatively limited data is of limited accuracy it can hardly provide guidance for decision for wheat cultivation for example pfm and sm both exhibit a yield reducing effect in certain areas due to reduce soil temperature delay crop growth stunt reproductive organ development zhang et al 2021 liu et al 2017 therefore there exist uncertainties in the effects of mulching practices on the potential productivity of dryland wheat considering that the effects of mulching on the farmland microenvironment come mainly from two aspects temperature and precipitation yu et al 2018 huang et al 2021 the effects of mulching practices on the yield and water use of dryland wheat under different hydrothermal conditions also need to be further studied to determine their applicability the large number of relevant papers published in recent years make it capable for a meta analysis in the loess plateau hence in this study we focused on the situation in the loess plateau to study the effects of mulching on yield water consumption and water use efficiency under different temperatures and precipitation situation the results can provide guidance for regional agricultural production and can also provide reference for similar climate regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sources a literature search was conducted to retrieve articles published from 1997 to 2021 on mulching and the yield and water use efficiency wue of winter wheat in the dryland area of the loess plateau the web of science https webofknowledge com and china national knowledge infrastructure cnki https cnki com cn databases were searched with the following keywords winter wheat and plastic film mulching straw mulching mulching and yield water use efficiency the retrieved articles were selected for inclusion by the following criteria 1 the experimental locations were in the loess plateau 2 the experimental method was a field trial with no irrigation throughout the crop growth stage 3 the experimental treatments included plastic film mulching or straw mulching with no mulching as the control for each treatment 4 the yield wue and other indicators of winter wheat were reported in the form of digits figures or tables and 5 articles with repeat data the same experimental locations years and results were excluded after selection a total of 74 articles met the requirements their data including experimental locations mulching treatments yield wue and crop water consumption were extracted from the selected articles the data presented in the form of histograms or line charts were extracted after digitization using getdata graph digitizer 2 24 http www getdata graph digitizer com 2 2 boundary analysis of the water yield relationship and yield gap analysis boundary analysis is based on the concept raised by french schultz french and schultz 1984 all the yield and et data are illustrated in a scatter diagram the up boundary of the scatter dots is defined using an elasticity method proposed by lin and liu 2016b yield on the boundary line is the maximum yield under a specific et and is defined as the potential yield of the et yield gap is defined as the difference between actual yield and potential yield under the same et 2 3 data classification and database construction the geographical distribution of the experimental locations included in the 74 articles across the loess plateau is shown in fig 1 winter wheat is mainly distributed in the southern part of the loess plateau yang et al 2011 chen et al 2020b hence the data we collected is representative for winter wheat production in the loess plateau the mulching treatments included both sm wheat straw corn stalk and pfm degradable film ordinary film the precipitation and temperature in growth period were grouped according to the average precipitation or temperature round off number in growth period of experimental sites during 1995 2019 precipitation was grouped as 350 mm and 350 mm temperature group as 10 c and 10 c each group was further divided into different subgroups table 1 to study the impact of growth stage precipitation temperature and their combined effect on wheat yield 2 4 statistical data analysis for meta analysis when the experimental results are physical dimensional measurements and a result cannot be 0 the ratio between the mean values of two groups can be used as the effect size namely the response ratio r hedges and curtis 1999 here the response ratio r was used to calculate the effect size m linquist et al 2012 with the following eq 1 1 m ln r ln x e x c where m is the effect size of the experiment x e is the mean value of crop yield or wue corresponding to the experimental group with mulching and x c is the mean value of crop yield or wue corresponding to the control group with no mulching to facilitate the use of the relative change rate of crop yield and wue to explain the effects of mulching on these two outputs the results were converted into the relative change rate y with the following eqs 2 and 3 ainsworth et al 2002 2 y r 1 100 3 that is y exp m 1 100 because most of the studies did not provide variance an unweighted method chen et al 2013 was adopted and meta win 2 1 was used to bias correct the 95 confidence intervals cis rosenberg et al 2000 differences in mean effect size among groups were calculated using random effect models borenstein et al 2009 a bootstrapping procedure 9999 iterations was used to improve the probability that the confidence interval was calculated around the cumulative mean effect size for each categorical variable daryanto et al 2017 if the 95 confidence interval did not overlap with zero there are significant positive or negative differences between mulching and no mulching treatments p 0 05 otherwise the treatment effect was not considered significant between methods curtis and wang 1998 additionally the means standard deviations or standard errors and sample sizes of the variables concerned had to be directly available or able to be calculated from the data zhao et al 2015 water use efficiency g kg was defined as eq 4 4 wue y et where y is yield kg ha et is evapotranspiration mm reported in the study because all of the studies were conducted in no irrigation condition where et is closely related to rainfall input when et was not reported in the studies we considered et is equal to rainfall input during the crop growing season excel 2019

1 water yield relationship of winter wheat in the loess plateau under mulching conditions winter wheat yield shows a positive correlation with water consumption the boundary equation of yield and water consumption was obtained by quantile regression when water consumption was less than 353 8 mm the boundary equation of winter wheat yield and water consumption was a straight line with a slope of 33 13 and an x intercept of 67 8 mm when the water consumption was higher than 353 8 mm the yield reached 9474 2 kg ha and no longer increased with increasing water consumption the different yields were dominated by the data points of pfm treatment being near the lower and upper horizontal boundaries fig 2 the analysis of the yield gap under different mulching practices indicated a decreasing trend under pfm conditions whereas little difference was observed under sm compared with no mulching treatment when the yield gap change rates under pfm and sm conditions were analysed with no mulching treatment as the control both pfm and sm reduced the yield gap significantly fig 3 3 2 effects of different mulching practices on wheat yield water consumption and wue pfm increased wheat yield by 24 while straw mulching resulted in a yield increase of 12 fig 4a pfm also raised the water consumption of wheat by 3 but sm had no effect on water consumption fig 4b furthermore pfm increased the wue of wheat by 19 while sm increased it by 13 fig 4c the above mentioned increases were all significant 3 3 effects of mulching practices on wheat yield water consumption and wue under different precipitation conditions when there was 350 mm precipitation in the growth stage pfm significantly increased wheat yield by 22 and sm increased it by 14 when 350 mm precipitation occurred in the growth stage wheat yield showed an increase of 28 and 8 under pfm and sm respectively fig 5a under different precipitation conditions water consumption in the growth stage of winter wheat treated with pfm increased significantly but sm had no such effect fig 5b in terms of wue sm had no significant effect on it while pfm significantly increased it when there was 350 mm precipitation both pfm and sm significantly improved wue when the precipitation was 350 mm fig 5c 3 4 effects of mulching on wheat yield water consumption and wue under different average temperatures in the growth stage when the average temperature of the growth stage was 10 c pfm and sm significantly increased wheat yield by 21 and 14 respectively when the average temperature in the growth stage was 10 c pfm resulted in a significant yield increase of 18 and sm achieved a significant yield increase of 9 fig 6a in the case of a 10 c average temperature in the growth stage water consumption of wheat treated with pfm was increased by 5 but water consumption under sm exhibited a decreasing trend albeit not significant with a 10 c average temperature in the growth stage pfm and sm had no significant effects on water consumption fig 6b with a 10 c average temperature in the growth stage the wue of wheat under both pfm and sm conditions was significantly increased by 17 and 14 respectively fig 6c 3 5 comprehensive effects of mulching on wheat yield water consumption and wue under different hydrothermal conditions under 350 mm precipitation and 10 c average temperature in the growth stage pfm and sm increased wheat yield by 25 and 15 respectively both significant fig 7a sm had no significant effect on water consumption while pfm significantly increased water consumption in the growth stage fig 7b wue was significantly improved by the two mulching practices fig 7c under 350 mm precipitation and 10 c average temperature in the growth stage pfm significantly increased wheat yield by 16 while the yield increasing effect of sm was not significant fig 7a there was no significant difference in water consumption or wue under straw mulching fig 7b c pfm also had no significant effect on water consumption but it significantly increased wue by 19 with 350 mm precipitation and 10 c average temperature in the growth stage sm had no significant effects on the yield water consumption or wue while pfm increased the yield by 40 and wue by 31 fig 7 in the case of 350 mm precipitation and 10 c average temperature in the growth stage pfm and sm increased wheat yield by 20 and 10 respectively fig 7a water consumption and wue were respectively increased by 3 and 20 under pfm but sm had no significant effect on water consumption or wue fig 7b c 4 discussion 4 1 effects of mulching practices on water use of dryland winter wheat the results of this study indicated that both pfm and sm increased the yield of dryland wheat and the yield increase rate achieved by pfm was twice that obtained by sm fig 4a pfm significantly enhanced crop water consumption while sm had no such effect fig 4b a possible reason is that although pfm reduces soil surface evaporation while under pfm crop growth accelerates and biomass increases which increased water consumption used by transpiration li et al 2013 ding et al 2018 on the one hand sm can reduce soil water evaporation in farmland on the other hand it has a double edged effect on rainfall infiltration namely preventing infiltration when the rainfall intensity and amount are low and promoting infiltration when the rainfall intensity is high rahma et al 2017 consequently there is a large uncertainty in the effects of sm on water consumption in farmland the present research summarizes the results of different studies so the balance of effects on water consumption was not significant either pfm or sm promoted the effective use of water by crops therefore mulching can considerably improve the farmland wue of dryland winter wheat boundary analysis showed that the data points located near the boundary lines were mainly associated with pfm the low yields under different water consumption levels came mainly from the ck and the yields of sm treatment were located between those of pfm and ck this distribution further suggests that mulching treatment especially pfm can effectively increase the yield of winter wheat and reduce its yield gap under different water consumption levels in addition although the study areas were all in the loess plateau the boundary equation established in this study had a larger slope but an increased intercept than the equation derived by zhang 2013 one of the reasons is method used may lead to part of the difference more importantly the current study involved relevant results published in recent years improved agronomy practices and water efficient varieties in recent years may lead to improved wue 4 2 impact of hydrothermal conditions on the water use and yield of dryland wheat under mulching conditions the present results showed that with different precipitation levels in the growth stage both pfm and sm increased the yield and wue of wheat and the effects of pfm were better than those of sm under the two mulching practices wheat yield and wue under 350 mm precipitation in the growth stage were higher than those under 350 mm fig 5 meanwhile we also analysed the influence of average annual precipitation on water use and yield the yield and et variations among different treatments were similar to those in the growth stage fig s1 which means mulching method influence yield and water use by influence precipitation use in growth period this is because under low precipitation part of the rainwater is intercepted by straw mulch this water may be lost via ineffective evaporation so less water can be absorbed and used by wheat hu et al 2018 wang et al 2015 this mechanism is consistent with the results of the present research that is with 350 mm precipitation in the growth stage the wheat yield and its increase rate obtained under pfm were significantly higher than those obtained under sm with different average temperatures in the growth stage both pfm and sm increased wheat yield and wue under either mulching practices wheat yield and wue were both higher with a 10 c average temperature in the growth stage than with 10 c fig 6 pfm and sm showed variable effects under different average temperatures in the growth stage when the average temperature in the growth stage was 10 c the yield wue and their change rates under pfm were all significantly higher than those under sm at the same time we also analysed the influence of autumn and spring temperature on water use and yield the results showed that no matter yield or wue the change of effect size was similar in autumn temperature and spring temperature groups compared with the average temperatures in the growth stage there is no difference in the overall trend but there are some differences in the rate of change fig s2 this difference may arise because pfm could increase the topsoil temperature li et al 2021 although the amount of solar radiation that directly reaches the soil surface of farmland is decreased by pfm soil heat loss occurs very slowly due to the blocking effect of the plastic film so the soil temperature is maintained meanwhile owing to the reduction in soil evaporation the heat loss from water vaporization is also reduced liu et al 2020 yang et al 2018 under lower temperatures the warming effect of pfm is more important for wheat so its yield increasing effect is more pronounced in contrast sm has a more distinct effect of increasing yield under higher temperatures perhaps because sm has an evident cooling effect chen et al 2016 this effect is large in the early stages and small in the later stages of the growth stage the more straw mulch applied the more pronounced the cooling effect dai and dong 2009 and zhou et al 2009 also indicated that in the northwest dryland region of china with little precipitation and insufficient accumulated temperature sm lowers the ground temperature so lower soil temperature impairs seedling emergence and growth and causes slow development which ultimately lead to nonsignificant increases or even decreases in crop yield therefore at higher temperatures the cooling effect caused by sm has less adverse influence on crops and thus results in a greater increase in yield based on a comprehensive consideration of the benefits of water and temperature the yield increasing effect of pfm was greater than that of sm the primary reason for this phenomenon is that pfm promotes water retention better than sm while the warming effect of pfm facilitates crop growth the effect of sm on wheat yield showed greater variability when the growth stage had 350 mm precipitation with 10 c average temperature or 350 mm precipitation with 10 c average temperature the yield increasing effect was not significant and there was a possible yield reduction fig 7 one possible reason is that under high temperature and low precipitation crop straw intercepts part of the low precipitation at higher temperatures this part of the precipitation cannot pass through the mulch layer to evaporate thus further reducing the replenishment of soil moisture by precipitation he et al 2018 which reduces the yield due to insufficient water under high precipitation and low temperature excessive soil water further magnifies the cooling effect of crop straw thereby reducing the yield due to low soil temperature wang et al 2021 pfm showed a yield increasing effect under different hydrothermal conditions the largest yield increase rate was obtained under the low temperature conditions of 10 c while the yield increase rate was relatively low under high temperature and low precipitation 10 c and 350 mm these results indicate that the importance of pfm for soil warming is greater than its importance for water retention during the production of dryland winter wheat in the loess plateau 5 conclusions this study explored the effects of pfm and sm on water use and the yield of wheat in the loess plateau through boundary analysis and meta analysis both pfm and sm effectively reduced the difference between actual yield and potential yield under different water consumption levels pfm and sm prominently improved the yield and water use efficiency of winter wheat in the loess plateau area the hydrothermal conditions impacted the water use and yield increasing effect under different mulching practices from an overall perspective pfm achieved a large yield increase under lower temperatures 10 c while the yield under sm was considerably impacted by temperature and precipitation compared with pfm sm showed no yield or wue increasement effect under high temperature with low precipitation 10 c 350 mm or low temperature with high precipitation 10 c 350 mm funding sources funding

corresponding authors handling editor dr b e clothier negative pressure irrigation npi has potential to reduce evaporative loss of water on the soil surface reduce runoff and maintain a stable soil water content as compared to other irrigation methods however there is a lack of synthesized information in literature with regard to its effects on crop yield and water use efficiency wue which hinders its wide adoption in china we introduce the principles and device of npi analyze the npi research hotspots and review its effects on yield and wue of typical greenhouse crops based on the literature available in the china national knowledge infrastructure cnki and web of science wos review shows that a npi device typically consists of emitter water pipe water storage tank and negative pressure generator the material of emitters is important in affecting irrigation efficiency and polyvinyl formal materials have higher cumulative infiltration per unit area and faster soil water movement than ceramic head under the same water pressure as the polyvinyl formal material can control the larger soil water space than a ceramic head current research hotspots include the development of npi devices crop response and water use efficiency of npi and influences of environmental factors on irrigation efficiency compared with conventional irrigation npi is more energy saving and water saving and significantly improves wue and crop yield soil texture is the main factor contributing to the maximum vertical wetting distance and maximum horizontal wetting distance and cumulative infiltration and it affects the irrigation efficiency of npi and the arrangement of npi for meeting crop water need results suggest that when the negative pressure level of 10 kpa to 5 kpa and the soil water content of 60 80 field capacity are most conducive to the growth of most greenhouse crops with better agronomic effects than conventional irrigation keywords negative pressure irrigation cumulative water supply soil water movement polyvinyl formal materials water use efficiency 1 introduction in vast areas of china crop production is limited by the availability of water and solutions are sought for irrigation to address the issue of increasing food demand crops are commonly irrigated with furrow irrigation fi sprinkler irrigation si and drip irrigation di however these irrigation methods often lead to unnecessary water losses through evaporation and runoff and unsatisfactory water use efficiency wue wang et al 2019 to solve the problem negative pressure irrigation npi has been developed and increasingly used in china in the recent decades long et al 2018 negative pressure irrigation mainly used the difference of water potential gradient between soil and emitter to realize the automatic input of water and keep the soil water content at a constant level the basic principle is that when crops consume water it decreases soil water content and soil water potential results in the flow of water from the emitter of the irrigation device to the soil as the water supply process is regulated through the negative pressure that is created pre setable and controllable in the system the technology gains its name of negative pressure with the growth of crops the whole process circulates to dynamically supply water to the crops long et al 2020 owing to its greater water saving potential than other irrigation methods npi has emerged as a key potential solution to reduce the extraction of water resources in the contexts of increasing agricultural intensification and climate change previous studies have shown that npi helps increase wue and improve crop yield and quality e g li et al 2008 d li et al 2017 y k li et al 2017 s p li et al 2017 huang et al 2017 for example li et al 2019 assessed the yield and wue of tomato and cucumber under di and npi respectively they concluded that while npi and di produced similar vegetable yields npi increased wue by 26 as compared to di the negative pressure applied in npi plays an important role in the efficacy of the technology for example xiao et al 2016 showed that maintaining the negative pressure within the range of 20 to 10 kpa saved 22 47 of irrigation water and improved wue by 1 5 2 6 kg m 3 than conventional irrigation during the whole growth period of flue cured tobacco and also increased the accumulation of dry matter in tobacco plants in the negative pressure range of 5 to 10 kpa huang et al 2017 observed the highest wue for the chinese cabbage under the pressure of 10 kpa in contrast ma et al 2017 found that 5 kpa was best for improving the yield and quality of peppers d li et al 2017 s p li et al 2017 and y k li et al 2017 also found the largest water saving and yield increase at 5 kpa the results indicate that different crops favor different negative pressure values of npi furthermore the irrigation efficiency of npi is affected by water outlet and water infiltration of emitters and by soil texture that is closely related to soil water movement in this context studies have been conducted to investigate soil water content water infiltration rate and soil wetting range as affected by npi in soils with different textures wang et al 2017 tang 2018 using the hydrus 2d model for example wang et al 2017 quantified water movement and solute transport in differently textured soils under simulated npi and found that silt and silty clay were more conducive to infiltration of water and reduced evaporation on the soil surface in a study on npi for five different types of soils tang 2018 found that sandy loam had significantly poorer soil water absorption and retention capacities lower soil water content and smaller water transport range than loam clay loam sandy clay and loamy clay concluding that sandy loam was not suitable for implementing npi the findings of these studies suggest that a larger clay content is beneficial for water movement and irrigation efficiency of npi continuous and stable negative pressure water supply is important for achieving water saving and agronomic improvements of the crops when using the npi technology d li et al 2017 y k li et al 2017 s p li et al 2017 huang et al 2017 thus research has been conducted to improve the stability of water supply jiang et al 2006 improved the accuracy for controlling npi water supply pressure by changing the elevation difference between irrigation water source and emitter but the range of water supply pressure controlled by this method is small as material of emitters fundamentally affects irrigation flow in the npi cong et al 2015 has developed a new type of water permeable foam pipe that used polyvinyl formal material as a npi irrigation device in place of clay materials from a system perspective lei et al 2005 verified the feasibility of negative pressure automatic replenishment water saving irrigation technology furthermore zhao and li 2020 discussed the development of low pressure pipeline irrigation technology in china and compared the characteristics of polyethylene poly vinyl chloride and other common pipeline materials the objectives of this paper were to review the principles and research status of negative pressure irrigation its affecting on crops yield and wue with a reference to other irrigation methods and discuss the factors affecting the efficacy of npi such as emitter material soil texture and crop type given the fact that npi is currently mostly used for crop production in greenhouse settings the review has been scoped to greenhouse crops in china following a description of review methods in section 2 introduces structure and mechanism of npi device in section 3 discusses the advantages and disadvantages of npi as compared to other irrigation methods in section 4 the trend of npi development and research in china in section 5 different emitter materials in section 6 the effects of soil properties on water infiltration under npi in section 7 and the effects of npi on crop yield and wue in section 8 and summarizes main findings in section 9 2 review methods using the web of science wos and the china national knowledge infrastructure cnki databases we searched for articles that investigated npi technology development advantages and disadvantage of npi in wue and crop production as compared to other irrigation methods specifically we used ts negative pressure irrigation not ts teeth or tooth or wound or therapy or patient as the search formula which limited the scope of literature classification to forestry agronomy water resources environmental science plant science microbiology horticulture biology soil science agricultural economics policy agriculture multidisciplinary agricultural engineering environmental studies biochemistry molecular biology and ecology we limited our search to the articles published between january 2005 and december 2020 to get a collection of more recent studies the searches turned out 75 articles from cnki and 18 articles from wos for which we saved the information of the themes key words abstracts authors and references of each article and managed the articles using endnote the searching results were screened to analyze the trend of research across china section 5 specifically we conducted a keyword co occurrence analysis and constructed timeline cluster map by using vos viewer and analyzed the research hotspots and evolution trend of npi we used arc gis 10 0 to map the relevant research areas of npi and the studied crops furthermore a subset of articles reporting research in the beijing region were reviewed in detail to demonstrate the effects of npi on yield and water use efficiency of greenhouse crop production section 8 3 structure and mechanism of negative pressure irrigation device a npi device has four parts emitter water delivery pipe water storage tank and negative pressure generator fig 1 yang et al 2020 li et al 2021 emitter is a vessel for water to enter the soil through the irrigation device after water seeps from the emitter it changes from irrigation water to soil water water delivery pipe is a hollow tubular device connecting a water storage tank and an emitter water storage tank is a device for storing irrigation water the tank has a scale that is used to indicate the amount of water that has been used for irrigation by reading the changes in water level negative pressure generator is used for maintaining the negative pressure of the whole device at a constantly set value nowadays most common negative pressure generators are heavy liquid type negative pressure generator fig 1 and solenoid valve type negative pressure generator fig 2 the heavy liquid type generator includes a spherical negative pressure chamber a u shaped tube and an s shaped tube fig 1 when all parts of the npi device are connected and the emitter is buried in the soil the air pressure in the negative pressure chamber is equal to the external atmospheric pressure before the operation of the device and the mercury level in the u shaped tube and s shaped tube is at the same height as a crop consumes water the device automatically discharges water and part of the air in the negative pressure chamber flows out through the upper part of the negative pressure chamber of the u shaped tube and enters the water reservoir thereafter the air pressure decreases the mercury level at the inlet pipe side of the u shaped tube decreases and the mercury levels in the negative pressure chamber and in the s shaped tube pressure control tube rise when the mercury level at the inlet pipe side drops to the bifurcation point the mercury in the pressure control tube is separated from the mercury in the u shaped tube and the pressure in the negative pressure chamber continues to decrease when the absolute value of the difference between the chamber air pressure and the external atmospheric pressure is greater than ρgh ρ the density of mercury g the gravitational potential energy and h the height of the s tube the mercury in the pressure control tube quickly flows into the negative pressure chamber meanwhile the pressure control tube becomes an air channel and external air enters the negative pressure chamber which increases the air pressure in the negative pressure chamber mercury flows back through the return pipe and the liquid level at the inlet pipe side of the u shaped tube rises when it rises to the bifurcation point mercury enters the pressure control tube again to prevent air from entering the negative pressure chamber the whole process circulates so that the negative pressure is maintained around the level of ρgh the specification of the heavy liquid negative pressure generator is fixed for a pressure control requirement and thus different specifications should be adopted for different pressure control requirements long et al 2018 the solenoid valve type negative pressure generator is consisted of a solenoid valve a pressure control switch and a gas tank fig 2 when in use a pressure value is set for the pressure control switch as a crop consumes water the emitter will automatically discharge water the water level in the water storage tank will drop and the pressure will decrease thereafter the gas in the gas tank enters the water storage tank through a gas transmission pipe to keep the air pressure in the water storage tank stable when the pressure in the gas tank is lower than the negative pressure value that is set at the negative pressure switch the pressure control switch triggers the solenoid valve to allow external air enter the gas tank until the air pressure in the tank is equal to the negative pressure value and then the solenoid valve is closed and the air inlet is completed the whole process circulates to stabilize the internal pressure of the gas tank at the set value so as to maintain the soil water content at a stable level 4 negative pressure irrigation as compared to other irrigation methods the advantages and disadvantages of different irrigation methods are compared which include furrow irrigation drip irrigation sprinkler irrigation subsurface irrigation regulated deficit irrigation alternate partial root zone irrigation and negative pressure irrigation table 1 the npi technology can reduce the loss of soil water through deep leakage and surface evaporation by maintaining unsaturated soil water in the rhizosphere throughout the growing season compared with other irrigation methods npi has obvious water saving effects does not need a external power equipment and is more energy efficient the npi technology is regarded as the optimization of new irrigation technology d li et al 2017 y k li et al 2017 s p li et al 2017 and it maintains soil moisture within a stable range this helps avoid lack of oxygen in crop roots resulting from water shortage drought or excessive moisture or cause soil hardening due to the alternation of dry and wet conditions with npi crops grow in a suitable state of water and nutrient supply which significantly improves crop yield and wue zhu et al 2020 however npi also has disadvantages such as a high cost and operations under fixed pressures which has limited its wide applications to field crops zou et al 2007 d li et al 2017 y k li et al 2017 s p li et al 2017 xiang et al 2019 it is designed to maintain the same negative pressure level for water supply and cannot be adjusted according to soil water content for different periods of crop growth it also has high requirements for the air tightness of the device in recent years two new kinds of irrigation technologies i e deficit irrigation and alternate partial root zone irrigation have been developed for improving crop yield for example regulated deficit irrigation is not suitable for areas with shortage of water resources and poor water retention in alternate partial root zone irrigation the frequency of dry and wet alternation is affected by crop types climatic conditions and many other factors dong et al 2018 wang et al 2019 the comparisons suggest that more research is needed to optimize the design of irrigation devices to improve their efficiency and application conditions 5 trend of npi development and research in china from 2005 to 2020 a total of 75 journal articles and student theses reporting chinese npi research were indexed by cnki and 18 journal articles by wos among these articles 17 were focused on describing the principles of irrigation devices 19 on water movement 44 on crop response to npi nine on emitter materials seven on the effects of soil texture and two on water quality with some of them covering multiple topics over the 15 year period the number of published papers overall increased with years fig 3 the articles were published by 26 chinese research institutions among which the chinese academy of agricultural sciences produced the largest number of documents and attracted most citations notably the number of articles indexed by cnki increased substantially from 2012 to 2018 the years 2015 and 2017 were most productive with 10 and 18 articles published respectively the year 2019 had a lower publication record of 7 articles interestingly major research focus appeared to evolve with time as well which was emitter materials in 2015 the impact of different water supply pressures on crop yield and quality and the law of soil water transport under different negative pressures in 2017 and the impact of npi technology on soil microbial community and crop wue respectively the analysis using the vos viewer to cluster key words in titles and abstracts of the articles and draw the timeline clustering map also shows the change of npi research hotspots with time figs 4 and 5 the research key words gradually transitioned from those related to device development e g emitter pressure and irrigation device to soil water transport e g soil moisture and soil water and then to the impacts on crop yield and quality water and fertilizer utilization efficiency e g yield quality water use efficiency nutrient nitrogen phosphorus and potassium the evolvement shows the development process of the npi technology from introduction to application in china the npi research was conducted in seven provinces of china i e beijing hunan heilongjiang shanxi tianjin shangdong and hebei fig 6 the main crops studied were tomato solanum crown daisy chrysanthemum coronarium l cherry radish raphanussativus l spinach spinacia oleracea cucumber cucumis sativus l tobacco nicotiana tabacum l red wave lettuce lactucasativa l var ramose hort maize zeamays l lettuces lactucasativa l var ramose hort and cowpea vigna unguiculata among the provinces beijing has been studied for the longest time with most studies and the widest range of crops fig 7 6 comparison of emitter materials emitter materials affect the efficacy of npi in two aspects effluent performance and cost indicators of effluent performance include cumulative water infiltration per unit area soil moisture content and wetting front and cost involves physical properties of the emitters such as strength wear resistance etc and the size and simplicity of the device which affects the promotion of the emitters there are two types of conventional emitter materials ceramic fiber and polyvinyl formal pvfm with different characteristics ceramics are inorganic materials with poor toughness and slow water seepage rate when crops have large water demands the use of ceramic emitters is hard to meet the water supply requirements in addition if the quality of irrigation water is poor ceramics are prone to clogging zou et al 2007 in contrast fibers have rough surface and good softness they are in closer contact with the soil and their pore structure is closer to the soil jiang et al 2006 finally pvfm has good hydrophilicity strong water absorption capacity mainly small pores supplemented by large pores good chemical stability and good wear resistance wang and li 2006 several studies have compared the performance of different types of emitters that have been used in npi for example jiang et al 2006 selected fiber and clay emitters to study the effects of soil texture and emitter materials on water flow and soil water transport in npi systems the results showed that under the same soil texture the fiber emitter had greater water flow and maximum wetting distance than the clay emitter elsewhere cong et al 2015 compared the performance of water infiltration between pvfm water infiltrators and ceramic heads in three aspects cumulative infiltration per unit area soil moisture content and movement of wetting front they found that with the same time period of irrigation pvfm water infiltrators had greater cumulative infiltration per unit area faster water movement and a larger area of water distribution than ceramic heads under the same negative pressure although both types of emitters obtained an overall similar range of soil moisture content pvfm had higher soil moisture contents in most field locations than ceramic heads they also formed different shapes of wetting fronts which was similar to ellipsoid with more uniform upper and lower water penetration in pvfm and similar to spindle in ceramic heads when the negative pressure was larger than 20kpa pvfm had greater horizontal wetting distance and vertical wetting distance than ceramic heads suggesting the better water seepage performance of pvfm bian et al 2018 in addition ding et al 2017 observed enhanced water permeability of pvfm than ceramic heads under a negative pressure range of 15 to 5kpa concluding that pvfm could completely replace ceramic heads in agricultural production to achieve the purposes of high yield and water saving indeed pvfm has been increasingly used in npi and other irrigation methods due to its good effluent performance high tear resistance and low cost 7 soil water infiltration in negative pressure irrigation as npi requires a close contact between an emitter and soil and different soils have different water infiltration characteristics it is necessary to understand the applicability of npi to different types of soils tang 2018 studied the characteristics of soil water transport in sandy loam loam clay loam sandy clay and loamy clay under npi he found that compared with the other four soils sandy loam had significantly lower water content smaller water transport range and poorer water absorption and retention capacities and it needed more emitters and increased irrigation water pressure than other soils to supply water for normal crop growth in contrast the other four soils had relatively similar trends and values of water content in terms of the degree of soil moisture diffusion i e the uniformity of npi clay loam appeared to be poorer than other soils these findings suggest that when applying npi it is necessary to appropriately design the spatial layout of emitters based on soil types so that the system apply a sufficient amount of water to crops it appears that a larger proportion of clay in the soil results in greater range intensity and uniformity of soil water movement and requires a smaller number of emitters and irrigation water pressure the effects of soil type on soil water movement under npi have also been demonstrated in other studies for example wang et al 2016 found that under npi the total amount of soil water infiltration in 24 h in different types of soils followed loam sandy loam silty loam loamy sand the stable infiltration rate after water balance and the maximum and average water contents in the soil wetting range followed loam silty loam sandy loam loamy sand their findings were consistent with those of tang 2018 in that water infiltration rate and water content in the wetting range increased with increasing soil clay content overall soil texture greatly affects water infiltration the higher soil clay content is the more suitable it is for the popularization and application of npi technology soil water infiltration in npi is also affected by the pressure applied to the system liang et al 2011 studied the water transport patterns in clay loam and sandy soil under zero pressure positive pressure and negative pressure respectively they found that when the emitter was consistent with the contact area the variation values of the maximum vertical wetting distance the maximum horizontal wetting distance and the cumulative infiltration amount decreased with lower height of the water supply head for the same time period of npi the maximum vertical wetting distance in the sandy soil was smaller than that in the clay loam elsewhere shangguan et al 2015 applied three negative head heights of 10 cm 30 cm and 50 cm to a silty loam and studied the pattern of soil water infiltration under the condition of negative heads the results showed that when the absolute value of negative head height was small the total amount of cumulative infiltration was large and the change rate of cumulative infiltration with time was fast which supported the finding of liang et al 2011 8 effects of npi on crop yield and water use efficiency the purpose of npi is to maintain field water content at a stable level and avoid crop yield reduction caused by water change amplitude and time variability it is equivalent to controlling the compensation effect of moderate soil water deficit irrigation methods can directly control the amount of irrigation water that is applied to crops and thus affect the growth development yield and quality of the crops as well as the crop wue here we use the research conducted in beijing as an example to discuss the effects of npi on yield increase and wue increase in multiple greenhouse crops as compared to other irrigation methods table 2 consistently npi has been shown to increase crop yield and wue as compared to other commonly used irrigation methods for example d li et al 2017 s p li et al 2017 y k li et al 2017 and zhao et al 2019 studied crop yield and wue used fi di and npi the results of d li et al 2017 s p li et al 2017 y k li et al 2017 showed that npi increased tomato yield by 8 10 compared with ck zhao et al 2019 showed that npi increased rapeseed yield by 29 and wue by 67 as compared with the drip irrigation the effects of npi vary with different negative pressures different levels of negative pressures have been used in various studies in general the negative pressure used in the studies ranged from 15kpa to 0 kpa with typical settings at 5kpa 10kpa and 15kpa respectively thus it is important to note the negative pressure associated with the increase in yield and wue bian et al 2018 and yang et al 2020 studied npi effects at the negative pressures of 4kpa 8kpa and 12kpa and found that 8kpa was the optimal pressure for achieving yield benefits bian et al 2018 showed that under 8kpa npi increased spinach yield by 60 and wue by 88 as compared to the conventional irrigation again under 8kpa the results of yang et al 2020 showed that npi increased the yield of chrysanthemum by 150 and wue by 77 as compared to sprinkler irrigation elsewhere zhu et al 2020 studied npi performance at 5kpa 9kpa and 14kpa and found that under 9kpa npi increased the yield of cherry radish by only 0 3 but increased wue by 57 9 as compared to drip irrigation geng et al 2006 used a self made npi device to control the negative pressure at 1 to 9kpa and study the effects of different irrigation treatments on the photosynthetic and physiological characteristics of cowpea they found that when the pressure was between 2kpa and 3kpa the soil had appropriate water content and greater stomatal conductance transpiration rate photosynthetic rate chlorophyll content and wue which helped to explain the observed greater yield by npi than the conventional irrigation a negative pressure of 5kpa has been widely tested for example d li et al 2017 s p li et al 2017 and y k li et al 2017 studied the agronomic performance of npi under 5kpa on both cucumber and pepper as compared to fi they found that npi increased cucumber yield by 69 and wue by 150 and increased prepper yield by 14 and wue by 125 elsewhere wang et al 2020 found that npi under 5 kpa increased maize yield by 107 wue by 87 as compared to the conventional irrigation moreover gao et al 2019 showed that at 5 kpa npi increased the yield of red wave lettuce by 68 compared with ck and 29 compared with di and increased wue by 122 compared with ck and 71 compared with di over all studies it has appeared that a negative pressure level of 10 kpa to 5 kpa and the soil water content of 60 80 of field capacity is conducive to the growth of most greenhouse crops and the effect of npi is significantly better than that of conventional irrigation table 2 moreover fertigation based on negative water head shows promises to effectively control the timely supply of water and fertilizer ensure the stability of soil water and fertility and meet the overall needs of crops 9 conclusions agricultural irrigation water consumption accounts for 90 of agricultural water consumption but its water utilization efficiency is only about 0 8 1 0 kg m 3 it s of pressing importance to improve the utilization efficiency of agricultural water resources and to ensure china s food and water security and sustainable socio economic development negative pressure irrigation can overcome the disadvantages of conventional drip irrigation the npi technology has demonstrated to maintain stable soil water content and increase crop yield and water use efficiency as compared to conventional irrigation our review suggests that future irrigation research should consider detailed information on soil properties experimental conditions and crops this include for example 1 carrying out in depth research on soil water time variation trend focusing on crop transpiration consumption photosynthetic characteristics source signal material and osmoregulatory substances and 2 exploring the

corresponding authors handling editor dr b e clothier negative pressure irrigation npi has potential to reduce evaporative loss of water on the soil surface reduce runoff and maintain a stable soil water content as compared to other irrigation methods however there is a lack of synthesized information in literature with regard to its effects on crop yield and water use efficiency wue which hinders its wide adoption in china we introduce the principles and device of npi analyze the npi research hotspots and review its effects on yield and wue of typical greenhouse crops based on the literature available in the china national knowledge infrastructure cnki and web of science wos review shows that a npi device typically consists of emitter water pipe water storage tank and negative pressure generator the material of emitters is important in affecting irrigation efficiency and polyvinyl formal materials have higher cumulative infiltration per unit area and faster soil water movement than ceramic head under the same water pressure as the polyvinyl formal material can control the larger soil water space than a ceramic head current research hotspots include the development of npi devices crop response and water use efficiency of npi and influences of environmental factors on irrigation efficiency compared with conventional irrigation npi is more energy saving and water saving and significantly improves wue and crop yield soil texture is the main factor contributing to the maximum vertical wetting distance and maximum horizontal wetting distance and cumulative infiltration and it affects the irrigation efficiency of npi and the arrangement of npi for meeting crop water need results suggest that when the negative pressure level of 10 kpa to 5 kpa and the soil water content of 60 80 field capacity are most conducive to the growth of most greenhouse crops with better agronomic effects than conventional irrigation keywords negative pressure irrigation cumulative water supply soil water movement polyvinyl formal materials water use efficiency 1 introduction in vast areas of china crop production is limited by the availability of water and solutions are sought for irrigation to address the issue of increasing food demand crops are commonly irrigated with furrow irrigation fi sprinkler irrigation si and drip irrigation di however these irrigation methods often lead to unnecessary water losses through evaporation and runoff and unsatisfactory water use efficiency wue wang et al 2019 to solve the problem negative pressure irrigation npi has been developed and increasingly used in china in the recent decades long et al 2018 negative pressure irrigation mainly used the difference of water potential gradient between soil and emitter to realize the automatic input of water and keep the soil water content at a constant level the basic principle is that when crops consume water it decreases soil water content and soil water potential results in the flow of water from the emitter of the irrigation device to the soil as the water supply process is regulated through the negative pressure that is created pre setable and controllable in the system the technology gains its name of negative pressure with the growth of crops the whole process circulates to dynamically supply water to the crops long et al 2020 owing to its greater water saving potential than other irrigation methods npi has emerged as a key potential solution to reduce the extraction of water resources in the contexts of increasing agricultural intensification and climate change previous studies have shown that npi helps increase wue and improve crop yield and quality e g li et al 2008 d li et al 2017 y k li et al 2017 s p li et al 2017 huang et al 2017 for example li et al 2019 assessed the yield and wue of tomato and cucumber under di and npi respectively they concluded that while npi and di produced similar vegetable yields npi increased wue by 26 as compared to di the negative pressure applied in npi plays an important role in the efficacy of the technology for example xiao et al 2016 showed that maintaining the negative pressure within the range of 20 to 10 kpa saved 22 47 of irrigation water and improved wue by 1 5 2 6 kg m 3 than conventional irrigation during the whole growth period of flue cured tobacco and also increased the accumulation of dry matter in tobacco plants in the negative pressure range of 5 to 10 kpa huang et al 2017 observed the highest wue for the chinese cabbage under the pressure of 10 kpa in contrast ma et al 2017 found that 5 kpa was best for improving the yield and quality of peppers d li et al 2017 s p li et al 2017 and y k li et al 2017 also found the largest water saving and yield increase at 5 kpa the results indicate that different crops favor different negative pressure values of npi furthermore the irrigation efficiency of npi is affected by water outlet and water infiltration of emitters and by soil texture that is closely related to soil water movement in this context studies have been conducted to investigate soil water content water infiltration rate and soil wetting range as affected by npi in soils with different textures wang et al 2017 tang 2018 using the hydrus 2d model for example wang et al 2017 quantified water movement and solute transport in differently textured soils under simulated npi and found that silt and silty clay were more conducive to infiltration of water and reduced evaporation on the soil surface in a study on npi for five different types of soils tang 2018 found that sandy loam had significantly poorer soil water absorption and retention capacities lower soil water content and smaller water transport range than loam clay loam sandy clay and loamy clay concluding that sandy loam was not suitable for implementing npi the findings of these studies suggest that a larger clay content is beneficial for water movement and irrigation efficiency of npi continuous and stable negative pressure water supply is important for achieving water saving and agronomic improvements of the crops when using the npi technology d li et al 2017 y k li et al 2017 s p li et al 2017 huang et al 2017 thus research has been conducted to improve the stability of water supply jiang et al 2006 improved the accuracy for controlling npi water supply pressure by changing the elevation difference between irrigation water source and emitter but the range of water supply pressure controlled by this method is small as material of emitters fundamentally affects irrigation flow in the npi cong et al 2015 has developed a new type of water permeable foam pipe that used polyvinyl formal material as a npi irrigation device in place of clay materials from a system perspective lei et al 2005 verified the feasibility of negative pressure automatic replenishment water saving irrigation technology furthermore zhao and li 2020 discussed the development of low pressure pipeline irrigation technology in china and compared the characteristics of polyethylene poly vinyl chloride and other common pipeline materials the objectives of this paper were to review the principles and research status of negative pressure irrigation its affecting on crops yield and wue with a reference to other irrigation methods and discuss the factors affecting the efficacy of npi such as emitter material soil texture and crop type given the fact that npi is currently mostly used for crop production in greenhouse settings the review has been scoped to greenhouse crops in china following a description of review methods in section 2 introduces structure and mechanism of npi device in section 3 discusses the advantages and disadvantages of npi as compared to other irrigation methods in section 4 the trend of npi development and research in china in section 5 different emitter materials in section 6 the effects of soil properties on water infiltration under npi in section 7 and the effects of npi on crop yield and wue in section 8 and summarizes main findings in section 9 2 review methods using the web of science wos and the china national knowledge infrastructure cnki databases we searched for articles that investigated npi technology development advantages and disadvantage of npi in wue and crop production as compared to other irrigation methods specifically we used ts negative pressure irrigation not ts teeth or tooth or wound or therapy or patient as the search formula which limited the scope of literature classification to forestry agronomy water resources environmental science plant science microbiology horticulture biology soil science agricultural economics policy agriculture multidisciplinary agricultural engineering environmental studies biochemistry molecular biology and ecology we limited our search to the articles published between january 2005 and december 2020 to get a collection of more recent studies the searches turned out 75 articles from cnki and 18 articles from wos for which we saved the information of the themes key words abstracts authors and references of each article and managed the articles using endnote the searching results were screened to analyze the trend of research across china section 5 specifically we conducted a keyword co occurrence analysis and constructed timeline cluster map by using vos viewer and analyzed the research hotspots and evolution trend of npi we used arc gis 10 0 to map the relevant research areas of npi and the studied crops furthermore a subset of articles reporting research in the beijing region were reviewed in detail to demonstrate the effects of npi on yield and water use efficiency of greenhouse crop production section 8 3 structure and mechanism of negative pressure irrigation device a npi device has four parts emitter water delivery pipe water storage tank and negative pressure generator fig 1 yang et al 2020 li et al 2021 emitter is a vessel for water to enter the soil through the irrigation device after water seeps from the emitter it changes from irrigation water to soil water water delivery pipe is a hollow tubular device connecting a water storage tank and an emitter water storage tank is a device for storing irrigation water the tank has a scale that is used to indicate the amount of water that has been used for irrigation by reading the changes in water level negative pressure generator is used for maintaining the negative pressure of the whole device at a constantly set value nowadays most common negative pressure generators are heavy liquid type negative pressure generator fig 1 and solenoid valve type negative pressure generator fig 2 the heavy liquid type generator includes a spherical negative pressure chamber a u shaped tube and an s shaped tube fig 1 when all parts of the npi device are connected and the emitter is buried in the soil the air pressure in the negative pressure chamber is equal to the external atmospheric pressure before the operation of the device and the mercury level in the u shaped tube and s shaped tube is at the same height as a crop consumes water the device automatically discharges water and part of the air in the negative pressure chamber flows out through the upper part of the negative pressure chamber of the u shaped tube and enters the water reservoir thereafter the air pressure decreases the mercury level at the inlet pipe side of the u shaped tube decreases and the mercury levels in the negative pressure chamber and in the s shaped tube pressure control tube rise when the mercury level at the inlet pipe side drops to the bifurcation point the mercury in the pressure control tube is separated from the mercury in the u shaped tube and the pressure in the negative pressure chamber continues to decrease when the absolute value of the difference between the chamber air pressure and the external atmospheric pressure is greater than ρgh ρ the density of mercury g the gravitational potential energy and h the height of the s tube the mercury in the pressure control tube quickly flows into the negative pressure chamber meanwhile the pressure control tube becomes an air channel and external air enters the negative pressure chamber which increases the air pressure in the negative pressure chamber mercury flows back through the return pipe and the liquid level at the inlet pipe side of the u shaped tube rises when it rises to the bifurcation point mercury enters the pressure control tube again to prevent air from entering the negative pressure chamber the whole process circulates so that the negative pressure is maintained around the level of ρgh the specification of the heavy liquid negative pressure generator is fixed for a pressure control requirement and thus different specifications should be adopted for different pressure control requirements long et al 2018 the solenoid valve type negative pressure generator is consisted of a solenoid valve a pressure control switch and a gas tank fig 2 when in use a pressure value is set for the pressure control switch as a crop consumes water the emitter will automatically discharge water the water level in the water storage tank will drop and the pressure will decrease thereafter the gas in the gas tank enters the water storage tank through a gas transmission pipe to keep the air pressure in the water storage tank stable when the pressure in the gas tank is lower than the negative pressure value that is set at the negative pressure switch the pressure control switch triggers the solenoid valve to allow external air enter the gas tank until the air pressure in the tank is equal to the negative pressure value and then the solenoid valve is closed and the air inlet is completed the whole process circulates to stabilize the internal pressure of the gas tank at the set value so as to maintain the soil water content at a stable level 4 negative pressure irrigation as compared to other irrigation methods the advantages and disadvantages of different irrigation methods are compared which include furrow irrigation drip irrigation sprinkler irrigation subsurface irrigation regulated deficit irrigation alternate partial root zone irrigation and negative pressure irrigation table 1 the npi technology can reduce the loss of soil water through deep leakage and surface evaporation by maintaining unsaturated soil water in the rhizosphere throughout the growing season compared with other irrigation methods npi has obvious water saving effects does not need a external power equipment and is more energy efficient the npi technology is regarded as the optimization of new irrigation technology d li et al 2017 y k li et al 2017 s p li et al 2017 and it maintains soil moisture within a stable range this helps avoid lack of oxygen in crop roots resulting from water shortage drought or excessive moisture or cause soil hardening due to the alternation of dry and wet conditions with npi crops grow in a suitable state of water and nutrient supply which significantly improves crop yield and wue zhu et al 2020 however npi also has disadvantages such as a high cost and operations under fixed pressures which has limited its wide applications to field crops zou et al 2007 d li et al 2017 y k li et al 2017 s p li et al 2017 xiang et al 2019 it is designed to maintain the same negative pressure level for water supply and cannot be adjusted according to soil water content for different periods of crop growth it also has high requirements for the air tightness of the device in recent years two new kinds of irrigation technologies i e deficit irrigation and alternate partial root zone irrigation have been developed for improving crop yield for example regulated deficit irrigation is not suitable for areas with shortage of water resources and poor water retention in alternate partial root zone irrigation the frequency of dry and wet alternation is affected by crop types climatic conditions and many other factors dong et al 2018 wang et al 2019 the comparisons suggest that more research is needed to optimize the design of irrigation devices to improve their efficiency and application conditions 5 trend of npi development and research in china from 2005 to 2020 a total of 75 journal articles and student theses reporting chinese npi research were indexed by cnki and 18 journal articles by wos among these articles 17 were focused on describing the principles of irrigation devices 19 on water movement 44 on crop response to npi nine on emitter materials seven on the effects of soil texture and two on water quality with some of them covering multiple topics over the 15 year period the number of published papers overall increased with years fig 3 the articles were published by 26 chinese research institutions among which the chinese academy of agricultural sciences produced the largest number of documents and attracted most citations notably the number of articles indexed by cnki increased substantially from 2012 to 2018 the years 2015 and 2017 were most productive with 10 and 18 articles published respectively the year 2019 had a lower publication record of 7 articles interestingly major research focus appeared to evolve with time as well which was emitter materials in 2015 the impact of different water supply pressures on crop yield and quality and the law of soil water transport under different negative pressures in 2017 and the impact of npi technology on soil microbial community and crop wue respectively the analysis using the vos viewer to cluster key words in titles and abstracts of the articles and draw the timeline clustering map also shows the change of npi research hotspots with time figs 4 and 5 the research key words gradually transitioned from those related to device development e g emitter pressure and irrigation device to soil water transport e g soil moisture and soil water and then to the impacts on crop yield and quality water and fertilizer utilization efficiency e g yield quality water use efficiency nutrient nitrogen phosphorus and potassium the evolvement shows the development process of the npi technology from introduction to application in china the npi research was conducted in seven provinces of china i e beijing hunan heilongjiang shanxi tianjin shangdong and hebei fig 6 the main crops studied were tomato solanum crown daisy chrysanthemum coronarium l cherry radish raphanussativus l spinach spinacia oleracea cucumber cucumis sativus l tobacco nicotiana tabacum l red wave lettuce lactucasativa l var ramose hort maize zeamays l lettuces lactucasativa l var ramose hort and cowpea vigna unguiculata among the provinces beijing has been studied for the longest time with most studies and the widest range of crops fig 7 6 comparison of emitter materials emitter materials affect the efficacy of npi in two aspects effluent performance and cost indicators of effluent performance include cumulative water infiltration per unit area soil moisture content and wetting front and cost involves physical properties of the emitters such as strength wear resistance etc and the size and simplicity of the device which affects the promotion of the emitters there are two types of conventional emitter materials ceramic fiber and polyvinyl formal pvfm with different characteristics ceramics are inorganic materials with poor toughness and slow water seepage rate when crops have large water demands the use of ceramic emitters is hard to meet the water supply requirements in addition if the quality of irrigation water is poor ceramics are prone to clogging zou et al 2007 in contrast fibers have rough surface and good softness they are in closer contact with the soil and their pore structure is closer to the soil jiang et al 2006 finally pvfm has good hydrophilicity strong water absorption capacity mainly small pores supplemented by large pores good chemical stability and good wear resistance wang and li 2006 several studies have compared the performance of different types of emitters that have been used in npi for example jiang et al 2006 selected fiber and clay emitters to study the effects of soil texture and emitter materials on water flow and soil water transport in npi systems the results showed that under the same soil texture the fiber emitter had greater water flow and maximum wetting distance than the clay emitter elsewhere cong et al 2015 compared the performance of water infiltration between pvfm water infiltrators and ceramic heads in three aspects cumulative infiltration per unit area soil moisture content and movement of wetting front they found that with the same time period of irrigation pvfm water infiltrators had greater cumulative infiltration per unit area faster water movement and a larger area of water distribution than ceramic heads under the same negative pressure although both types of emitters obtained an overall similar range of soil moisture content pvfm had higher soil moisture contents in most field locations than ceramic heads they also formed different shapes of wetting fronts which was similar to ellipsoid with more uniform upper and lower water penetration in pvfm and similar to spindle in ceramic heads when the negative pressure was larger than 20kpa pvfm had greater horizontal wetting distance and vertical wetting distance than ceramic heads suggesting the better water seepage performance of pvfm bian et al 2018 in addition ding et al 2017 observed enhanced water permeability of pvfm than ceramic heads under a negative pressure range of 15 to 5kpa concluding that pvfm could completely replace ceramic heads in agricultural production to achieve the purposes of high yield and water saving indeed pvfm has been increasingly used in npi and other irrigation methods due to its good effluent performance high tear resistance and low cost 7 soil water infiltration in negative pressure irrigation as npi requires a close contact between an emitter and soil and different soils have different water infiltration characteristics it is necessary to understand the applicability of npi to different types of soils tang 2018 studied the characteristics of soil water transport in sandy loam loam clay loam sandy clay and loamy clay under npi he found that compared with the other four soils sandy loam had significantly lower water content smaller water transport range and poorer water absorption and retention capacities and it needed more emitters and increased irrigation water pressure than other soils to supply water for normal crop growth in contrast the other four soils had relatively similar trends and values of water content in terms of the degree of soil moisture diffusion i e the uniformity of npi clay loam appeared to be poorer than other soils these findings suggest that when applying npi it is necessary to appropriately design the spatial layout of emitters based on soil types so that the system apply a sufficient amount of water to crops it appears that a larger proportion of clay in the soil results in greater range intensity and uniformity of soil water movement and requires a smaller number of emitters and irrigation water pressure the effects of soil type on soil water movement under npi have also been demonstrated in other studies for example wang et al 2016 found that under npi the total amount of soil water infiltration in 24 h in different types of soils followed loam sandy loam silty loam loamy sand the stable infiltration rate after water balance and the maximum and average water contents in the soil wetting range followed loam silty loam sandy loam loamy sand their findings were consistent with those of tang 2018 in that water infiltration rate and water content in the wetting range increased with increasing soil clay content overall soil texture greatly affects water infiltration the higher soil clay content is the more suitable it is for the popularization and application of npi technology soil water infiltration in npi is also affected by the pressure applied to the system liang et al 2011 studied the water transport patterns in clay loam and sandy soil under zero pressure positive pressure and negative pressure respectively they found that when the emitter was consistent with the contact area the variation values of the maximum vertical wetting distance the maximum horizontal wetting distance and the cumulative infiltration amount decreased with lower height of the water supply head for the same time period of npi the maximum vertical wetting distance in the sandy soil was smaller than that in the clay loam elsewhere shangguan et al 2015 applied three negative head heights of 10 cm 30 cm and 50 cm to a silty loam and studied the pattern of soil water infiltration under the condition of negative heads the results showed that when the absolute value of negative head height was small the total amount of cumulative infiltration was large and the change rate of cumulative infiltration with time was fast which supported the finding of liang et al 2011 8 effects of npi on crop yield and water use efficiency the purpose of npi is to maintain field water content at a stable level and avoid crop yield reduction caused by water change amplitude and time variability it is equivalent to controlling the compensation effect of moderate soil water deficit irrigation methods can directly control the amount of irrigation water that is applied to crops and thus affect the growth development yield and quality of the crops as well as the crop wue here we use the research conducted in beijing as an example to discuss the effects of npi on yield increase and wue increase in multiple greenhouse crops as compared to other irrigation methods table 2 consistently npi has been shown to increase crop yield and wue as compared to other commonly used irrigation methods for example d li et al 2017 s p li et al 2017 y k li et al 2017 and zhao et al 2019 studied crop yield and wue used fi di and npi the results of d li et al 2017 s p li et al 2017 y k li et al 2017 showed that npi increased tomato yield by 8 10 compared with ck zhao et al 2019 showed that npi increased rapeseed yield by 29 and wue by 67 as compared with the drip irrigation the effects of npi vary with different negative pressures different levels of negative pressures have been used in various studies in general the negative pressure used in the studies ranged from 15kpa to 0 kpa with typical settings at 5kpa 10kpa and 15kpa respectively thus it is important to note the negative pressure associated with the increase in yield and wue bian et al 2018 and yang et al 2020 studied npi effects at the negative pressures of 4kpa 8kpa and 12kpa and found that 8kpa was the optimal pressure for achieving yield benefits bian et al 2018 showed that under 8kpa npi increased spinach yield by 60 and wue by 88 as compared to the conventional irrigation again under 8kpa the results of yang et al 2020 showed that npi increased the yield of chrysanthemum by 150 and wue by 77 as compared to sprinkler irrigation elsewhere zhu et al 2020 studied npi performance at 5kpa 9kpa and 14kpa and found that under 9kpa npi increased the yield of cherry radish by only 0 3 but increased wue by 57 9 as compared to drip irrigation geng et al 2006 used a self made npi device to control the negative pressure at 1 to 9kpa and study the effects of different irrigation treatments on the photosynthetic and physiological characteristics of cowpea they found that when the pressure was between 2kpa and 3kpa the soil had appropriate water content and greater stomatal conductance transpiration rate photosynthetic rate chlorophyll content and wue which helped to explain the observed greater yield by npi than the conventional irrigation a negative pressure of 5kpa has been widely tested for example d li et al 2017 s p li et al 2017 and y k li et al 2017 studied the agronomic performance of npi under 5kpa on both cucumber and pepper as compared to fi they found that npi increased cucumber yield by 69 and wue by 150 and increased prepper yield by 14 and wue by 125 elsewhere wang et al 2020 found that npi under 5 kpa increased maize yield by 107 wue by 87 as compared to the conventional irrigation moreover gao et al 2019 showed that at 5 kpa npi increased the yield of red wave lettuce by 68 compared with ck and 29 compared with di and increased wue by 122 compared with ck and 71 compared with di over all studies it has appeared that a negative pressure level of 10 kpa to 5 kpa and the soil water content of 60 80 of field capacity is conducive to the growth of most greenhouse crops and the effect of npi is significantly better than that of conventional irrigation table 2 moreover fertigation based on negative water head shows promises to effectively control the timely supply of water and fertilizer ensure the stability of soil water and fertility and meet the overall needs of crops 9 conclusions agricultural irrigation water consumption accounts for 90 of agricultural water consumption but its water utilization efficiency is only about 0 8 1 0 kg m 3 it s of pressing importance to improve the utilization efficiency of agricultural water resources and to ensure china s food and water security and sustainable socio economic development negative pressure irrigation can overcome the disadvantages of conventional drip irrigation the npi technology has demonstrated to maintain stable soil water content and increase crop yield and water use efficiency as compared to conventional irrigation our review suggests that future irrigation research should consider detailed information on soil properties experimental conditions and crops this include for example 1 carrying out in depth research on soil water time variation trend focusing on crop transpiration consumption photosynthetic characteristics source signal material and osmoregulatory substances and 2 exploring the correlation between crop growth and development production quality and soil moisture variation in rhizosphere under various microbial and soil nutrient conditions declaration of competing interest the

9619,the importance of stevia stevia rebaudiana is increasing rapidly as a potential industrial crop throughout the world soil moisture and nitrogen n are the key components for agricultural productivity however the information on the effects of availability of soil moisture and n dose on the growth of stevia n dynamics in the plant and soil and nue is limited thus a field study involving three soil water regimes irrigation schedule at 20 75 kpa and five different levels of n 0 140 kg ha 1 was conducted results showed that the dry leaf and total steviol glycosides sgs yield of stevia was found maximum with the irrigation at 50 kpa at harvest the plants irrigated at 50 kpa produced 26 9 32 5 higher dry matter over limited application of water 75 kpa the n at 105 kg ha 1 registered maximum leaf yield 2 59 and 2 37 t ha 1 and n uptake 83 23 and 74 73 kg ha 1 the higher dose of n 140 kg ha 1 did not enhance dry leaf and total sgs yield compared with n at 105 kg ha 1 the low apparent n recovery and agronomic n efficiency at higher doses of n indicate higher accumulations of n into the environment the soil n balance sheet indicates that the maximum n has been harvested with the higher n under water limiting conditions thus it can be concluded that the irrigation at 50 kpa in combination with n at 105 kg ha 1 could improve leaf and total sgs yield n uptake and nue of stevia without deteriorating soil health graphical abstract ga1 keywords leaf yield industrial crop nitrogen use efficiency soil moisture steviol glycosides 1 introduction water and nutrient management are the key components for enhancing crop productivity and maintaining agricultural sustainability the optimum dose of nitrogen n fertilizers could significantly increase crop productivity through encouraging photosynthesis improving dry matter accumulation net assimilation rate nar and nutrient uptake barłóg and grzebisz 2004a 2004b it has been reported that due to n losses through various ways such as denitrification surface runoff and leaching crops can utilize only 30 50 of applied n prasad 1996 kirda et al 2001 wang et al 2019 the excess application of n maximizes the risks of n losses to the environment due to poor synchronization between the soil n supply and the plant demand which leads to a decline in n use efficiency nue shi et al 2012 a low nue results in soil acidification emissions of n2o to the atmosphere eutrophication through surface runoff and leaching high production cost and lower net returns for farmers wang et al 2001 diaz and rosenberg 2008 guo et al 2010 the availability of water in the soil impacts how n is accessed by the plants thus efficient water management is required to derive full beneficial outputs from all other resources about 70 of the total global water is used in the agricultural sector somerville and briscoe 2001 and due to such water withdrawal groundwater tables have been dropping at alarming rates the demand for irrigation water will be increased by 13 6 by 2025 rosegrant and cai 2002 to encounter this ever increasing demand it is necessary to increase the water use efficiency wue in the agricultural sector the proper scheduling of irrigation coupled with an appropriate method of irrigation is the main factor to increase the wue in agriculture however scheduling of irrigation should be developed for the crop soil and climate specific conditions in developing countries crop production has been increased by about 55 due to the application of chemical fertilizers particularly n based fertilizers li et al 2009 nevertheless n is a contaminant which deteriorates the ecosystem and biodiversity stevens et al 2004 galloway et al 2008 many processes related to plant production are largely affected by water availability and mineral nutrition uptake onillon et al 1995 gonzalez dugo et al 2005 the whole n biogeochemical cycle is controlled by the water which ultimately influences plant production gonzalez dugo et al 2010 thus optimum soil moisture enhances plant growth through increasing nutrient availability and uptake plants absorb n in the form of nh4 and no3 ions the conversion from n fertilizer to nh4 and nh4 to no3 ions in soil are happened in presence of water overused irrigation hastens the loss of no3 through leaching in contrast the mobility of no3 is reduced at the deficit moisture level both the occurrences are responsible for low nue in agriculture the reduced uptake of n has an immediate effect on leaf area chlorophyll content and rubisco activity which further alter photosynthesis and ultimately reduce plant growth however the higher rate of n application has various negative environmental consequences therefore the application of n fertilizer and water should be synchronized with crop demand for attaining high production and enhancing resource use efficiency particularly nue to date the information on the nue of stevia stevia rebaudiana under different moisture regimes is limited stevia is being cultivated in some countries like china indonesia korea japan brazil argentina canada india mexico and usa brandle et al 1998 pal et al 2015a 2015b stevia leaf possesses steviol glycosides sgs that are low calorie and about 300 times sweeter than sucrose kinghorn 2002 out of 60 identified sgs in stevia leaves efsa faf panel et al 2020 the stevioside and rebaudioside a contribute the major percentage share there are different factors such as agronomic genetic and climatic which determine the growth performance and sgs biosynthesis in leaves tavarini and angelini 2013 pal et al 2015a however the information on the dynamics of dry matter accumulation the spatial distribution of n nue and n balance at different soil moisture and n levels is limited for stevia farming hence the objectives of this investigation are 1 to understand how the individual and collective effects of n dose and soil moisture regimes influence the dry matter accumulation leaf and total sgs yield the spatial distribution of nutrient and nue of stevia 2 to quantify optimum n dose for enhancing productivity of stevia cultivation 3 to prepare a soil n balance sheet under different treatment combinations 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and soil properties the study was carried out at the institutional farm of csir ihbt palampur india during 2016 and 2017 to know the influences of moisture regimes and n application on soil physico chemical properties leaf biomass nutrient dynamics and uptake and nue of stevia the experimental farm is situated at 32 06 05 n latitude and 76 34 10 e longitude with an altitude of 1390 m from mean sea level the mean annual temperature of the experimental location is 18 c with an annual mean rainfall of 2500 mm the soil texture of the experimental plots was silty clay with acidic in reaction ph 5 76 and organic carbon oc was high 1 37 available nitrogen phosphorus p and potassium k in the soil were 308 0 32 0 and 385 06 kg ha 1 respectively table s1 2 2 statistical design of experiment and application of treatments the field experiment was conducted in a split plot design involving two factors i e application of water at three different 20 50 and 75 kpa soil water potential swp as main plot and five n levels 0 35 70 105 and 140 kg ha 1 as sub plots the number of replications was three stevia seedlings were transplanted in the experimental unit in april first week in both years with a spacing of 45 cm 45 cm urea containing 46 n was used as a source for n in three split doses i e half at the time of transplantation and the remaining half at 2 times with equal quantity at 30th and 45th day after transplanting the full doses of phosphorus p2o5 at 50 kg ha 1 and potassium k2o at 60 kg ha 1 were applied at the time of transplantation the n doses were selected based on our previous study irrigation regimes were selected based on the performance of the tensiometer and soil texture the maximum limit of swp was 75 kpa in this experiment since the tensiometer is sensitive up to 85 kpa the experimental location receives a heavy rainfall area so the entire field area was protected by the rain out shelter for maintaining required moisture conditions the irrigation was given based on tensiometer readings a total of nine tensiometers were installed at 10 cm soil depths in the field for monitoring the swp and the crop was irrigated accordingly 2 3 growth analysis and yield for growth analysis randomly two plants were harvested with roots from each replication at 60 80 and 100 days of transplantation dat during 2016 and 2017 the leaf stem and roots were separated after washing with tap water then the leaf area la of each plant was recorded by an image analysis system and then the la was converted to leaf area index lai after recording la each plant part was dried at 70 ºc 2 ºc in a hot air oven till the constant value was achieved then weighed the dried samples to determine the periodic dry matter accumulation g plant 1 the crop growth rate cgr relative growth rate rgr and net assimilation rate nar were calculated according to classical methods and formula gregory 1917 blackman 1919 briggs et al 1920 for estimation of dry leaf yield at harvest at 100 dat another five plants were randomly harvested from each experimental unit 2 4 total steviol glycosides yield for the calculation of total sgs yield firstly total sgs concentration sum of stevioside reb a b c f dulcoside a rubusoside and steviolbioside in leaf was estimated by using a standard protocol as per the protocol described by mahajan et al 2020 then total sgs yield was determined by multiplying total sgs concentration with dry leaf yield 2 5 estimation of npk in plants for estimation of n p and k in plant parts the dried samples were grounded by a laboratory grinder and passed through a 40 mesh screen the total n concentrations in plant parts were determined by the micro kjeldahl technique the samples were digested by a concentrated sulfuric acid containing catalyst mixture of k2so4 and cuso4 10 1 for p and k determination a blend of nitric sulfuric and perchloric acid in the ratio of 9 4 1 was used for digestion after digestion total p and k concentrations in samples were determined by a spectrophotometer and flame photometer respectively as per standard protocols prasad et al 2006 2 6 soil analysis the samples were collected from 0 15 cm and 15 30 cm depth after harvesting during both years of study the shade dried soils were grounded by a pestle and mortar and passed through a sieve of spacing 2 mm after that prepared soils were stored under moisture free conditions for further analysis the ph and ec of soil 1 2 water suspension were determined by a ph and ec meter respectively the available soil n and oc were determined by using the method of subbiah and asija 1956 and walkley and black 1934 respectively the available p was estimated by following the method of bray and kurtz p1 1945 the available k was estimated through the ammonium acetate extraction method 2 7 nitrogen use efficiency and nitrogen balance sheet nitrogen use efficiency of crops is basically expressed through agronomic n efficiency ae physiological n efficiency pe and apparent n recovery ar that are calculated by the formula proposed by prasad 1990 the nitrogen balance sheet was prepared by using the data of total n uptake and applied and available n present in the soil the n balance is a key parameter to evaluate the n use and the threat for environmental contamination 2 8 data analysis the analysis of variance anova was conducted by statistica 7 software to understand the effects of soil water and n on growth attributes leaf biomass steviol glycosides yield nutrient uptake and residual nutrient status of soil the response function was also developed using statistica 7 software the differences between the two treatment effects were measured by the critical difference cd value at the 5 probability level of significance 3 results 3 1 periodic dry matter accumulation the dry matter accumulations in stevia plants at different growth stages 60 80 dat and at harvest were significantly p 0 05 affected by the moisture level and application of n in both years fig 1 dry matter increased consistently with the progression of crop growth stages 60 dat harvest the plants with moderate water 50 kpa resulted in significantly p 0 05 greater dry matter accumulation than plants grown under deficit 75 kpa and excessive 20 kpa moisture conditions at all the growth stages at harvest plants irrigated at 50 kpa produced about 26 9 and 32 5 higher dry matter over 75 kpa in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig 1a the total dry matter accumulation in stevia was gradually increased at all the stages with the increase in the application of n up to 105 kg ha 1 in both years fig 1b during 2016 at 60 dat the plants treated with n at 140 kg ha 1 registered about 65 2 higher total dry matter compared with the control but remained at par with n at 105 kg ha 1 at harvest the dry matter produced with n at 140 kg ha 1 was 35 6 and 34 0 higher than control in the 1st and 2nd year respectively no significant variation in total dry matter accumulation was observed between control and plants treated with 35 kg ha 1 n at all growth stages in 2017 at harvest the significant p 0 05 interaction effects between moisture regimes and n application on total dry matter production occurred in both the cropping years 3 2 growth analysis leaf area index lai one of the main physiological growth parameters was changed significantly p 0 05 due to accessibility of soil moisture at 60 80 and 100 dat fig 2a the plants under sufficient soil moisture wetting at 20 kpa noticeably reduced the lai by approximately 15 4 9 0 and 6 3 compared with the plant under medium water supply irrigation at 50 kpa at 60 80 and 100 dat respectively in 1st cropping season there was no significant variation in lai observed in plants grown under excess and deficit moisture at 60 and 80 dat in the 2nd cropping season at harvest maximum lai 2 53 and 2 34 was observed with the plants irrigated at 50 kpa the other physiological attributes such as cgr rgr and nar during 60 80 days of growth were not significantly influenced by soil moisture levels however the plants irrigated at 50 kpa registered approximately 56 7 81 6 33 3 35 7 and 34 9 51 2 higher cgr rgr and nar than the plants grown at 75 kpa irrigation schedule respectively during 80 100 days of growth in both years fig 2c h the influence of n on lai was found significant p 0 05 at all the growth stages in both years plants grown with 140 kg n ha 1 improved lai by 49 2 and 45 9 than control in the 1st and 2nd year of study respectively at 60 dat however at harvest 105 kg n ha 1 produced significantly greater lai 2 72 and 2 51 than other treatments the effect on n on cgr was significant during 60 80 days of growth in both years of study however at a later stage during 60 100 days of growth the effect of n was found significant p 0 05 only for the second year fig 2d the interactions of soil moisture and n on cgr were found significant during 80 100 days of growth the rgr and nar were found significant only in the first year during the growth period of 80 100 days and the maximum values were recorded with control however the interactions of n and soil water on cgr and nar were found significant in both years at the later stage 3 3 dry leaf and total steviol glycosides yield the soil moisture significantly p 0 05 influenced the production of dry leaves of stevia table 1 the utmost quantity of dry leaf 2 38 and 2 24 t ha 1 was registered with a moderate moisture level 50 kpa in both years the plants irrigated at 75 kpa registered about 12 1 reduction in dry leaf yield than the plants irrigated at 20 kpa in 1st cropping season however no difference in dry leaf yield was observed in plants grown at 20 and 75 kpa in the 2nd year thus these results indicated that water deficit and excess water both are equally harmful to stevia the maximum leaf yields 2 59 and 2 37 t ha 1 were observed with 105 kg n ha 1 which were almost 50 6 and 52 9 greater than without n in the first and second year respectively the interaction effects of water and n on leaf yields were found significant p 0 05 in both years table 1 and the utmost yield was recorded with 105 kg n ha 1 under moderate moisture level 50 kpa the effect of soil moisture on total sgs yield was insignificant p 0 05 during 1st cropping season table 1 in 2017 the effect on total sgs yield was significant p 0 05 and the higher sgs yield was recorded with 75 kpa the maximum 5 03 and 4 84 g plant 1 and minimum 3 20 and 3 18 g plant 1 total sgs yield were documented with n at 105 kg ha 1 and control without the addition of n respectively during both years of study the interaction effect between the availability of water and n on total sgs content was found insignificant p 0 05 3 4 regression studies response function to comprehend the mathematical association between applied n and dry leaf yield a regression analysis was conducted the relationship between leaf yield and applied n was best fitted by the second degree polynomial equation fig 3 and the mathematical expression is given below y 2016 1662 58 14 18 x 0 06 x2 r 2 0 863 y 2017 1513 83 10 62 x 0 04 x2 r 2 0 844 fig 2 indicates that the leaf biomass is consistently improved up to 105 kg n ha 1 and afterward the tendency is declined the optimal n dose in terms of physical as well as economical has also been calculated by derivation of quadratic equations all the values have been calculated based on indian rupee one us dollar is equivalent to 74 42 indian rupee as on 18 01 2022 the physical optimal doses of n are 132 75 and 118 17 kg ha 1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively however the economical optimal doses of n are predicted based on the usual market rate of urea rs 6 0 per kg and the price of dry leaf of stevia rs 120 00 kg 1 at farmer s end in india the economical optimal doses of n are 131 39 and 117 26 kg ha 1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively 3 5 temporal n accumulation in leaf no significant variation in n concentration in leaf except 60 dat in 2nd year was observed due to scheduling of irrigation at whole sampling stages fig 4 however at 60 and 80 dat the maximum n concentration in leaf was registered with the plants irrigated at 50 kpa followed by 20 and 75 kpa in 1st year during the 2nd cropping season the plants with medium water availability recorded about 7 4 and 13 7 higher n concentrations than the plants with excess and shortage of water respectively at 60 dat at harvest the concentration of n decreases from 19 24 and 19 61 mg g 1 to 18 22 and 18 85 mg g 1 with the decrease in soil moisture availability from 20 to 75 kpa in 2016 and 2017 respectively no changes p 0 05 in the concentration of n in leaf were observed by the n doses at all growth stages except 60 dat in 2016 fig 4 the increase of n up to 105 kg ha 1 significantly enhanced the concentration of n in leaf at 60 dat in 1st cropping season however at harvest the reverse trend of n accumulation was observed during both years 3 6 nutrients concentration in leaf stem and root and total npk uptake in above ground biomass the consequence of soil water and n rates on the accumulation of npk in leaf was not found significant p 0 05 during both years table s2 nevertheless results showed that the nutrient npk uptakes by stevia under different irrigation schedules and n rates were found significant p 0 05 in both years table 2 application of water at 20 and 50 kpa uptook significantly higher npk than the plants wetted at 75 kpa plants grown with medium water supply registered about 29 8 and 31 1 higher n uptake than the plants grown at moisture stress conditions in 2016 and 2017 respectively the maximum p uptake 18 97 and 16 42 kg ha 1 was also observed with the plants irrigated at 50 kpa uptake of k was declined at water deficit condition compared with sufficient moisture level the application of 105 kg n ha 1 registered statistically greater n 83 23 and 74 73 kg ha 1 p 19 96 and 17 04 kg ha 1 and k 148 22 and 137 41 kg ha 1 uptake related to control and lower dose up to 70 kg ha 1 of n table 2 also the higher level of n 140 kg ha 1 considerably improved n p and k uptake than control 3 7 nitrogen use efficiency of stevia the higher ar and ae were registered at a lower n rate 35 105 kg ha 1 in both experimental years table 3 among different nitrogen doses ar was found highest 29 21 and 29 79 with n at 70 and 35 kg ha 1 during 2016 and 2017 respectively the n at 105 kg ha 1 showed 79 2 and 61 8 higher ae than n at 140 kg ha 1 during 2016 and 2017 respectively the physiological efficiency was decreased with the increase in n dose and the maximum value 35 37 kg kg 1 was noticed with the lowest rate of n 35 kg ha 1 during 1st cropping season however an irregular trend was observed during the 2nd year and the highest pe 30 76 kg kg 1 was noticed with the medium rate n 105 kg ha 1 3 8 chemical properties of soil after completion of crop cycle the soil ph ec and oc 0 15 cm did not change in response to different irrigation scheduling in both the experimental years table 4 however the available soil n status was noticeably influenced by the irrigation schedule or frequency of irrigation the trend of available n in soil was the same over the years and the maximum value 325 36 and 295 79 kg ha 1 was registered with the 50 kpa in both years the available p content in soil was declined with an increase in moisture deficit during both years the change in irrigation schedule did not demonstrate a significant change in k content during both years the ph in 2016 ec oc p and k of the soil were not changed significantly p 0 05 due to the application of different doses of n in both years in this study table 4 nevertheless the effect of applied n on the available soil n was found significant p 0 05 the highest values 328 23 and 296 54 kg ha 1 were noted with a higher application rate of n table 4 the n at 140 kg ha 1 registered nearly 9 4 and 11 4 greater available n than the control in the first and second year respectively nonetheless the chemical properties of 15 30 cm soil layer were not noticeably changed by irrigation and n treatments table s3 however the n content was somewhat raised with frequent water application irrigation schedule at 20 kpa 3 9 nitrogen balance sheet the data presented in table 5 showed the effect of n on the nitrogen balance sheet under different moisture regimes it is evident from the data that during 1st year apparent gain of n varies from 10 16 to 60 10 kg ha 1 under 50 kpa the highest apparent gain was recorded with control 60 10 kg ha 1 followed by n application at 35 kg ha 1 44 20 kg ha 1 under moderate soil moisture irrigation at 50 kpa the maximum apparent n loss was registered with higher doses of n 105 kg ha 1 during both years the apparent n loss in the soil increases with an increase in n dose under moisture stress conditions irrigation interval at 75 kpa under well watered as well as moisture stress conditions the highest apparent n gain in the soil was registered with control during both the year 4 discussion the results of the present investigation indicate many points of scientific interest concerning the relative response of stevia to water stress excess water and n rates and its effect on soil health the pattern of dry matter accumulation over time indicates the growth behaviors of the plants in this study the rapid rate of dry matter production was persisted between 60 and 80 days and afterward it was increased at a diminishing rate regardless of treatments fig 1 a b the stevia plant differed in their dry matter production considerably owing to changes in the soil moisture content the plants irrigated at 50 kpa produced higher total dry matter due to better availability and uptake of nutrients aeration soil microbial and enzymatic activities for the production of dry matter it is evident from this study that moderate moisture level increases the concentration of n in leaf stem and root fig 4 and table s2 in this study the lower dry biomass under water stress conditions was due to the reduction of stomatal conductance gs and ultimately photosynthetic rate pn mahajan et al 2021 the carbon assimilation is reduced under water stress conditions due to the reduction of gs bradford and hsiao 1982 the disruption of the balance between photosynthesis and respiration may be another reason for low dry matter accumulation under water stress conditions galmés et al 2007 soil water content also controls the n transformation processes in soil gonzalez dugo et al 2010 low total dry matter accumulation in phaseolus vulgaris has been noticed under water stress conditions boutraa and sanders 2001 the lai was gradually increased up to the harvesting stage fig 2 a the low lai under water stress conditions was recorded probably due to the reduction of gs and pn parameters which ultimately reduced the carbon assimilation bradford and hsiao 1982 mahajan et al 2021 soil moisture deficit also accelerates leaf senescence palta et al 1994 and consequently reduces lai under water stress proportionally less biomass allocations have been observed in leaves of eragrostis lehmanniana and bouteloua eriopoda fernández et al 2002 thus the combined effects of low lai pn and carbon assimilation are accountable for low cgr and rgr in this study application of n enhanced the total dry biomass accumulation per plant compared with control in both years n at 105 kg ha 1 proved most effective in the production of dry biomass per plant at all the growth stages till the harvest fig 1b this increase was probably due to the maintaining of optimal level of nutrients especially n causing accelerated pn and consequently leading to the production of more carbohydrates the higher pn and transpiration rate trn at 105 kg n ha 1 has already been reported in the first part of this study mahajan et al 2021 the increase in dry matter accumulation in stevia with the higher dose of n has been also reported by ucar et al 2017 maximum lai and cgr were noticed with the plants fertilized with n at 105 kg ha 1 probably owing to an adequate supply of n hastens the expansion of individual leaves and branches vos and biemond 1992 1996 nitrogen supply hastens the cell growth rate in the leaf radin and ackerson 1981 radin et al 1982 and ultimately improves leaf expansion higher cgr associated with the medium n level in this study might be due to higher lai which facilitated dry matter at a faster rate per unit time the trends of cgr and rgr at a later stage were declined probably due to the reduction in absorption of solar radiance and leaf senescence borrego et al 2000 higher dry leaf yield was noted with moderate water content as a cause of greater lai table 1 this result was happened because of the low availability of nutrients particularly n at excessive 20 kpa and deficit 75 kpa water supply conditions table s3 the n uptake at 50 kpa is evident in this experiment under water deficit conditions biomass production is attributed to the low pn rate and gs and low antioxidant enzymatic pox cat and sod activities mahajan et al 2021 the uses of n in agricultural production must be optimized for balancing the energy economics and environmental factors with the resulting gains in yield wang et al 2010 the synchronization between applied n and crop n demand is also the key factor for higher yield fageria and baligar 2005 this experiment hypothesizes that the yield of stevia is influenced by the n supply consistent with this hypothesis the yield of stevia has been increased by about 50 6 52 9 with n at 105 kg ha 1 than control without external n supply the higher dry leaf yield with the application of n at 105 kg ha 1 was achieved mainly by increased lai the influence of n on the enlargement of leaves has been observed in other species taylor et al 1993 gastal and lemaire 2002 the greater dry leaf biomass with the n is generally owing to better trn and pn rate and higher biosynthesis of important biochemical constituents mahajan et al 2021 higher amounts of total sgs yields were recorded in the plants which were grown at 50 kpa irrigation schedule the result was obtained due to the production of a higher leaf without losing the percentage of sgs similarly the plants grown at 105 kg n ha 1 registered higher total sgs yield by about 57 2 and 52 2 compared with control in 2016 and 2017 respectively table 1 the higher uptakes of n p and k were registered with 50 kpa due to higher biomass table 1 without significant reduction of npk concentration in leaf and stem s2 the losses of n through leaching and denitrification are common facts under excessive application of water the low o2 in the soil is also a cause of n losses through unfinished nitrification and denitrification klemedtsson et al 1988 papen et al 1989 the nutrients uptake is controlled by the physical conditions of soil moisture temperature rather than the supply of nutrients to the soil pinamonti 1998 the decline in k uptake in the plants irrigated at 75 kpa was possibly owing to the low mobility of k in the soil and its diffusive flux in this experiment the maximum npk uptakes were registered with n at 105 kg ha 1 may be due to higher biomass in combination with maintaining consistent npk concentration in different plant parts also it has been reported that root proliferation increases under optimum n dose so that more nutrients were removed from large soil areas takei et al 2001 sakakibara et al 2006 the surge of n rate from 30 to 90 kg ha 1 progressively increases the uptakes of n p and k by the above ground parts of stevia as observed by pal et al 2015a the least ar values 16 52 and 16 76 with the greater quantity of n at 140 kg n ha 1 were obtained probably due to low n uptake and assimilation capacity of stevia mahajan et al 2021 thus it can be concluded that the nue of stevia is low however it depends on soil type crop variety environmental conditions and microbial activities walley et al 2002 burger and jackson 2004 sinebo et al 2004 the ae was higher at the moderate level of n in this experiment the incorrect form of n and wrong time of application may be the possible causes of low nue the result of low oc under water stress conditions is in line with the study of su et al 2020 who reported that moisture stress substantially reduced the quality of soil oc the higher amount of available n in soil 0 15 cm depth was recorded under moderate water supply irrigation at 50 kpa this result may be due to the fact that moderate water supply enhances the microbial activation decomposition of organic matter release of nutrients and their solubility and mobility in contrast at 15 30 cm depth the marginally higher available n was recorded under excessive water supply table s3 probably due to deposition of n as no3 ions at lower layer through leaching in this study the depletion in soil ph at higher doses of n could be due to enhance h concentration that was released during nitrification of the ammonium ions in the soil system the results are similar to the outcomes of dong et al 2012 the residual available n content in the soil was higher with the higher dose of n this result could be due to due the low nue of stevia it is evident from our balance sheet result table 5 that the positive n balance is maintained at a higher dose of n however maximum negative n balance was registered with control without an external supply of n under all the moisture regimes over the years 5 conclusions the outcomes of this study suggest that the availability of soil moisture and n directly modulates the growth development nutrient uptake and biosynthesis of sgs of stevia moderate moisture level produced about 6 19 higher dry leaf yield compared with excessive water also maximum total sgs yield and n p and k uptakes were registered with the plants irrigated at 50 kpa the sole effects of n were also found significant on various parameters based on the response function curve second degree polynomial the economical optima of n were estimated at 131 39 and 117 26 kg ha 1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively the maximum 5 03 and 4 84 g plant 1 and minimum 3 20 and 3 18 g plant 1 total sgs yield were noted with n at 105 kg ha 1 and control without the addition of n respectively this study was conducted conjunctively for two years and the trends of the results for different parameters were found consistent which adds value to our results thus in conclusion it can be stated from this study that the combination of moderate soil moisture and n is the most suitable condition for stevia cultivation it is also concluded that stevia can be grown under water stress conditions irrigation at 75 kpa with a 17 yield reduction compared with the moderate water supply thus excessive water and n are not required for stevia cultivation however further studies are required for proper scheduling of n fertilization identification of n sources and method of application to increase productivity as well as nue moreover research on the physiological and molecular understanding of low nue of stevia is also required for improving yield and quality

9619,the importance of stevia stevia rebaudiana is increasing rapidly as a potential industrial crop throughout the world soil moisture and nitrogen n are the key components for agricultural productivity however the information on the effects of availability of soil moisture and n dose on the growth of stevia n dynamics in the plant and soil and nue is limited thus a field study involving three soil water regimes irrigation schedule at 20 75 kpa and five different levels of n 0 140 kg ha 1 was conducted results showed that the dry leaf and total steviol glycosides sgs yield of stevia was found maximum with the irrigation at 50 kpa at harvest the plants irrigated at 50 kpa produced 26 9 32 5 higher dry matter over limited application of water 75 kpa the n at 105 kg ha 1 registered maximum leaf yield 2 59 and 2 37 t ha 1 and n uptake 83 23 and 74 73 kg ha 1 the higher dose of n 140 kg ha 1 did not enhance dry leaf and total sgs yield compared with n at 105 kg ha 1 the low apparent n recovery and agronomic n efficiency at higher doses of n indicate higher accumulations of n into the environment the soil n balance sheet indicates that the maximum n has been harvested with the higher n under water limiting conditions thus it can be concluded that the irrigation at 50 kpa in combination with n at 105 kg ha 1 could improve leaf and total sgs yield n uptake and nue of stevia without deteriorating soil health graphical abstract ga1 keywords leaf yield industrial crop nitrogen use efficiency soil moisture steviol glycosides 1 introduction water and nutrient management are the key components for enhancing crop productivity and maintaining agricultural sustainability the optimum dose of nitrogen n fertilizers could significantly increase crop productivity through encouraging photosynthesis improving dry matter accumulation net assimilation rate nar and nutrient uptake barłóg and grzebisz 2004a 2004b it has been reported that due to n losses through various ways such as denitrification surface runoff and leaching crops can utilize only 30 50 of applied n prasad 1996 kirda et al 2001 wang et al 2019 the excess application of n maximizes the risks of n losses to the environment due to poor synchronization between the soil n supply and the plant demand which leads to a decline in n use efficiency nue shi et al 2012 a low nue results in soil acidification emissions of n2o to the atmosphere eutrophication through surface runoff and leaching high production cost and lower net returns for farmers wang et al 2001 diaz and rosenberg 2008 guo et al 2010 the availability of water in the soil impacts how n is accessed by the plants thus efficient water management is required to derive full beneficial outputs from all other resources about 70 of the total global water is used in the agricultural sector somerville and briscoe 2001 and due to such water withdrawal groundwater tables have been dropping at alarming rates the demand for irrigation water will be increased by 13 6 by 2025 rosegrant and cai 2002 to encounter this ever increasing demand it is necessary to increase the water use efficiency wue in the agricultural sector the proper scheduling of irrigation coupled with an appropriate method of irrigation is the main factor to increase the wue in agriculture however scheduling of irrigation should be developed for the crop soil and climate specific conditions in developing countries crop production has been increased by about 55 due to the application of chemical fertilizers particularly n based fertilizers li et al 2009 nevertheless n is a contaminant which deteriorates the ecosystem and biodiversity stevens et al 2004 galloway et al 2008 many processes related to plant production are largely affected by water availability and mineral nutrition uptake onillon et al 1995 gonzalez dugo et al 2005 the whole n biogeochemical cycle is controlled by the water which ultimately influences plant production gonzalez dugo et al 2010 thus optimum soil moisture enhances plant growth through increasing nutrient availability and uptake plants absorb n in the form of nh4 and no3 ions the conversion from n fertilizer to nh4 and nh4 to no3 ions in soil are happened in presence of water overused irrigation hastens the loss of no3 through leaching in contrast the mobility of no3 is reduced at the deficit moisture level both the occurrences are responsible for low nue in agriculture the reduced uptake of n has an immediate effect on leaf area chlorophyll content and rubisco activity which further alter photosynthesis and ultimately reduce plant growth however the higher rate of n application has various negative environmental consequences therefore the application of n fertilizer and water should be synchronized with crop demand for attaining high production and enhancing resource use efficiency particularly nue to date the information on the nue of stevia stevia rebaudiana under different moisture regimes is limited stevia is being cultivated in some countries like china indonesia korea japan brazil argentina canada india mexico and usa brandle et al 1998 pal et al 2015a 2015b stevia leaf possesses steviol glycosides sgs that are low calorie and about 300 times sweeter than sucrose kinghorn 2002 out of 60 identified sgs in stevia leaves efsa faf panel et al 2020 the stevioside and rebaudioside a contribute the major percentage share there are different factors such as agronomic genetic and climatic which determine the growth performance and sgs biosynthesis in leaves tavarini and angelini 2013 pal et al 2015a however the information on the dynamics of dry matter accumulation the spatial distribution of n nue and n balance at different soil moisture and n levels is limited for stevia farming hence the objectives of this investigation are 1 to understand how the individual and collective effects of n dose and soil moisture regimes influence the dry matter accumulation leaf and total sgs yield the spatial distribution of nutrient and nue of stevia 2 to quantify optimum n dose for enhancing productivity of stevia cultivation 3 to prepare a soil n balance sheet under different treatment combinations 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and soil properties the study was carried out at the institutional farm of csir ihbt palampur india during 2016 and 2017 to know the influences of moisture regimes and n application on soil physico chemical properties leaf biomass nutrient dynamics and uptake and nue of stevia the experimental farm is situated at 32 06 05 n latitude and 76 34 10 e longitude with an altitude of 1390 m from mean sea level the mean annual temperature of the experimental location is 18 c with an annual mean rainfall of 2500 mm the soil texture of the experimental plots was silty clay with acidic in reaction ph 5 76 and organic carbon oc was high 1 37 available nitrogen phosphorus p and potassium k in the soil were 308 0 32 0 and 385 06 kg ha 1 respectively table s1 2 2 statistical design of experiment and application of treatments the field experiment was conducted in a split plot design involving two factors i e application of water at three different 20 50 and 75 kpa soil water potential swp as main plot and five n levels 0 35 70 105 and 140 kg ha 1 as sub plots the number of replications was three stevia seedlings were transplanted in the experimental unit in april first week in both years with a spacing of 45 cm 45 cm urea containing 46 n was used as a source for n in three split doses i e half at the time of transplantation and the remaining half at 2 times with equal quantity at 30th and 45th day after transplanting the full doses of phosphorus p2o5 at 50 kg ha 1 and potassium k2o at 60 kg ha 1 were applied at the time of transplantation the n doses were selected based on our previous study irrigation regimes were selected based on the performance of the tensiometer and soil texture the maximum limit of swp was 75 kpa in this experiment since the tensiometer is sensitive up to 85 kpa the experimental location receives a heavy rainfall area so the entire field area was protected by the rain out shelter for maintaining required moisture conditions the irrigation was given based on tensiometer readings a total of nine tensiometers were installed at 10 cm soil depths in the field for monitoring the swp and the crop was irrigated accordingly 2 3 growth analysis and yield for growth analysis randomly two plants were harvested with roots from each replication at 60 80 and 100 days of transplantation dat during 2016 and 2017 the leaf stem and roots were separated after washing with tap water then the leaf area la of each plant was recorded by an image analysis system and then the la was converted to leaf area index lai after recording la each plant part was dried at 70 ºc 2 ºc in a hot air oven till the constant value was achieved then weighed the dried samples to determine the periodic dry matter accumulation g plant 1 the crop growth rate cgr relative growth rate rgr and net assimilation rate nar were calculated according to classical methods and formula gregory 1917 blackman 1919 briggs et al 1920 for estimation of dry leaf yield at harvest at 100 dat another five plants were randomly harvested from each experimental unit 2 4 total steviol glycosides yield for the calculation of total sgs yield firstly total sgs concentration sum of stevioside reb a b c f dulcoside a rubusoside and steviolbioside in leaf was estimated by using a standard protocol as per the protocol described by mahajan et al 2020 then total sgs yield was determined by multiplying total sgs concentration with dry leaf yield 2 5 estimation of npk in plants for estimation of n p and k in plant parts the dried samples were grounded by a laboratory grinder and passed through a 40 mesh screen the total n concentrations in plant parts were determined by the micro kjeldahl technique the samples were digested by a concentrated sulfuric acid containing catalyst mixture of k2so4 and cuso4 10 1 for p and k determination a blend of nitric sulfuric and perchloric acid in the ratio of 9 4 1 was used for digestion after digestion total p and k concentrations in samples were determined by a spectrophotometer and flame photometer respectively as per standard protocols prasad et al 2006 2 6 soil analysis the samples were collected from 0 15 cm and 15 30 cm depth after harvesting during both years of study the shade dried soils were grounded by a pestle and mortar and passed through a sieve of spacing 2 mm after that prepared soils were stored under moisture free conditions for further analysis the ph and ec of soil 1 2 water suspension were determined by a ph and ec meter respectively the available soil n and oc were determined by using the method of subbiah and asija 1956 and walkley and black 1934 respectively the available p was estimated by following the method of bray and kurtz p1 1945 the available k was estimated through the ammonium acetate extraction method 2 7 nitrogen use efficiency and nitrogen balance sheet nitrogen use efficiency of crops is basically expressed through agronomic n efficiency ae physiological n efficiency pe and apparent n recovery ar that are calculated by the formula proposed by prasad 1990 the nitrogen balance sheet was prepared by using the data of total n uptake and applied and available n present in the soil the n balance is a key parameter to evaluate the n use and the threat for environmental contamination 2 8 data analysis the analysis of variance anova was conducted by statistica 7 software to understand the effects of soil water and n on growth attributes leaf biomass steviol glycosides yield nutrient uptake and residual nutrient status of soil the response function was also developed using statistica 7 software the differences between the two treatment effects were measured by the critical difference cd value at the 5 probability level of significance 3 results 3 1 periodic dry matter accumulation the dry matter accumulations in stevia plants at different growth stages 60 80 dat and at harvest were significantly p 0 05 affected by the moisture level and application of n in both years fig 1 dry matter increased consistently with the progression of crop growth stages 60 dat harvest the plants with moderate water 50 kpa resulted in significantly p 0 05 greater dry matter accumulation than plants grown under deficit 75 kpa and excessive 20 kpa moisture conditions at all the growth stages at harvest plants irrigated at 50 kpa produced about 26 9 and 32 5 higher dry matter over 75 kpa in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig 1a the total dry matter accumulation in stevia was gradually increased at all the stages with the increase in the application of n up to 105 kg ha 1 in both years fig 1b during 2016 at 60 dat the plants treated with n at 140 kg ha 1 registered about 65 2 higher total dry matter compared with the control but remained at par with n at 105 kg ha 1 at harvest the dry matter produced with n at 140 kg ha 1 was 35 6 and 34 0 higher than control in the 1st and 2nd year respectively no significant variation in total dry matter accumulation was observed between control and plants treated with 35 kg ha 1 n at all growth stages in 2017 at harvest the significant p 0 05 interaction effects between moisture regimes and n application on total dry matter production occurred in both the cropping years 3 2 growth analysis leaf area index lai one of the main physiological growth parameters was changed significantly p 0 05 due to accessibility of soil moisture at 60 80 and 100 dat fig 2a the plants under sufficient soil moisture wetting at 20 kpa noticeably reduced the lai by approximately 15 4 9 0 and 6 3 compared with the plant under medium water supply irrigation at 50 kpa at 60 80 and 100 dat respectively in 1st cropping season there was no significant variation in lai observed in plants grown under excess and deficit moisture at 60 and 80 dat in the 2nd cropping season at harvest maximum lai 2 53 and 2 34 was observed with the plants irrigated at 50 kpa the other physiological attributes such as cgr rgr and nar during 60 80 days of growth were not significantly influenced by soil moisture levels however the plants irrigated at 50 kpa registered approximately 56 7 81 6 33 3 35 7 and 34 9 51 2 higher cgr rgr and nar than the plants grown at 75 kpa irrigation schedule respectively during 80 100 days of growth in both years fig 2c h the influence of n on lai was found significant p 0 05 at all the growth stages in both years plants grown with 140 kg n ha 1 improved lai by 49 2 and 45 9 than control in the 1st and 2nd year of study respectively at 60 dat however at harvest 105 kg n ha 1 produced significantly greater lai 2 72 and 2 51 than other treatments the effect on n on cgr was significant during 60 80 days of growth in both years of study however at a later stage during 60 100 days of growth the effect of n was found significant p 0 05 only for the second year fig 2d the interactions of soil moisture and n on cgr were found significant during 80 100 days of growth the rgr and nar were found significant only in the first year during the growth period of 80 100 days and the maximum values were recorded with control however the interactions of n and soil water on cgr and nar were found significant in both years at the later stage 3 3 dry leaf and total steviol glycosides yield the soil moisture significantly p 0 05 influenced the production of dry leaves of stevia table 1 the utmost quantity of dry leaf 2 38 and 2 24 t ha 1 was registered with a moderate moisture level 50 kpa in both years the plants irrigated at 75 kpa registered about 12 1 reduction in dry leaf yield than the plants irrigated at 20 kpa in 1st cropping season however no difference in dry leaf yield was observed in plants grown at 20 and 75 kpa in the 2nd year thus these results indicated that water deficit and excess water both are equally harmful to stevia the maximum leaf yields 2 59 and 2 37 t ha 1 were observed with 105 kg n ha 1 which were almost 50 6 and 52 9 greater than without n in the first and second year respectively the interaction effects of water and n on leaf yields were found significant p 0 05 in both years table 1 and the utmost yield was recorded with 105 kg n ha 1 under moderate moisture level 50 kpa the effect of soil moisture on total sgs yield was insignificant p 0 05 during 1st cropping season table 1 in 2017 the effect on total sgs yield was significant p 0 05 and the higher sgs yield was recorded with 75 kpa the maximum 5 03 and 4 84 g plant 1 and minimum 3 20 and 3 18 g plant 1 total sgs yield were documented with n at 105 kg ha 1 and control without the addition of n respectively during both years of study the interaction effect between the availability of water and n on total sgs content was found insignificant p 0 05 3 4 regression studies response function to comprehend the mathematical association between applied n and dry leaf yield a regression analysis was conducted the relationship between leaf yield and applied n was best fitted by the second degree polynomial equation fig 3 and the mathematical expression is given below y

declined the optimal n dose in terms of physical as well as economical has also been calculated by derivation of quadratic equations all the values have been calculated based on indian rupee one us dollar is equivalent to 74 42 indian rupee as on 18 01 2022 the physical optimal doses of n are 132 75 and 118 17 kg ha 1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively however the economical optimal doses of n are predicted based on the usual market rate of urea rs 6 0 per kg and the price of dry leaf of stevia rs 120 00 kg 1 at farmer s end in india the economical optimal doses of n are 131 39 and 117 26 kg ha 1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively 3 5 temporal n accumulation in leaf no significant variation in n concentration in leaf except 60 dat in 2nd year was observed due to scheduling of irrigation at whole sampling stages fig 4 however at 60 and 80 dat the maximum n concentration in leaf was registered with the plants irrigated at 50 kpa followed by 20 and 75 kpa in 1st year during the 2nd cropping season the plants with medium water availability recorded about 7 4 and 13 7 higher n concentrations than the plants with excess and shortage of water respectively at 60 dat at harvest the concentration of n decreases from 19 24 and 19 61 mg g 1 to 18 22 and 18 85 mg g 1 with the decrease in soil moisture availability from 20 to 75 kpa in 2016 and 2017 respectively no changes p 0 05 in the concentration of n in leaf were observed by the n doses at all growth stages except 60 dat in 2016 fig 4 the increase of n up to 105 kg ha 1 significantly enhanced the concentration of n in leaf at 60 dat in 1st cropping season however at harvest the reverse trend of n accumulation was observed during both years 3 6 nutrients concentration in leaf stem and root and total npk uptake in above ground biomass the consequence of soil water and n rates on the accumulation of npk in leaf was not found significant p 0 05 during both years table s2 nevertheless results showed that the nutrient npk uptakes by stevia under different irrigation schedules and n rates were found significant p 0 05 in both years table 2 application of water at 20 and 50 kpa uptook significantly higher npk than the plants wetted at 75 kpa plants grown with medium water supply registered about 29 8 and 31 1 higher n uptake than the plants grown at moisture stress conditions in 2016 and 2017 respectively the maximum p uptake 18 97 and 16 42 kg ha 1 was also observed with the plants irrigated at 50 kpa uptake of k was declined at water deficit condition compared with sufficient moisture level the application of 105 kg n ha 1 registered statistically greater n 83 23 and 74 73 kg ha 1 p 19 96 and 17 04 kg ha 1 and k 148 22 and 137 41 kg ha 1 uptake related to control and lower dose up to 70 kg ha 1 of n table 2 also the higher level of n 140 kg ha 1 considerably improved n p and k uptake than control 3 7 nitrogen use efficiency of stevia the higher ar and ae were registered at a lower n rate 35 105 kg ha 1 in both experimental years table 3 among different nitrogen doses ar was found highest 29 21 and 29 79 with n at 70 and 35 kg ha 1 during 2016 and 2017 respectively the n at 105 kg ha 1 showed 79 2 and 61 8 higher ae than n at 140 kg ha 1 during 2016 and 2017 respectively the physiological efficiency was decreased with the increase in n dose and the maximum value 35 37 kg kg 1 was noticed with the lowest rate of n 35 kg ha 1 during 1st cropping season however an irregular trend was observed during the 2nd year and the highest pe 30 76 kg kg 1 was noticed with the medium rate n 105 kg ha 1 3 8 chemical properties of soil after completion of crop cycle the soil ph ec and oc 0 15 cm did not change in response to different irrigation scheduling in both the experimental years table 4 however the available soil n status was noticeably influenced by the irrigation schedule or frequency of irrigation the trend of available n in soil was the same over the years and the maximum value 325 36 and 295 79 kg ha 1 was registered with the 50 kpa in both years the available p content in soil was declined with an increase in moisture deficit during both years the change in irrigation schedule did not demonstrate a significant change in k content during both years the ph in 2016 ec oc p and k of the soil were not changed significantly p 0 05 due to the application of different doses of n in both years in this study table 4 nevertheless the effect of applied n on the available soil n was found significant p 0 05 the highest values 328 23 and 296 54 kg ha 1 were noted with a higher application rate of n table 4 the n at 140 kg ha 1 registered nearly 9 4 and 11 4 greater available n than the control in the first and second year respectively nonetheless the chemical properties of 15 30 cm soil layer were not noticeably changed by irrigation and n treatments table s3 however the n content was somewhat raised with frequent water application irrigation schedule at 20 kpa 3 9 nitrogen balance sheet the data presented in table 5 showed the effect of n on the nitrogen balance sheet under different moisture regimes it is evident from the data that during 1st year apparent gain of n varies from 10 16 to 60 10 kg ha 1 under 50 kpa the highest apparent gain was recorded with control 60 10 kg ha 1 followed by n application at 35 kg ha 1 44 20 kg ha 1 under moderate soil moisture irrigation at 50 kpa the maximum apparent n loss was registered with higher doses of n 105 kg ha 1 during both years the apparent n loss in the soil increases with an increase in n dose under moisture stress conditions irrigation interval at 75 kpa under well watered as well as moisture stress conditions the highest apparent n gain in the soil was registered with control during both the year 4 discussion the results of the present investigation indicate many points of scientific interest concerning the relative response of stevia to water stress excess water and n rates and its effect on soil health the pattern of dry matter accumulation over time indicates the growth behaviors of the plants in this study the rapid rate of dry matter production was persisted between 60 and 80 days and afterward it was increased at a diminishing rate regardless of treatments fig 1 a b the stevia plant differed in their dry matter production considerably owing to changes in the soil moisture content the plants irrigated at 50 kpa produced higher total dry matter due to better availability and uptake of nutrients aeration soil microbial and enzymatic activities for the production of dry matter it is evident from this study that moderate moisture level increases the concentration of n in leaf stem and root fig 4 and table s2 in this study the lower dry biomass under water stress conditions was due to the reduction of stomatal conductance gs and ultimately photosynthetic rate pn mahajan et al 2021 the carbon assimilation is reduced under water stress conditions due to the reduction of gs bradford and hsiao 1982 the disruption of the balance between photosynthesis and respiration may be another reason for low dry matter accumulation under water stress conditions galmés et al 2007 soil water content also controls the n transformation processes in soil gonzalez dugo et al 2010 low total dry matter accumulation in phaseolus vulgaris has been noticed under water stress conditions boutraa and sanders 2001 the lai was gradually increased up to the harvesting stage fig 2 a the low lai under water stress conditions was recorded probably due to the reduction of gs and pn parameters which ultimately reduced the carbon assimilation bradford and hsiao 1982 mahajan et al 2021 soil moisture deficit also accelerates leaf senescence palta et al 1994 and consequently reduces lai under water stress proportionally less biomass allocations have been observed in leaves of eragrostis lehmanniana and bouteloua eriopoda fernández et al 2002 thus the combined effects of low lai pn and carbon assimilation are accountable for low cgr and rgr in this study application of n enhanced the total dry biomass accumulation per plant compared with control in both years n at 105 kg ha 1 proved most effective in the production of dry biomass per plant at all the growth stages till the harvest fig 1b this increase was probably due to the maintaining of optimal level of nutrients especially n causing accelerated pn and consequently leading to the production of more carbohydrates the higher pn and transpiration rate trn at 105 kg n ha 1 has already been reported in the first part of this study mahajan et al 2021 the increase in dry matter accumulation in stevia with the higher dose of n has been also reported by ucar et al 2017 maximum lai and cgr were noticed with the plants fertilized with n at 105 kg ha 1 probably owing to an adequate supply of n hastens the expansion of individual leaves and branches vos and biemond 1992 1996 nitrogen supply hastens the cell growth rate in the leaf radin and ackerson 1981 radin et al 1982 and ultimately improves leaf expansion higher cgr associated with the medium n level in this study might be due to higher lai which facilitated dry matter at a faster rate per unit time the trends of cgr and rgr at a later stage were declined probably due to the reduction in absorption of solar radiance and leaf senescence borrego et al 2000 higher dry leaf yield was noted with moderate water content as a cause of greater lai table 1 this result was happened because of the low availability of nutrients particularly n at excessive 20 kpa and deficit 75 kpa water supply conditions table s3 the n uptake at 50 kpa is evident in this experiment under water deficit conditions biomass production is attributed to the low pn rate and gs and low antioxidant enzymatic pox cat and sod activities mahajan et al 2021 the uses of n in agricultural production must be optimized for balancing the energy economics and environmental factors with the resulting gains in yield wang et al 2010 the synchronization between applied n and crop n demand is also the key factor for higher yield fageria and baligar 2005 this experiment hypothesizes that the yield of stevia is influenced by the n supply consistent with this hypothesis the yield of stevia has been increased by about 50 6 52 9 with n at 105 kg ha 1 than control without external n supply the higher dry leaf yield with the application of n at 105 kg ha 1 was achieved mainly by increased lai the influence of n on the enlargement of leaves has been observed in other species taylor et al 1993 gastal and lemaire 2002 the greater dry leaf biomass with the n is generally owing to better trn and pn rate and higher biosynthesis of important biochemical constituents mahajan et al 2021 higher amounts of total sgs yields were recorded in the plants which were grown at 50 kpa irrigation schedule the result was obtained due to the production of a higher leaf without losing the percentage of sgs similarly the plants grown at 105 kg n ha 1 registered higher total sgs yield by about 57 2 and 52 2 compared with control in 2016 and 2017 respectively table 1 the higher uptakes of n p and k were registered with 50 kpa due to higher biomass table 1 without significant reduction of npk concentration in leaf and stem s2 the losses of n through leaching and denitrification are common facts under excessive application of water the low o2 in the soil is also a cause of n losses through unfinished nitrification and denitrification klemedtsson et al 1988 papen et al 1989 the nutrients uptake is controlled by the physical conditions of soil moisture temperature rather than the supply of nutrients to the soil pinamonti 1998 the decline in k uptake in the plants irrigated at 75 kpa was possibly owing to the low mobility of k in the soil and its diffusive flux in this experiment the maximum npk uptakes were registered with n at 105 kg ha 1 may be due to higher biomass in combination with maintaining consistent npk concentration in different plant parts also it has been reported that root proliferation increases under optimum n dose so that more nutrients were removed from large soil areas takei et al 2001 sakakibara et al 2006 the surge of n rate from 30 to 90 kg ha 1 progressively increases the uptakes of n p and k by the above ground parts of stevia as observed by pal et al 2015a the least ar values 16 52 and 16 76 with the greater quantity of n at 140 kg n ha 1 were obtained probably due to low n uptake and assimilation capacity of stevia mahajan et al 2021 thus it can be concluded that the nue of stevia is low however it depends on soil type crop variety environmental conditions and microbial activities walley et al 2002 burger and jackson 2004 sinebo et al 2004 the ae was higher at the moderate level of n in this experiment the incorrect form of n and wrong time of application may be the possible causes of low nue the result of low oc under water stress conditions is in line with the study of su et al 2020 who reported that moisture stress substantially reduced the quality of soil oc the higher amount of available n in soil 0 15 cm depth was recorded under moderate water supply irrigation at 50 kpa this result may be due to the fact that moderate water supply enhances the microbial activation decomposition of organic matter release of nutrients and their solubility and mobility in contrast at 15 30 cm depth the marginally higher available n was recorded under excessive water supply table s3 probably due to deposition of n as no3 ions at lower layer through leaching in this study the depletion in soil ph at higher doses of n could be due to enhance h concentration that was released during nitrification of the ammonium ions in the soil system the results are similar to the outcomes of dong et al 2012 the residual available n content in the soil was higher with the higher dose of n this result could be due to due the low nue of stevia it is evident from our balance sheet result table 5 that the positive n balance is maintained at a higher dose of n however maximum negative n balance was registered with control without an external supply of n under all the moisture regimes over the years 5 conclusions the outcomes of this study suggest that the availability of soil moisture and n directly modulates the growth development nutrient uptake and biosynthesis of sgs of stevia moderate moisture level produced about 6 19 higher dry leaf yield compared with excessive water also maximum total sgs yield and n p and k uptakes were registered with the plants irrigated at 50 kpa the sole effects of n were also found significant on various parameters based on the response function curve second degree polynomial the economical optima of n were estimated at 131 39 and 117 26 kg ha 1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively the maximum 5 03 and 4 84 g plant 1 and minimum 3 20 and 3 18 g plant 1 total sgs yield were noted with n at 105 kg ha 1 and control without the addition of n respectively this study was conducted conjunctively for two years and the trends of the results for different parameters were found consistent which adds value to our results thus in conclusion it can be stated from this study that the combination of moderate soil moisture and n is the most suitable condition for stevia cultivation it is also concluded that stevia can be grown under water stress conditions irrigation at 75 kpa with a 17 yield reduction compared with the moderate water supply thus excessive water and n are not required for stevia cultivation however further studies are required for proper scheduling of n fertilization identification of n sources and method of application to increase productivity as well as nue moreover research on the physiological and molecular understanding of low nue of stevia is also required for improving yield and quality
