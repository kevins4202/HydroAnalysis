15540,while a variety of chemical cleaning strategies has been studied to control fouling in membrane based water treatment processes the removal of irreversible foulants strongly bound on membrane surfaces has not been successful in this study we firstly investigated the diluted aqueous solutions of ionic fluid if 1 ethyl 3 methylimidazolium acetate as a cleaning agent for three model organic foulants humic acid ha bovine serum albumin bsa sodium alginate sa the real time monitoring of cleaning progress by optical coherence tomography oct showed that fouling layer was dramatically swelled by introducing if solution and removed by shear force exerted during cleaning this phenomenon was induced due to the pre existing interactions between organic foulants were weakened by the intrusion of if into the fouling layer which was analyzed by the measurement of adhesion forces using atomic force microscopy afm in the experiments with model foulants and wastewater effluent if was added to alkaline cleaning agents naoh to verify the applicability to be supplemented in commercial cleaning agents and resulted in the significantly enhanced control of irreversible membrane fouling implication of utilizing recyclable if with negligible volatility is that environmental effects of membrane cleaning solutions could be minimized by decreasing usage of cleaning chemicals while increasing the cleaning efficiency graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords irreversible fouling organic fouling ionic liquids optical coherence tomography atomic force microscopy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the availability and management of clean water are among the most important targets of the united nations sustainable development goals sdg membrane based reclamation of wastewater is considered a promising solution for the security of sustainable water resources among various pressure driven membrane processes reverse osmosis ro is the most frequently used for the reclamation of wastewater because of its superior rejection of dissolved constituents including organic matter and ions ro has been integrated into various wastewater reclamation processes from conventional coagulation floculation to advanced processes such as ozonation microfiltration ultrafiltration and nanofiltration to produce reclaimed water with negligeable amounts of ions and or organic substances chuang et al 2019 however one of the significant obstacles to the broader application of ro is the fouling phenomenon which is initiated by the non specific binding accumulation of foulants such as organics inorganics and the attachment and growth of microorganisms on the ro membrane surface results in severe decrease of membrane performance wu et al 2021 among various foulants in the effluent of wastewater organic foulants such as natural organic matter nom and soluble microbial products smps complicated the fouling phenomenon with increasing fouling potential in combination with other substances tang et al 2016 in particular organic foulants that accumulate on membrane surfaces have been shown to act as nucleation sites for sparingly soluble salts which causes irreversible fouling in the later stage of operation farias et al 2014 at the molecular level various interactions such as hydrogen bonding hydrophobic attraction and quadrupole interactions favour the adsorption of organic foulants onto membrane and further development of a fouling layer lu et al 2018 among interactions quadrupole interactions arise from the electron rich π systems above and below benzene rings hosting partial negative charges dougherty 1996 quadrupole interactions include cation π anion π and π π interactions and their bonding energies are known to be as strong as that of hydrogen bonding in aqueous conditions lim et al 2016 relating interaction between salts and organic foulants with quadrupole interaction the stability of the organic fouling layer has been increased through cation π interaction between cations in the feed solution and electron rich aromatic parts of organic foulants kim et al 2015 park et al 2019 besides there are strong quadrupole interactions between organic foulants organic foulants and organic foulants polyamide membrane surfaces so called π π interaction which is the force between the aromatic rings of organic matters known to strongly deteriorate water flux of pressurized membrane processes mustafa et al 2014 therefore control of organic fouling has been one of the elusive research priorities in ro technology recently cleaning solution saturated with co2 has been applied to the ultrafiltration membranes and successfully controlled the organic fouling al ghamdiet at al 2019 on the other hand the cavitation generated by ultrasound has been also applied to control organic fouling in ro and nanofiltration aghapour aktij et al 2020 however practical application of the above mentioned strategies has been limited due to the practical and economic applicabilities generally periodic chemical cleaning processes with alkaline and salt solutions have been utilized in the industrial application of reverse osmosis to mitigate organic fouling lee and elimelech 2007 however despite the periodical application of chemical cleaning a permanent decrease in ro membrane performance is inevitable due to the irreversible deposition of organic and inorganic matter on the membrane surface because the existing chemical cleaning agents have been developed without careful consideration of quadrupole interactions ang et al 2011 yamamura et al 2014 for instance alkaline cleaning solution shows poor efficiency if there are strong cation π interactions especially when polysaccharide like organic foulants are treated together with multivalent ions ang et al 2006 also salt cleaning solution was shown to be ineffective against hydrophobic organic foulants such as nom because it has weaker force to break π π interactions between the foulants foulants and foulants membrane surfaces lee and elimelech 2007 therefore the chemical cleaning agents used in ro should be capable of breaking the strong quadrupole interactions such as cation π interactions between organic foulants multivalent ions and π π interactions among organic foulants organic foulants and organic foulants membrane surfaces ionic liquids ils formerly known as molten salts are salts in liquid states and they have melting points below 100 which can be achieved by incorporating a bulky asymmetric organic cation into the structure together with a weakly coordinating anion weingärtner 2008 although ils are relatively expensive compared to the currently used cleaning chemicals they are thermally stable and are recyclable due to their non volatility greaves and drummond 2008 thus they are regarded as green solvents which can be substituted for volatile organic solvents which are a major source of environmental pollution moreover because the electrostatic interaction in ils is generally stronger than the van der waals interaction in liquid state solvents ils have better solvating properties for a wide range of polar and non polar compounds in comparison to common solvents hallett and welton 2011 the unique highly solvating yet non coordinating environment of ils makes them suitable for novel applications and an attractive medium for electrochemical devices biocatalysis engineering fluids or the treatment of biomass rogers and seddon 2003 in terms of usage as solvents for dissolving biomass with a complex structure or with a high concentration of cellulose 10 wt which is not soluble in water and most common organic liquids such as benzene or hexane can be dissolved in the various types of ils by the breakage of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding network swatloski et al 2002 moreover highly polar substrates such as carbohydrates and amino acids that are sparingly soluble in most organic solvents are dissolved in ils van rantwijk and sheldon 2007 the novel properties of ils mentioned above make them suitable for application as chemical cleaning agents to control irreversible foulants on ro membrane surfaces specifically several cation parts of ils such as imidazolium and pyrinidium have not only positive charge but also aromatic rings which could potentially have strong cation π and π π interactions with organic foulants in the fouling layer therefore in this study we first examined diluted ils or ionic fluid if as a novel cleaning agent to control irreversible foulants in ro processes moreover the cleaning mechanism of if was investigated through optical coherence microscopy oct and atomic force microscopy afm 2 materials and methods 2 1 foulants 2 1 1 organic foulants humic acid ha bovine serum albumin bsa and sodium alginate sa were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mi usa in powder form s stock solutions 1 g l were prepared by dissolving each foulant in deionized di water with gentle mixing for 24 h this was followed by filtration by a 0 45 µm cellulose acetate membrane filter advantec japan 2 1 2 wastewater effluent tertiary wastewater effluent after a2o followed by coagulation microfiltration was taken from a domestic wastewater treatment plant in d city filtered through a gf c filter the detailed characteristics of the wastewater effluent are presented in table s1 2 2 membrane properties and fouling procedures a thin film composite xle 2540 dow midland mi usa was used as a model ro membrane fouling experiments were performed with a laboratory scale cross flow test unit following the previous study park et al 2017 briefly the membrane cell was a rectangular plate and frame unit with the channel dimensions of 7 7 cm 2 6 cm 0 3 cm l w h the retentate was recirculated back to the feed reservoir while the permeate flux was measured continuously using a digital scale interfaced with a computer and then recirculated back to the feed using the siphon the cross flow velocity and the operating pressure were adjusted to be 10 cm s and 7 bar respectively using a gear pump in conjunction with a customized pressure regulator for the fouling procedure the feed water volume was 1 l and the initial flux was measured with a foulant free electrolyte solution 8 5 mm nacl 0 5 mm cacl2 under the above operating conditions fouling was initiated by adding 20 mg doc l sa and ha or 100 mg doc l bsa of organic foulants and carried out until the normalized flux reached 0 4 on the other hand the permeate was not recirculated back to the feed tank for the fouling with wwe in addition the fouling was carried out to a recovery ratio of 70 with a feed water volume of 3 l 2 3 chemical cleaning agents and ils cleaning without chemical cleaning agents control was evaluated using an electrolyte solution with identical ionic chemistry to that used in the fouling experiments the model il used in the study was 1 ethyl 3 methylimifsxolium acetate fig s1 sigma aldrich st louis mi usa before comparing the cleaning capability of if with other cleaning agents the cleaning efficiencies of ifs with dissimilar concentrations were compared and the optimal condition was chosen the desired ionic fluids 0 01 m and 0 1 m were prepared by dilution with electrolyte solution the concentrations of the cleaning agents were chosen based on the concentrations of alkaline cleaning agents against organic foulants which is within the range of 0 025 m to 0 1 m yang et al 2013 additionally the effects of if solution on membrane performance were analyzed after 3 days 10 days and 20 days of acceleration experiments by keeping the membranes in the if solution subsequently the membrane coupons were thoroughly washed with di and the performance water flux and salt passage was assessed under identical conditions with fouling procedure using the feed solution of 2000 mg l nacl for the comparison of the inorganic ions with if i e organic ions the cleaning efficiencies of salt cleaning agents nacl ph 6 8 0 3 with identical molar concentrations to if ph 6 7 0 2 were assessed furthermore the effects of if solutions as additives to the currently used alkaline cleaning agents were evaluated by comparing the cleaning efficiencies of alkaline only naoh ph 13 0 1 and the mixture naoh if ph 12 7 0 1 2 4 cleaning of membranes after the fouling run the solution in the feed reservoir was removed and replaced with each cleaning agent electrolyte if nacl naoh and naoh if during the chemical cleaning the cross flow velocity was increased to 20 cm s and each cleaning solution was in contact with a fouled membrane for 1 h at 35 c after cleaning the solution was thoroughly replaced with electrolyte solution containing 8 5 mm nacl 0 5 mm cacl2 and the water flux was measured with the cross flow velocity of 10 cm s and 7 bar for the comparison of the cleaning efficiency against model foulants the change in membrane fouling resistance were analyzed the membrane fouling resistance was divided into the intrinsic membrane resistance rm total fouling resistance rt and irreversible fouling resistance after chemical cleaning rc and calculated at the end of filtration by darcy s law r p μj where δ p transmembrane pressure μ dynamic viscosity 0 9321 10 3 pa s at 23 c rm was obtained by measuring the initial water flux of the virgin membrane j0 and the total fouling resistance rt was acquired by measuring the flux after the fouling jt after the cleaning with each cleaning solution the clean water flux jc was measured again with the flushed membrane to assess cleaned membrane resistance rc the cleaning efficiency was determined by comparing the membrane resistance before and after the chemical cleaning with the below equation cleaning efficiency r t r c r t r m 100 on the other hands the effects of the chemical cleaning against wwe were compared with the flux recovery after the chemical cleaning flux recovery j c j 0 100 2 5 monitoring of fouling layers by oct membranes fouled with ha under the standard conditions were used for the analysis of oct thorlabs germany the fouled membrane coupons were placed in a polymethyl methacrylate module and cross sectional observation of the fouling layer was implemented to obtain the cleaning mechanism of the cleaning agents i e if nacl and naoh at two different stages soaking of cleaning agents and post cleaning the oct was operated with thorlabs ganymede spectral domain system at the central wavelength of 930 nm equipped with a 5 telecentric scan lens thorlabs lsm 03bb a time resolved oct investigation was performed at the scan frequency of 30 hz and serial static images were obtained to figure out the change in the thickness of the fouling layer during the soakage of the cleaning solution thickness was randomly measured at 20 different locations from oct images 2 6 afm analysis innova atomic force microscopy afm bruker santa barbara ca usa was conducted to measure the interfacial force between the foulants in the fouling layer developed on the membrane the interfacial force between foulants was measured with a commercial sin sharp tip cantilever bruker snl 10 santa barbara ca usa spring constant of 0 06 n m the virgin ro membranes and afm probe were coated with ha by the poly l lysine pll chemistry with the rinse method colville et al 2010 in the rinse method 0 01 wt of pll solution was placed on both membranes and the afm probe for 1 h to make the coated surface positively charged subsequently membranes and afm probe were then immersed in 20 mg c l of ha solution for 1 h to ha molecules on the membrane and afm probe the interaction between the ha coated tip and ha fouled ro membrane was assessed by merging the electrolyte solutions containing 8 5 mm nacl and 0 5 mm cacl2 to further investigate the effect of cleaning agents on the intermolecular adhesion force of ha each cleaning agent nacl naoh and if was added to the electrolyte solution at the same concentration as that used in the cleaning experiments the afm adhesion force measurements were performed in a fluid cell by the liquid drop merge method in the liquid drop merge method the test solutions were dropped on both the membrane surface sample and the fluid cell afm probe both the membrane and afm probe were equilibrated with the test solution for 30 min before force measurements were performed the afm was operated in a force mode with an approach retraction speed of 0 5 μm s and 0 5 μm of piezo movement the force measurements were conducted at four different locations and at least 15 measurements were taken at each location 2 7 analysis of membrane surface after each fouling and cleaning experiment each treated membrane was rinsed three times with di water and dried before further analysis the atr ftir spectra were recorded on a nicolet spectrometer model is50 thermo fisher scientific instrument usa with a resolution of 4 0 cm 1 in the range of 1800 400 cm 1 by the absorbance mode 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical cleaning efficiency of salt cleaning agents and if cleaning agent the optimal concentration of the if used in this study was chosen by comparing the cleaning efficiencies of if with different concentrations 0 01 m and 0 1 m the cleaning efficiencies of the electrolyte solution 0 01 m if and 0 1 m if against ha fouled bsa fouled and sa fouled membranes were compared text s1 fig s2 as a result 0 1 m if showed significantly pronounced cleaning efficiency than 0 01 m if against ha and bsa in contrast the cleaning efficiency of 0 1 m if had insignificant difference to that of 0 01 m against sa the increase in the cleaning efficiency with an increasing if concentration against ha and bsa implies that this chemical reaction is controlled by the stoichiometry between the if dose and the amount of organic fouling on the membrane surface thus later on in this study 0 1 m if was applied to control organic fouling before comparing the cleaning efficiency of if with other types of cleaning agents the effects of if on membrane performance water flux and salt permeability were evaluated through acceleration experiments by keeping the membrane in contact with the 0 1 m if solution for 3 days 10 days and 20 days which are identical to the 12 40 and 80 chemical cleanings fig s3 in the case of water flux fig s3 a compared to the virgin membrane 51 5 1 7 lmh those of membrane kept in contact with if for 3 days 10 days and 20 days were 52 1 1 9 lmh 52 7 2 3 lmh and 53 9 3 6 lmh respectively for salt permeability fig s3 b the virgin membrane showed 7 0 0 4 and those of the membrane stored in if solution were 7 2 0 4 7 1 0 5 and 7 4 0 9 respectively for 3 days 10 days and 20 days through the acceleration experiments 0 1 m if was proven to have negligible effect on the membrane performance for long term cycles of chemical cleaning in fig 1 a the decline in water flux by ha fouling and the flux recovery after chemical cleaning are presented the initial permeate flux at the given operating condition cross flow velocity 10 cm s applied pressure 7 bar with the electrolyte solution was 50 5 0 3 l m2 h in fig 1 b d the changes in the membrane fouling resistance after the chemical cleaning are presented and the cleaning efficiencies of identical molar concentrations 0 1 m of nacl or if against ha fouled 20 mg c l bsa fouled 100 mg c l and sa fouled 20 mg c l membranes respectively are compared the cleaning efficiency of each cleaning solution against ha fouling is shown in fig 1 b the intrinsic membrane resistance was 5 4 1013 m 1 2 4 1012 and the resistance of the ha fouled membrane was 1 4 1014 m 1 3 4 1012 after cleaning with 0 1 m nacl the fouling resistance became 8 3 1013 m 1 5 4 1012 and the cleaning efficiency calculated with the equation from section 2 4 was 64 in case of nacl cleaning lower efficiency was attributed to the limited ion exchange effects of salt cleaning agents with ha which consist mostly of hydrophobic moieties lee and elimelech 2007 however after cleaning by 0 l m if solution the membrane fouling resistance recovered to that of intrinsic membrane resistance 96 in a previous study ils were shown to have a strong binding strength with ha around 107 l kg 1 and moreover lignin which has a more complex molecular structure than ha does was proven to be dissolved up to 20 wt in ils wang et al 2012 by the aforementioned chemical characteristics of if against ha the fouling layer was shown to be controlled at the tested if concentration the effects of cleaning against bsa fouling were also investigated as presented in fig 1 c in the case of nacl cleaning the efficiency was 81 and this was due to the increased but limited protein solubility by the salting in effect of nacl corbatón báguena et al 2014 in contrast after if cleaning the membrane fouling resistance decreased significantly and the cleaning efficiency was 97 it was attributable to the superior solvation properties of ils which are widely used as solvents to dissolve denature or hydrolyze proteins or amino acids brogan and hallett 2016 alginate one of the representative polysaccharides in biofouling forms a stable complex of an egg box like structure in the presence of divalent cations especially ca2 in the feed solution lee et al 2006b for nacl cleaning as shown in fig 1 d the cleaning efficiency reached 88 and this was due to the lessening of the structural integrity of the alginate gel layer through the swelling induced by ion exchange between calcium ions and sodium ions lee and elimelech 2007 in the case of if it exhibited a slightly higher cleaning efficiency to that of nacl 94 which was likely due to the surpassing solvation properties of ils which were effective on the coordinative structure of typical saccharides such as chitin and sucrose shamshina et al 2014 comparing if cleaning with salt cleaning salt cleaning is efficient only with hydrophilic organic foulants such as sa while if cleaning was effective not only with sa but also with hydrophobic foulants such as ha and bsa 3 2 oct monitoring cross sectional scans and time resolved images of the fouled membranes in the middle of the chemical cleaning step were acquired at various frame rates using oct to obtain detailed information on the cleaning mechanism of the cleaning agents used in this study 0 1 m of if nacl and naoh oct analysis was typically implemented against ha fouling layer as sa and bsa fouling layers were not differentiated from that of the polyamide layer of the ro membrane in fig s4 oct observation of a virgin membrane shows bright upper parts less bright parts and dark parts and these were shown to be an active layer support layer and woven layer respectively the ha fouled membrane was prepared by a procedure identical to that described in the previous section thereafter a thin bright and uniform fouling layer was formed just above the active layer observed from oct images fig 2 presents the results of oct analysis and the thickness of the fouling layer during the soakage of the cleaning solution was compared compared to the thickness of the fouling layer before cleaning 50 4 7 5 μm only the negligible for salt cleaning 56 0 13 4 μm and partial for alkaline cleaning 98 3 15 7 μm disruption of the fouling layer were observed in the case of nacl cleaning oct images clearly showed that the fouling layer was hardly removed by salt cleaning which was consistent with the results presented in fig 1 b for alkaline cleaning with naoh the interface of the ha fouling layer became more porous during the soaking stage and further detached when cross flow was applied however a thin ha layer still remained on the membrane surface even after cleaning which implied incomplete cleaning on the other hand immediately after if was added the whole fouling layer was swollen or expanded in the soaking stage 250 0 22 6 μm moreover as the cross flow was applied on the membrane surface disruption of the fouling layer was clearly observed the cleaning mechanism of if used in this study was thought to be the swelling of the organic fouling layer by the intrusion of if into the fouling layer 3 3 afm analysis the effect of cleaning chemicals on the foulants foulants interactions in the fouling layer was analyzed by afm in the afm analysis following the oct analysis ha was used as the model organic foulants successful coating of ha on the probe and membrane via pll chemistry were confirmed by the stepwise analysis of the interactions through afm as shown in fig s5 the adhesion force between the afm probe and membrane was significantly increased when the probe was coated with pll 3 79 2 18 nn compared to that of the uncoated probe and membrane 0 54 0 51 nn due to the increased electrostatic interaction on the other hand when the pll coated probe was further coated with the ha the interaction between the probe and membrane 1 79 0 99 nn decreased slightly to further figure out the foulants foulants interaction in the ha fouling layer a virgin membrane was coated with ha and the strong adhesion 1 13 0 77 nn was present between the ha coated probe and ha fouled membrane thus strong foulant foulant interaction and much stronger foulant membrane interaction implies the difficulties of controlling organic fouling layers developed on membranes and foulants strongly bound to membrane surfaces therefore to control the organic fouling layer strongly bound by various interactions including quadrupole interactions the chemical cleaning agents should be capable of breaking those interactions in fig 3 the effect of cleaning agents on the intermolecular adhesion force of ha was analyzed by injecting 0 1 m of one of the following cleaning chemicals in the electrolyte solution 8 5 mm nacl 0 5 mm cacl2 nacl naoh or if between the ha coated probe and ha fouled membrane without the presence of cleaning agents fig 3 a substantial adhesive force 1 15 0 77 nn exists between the ha coated probe and ha fouled membrane when nacl was added to the solution chemistry fig 3 b there was strong adhesion between the ha coated probe and ha fouled membrane 1 19 0 68 nn therefore the poor cleaning efficiency of nacl against ha in fig 1 b was explained by this result that nacl did not diminish the interactions between ha molecules the effect of naoh on the reduction of the intermolecular adhesion force of ha was also investigated as seen in fig 3 c the adhesion force between the ha molecules was significantly reduced 0 68 0 67 nn even though the interaction between foulants was clearly reduced relatively large standard deviation implies that there were measurements with strong adhesion force remained after alkaline cleaning this result showed good agreement with the oct analysis finding that the ha fouling layer remained on the membrane surface after cleaning with naoh both the oct and afm analysis indicated that irreversible organic fouling could not be completely controlled through the hydrolysis and solubilisation by naoh when if was added to the electrolyte solution as a cleaning agent fig 3 d the interaction between ha was considerably reduced 0 64 0 41 nn in a previous study aromatic compounds which are the major constituents of ha had high solubility in the ils due to the favorable quadrupole interactions between the delocalized π system of the aromatic solutes and components of ils keaveney et al 2017 moreover in an md simulation analyzing the solubility of aromatic compounds by ils cations of ils were shown to be localized in the polar and equatorial positions of the π electron cloud of the aromatic ring which controls the solubility of aromatic compounds through quadrupole interactions shimizu et al 2009 in particular the imidazolium based ils used in this study were shown to have stronger interaction with the aromatic compounds as imidazolium is cation with aromatic ring cui et al 2017 this result agreed with the oct analysis finding that the ha fouling layer was swollen during if cleaning as the pre existing interaction between the ha molecules was disturbed by the strong quadrupole interactions existing between the cations with the aromatic ring of imidazolium based ils and π systems of organic foulants these superior solvating properties of if with strong quadrupole interaction was thought to be effective not only against ha but also against other organic foulants such as sa and bsa according to the results of chemical cleaning presented in fig 1 3 4 membrane surface characterizations by ft ir and afm to examine the changes in the residual substances on the membrane surface before and after cleaning ft ir spectra were analyzed as shown in fig 4 a c polyamide peaks around 1487 cm 1 and 1585 cm 1 were observed due to aromatic amide and these characteristic peaks disappeared due to the formation of the fouling layer on membrane surfaces as indicated by the black dashed lines in fig 4 tang et al 2009 the peaks at wavenumbers of 911 cm 1 and 1022 cm 1 indicate c h groups and aliphatic ether of ha respectively as shown in fig 4 a helal et al 2011 in fig 4 b the indicative peaks of bsa amides ⅰ 1643 cm 1 and amides ⅱ 1533 cm 1 are shown chatterjee and mukherjee 2014 the wave numbers representing sa at 1024 cm 1 1411 cm 1 and 1587 cm 1 in fig 4 c are an elongation of c o groups symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibration of coo groups respectively pereira et al 2011 in a previous study natural organic matter protein and polysaccharides remained on the membrane surface even after physical and chemical cleaning yu et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 specifically strong adsorption was observed at 1025 cm 1 c o aliphatic ether 1650 cm 1 n h amide ii and 1598 cm 1 coo symmetric carboxylate on the membrane after physical cleaning and these peaks were closely related to humic acid like protein like and polysaccharide like materials respectively lee et al 2006a yu et al 2010 these results agreed with the findings of this study that peaks remained at 1022 cm 1 for an ha fouled membrane and at 1643 cm 1 for a bsa fouled membrane after cleaning with nacl which implies limited interaction between salt cleaning agents with hydrophobic organic foulants the peak observed at 1587 cm 1 for the sa fouled membrane after naoh chemical cleaning indicated incomplete cleaning due to the poor interaction between alkaline cleaning agents with the gel like structure however after chemical cleaning with 0 1 m if the peaks denoting irreversible fouling were significantly reduced and the polyamide peaks 1487 cm 1 and 1585 cm 1 aromatic amide reappeared for all model foulants these results prove that the if cleaning agent was able to disintegrate irreversible membrane fouling by its strong quadrupole interaction with organic foulants in the fouling layer 3 5 synergetic cleaning efficiency of alkaline cleaning agents and if cleaning agent according to the findings of the oct and afm analysis the cleaning mechanisms of the naoh and if cleaning agents were dissimilar hydrolysis and solubilization for naoh and solvation followed by swelling for if therefore in this section as presented in fig 5 the cleaning effects of naoh alone 0 1 m and naoh together with if 0 05 m respectively were compared to evaluate the synergetic cleaning effects of if with naoh against model organic foulants the chemical stability of the imidazolium based ionic liquid used in this was known to be unstable at high temperatures 80 c or with a high concentration of oh 1 m wang et al 2017 ye and elabd 2011 as the cleaning with if was conducted at room temperature with a lower oh concentration 0 05 m the ionic liquid was in a stable condition on the other hand the effects of mixing naoh and if on the membrane performance i e water flux and salt permeability were evaluated through acceleration experiments by keeping the membrane in contact with the 0 05 m if 0 05 m naoh solution for 3 days 10 days and 20 days respectively which are identical to the 12 40 and 80 chemical cleanings fig s3 both the water flux and salt permeability of the membrane stored in naoh and if had a negligible effect on the membrane performance compared to the virgin membrane text s2 in the cases of ha and bsa fouling as seen in fig 5 a and 5 b the cleaning efficiencies of naoh alone were 95 and 97 respectively with the addition of if the cleaning efficiency improved to 99 for both foulants which implies the complete cleaning of the fouling layer by naoh with if for cleaning against sa as presented in fig 5 c the alkaline solution had a very low cleaning efficiency 74 which implies that the chemical reaction between naoh and the egg box like alginate calcium complexes was limited alkaline cleaning solutions show poor efficiency if there are strong cation π interactions especially when treating polysaccharide like organic foulants existing together with multivalent ions ang et al 2006 on the other hand when if was used together with naoh the cleaning efficiency increased to 95 which was comparable to the results of if cleaning presented in fig 1 d the results presented in this section indicate that the addition of if to naoh could significantly improve the cleaning efficiency by having different cleaning mechanisms especially for sa that develops a gel structure 3 6 chemical cleaning efficiency against wastewater effluent to assess the efficiency of cleaning agents i e 0 1 m nacl 0 1 m naoh and 0 05 m naoh 0 05 m if against irreversible membrane fouling tertiary wastewater effluent was used as a feed solution and fouling cleaning cycles were repeated five times as seen in fig 6 the cleaning efficiency of the 0 1 m nacl solution 61 9 2 1 46 2 0 1 34 3 0 0 29 1 0 1 and 24 4 0 3 and naoh solution 74 2 0 5 62 8 0 4 56 9 0 3 51 3 0 1 and 49 7 0 4 decreased rapidly after each cleaning cycle which indicates failure in controlling irreversible fouling on the other hand the addition of if to naoh improved the cleaning efficiency and the efficiency was maintained over cleaning cycles in comparison to those of salt and alkaline cleaning 76 5 1 7 70 3 0 3 65 4 0 9 62 0 0 0 and 60 3 0 3 when compared with the previous study that used 0 2 mm edta ph 10 5 and 10 mm sds ph 7 as the cleaning solution to control the fouling phenomenon in the ro membrane operating in treated wastewater the cleaning efficiency decreased rapidly after the fifth cleaning cycle 53 8 al ashhab et al 2017 in another study the cleaning efficiency of diluted naoh ph 12 and saturated urea 1 34 kg l were assessed with the ro operating against simulated brackish water the average recovery of the feed channel pressure drop was 35 and 41 for naoh and urea cleaning respectively in the cleaning cycles 4 to 6 sanawar et al 2021 however when if was added to the naoh against the membrane fouled with wastewater effluent the flux recovery was maintained to be higher than 60 even after the fifth cleaning cycle thus if was shown to have synergetic effects with naoh in mitigating irreversible membrane fouling these results demonstrate the applicability of if as an additive to currently used cleaning agents to control irreversible membrane fouling and moreover application of if which is known to be recycled by its negligible volatility will open the door for chemical cleaning not only by its efficiency but also for its environmental friendly characteristics 4 conclusions this study explored the potential application of if as a novel cleaning agent of ro membrane processes and a cleaning mechanism was proposed in comparison to salt cleaning agents if showed outstanding performance against ha and bsa and a comparable effect against sa the main cleaning mechanism of if proven by oct and afm analysis was the swelling of the fouling layer due to the weakened pre existing interactions between organic foulants by the intrusion of if into the fouling layer cation part of ils used in this study was imidazolium which has aromatic ring in its structure and thus strong quadrupole interaction involving cation π and π π interaction presumably exist between imidazolium based ils and π systems of organic foulants more interestingly the addition of if into naoh solution resulted in the significantly enhanced control of irreversible membrane fouling induced by model foulants and wastewater effluent consequently the supplementation of if with disparate cleaning mechanisms into the currently used cleaning agents would be a promising strategy for cleaning ro membranes that are subject to irreversible fouling by utilizing recyclable if with negligible volatility the usage of cleaning chemicals could be decreased and therefore environmental effects of membrane cleaning solutions could be minimized credit authorship contribution statement seung ju choi investigation formal analysis writing original draft sangsik kim methodology data

15540,while a variety of chemical cleaning strategies has been studied to control fouling in membrane based water treatment processes the removal of irreversible foulants strongly bound on membrane surfaces has not been successful in this study we firstly investigated the diluted aqueous solutions of ionic fluid if 1 ethyl 3 methylimidazolium acetate as a cleaning agent for three model organic foulants humic acid ha bovine serum albumin bsa sodium alginate sa the real time monitoring of cleaning progress by optical coherence tomography oct showed that fouling layer was dramatically swelled by introducing if solution and removed by shear force exerted during cleaning this phenomenon was induced due to the pre existing interactions between organic foulants were weakened by the intrusion of if into the fouling layer which was analyzed by the measurement of adhesion forces using atomic force microscopy afm in the experiments with model foulants and wastewater effluent if was added to alkaline cleaning agents naoh to verify the applicability to be supplemented in commercial cleaning agents and resulted in the significantly enhanced control of irreversible membrane fouling implication of utilizing recyclable if with negligible volatility is that environmental effects of membrane cleaning solutions could be minimized by decreasing usage of cleaning chemicals while increasing the cleaning efficiency graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords irreversible fouling organic fouling ionic liquids optical coherence tomography atomic force microscopy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the availability and management of clean water are among the most important targets of the united nations sustainable development goals sdg membrane based reclamation of wastewater is considered a promising solution for the security of sustainable water resources among various pressure driven membrane processes reverse osmosis ro is the most frequently used for the reclamation of wastewater because of its superior rejection of dissolved constituents including organic matter and ions ro has been integrated into various wastewater reclamation processes from conventional coagulation floculation to advanced processes such as ozonation microfiltration ultrafiltration and nanofiltration to produce reclaimed water with negligeable amounts of ions and or organic substances chuang et al 2019 however one of the significant obstacles to the broader application of ro is the fouling phenomenon which is initiated by the non specific binding accumulation of foulants such as organics inorganics and the attachment and growth of microorganisms on the ro membrane surface results in severe decrease of membrane performance wu et al 2021 among various foulants in the effluent of wastewater organic foulants such as natural organic matter nom and soluble microbial products smps complicated the fouling phenomenon with increasing fouling potential in combination with other substances tang et al 2016 in particular organic foulants that accumulate on membrane surfaces have been shown to act as nucleation sites for sparingly soluble salts which causes irreversible fouling in the later stage of operation farias et al 2014 at the molecular level various interactions such as hydrogen bonding hydrophobic attraction and quadrupole interactions favour the adsorption of organic foulants onto membrane and further development of a fouling layer lu et al 2018 among interactions quadrupole interactions arise from the electron rich π systems above and below benzene rings hosting partial negative charges dougherty 1996 quadrupole interactions include cation π anion π and π π interactions and their bonding energies are known to be as strong as that of hydrogen bonding in aqueous conditions lim et al 2016 relating interaction between salts and organic foulants with quadrupole interaction the stability of the organic fouling layer has been increased through cation π interaction between cations in the feed solution and electron rich aromatic parts of organic foulants kim et al 2015 park et al 2019 besides there are strong quadrupole interactions between organic foulants organic foulants and organic foulants polyamide membrane surfaces so called π π interaction which is the force between the aromatic rings of organic matters known to strongly deteriorate water flux of pressurized membrane processes mustafa et al 2014 therefore control of organic fouling has been one of the elusive research priorities in ro technology recently cleaning solution saturated with co2 has been applied to the ultrafiltration membranes and successfully controlled the organic fouling al ghamdiet at al 2019 on the other hand the cavitation generated by ultrasound has been also applied to control organic fouling in ro and nanofiltration aghapour aktij et al 2020 however practical application of the above mentioned strategies has been limited due to the practical and economic applicabilities generally periodic chemical cleaning processes with alkaline and salt solutions have been utilized in the industrial application of reverse osmosis to mitigate organic fouling lee and elimelech 2007 however despite the periodical application of chemical cleaning a permanent decrease in ro membrane performance is inevitable due to the irreversible deposition of organic and inorganic matter on the membrane surface because the existing chemical cleaning agents have been developed without careful consideration of quadrupole interactions ang et al 2011 yamamura et al 2014 for instance alkaline cleaning solution shows poor efficiency if there are strong cation π interactions especially when polysaccharide like organic foulants are treated together with multivalent ions ang et al 2006 also salt cleaning solution was shown to be ineffective against hydrophobic organic foulants such as nom because it has weaker force to break π π interactions between the foulants foulants and foulants membrane surfaces lee and elimelech 2007 therefore the chemical cleaning agents used in ro should be capable of breaking the strong quadrupole interactions such as cation π interactions between organic foulants multivalent ions and π π interactions among organic foulants organic foulants and organic foulants membrane surfaces ionic liquids ils formerly known as molten salts are salts in liquid states and they have melting points below 100 which can be achieved by incorporating a bulky asymmetric organic cation into the structure together with a weakly coordinating anion weingärtner 2008 although ils are relatively expensive compared to the currently used cleaning chemicals they are thermally stable and are recyclable due to their non volatility greaves and drummond 2008 thus they are regarded as green solvents which can be substituted for volatile organic solvents which are a major source of environmental pollution moreover because the electrostatic interaction in ils is generally stronger than the van der waals interaction in liquid state solvents ils have better solvating properties for a wide range of polar and non polar compounds in comparison to common solvents hallett and welton 2011 the unique highly solvating yet non coordinating environment of ils makes them suitable for novel applications and an attractive medium for electrochemical devices biocatalysis engineering fluids or the treatment of biomass rogers and seddon 2003 in terms of usage as solvents for dissolving biomass with a complex structure or with a high concentration of cellulose 10 wt which is not soluble in water and most common organic liquids such as benzene or hexane can be dissolved in the various types of ils by the breakage of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding network swatloski et al 2002 moreover highly polar substrates such as carbohydrates and amino acids that are sparingly soluble in most organic solvents are dissolved in ils van rantwijk and sheldon 2007 the novel properties of ils mentioned above make them suitable for application as chemical cleaning agents to control irreversible foulants on ro membrane surfaces specifically several cation parts of ils such as imidazolium and pyrinidium have not only positive charge but also aromatic rings which could potentially have strong cation π and π π interactions with organic foulants in the fouling layer therefore in this study we first examined diluted ils or ionic fluid if as a novel cleaning agent to control irreversible foulants in ro processes moreover the cleaning mechanism of if was investigated through optical coherence microscopy oct and atomic force microscopy afm 2 materials and methods 2 1 foulants 2 1 1 organic foulants humic acid ha bovine serum albumin bsa and sodium alginate sa were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mi usa in powder form s stock solutions 1 g l were prepared by dissolving each foulant in deionized di water with gentle mixing for 24 h this was followed by filtration by a 0 45 µm cellulose acetate membrane filter advantec japan 2 1 2 wastewater effluent tertiary wastewater effluent after a2o followed by coagulation microfiltration was taken from a domestic wastewater treatment plant in d city filtered through a gf c filter the detailed characteristics of the wastewater effluent are presented in table s1 2 2 membrane properties and fouling procedures a thin film composite xle 2540 dow midland mi usa was used as a model ro membrane fouling experiments were performed with a laboratory scale cross flow test unit following the previous study park et al 2017 briefly the membrane cell was a rectangular plate and frame unit with the channel dimensions of 7 7 cm 2 6 cm 0 3 cm l w h the retentate was recirculated back to the feed reservoir while the permeate flux was measured continuously using a digital scale interfaced with a computer and then recirculated back to the feed using the siphon the cross flow velocity and the operating pressure were adjusted to be 10 cm s and 7 bar respectively using a gear pump in conjunction with a customized pressure regulator for the fouling procedure the feed water volume was 1 l and the initial flux was measured with a foulant free electrolyte solution 8 5 mm nacl 0 5 mm cacl2 under the above operating conditions fouling was initiated by adding 20 mg doc l sa and ha or 100 mg doc l bsa of organic foulants and carried out until the normalized flux reached 0 4 on the other hand the permeate was not recirculated back to the feed tank for the fouling with wwe in addition the fouling was carried out to a recovery ratio of 70 with a feed water volume of 3 l 2 3 chemical cleaning agents and ils cleaning without chemical cleaning agents control was evaluated using an electrolyte solution with identical ionic chemistry to that used in the fouling experiments the model il used in the study was 1 ethyl 3 methylimifsxolium acetate fig s1 sigma aldrich st louis mi usa before comparing the cleaning capability of if with other cleaning agents the cleaning efficiencies of ifs with dissimilar concentrations were compared and the optimal condition was chosen the desired ionic fluids 0 01 m and 0 1 m were prepared by dilution with electrolyte solution the concentrations of the cleaning agents were chosen based on the concentrations of alkaline cleaning agents against organic foulants which is within the range of 0 025 m to 0 1 m yang et al 2013 additionally the effects of if solution on membrane performance were analyzed after 3 days 10 days and 20 days of acceleration experiments by keeping the membranes in the if solution subsequently the membrane coupons were thoroughly washed with di and the performance water flux and salt passage was assessed under identical conditions with fouling procedure using the feed solution of 2000 mg l nacl for the comparison of the inorganic ions with if i e organic ions the cleaning efficiencies of salt cleaning agents nacl ph 6 8 0 3 with identical molar concentrations to if ph 6 7 0 2 were assessed furthermore the effects of if solutions as additives to the currently used alkaline cleaning agents were evaluated by comparing the cleaning efficiencies of alkaline only naoh ph 13 0 1 and the mixture naoh if ph 12 7 0 1 2 4 cleaning of membranes after the fouling run the solution in the feed reservoir was removed and replaced with each cleaning agent electrolyte if nacl naoh and naoh if during the chemical cleaning the cross flow velocity was increased to 20 cm s and each cleaning solution was in contact with a fouled membrane for 1 h at 35 c after cleaning the solution was thoroughly replaced with electrolyte solution containing 8 5 mm nacl 0 5 mm cacl2 and the water flux was measured with the cross flow velocity of 10 cm s and 7 bar for the comparison of the cleaning efficiency against model foulants the change in membrane fouling resistance were analyzed the membrane fouling resistance was divided into the intrinsic membrane resistance rm total fouling resistance rt and irreversible fouling resistance after chemical cleaning rc and calculated at the end of filtration by darcy s law r p μj where δ p transmembrane pressure μ dynamic viscosity 0 9321 10 3 pa s at 23 c rm was obtained by measuring the initial water flux of the virgin membrane j0 and the total fouling resistance rt was acquired by measuring the flux after the fouling jt after the cleaning with each cleaning solution the clean water flux jc was measured again with the flushed membrane to assess cleaned membrane resistance rc the cleaning efficiency was determined by comparing the membrane resistance before and after the chemical cleaning with the below equation cleaning efficiency r t r c r t r m 100 on the other hands the effects of the chemical cleaning against wwe were compared with the flux recovery after the chemical cleaning flux recovery j c j 0 100 2 5 monitoring of fouling layers by oct membranes fouled with ha under the standard conditions were used for the analysis of oct thorlabs germany the fouled membrane coupons were placed in a polymethyl methacrylate module and cross sectional observation of the fouling layer was implemented to obtain the cleaning mechanism of the cleaning agents i e if nacl and naoh at two different stages soaking of cleaning agents and post cleaning the oct was operated with thorlabs ganymede spectral domain system at the central wavelength of 930 nm equipped with a 5 telecentric scan lens thorlabs lsm 03bb a time resolved oct investigation was performed at the scan frequency of 30 hz and serial static images were obtained to figure out the change in the thickness of the fouling layer during the soakage of the cleaning solution thickness was randomly measured at 20 different locations from oct images 2 6 afm analysis innova atomic force microscopy afm bruker santa barbara ca usa was conducted to measure the interfacial force between the foulants in the fouling layer developed on the membrane the interfacial force between foulants was measured with a commercial sin sharp tip cantilever bruker snl 10 santa barbara ca usa spring constant of 0 06 n m the virgin ro membranes and afm probe were coated with ha by the poly l lysine pll chemistry with the rinse method colville et al 2010 in the rinse method 0 01 wt of pll solution was placed on both membranes and the afm probe for 1 h to make the coated surface positively charged subsequently membranes and afm probe were then immersed in 20 mg c l of ha solution for 1 h to ha molecules on the membrane and afm probe the interaction between the ha coated tip and ha fouled ro membrane was assessed by merging the electrolyte solutions containing 8 5 mm nacl and 0 5 mm cacl2 to further investigate the effect of cleaning agents on the intermolecular adhesion force of ha each cleaning agent nacl naoh and if was added to the electrolyte solution at the same concentration as that used in the cleaning experiments the afm adhesion force measurements were performed in a fluid cell by the liquid drop merge method in the liquid drop merge method the test solutions were dropped on both the membrane surface sample and the fluid cell afm probe both the membrane and afm probe were equilibrated with the test solution for 30 min before force measurements were performed the afm was operated in a force mode with an approach retraction speed of 0 5 μm s and 0 5 μm of piezo movement the force measurements were conducted at four different locations and at least 15 measurements were taken at each location 2 7 analysis of membrane surface after each fouling and cleaning experiment each treated membrane was rinsed three times with di water and dried before further analysis the atr ftir spectra were recorded on a nicolet spectrometer model is50 thermo fisher scientific instrument usa with a resolution of 4 0 cm 1 in the range of 1800 400 cm 1 by the absorbance mode 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical cleaning efficiency of salt cleaning agents and if cleaning agent the optimal concentration of the if used in this study was chosen by comparing the cleaning efficiencies of if with different concentrations 0 01 m and 0 1 m the cleaning efficiencies of the electrolyte solution 0 01 m if and 0 1 m if against ha fouled bsa fouled and sa fouled membranes were compared text s1 fig s2 as a result 0 1 m if showed significantly pronounced cleaning efficiency than 0 01 m if against ha and bsa in contrast the cleaning efficiency of 0 1 m if had insignificant difference to that of 0 01 m against sa the increase in the cleaning efficiency with an increasing if concentration against ha and bsa implies that this chemical reaction is controlled by the stoichiometry between the if dose and the amount of organic fouling on the membrane surface thus later on in this study 0 1 m if was applied to control organic fouling before comparing the cleaning efficiency of if with other types of cleaning agents the effects of if on membrane performance water flux and salt permeability were evaluated through acceleration experiments by keeping the membrane in contact with the 0 1 m if solution for 3 days 10 days and 20 days which are identical to the 12 40 and 80 chemical cleanings fig s3 in the case of water flux fig s3 a compared to the virgin membrane 51 5 1 7 lmh those of membrane kept in contact with if for 3 days 10 days and 20 days were 52 1 1 9 lmh 52 7 2 3 lmh and 53 9 3 6 lmh respectively for salt permeability fig s3 b the virgin membrane showed 7 0 0 4 and those of the membrane stored in if solution were 7 2 0 4 7 1 0 5 and 7 4 0 9 respectively for 3 days 10 days and 20 days through the acceleration experiments 0 1 m if was proven to have negligible effect on the membrane performance for long term cycles of chemical cleaning in fig 1 a the decline in water flux by ha fouling and the flux recovery after chemical cleaning are presented the initial permeate flux at the given operating condition cross flow velocity 10 cm s applied pressure 7 bar with the electrolyte solution was 50 5 0 3 l m2 h in fig 1 b d the changes in the membrane fouling resistance after the chemical cleaning are presented and the cleaning efficiencies of identical molar concentrations 0 1 m of nacl or if against ha fouled 20 mg c l bsa fouled 100 mg c l and sa fouled 20 mg c l membranes respectively are compared the cleaning efficiency of each cleaning solution against ha fouling is shown in fig 1 b the intrinsic membrane resistance was 5 4 1013 m 1 2 4 1012 and the resistance of the ha fouled membrane was 1 4 1014 m 1 3 4 1012 after cleaning with 0 1 m nacl the fouling resistance became 8 3 1013 m 1 5 4 1012 and the cleaning efficiency calculated with the equation from section 2 4 was 64 in case of nacl cleaning lower efficiency was attributed to the limited ion exchange effects of salt cleaning agents with ha which consist mostly of hydrophobic moieties lee and elimelech 2007 however after cleaning by 0 l m if solution the membrane fouling resistance recovered to that of intrinsic membrane resistance 96 in a previous study ils were shown to have a strong binding strength with ha around 107 l kg 1 and moreover lignin which has a more complex molecular structure than ha does was proven to be dissolved up to 20 wt in ils wang et al 2012 by the aforementioned chemical characteristics of if against ha the fouling layer was shown to be controlled at the tested if concentration the effects of cleaning against bsa fouling were also investigated as presented in fig 1 c in the case of nacl cleaning the efficiency was 81 and this was due to the increased but limited protein solubility by the salting in effect of nacl corbatón báguena et al 2014 in contrast after if cleaning the membrane fouling resistance decreased significantly and the cleaning efficiency was 97 it was attributable to the superior solvation properties of ils which are widely used as solvents to dissolve denature or hydrolyze proteins or amino acids brogan and hallett 2016 alginate one of the representative polysaccharides in biofouling forms a stable complex of an egg box like structure in the presence of divalent cations especially ca2 in the feed solution lee et al 2006b for nacl cleaning as shown in fig 1 d the cleaning efficiency reached 88 and this was due to the lessening of the structural integrity of the alginate gel layer through the swelling induced by ion exchange between calcium ions and sodium ions lee and elimelech 2007 in the case of if it exhibited a slightly higher cleaning efficiency to that of nacl 94 which was likely due to the surpassing solvation properties of ils which were effective on the coordinative structure of typical saccharides such as chitin and sucrose shamshina et al 2014 comparing if cleaning with salt cleaning salt cleaning is efficient only with hydrophilic organic foulants such as sa while if cleaning was effective not only with sa but also with hydrophobic foulants such as ha and bsa 3 2 oct monitoring cross sectional scans and time resolved images of the fouled membranes in the middle of the chemical cleaning step were acquired at various frame rates using oct to obtain detailed information on the cleaning mechanism of the cleaning agents used in this study 0 1 m of if nacl and naoh oct analysis was typically implemented against ha fouling layer as sa and bsa fouling layers were not differentiated from that of the polyamide layer of the ro membrane in fig s4 oct observation of a virgin membrane shows bright upper parts less bright parts and dark parts and these were shown to be an active layer support layer and woven layer respectively the ha fouled membrane was prepared by a procedure identical to that described in the previous section thereafter a thin bright and uniform fouling layer was formed just above the active layer observed from oct images fig 2 presents the results of oct analysis and the thickness of the fouling layer during the soakage of the cleaning solution was compared compared to the thickness of the fouling layer before cleaning 50 4 7 5 μm only the negligible for salt cleaning 56 0 13 4 μm and partial for alkaline cleaning 98 3 15 7 μm disruption of the fouling layer were observed in the case of nacl cleaning oct images clearly showed that the fouling layer was hardly removed by salt cleaning which was consistent with the results presented in fig 1 b for alkaline cleaning with naoh the interface of the ha fouling layer became more porous during the soaking stage and further detached when cross flow was applied however a thin ha layer still remained on the membrane surface even after cleaning which implied incomplete cleaning on the other hand immediately after if was added the whole fouling layer was swollen or expanded in the soaking stage 250 0 22 6 μm moreover as the cross flow was applied on the membrane surface disruption of the fouling layer was clearly observed the cleaning mechanism of if used in this study was thought to be the swelling of the organic fouling layer by the intrusion of if into the fouling layer 3 3 afm analysis the effect of cleaning chemicals on the foulants foulants interactions in the fouling layer was analyzed by afm in the afm analysis following the oct analysis ha was used as the model organic foulants successful coating of ha on the probe and membrane via pll chemistry were confirmed by the stepwise analysis of the interactions through afm as shown in fig s5 the adhesion force between the afm probe and membrane was significantly increased when the probe was coated with pll 3 79 2 18 nn compared to that of the uncoated probe and membrane 0 54 0 51 nn due to the increased electrostatic interaction on the other hand when the pll coated probe was further coated with the ha the interaction between the probe and membrane 1 79 0 99 nn decreased slightly to further figure out the foulants foulants interaction in the ha fouling layer a virgin membrane was coated with ha and the strong adhesion 1 13 0 77 nn was present between the ha coated probe and ha fouled membrane thus strong foulant foulant interaction and much stronger foulant membrane interaction implies the difficulties of controlling organic fouling layers developed on membranes and foulants strongly bound to membrane surfaces therefore to control the organic fouling layer strongly bound by various interactions including quadrupole interactions the chemical cleaning agents should be capable of breaking those interactions in fig 3 the effect of cleaning agents on the intermolecular adhesion force of ha was analyzed by injecting 0 1 m of one of the following cleaning chemicals in the electrolyte solution 8 5 mm nacl 0 5 mm cacl2 nacl naoh or if between the ha coated probe and ha fouled membrane without the presence of cleaning agents fig 3 a substantial adhesive force 1 15 0 77 nn exists between the ha coated probe and ha fouled membrane when nacl was added to the solution chemistry fig 3 b there was strong adhesion between the ha coated probe and ha fouled membrane 1 19 0 68 nn therefore the poor cleaning efficiency of nacl against ha in fig 1 b was explained by this result that nacl did not diminish the interactions between ha molecules the effect of naoh on the reduction of the intermolecular adhesion force of ha was also investigated as seen in fig 3 c the adhesion force between the ha molecules was significantly reduced 0 68 0 67 nn even though the interaction between foulants was clearly reduced relatively large standard deviation implies that there were measurements with strong adhesion force remained after alkaline cleaning this result showed good agreement with the oct analysis finding that the ha fouling layer remained on the membrane surface after cleaning with naoh both the oct and afm analysis indicated that irreversible organic fouling could not be completely controlled through the hydrolysis and solubilisation by naoh when if was added to the electrolyte solution as a cleaning agent fig 3 d the interaction between ha was considerably reduced 0 64 0 41 nn in a previous study aromatic compounds which are the major constituents of ha had high solubility in the ils due to the favorable quadrupole interactions between the delocalized π system of the aromatic solutes and components of ils keaveney et al 2017 moreover in an md simulation analyzing the solubility of aromatic compounds by ils cations of ils were shown to be localized in the polar and equatorial positions of the π electron cloud of the aromatic ring which controls the solubility of aromatic compounds through quadrupole interactions shimizu et al 2009 in particular the imidazolium based ils used in this study were shown to have stronger interaction with the aromatic compounds as imidazolium is cation with aromatic ring cui et al 2017 this result agreed with the oct analysis finding that the ha fouling layer was swollen during if cleaning as the pre existing interaction between the ha molecules was disturbed by the strong quadrupole interactions existing between the cations with the aromatic ring of imidazolium based ils and π systems of organic foulants these superior solvating properties of if with strong quadrupole interaction was thought to be effective not only against ha but also against other organic foulants such as sa and bsa according to the results of chemical cleaning presented in fig 1 3 4 membrane surface characterizations by ft ir and afm to examine the changes in the residual substances on the membrane surface before and after cleaning ft ir spectra were analyzed as shown in fig 4 a c polyamide peaks around 1487 cm 1 and 1585 cm 1 were observed due to aromatic amide and these characteristic peaks disappeared due to the formation of the fouling layer on membrane surfaces as indicated by the black dashed lines in fig 4 tang et al 2009 the peaks at wavenumbers of 911 cm 1 and 1022 cm 1 indicate c h groups and aliphatic ether of ha respectively as shown in fig 4 a helal et al 2011 in fig 4 b the indicative peaks of bsa amides ⅰ 1643 cm 1 and amides ⅱ 1533 cm 1 are shown chatterjee and mukherjee 2014 the wave numbers representing sa at 1024 cm 1 1411 cm 1 and 1587 cm 1 in fig 4 c are an elongation of c o groups symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibration of coo groups respectively pereira et al 2011 in a previous study natural organic matter protein and polysaccharides remained on the membrane surface even after physical and chemical cleaning yu et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 specifically strong adsorption was observed at 1025 cm 1 c o aliphatic ether 1650 cm 1 n h amide ii and 1598 cm 1 coo symmetric carboxylate on the membrane after physical cleaning and these peaks were closely related to humic acid like protein like and polysaccharide like materials respectively lee et al 2006a yu et al 2010 these results agreed with the findings of this study that peaks remained at 1022 cm 1 for an ha fouled membrane and at 1643 cm 1 for a bsa fouled membrane after cleaning with nacl which implies limited interaction between salt cleaning agents with hydrophobic organic foulants the peak observed at 1587 cm 1 for the sa fouled membrane after naoh chemical cleaning indicated incomplete cleaning due to the poor interaction between alkaline cleaning agents with the gel like structure however after chemical cleaning with 0 1 m if the peaks denoting irreversible fouling were significantly reduced and the polyamide peaks 1487 cm 1 and 1585 cm 1 aromatic amide reappeared for all model foulants these results prove that the if cleaning agent was able to disintegrate irreversible membrane fouling by its strong quadrupole interaction with organic foulants in the fouling layer 3 5 synergetic cleaning efficiency of alkaline cleaning agents and if cleaning agent according to the findings of the oct and afm analysis the cleaning mechanisms of the naoh and if cleaning agents were dissimilar hydrolysis and solubilization for naoh and solvation followed by swelling for if therefore in this section as presented in fig 5 the cleaning effects of naoh alone 0 1 m and naoh together with if 0 05 m respectively were compared to evaluate the synergetic cleaning effects of if with naoh against model organic foulants the chemical stability of the imidazolium based ionic liquid used in this was known to be unstable at high temperatures 80 c or with a high concentration of oh 1 m wang et al 2017 ye and elabd 2011 as the cleaning with if was conducted at room temperature with a lower oh concentration 0 05 m the ionic liquid was in a stable condition on the other hand the effects of mixing naoh and if on the membrane performance i e water flux and salt permeability were evaluated through acceleration experiments by keeping the membrane in contact with the 0 05 m if 0 05 m naoh solution for 3 days 10 days and 20 days respectively which are identical to the 12 40 and 80 chemical cleanings fig s3 both the water flux and salt permeability of the membrane stored in naoh and if had a negligible effect on the membrane performance compared to the virgin membrane text s2 in the cases of ha and bsa fouling as seen in fig 5 a and 5 b the cleaning efficiencies of naoh alone were 95 and 97 respectively with the addition of if the cleaning efficiency improved to 99 for both foulants which implies the complete cleaning of the fouling layer by naoh with if for cleaning against sa as presented in fig 5 c the alkaline solution had a very low cleaning efficiency 74 which implies that the chemical reaction between naoh and the egg box like alginate calcium complexes was limited alkaline cleaning solutions show poor efficiency if there are strong cation π interactions especially when treating polysaccharide like organic foulants existing together with multivalent ions ang et al 2006 on the other hand when if was used together with naoh the cleaning efficiency increased to 95 which was comparable to the results of if cleaning presented in fig 1 d the results presented in this section indicate that the addition of if to naoh could significantly improve the cleaning efficiency by having different cleaning mechanisms especially for sa that develops a gel structure 3 6 chemical cleaning efficiency against wastewater effluent to assess the efficiency of cleaning agents i e 0 1 m nacl 0 1 m naoh and 0 05 m naoh 0 05 m if against irreversible membrane fouling tertiary wastewater effluent was used as a feed solution and fouling cleaning cycles were repeated five times as seen in fig 6 the cleaning efficiency of the 0 1 m nacl solution 61 9 2 1 46 2 0 1 34 3 0 0 29 1 0 1 and 24 4 0 3 and naoh solution 74 2 0 5 62 8 0 4 56 9 0 3 51 3 0 1 and 49 7 0 4 decreased rapidly after each cleaning cycle which indicates failure in controlling irreversible fouling on the other hand the addition of if to naoh improved the cleaning efficiency and the efficiency was maintained over cleaning cycles in comparison to those of salt and alkaline cleaning 76 5 1 7 70 3 0 3 65 4 0 9 62 0 0 0 and 60 3 0 3 when compared with the previous study that used 0 2 mm edta ph 10 5 and 10 mm sds ph 7 as the cleaning solution to control the fouling phenomenon in the ro membrane operating in treated wastewater the cleaning efficiency decreased rapidly after the fifth cleaning cycle 53 8 al ashhab et al 2017 in another study the cleaning efficiency of diluted naoh ph 12 and saturated urea 1 34 kg l were assessed with the ro operating against simulated brackish water the average recovery of the feed channel pressure drop was 35 and 41 for naoh and urea cleaning respectively in the cleaning cycles 4 to 6 sanawar et al 2021 however when if was added to the naoh against the membrane fouled with wastewater effluent the flux recovery was maintained to be higher than 60 even after the fifth cleaning cycle thus if was shown to have synergetic effects with naoh in mitigating irreversible membrane fouling these results demonstrate the applicability of if as an additive to currently used cleaning agents to control irreversible membrane fouling and moreover application of if which is known to be recycled by its negligible volatility will open the door for chemical cleaning not only by its efficiency but also for its environmental friendly characteristics 4 conclusions this study explored the potential application of if as a novel cleaning agent of ro membrane processes and a cleaning mechanism was proposed in comparison to salt cleaning agents if showed outstanding performance against ha and bsa and a comparable effect against sa the main cleaning mechanism of if proven by oct and afm analysis was the swelling of the fouling layer due to the weakened pre existing interactions between organic foulants by the intrusion of if into the fouling layer cation part of ils used in this study was imidazolium which has aromatic ring in its structure and thus strong quadrupole interaction involving cation π and π π interaction presumably exist between imidazolium based ils and π systems of organic foulants more interestingly the addition of if into naoh solution resulted in the significantly enhanced control of irreversible membrane fouling induced by model foulants and wastewater effluent consequently the supplementation of if with disparate cleaning mechanisms into the currently used cleaning agents would be a promising strategy for cleaning ro membranes that are subject to irreversible fouling by utilizing recyclable if with negligible volatility the usage of cleaning chemicals could be decreased and therefore environmental effects of membrane cleaning solutions could be minimized credit authorship contribution statement seung ju choi investigation formal analysis writing original draft sangsik kim methodology data

15541,removing ammonia nitrogen nh3 n from wastewater is of paramount importance for wastewater treatment in this study a novel continuous liquid plasma process clpd was evaluated to remove nh3 n from synthetic wastewater the box behnken experimental design was used to optimize the main process parameters including the initial nh3 n concentration 50 200 mg l power input 150 300 w and gas flow rate 1 5 2 5 l min for efficient nh3 n removal from wastewater the gas flow rate and power input were found to be significant factors affecting the removal efficiency of nh3 n whereas the initial concentration of nh3 n played a vital role in determining the energy efficiency of the process under the optimal conditions of an initial nh3 n concentration of 200 mg l applied power of 223 w and gas flow rate of 2 4 l min 98 91 of nh3 n could be removed with a n2 selectivity of 92 91 and the corresponding energy efficiency was 0 527 g kwh after 2 hrs of treatment a small fraction of undesirable no3 n 7 05 mg l and no2 n 2 83 mg l were also produced kinetic modeling revealed that nh3 n degradation by the clpd followed a pseudo first order reaction model with a rate constant k of 0 03522 min 1 optical emission spectroscopy oes was used to gather information about the active chemical species produced during the plasma discharge the obtained spectra revealed the presence of several highly

the second most produced chemical commodity after sulfuric acid ghavam et al 2021 and is widely used in industrial manufacturing processes including chemical fertilizer production petroleum refineries and metallurgy as a result it is a prevalent environmental pollutant that contributes significantly to water pollution problems huff et al 2013 ahmed and lan 2012 ammonia nitrogen nh3 n is used in measuring the quantity of ammonia ions present in water or waste solvents morris et al 2019 it includes both the non ionized nh3 and ionized form nh4 which are both ph and temperature dependent in aqueous solutions nh3 n generally exists as ammonium ions nh4 at ph below 8 whereas nh3 is the predominant form when the ph is above 9 75 zhang et al 2018 these two species of nh3 n are the most common source of nitrogen contamination in drinking water and the primary cause of eutrophication which is harmful to fish and other aquatic organisms capodaglio et al 2016 liu et al 2018 in response to these issues research on wastewater treatment technologies has increased significantly in recent years owing to stringent environmental regulatory requirements for the disposal of nitrogen containing compounds into receiving water systems biological treatment which consists of a combination of aerobic nitrification and anaerobic denitrification using specific types of microorganisms is the most commonly employed method for treating municipal and industrial wastewaters with low nh3 n concentrations 100 mg l cho et al 2020 winkler and straka 2019 shao and wu 2021 even though this process is cheap and relatively easy to implement it has limited flexibility and is generally difficult to control since it is readily inhibited by low dissolved oxygen high levels of toxic organics alcohols aldehydes and phenols fluctuations in ph low winter temperatures and high concentrations of nh3 n you et al 2020 furthermore the process sometimes requires the addition of methanol addition of pollutants due to a lack or shortage of carbon sources for the denitrification stage karri et al 2018 including large clarifiers and aeration tanks making it difficult to implement in areas where land is expensive or limited it also requires long treatment times 1 week and large volumes of sludge are often produced which requires further disposal akpor and muchie 2010 other physicochemical treatment technologies such as air stripping limoli et al 2016 struvite precipitation wu and vaneeckhaute 2021 ion exchange jorgensen and weatherley 2003 activated carbon fiber adsorption zheng et al 2016 and breakpoint chlorination shao and wu 2021 can also be used to reduce or remove nh3 n from wastewater however most of these technologies require the use of large quantities of chemicals and often produce harmful emissions or secondary contaminants consequently new wastewater treatment technology developments are needed to effectively remove nh3 n from wastewater sources over the years advanced oxidation processes aops such as photocatalysis electrolysis zheng et al 2020 peroxone process o3 h2o2 fenton processes uv based processes uv h2o2 and liquid phase plasma discharge have attracted a lot of attention as viable alternative options for wastewater treatment owing to the in situ generation of strong oxygen based oxidizers such as hydrogen peroxide h2o2 atomic oxygen o ozone o3 as well as hydroxyl radicals oh which is an excellent oxidant e 2 85 v that is able to degrade hazardous compounds in water jiang et al 2014 miklos et al 2018 among these liquid phase plasma discharge has emerged as the most suitable option for wastewater treatment due to its high efficiency simple operation low energy cost and ability to remove pollutants from highly contaminated effluents without producing any harmful gasses and toxic sludge magureanu et al 2011 plasma is generally formed by applying a high voltage discharge electric field between two electrodes one high voltage and one grounded schmidt et al 2015 in the gas liquid interface this generates a reactive environment of heat ultraviolet uv light shockwaves and multiple reactive chemical species such as oh o3 o h ho2 o2 h2 o2 h2o2 including hydrated electrons e aq that can react non selectively with the most pollutants in solution yang et al 2018 stratton et al 2015 numerous studies with a variety of electrical discharge plasma reactor types have demonstrated that plasma technology can efficiently remove a wide range of organic and inorganic contaminants in wastewater including 4 chlorophenol marković et al 2015 nitrophenols shang et al 2019 dyes li et al 2019 krosuri et al 2021 pesticides mousavi et al 2017 per fluorinated alkyl substances pfas singh et al 2019 volatile organic compounds vocs lu et al 2019 pharmaceuticals and personal care products magureanu et al 2018 guo et al 2020 however plasma based degradation studies of nh3 n removal from wastewater are very scarce to the best of the authors knowledge there are no studies on optimizing nh3 n removal from aqueous solutions by liquid phase plasma discharge using response surface methods rsm rsm is a set of statistical tools that can be used for process design and optimization by evaluating the interactive effects of various process parameters on a particular response variable under investigation the use of such statistical tools for optimizing process variables is essential for the efficient use of time and resources therefore the primary objective of this work was to fill this knowledge gap by using rsm to determine the effects of the primary operating variables including initial nh3 n concentration power and gas flow rate on the removal of ammonia from synthetic aqueous solutions treated by liquid phase plasma technology the optimal operating conditions for maximum nh3 n removal were also determined and an empirical model correlating the nh3 n removal efficiency to the three variables was then developed it is also the first time that a continuous flow plasma reactor with wastewater recirculation has been used to degrade remove nh3 n from aqueous solutions 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and experimental setup the simulated nh3 n contaminated wastewater 50 125 and 200 mgl 1 nh3 n used in this study was prepared by dissolving specific amounts of nh4cl sigma aldrich into

tektronix tbs1052b beaverton or a masterflex peristaltic pump cole parmer vernon hills il was used to circulate the nh3 solution from a 500 ml flask to the reactor core at a fixed rate of 100 ml min the plasma treatment was carried out with pure oxygen 99 99 that was injected into the discharge zone through a gas inlet tube at constant predetermined flow rates using a regulator and a mass flow controller c100l sierra instruments monterey ca oxygen was used as a working gas to increase the formation of oxidative radicals to enhance the degradation of nh3 n all exhaust gasses generated during experimentation were channeled to a fume hood via a flexible gas hose 2 2 experimental design and model development a three factor three level box behnken design bbd was used to determine the effects

analysed by analysis of variance anova and all the terms in the model were assessed at a 95 confidence level of the p value 2 3 desirability function the desirability function was used to simultaneously obtain the optimum values of all independent variables during the optimization process using the fitted model each predicted response is transformed into an individual desirability function di derringer and suich 1980 the overall desirability function d is obtained by combining the individual desirability scores for the predicted values of each dependent variable using a geometrical mean function which can be expressed as jeong and kim 2009 3 d i 1 n d i 1 n where n is the number of responses the desirability of the function varies from 0 to 1 with the latter value being the most desired response 2 4 kinetic modeling during each run samples 5 ml were collected at 20 min intervals from the effluent streams of the reactor and analyzed to determine the changes in ph values conductivity the concentration of nh3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n the rate of nh3 n decomposition was evaluated according to a pseudo first order kinetic model as

the various chemical species present within the plasma and their electron excitation during treatment of the nh3 solutions uv visible spectra of the discharge emissions in the wavelength range from 200 to 1100 nm were acquired simultaneously using an optical spectrometer ocean optics hdx uv vis which consists of a detector connected to a lens via fiber optic cable and laptop computer 3 results and discussion 3 1 regression analysis for liquid phase plasma activity on nh3 n removal in this study the removal of nh3 n from aqueous solutions was investigated using a continuous flow liquid plasma discharge reactor the effects of process variables such as nh3 n concentration 50 200 mg l power input 150 300 w and gas flow rate 0 5 2 5 l min on the nh3 n removal efficiency were investigated using rsm according to the bbd the design matrix of the variables by bbd experimental design together with the predicted and experimental values of the responses i e nh3 n degradation energy efficiency and specific energy input multiple regression models linear interactive quadratic and cubic were used to analyze the experimental data and the significance of the regression coefficients was determined using the f test table 2 results from the model summary statistics and lack of fit test revealed that the quadratic model provided the best fit to the experimental data as a result the quadratic model was chosen for further analysis 3 2 quantitative effects of operational parameters on nh3 n removal the empirical relationship between response and variables was obtained from bbd analysis using multiple regression analysis the response function coefficients which represent the effects of each factor as well as their interactive effects on nh3 n degradation no3 n and no2 n production as well as the energy efficiency of the system are presented in eqs 10 11 12 and 13 respectively 10 y n h 3 n 97 69 8 776 a 2 798 b 1 1913 c 1 6 a b 0 453 a c 1 25 b c 5 3615 a 2 3

0027 c 2 the terms with positive signs indicated an interactive effect of the variables while those with negative signs represent an antagonistic effect of variables the larger coefficient value of each factor indicated the magnitude of its effect on a given response variable from eq 10 it could be seen from the coefficients that the air flow rate a and the amount of power input b together with the interaction between the air flow rate and initial nh3 n concentration ac exerted a significant positive linear effect in contrast the initial nh3 n concentration c and the remaining model terms exerted negative linear effects on nh3 n removal the nh3 n decomposition efficiency increased with a corresponding increase in gas flow rate a similar trend was also observed for the power input b which had a moderate effect on the efficiency of nh3 n decomposition while the conversion efficiency of nh3 n decreased slightly with an increase in initial nh3 n concentration a similar observation was reported by fan et al 2021 who investigated the effects of discharge voltage gas flow rate initial nh3 n concentration and ph on nh3 n removal from wastewater using a non thermal plasma reactor combined with a fixed quantity of zeolite particles of various sizes the authors found that the removal efficiency of nh3 n rose from 69 97 to 80 75 when the power input was raised from 2 2 kv to 2 6 kv a linear rise in nh3 n removal efficiency was also observed when the oxygen flow rate was increased from 0 5 l min to 1 0 l min after 30 min of treatment however gas flow rates over 1 l min had a negative effect on nh3 n removal which means that the clpd system described in this study is a much more superior design as the system can operate in stable condition at gas flow rates over 2 5 l min in general increasing the power input results in an increase in energy which generates high energy electrons ultraviolet rays and shock waves bashir et al 2021 wang et al 2010 thus more oxygen gas molecules passing through the discharge zone of the reactor as a result of an increase in gas flow rate would lead to higher dissociation rates of oxygen molecules more active species are produced as a result which increases the oxidation of pollutants krosuri et al 2021 in this study the efficiency of nh3 n decomposition ranged from 75 43 to 100 whereas the selectivity for gaseous nitrogen products ranged from 41 11 and 95 25 the production of undesirable by products no3 n and no2 n was mainly influenced by the power input b followed by the initial concentration of nh3 n c as shown in eqs 11 12 and fig 2 the generation of no3 n and no2 n increased linearly with these two factors whereas the gas flow rate had the opposite effect the amount of no3 n and no2 n produced ranged from 1 37 to 13 74 mg l and 0 664 to 4 202 mg l respectively the amount of nh3 n degraded per unit of energy consumed is a better indicator of the overall efficiency of the process from the coefficients in eq 13 it can be seen that the energy efficiency of the clpd system was mainly influenced by the initial nh3 n concentration and gas flow rate the results indicated that the energy efficiency increased linearly with a corresponding increase in initial nh3 n concentration but decreased steeply with sei this observation was probably due to the fact that as the sei increases the density of electrons in the discharge zone increases resulting in more electron atom molecule interactions and generation of more reactive species nonetheless it is possible that a large fraction of the electrons that are generated do not participate in the reaction and their energy is wasted thus reducing the energy yield of the process at high power levels the lowest energy efficiency obtained was 0 099 g kwh for 50 mg l nh3 n at 300 w and 1 5 l min gas flow rate with a sei of 12 kj l while the best energy yield was 0 7252 g kwh for 200 mg l nh3 n at 150 w and 1 5 l min gas flow rate with a sei of 6 kj l more nh3 n molecules participated in reaction when the initial concentration of nh3 n increased from 50 to 200 mg l therefore a much higher energy efficiency was obtained at high initial concentration of nh3 n the significance and adequacy of the quadratic model to accurately predict the nh3 n degradation process was validated using anova the detailed anova results are presented in table 3 the model s fisher s f value was 64 69 and its p value was less than 0 0001 which implies that the model is significant p values from t tests were also used to validate the significance of each coefficient in the model a p value less than 0 05 suggests that the various terms in the model are significant niazi et al 2015 thus the linear effect of coefficients a b and c i e gas flow rate p 0 0001 power p 0 0004 and initial nh3 n conc p 0 0290 are significant similarly among binary interactions the interactive effect of gas flow rate and power input p 0 0494 including p values for the quadratic terms a2 p 0 0001 and b2 p 0 0012 are also significant this implies that minor changes in the values of these variables will affect the nh3 n removal efficiency whereas model terms greater than 0 05 are not significant therefore c2 p 0 4706 ac p 0 4863 and bc p 0 0817 interaction model terms have no significant impact on the nh3 n removal efficiency the model s coefficient of determination r2 was 0 988 much closer to unity which reflected a good fit between the values predicted by the model and the experimental data fig 3 in other words the proposed quadratic model can describe 98 8 of the nh3 n degradation eq 10 furthermore the predicted r² 0 988 agreed reasonably well with the adjusted r² 0 973 the difference is less than 0 2 indicating that the quadratic model could adequately explain the relationship between the operating parameters and the percentage of nh3 n removal the lack of fit metric assesses the model s ability to describe data in the experimental domain at points that are not covered by the regression the non significant p 0 05 lack of fit relative to pure error suggested that the quadratic model satisfactorily explained the removal of nh3 n by the liquid plasma discharge system with a 95 confidence level the adequate precision which measures the signal to noise ratio was 26 775 this value together with the low coefficient of variation cv 1 32 and standard deviation sd 1 23 indicated that the experiments were highly accurate and reliable the relationship between all variables was further elucidated using response surface plots 3 3 interaction effects of model parameters to demonstrate the interactions among model parameters three dimensional 3d response surface plots were created and presented in fig 4 candioti et al 2014 the plots were generated by varying two independent variables within experimental ranges while keeping the third variable at the central point the interaction of ab had a significant influence on nh3 n decomposition with a p value 0 0494 while the binary interaction bc had the most impact p 0 0001 on the energy efficiency of the process fig 4 a showed the combined effect of gas flow rate and power on nh3 n removal efficiency while the initial concentration of nh3 n was kept constant it was observed that nh3 n degradation increased 95 100 with a correspondent increase in power input and gas flow rates between 1 5 and 2 5 l min fig 4 b shows the interactive effect between the power input and initial concentration of nh3 n on the energy efficiency of the process the response surface plot indicates that a low applied power and a high initial concentration of nh3 n are favourable increasing energy efficiency the high p value 0 05 of bc in table 3 also supports this moreover compared with the applied power the initial nh3 n concentration has a greater impact on the energy efficiency as evidenced by the sharp increase to when the concentration increases from 50 mg l to 200 mg l 3 4 multi response desirability optimization and model validation the goal of optimization is to determine the optimal values for the process parameters needed to maximize the percentage of nh3 n removal while reducing no2 n and no3 n generation as well as power consumption multi objective numerical optimization was executed using the desirability function in design expert v13 software by selecting specific constraints i e none maximum minimum target or in range for all the variables and responses all variables and responses were set within range while the percentage of nh3 n degradation and total nitrogen production were set at maximum forty three solutions were found that contained different levels of independent variables the solution with a maximum desirability value of 1 0 was selected as the optimized condition the optimized results obtained from the ramp functions at maximum desirability were presented in fig 5 the predicted conditions were gas flow rate 2 4 l min power 223 w reaction time 2 hrs for achieving 99 9 nh3 n removal with a concurrent production of 7 915 mg l and 1 979 mg l of no3 n and no2 n respectively the specific energy input is 5 1 kj l with a predicted energy yield of 0 55 g kwh in order to validate the predictive capability of the model two additional experiments were carried out using the optimal settings specified by the model the mean values of the experimental response were 98 91 nh3 n decomposition 92 91 nitrogen production 7 05 mg l no3 n and 2 83 mg l of no2 n the energy efficiency was 0 527 g kwh the results obtained were reasonably close to the predicted values and the experimental data mean was well within the 95 prediction interval pi table 4 hence the model validation was successfully completed 3 5 kinetics of ammonia oxidation process fig 6 shows the concentration profiles of nh3 n no3 n and no2 n that remained in the treated solution after 120 mins of treatment it is evident that a significant amount of nitrogen was lost from the system into the gas phase majorly as n2 gas this loss of nitrogen from the system was estimated from the total nitrogen mass balance eq 7 it was observed that the concentration of nh3 n decreased as a function of time during the plasma treatment and only a small fraction of no3 n and no2 n were produced at first the concentration of nh3 n decreased from 200 mg l c0 to 35 7 mg l after 1 hr which accounted for up to 77 8 nitrogen production efficiency the amount of no2 n and no3 n produced was 3 44 mg l and 3 97 mg l respectively after another hour of treatment the n2 production efficiency increased from 77 8 to 92 5 while the nh3 n conversion efficiency of the system increased from 81 8 to 98 21 the final amount of no2 n and no3 n were 3 26 and 6 51 mg l respectively it has been reported that no2 can react with nh4 to produce n2 and or be oxidized to no3 by oxygen gas this was probably the reason why the final concentration of no2 n was lower than that of no3 n lousteau et al 2015 the energy yield decreased as the nh3 n degradation efficiency increased this makes sense because as the nh3 n is progressively degraded less and less of the energy input is used for nh3 n removal as there is less of it at the later stage of the process the kinetic behavior of the reaction was established by fitting the nh3 n concentration profile over time to various kinetic models it was found that the decomposition of nh3 n by the clpd system was best described by a pseudo first order kinetic model as shown in fig 7 using a linearized least squares method the reaction rate constant was 0 03522 min 1 the variation of ln ci ct versus time followed a straight line pattern with a good correlation coefficient value r2 0 986 indicating that the pseudo first order kinetic model was appropriate to describe the degradation of nh3 n by the clpd process there are two forms of nh3 n in an aqueous solution free ammonia nh3 and ammonium ion nh4 both of which are usually in equilibrium according to the following expressions 14 n h 4 n h 3 h p k a 9 25 a t 25 c 15 k n h 3 h n h 4 the composition ratio of nh3 to nh4 depends on the ph and temperature of the solution the higher the ph value the larger the fraction of nh3 is which is more volatile conversely the proportion of ammonium ion is higher with a lower ph value at ph 7 nh3 n exists mainly in the form of nh4 while more than 90 is free ammonia when the ph is over 11 luo et al 2015 in this study the temperature of the nh3 solution initially at 25 c increased gradually with time and reached a steady state value of 60 c within 10 mins during the course of treatment the ph increased linearly over time from a mean value of 4 62 to 7 68 while the electrical conductivity changed from 2 2 to 2 7 ms cm as shown in fig 8 the increase in ph was probably due to the formation of oh ions and other active species from the ionization of water molecules since the reaction proceeded under acidic to neutral conditions the nh3 n was most likely present as the salt form nh4 which would not be stripped off by the gas phase this meant that the nh3 n removal was actually catalyzed by the active chemical species generated by the plasma discharge in the clpd system 3 6 possible reaction mechanisms for ammonia oxidation by liquid phase plasma discharge in liquid phase plasma discharge free electrons gain energy from the electric field generated between the discharge and ground electrodes resulting in high energy electrons these high energy electrons can interact with oxygen water molecules and other ionic compounds in the aqueous phase to initiate various physical and chemical reactions these processes may generate shock waves reactive chemical species such as oh o h h2 o2 h2o2 and intense ultraviolet uv radiation which can be detected as a spectrum of emitted light photons by optical emission spectroscopy oes augugliaro et al 2012 this spectrum of plasma emitted radiation is grated and the intensity is measured as a function of the wavelength devia et al 2015 the spectra obtained in this study were analyzed using the national institute of standards and technology atomic spectra database kramida et al 2021 including other published works misra et al 2014 to identify the various active chemical species present in the reactor during operation fig 9 shows the relative intensity of the optical emission spectra observed in the clpd system from oxygen gas flow rate 2 5 l min at different power input levels 300 w and 225 w respectively the magnitude of the emission intensity lines provides a qualitative indicator of chemical species concentration in the optical emission the results showed that the relative intensity of oes was strongly influenced by the magnitude of the discharge voltage for example an increase in power input from 225 w vrms 9 2 kv irms 9 08 ma to 300 w vrms 10 4 kv irms 11 2 ma resulted in a significant increase in the density intensity of the transition lines of all active radicals and ionic species this observation could be ascribed to the fact that stronger electric fields are produced when the power is increased and as a result collisions of high energy electron with oxygen molecules accelerates the generation of active radicals through ionization resulting in more light emissions the discharge produced a significant uv radiation that was clearly visible to the naked eye and was dominated by atomic oxygen lines at 777 04 and 844 14 nm which correspond to atomic transition 3p5p 3s5s and 3p3p 3s3s respectively these transitions arise from the decay of various excited states of oxygen atoms in addition molecular bands corresponding to transitions in the first negative system of the o2 ions b4σg a4πu as well as hydrogen atoms hα 3s 2p were found at 559 6 and 659 nm respectively the oh emission from the electronic transition of a2σ x2π with a band head at 310 2 nm was also visible for the oxygen plasma discharge these excited states can be generated due to both energetic electron impact excitation of oxygen atoms and energetic electron impact dissociation or penning ionization of o2 nh3 oh h2o2 and h2o molecules abbasi firouzjah et al 2013 malik et al 2001 the emission spectra obtained from this study are consistent with the results from other studies conducted by different research groups abbasi firouzjah et al 2013 rybkin et al 2008 lock et al 2011 o2 and oh molecules are the most important reactive species that are frequently generated by the plasma treatment of aqueous solutions they can oxidize most organic and inorganic compounds they come in contact with and are the primary source of hydrogen peroxide in plasma systems joshi et al 1995 during plasma

liquid phase plasma discharge process the effects of various plasma operating parameters including discharge power gas flow rate and initial concentration of nh3 n on the nh3 n removal efficiency as well as the binary interactions between these parameters were investigated using the box behnken experimental design of rsm all three independent variables were effective in the nh3 n degradation among them the gas flow rate was found to be the most significant parameter with a more pronounced effect the second order polynomial regression model fitted the experimental data points well with high correlation coefficients r2 98 8 and adjusted r2 97 3 the maximum efficiency of nh3 n removal was found to be 98 91 with n2 selectivity of 92 91 under optimal conditions i e initial nh3 n concentration of 200 mg l 223 w and gas flow rate of 2 4 l min these optimized conditions were very close to the mean values predicted by the model and were shown to be feasible through verification experiments performed in duplicate the removal of nh3 n by the clpd followed pseudo first order kinetics although the evolution of n2 was not tested it was assumed to be the primary end product as only small amounts of by products including no3 n and no2 n were found in the treated effluent the possible nh3 n degradation pathways have been suggested based on the identification of the intermediates in the liquid phase and plasma discharge plume using optical emission spectrometry this study demonstrates that plasma technology is a promising alternative for the effective removal of high concentrations of nh3 n from aqueous solutions the reactor is simple eco friendly and less expensive to build and operate another distinct advantage is that this technology can be easily integrated with other technologies however overall costs for implementing such a process still need to be established further research is now underway to improve the process kinetics and energy

15541,removing ammonia nitrogen nh3 n from wastewater is of paramount importance for wastewater treatment in this study a novel continuous liquid plasma process clpd was evaluated to remove nh3 n from synthetic wastewater the box behnken experimental design was used to optimize the main process parameters including the initial nh3 n concentration 50 200 mg l power input 150 300 w and gas flow rate 1 5 2 5 l min for efficient nh3 n removal from wastewater the gas flow rate and power input were found to be significant factors affecting the removal efficiency of nh3 n whereas the initial concentration of nh3 n played a vital role in determining the energy efficiency of the process under the optimal conditions of an initial nh3 n concentration of 200 mg l applied power of 223 w and gas flow rate of 2 4 l min 98 91 of nh3 n could be removed with a n2 selectivity of 92 91 and the corresponding energy efficiency was 0 527 g kwh after 2 hrs of treatment a small fraction of undesirable no3 n 7 05 mg l and no2 n 2 83 mg l were also produced kinetic modeling revealed that nh3 n degradation by the clpd followed a pseudo first order reaction model with a rate constant k of 0 03522 min 1

the second most produced chemical commodity after sulfuric acid ghavam et al 2021 and is widely used in industrial manufacturing processes including chemical fertilizer production petroleum refineries and metallurgy as a result it is a prevalent environmental pollutant that contributes significantly to water pollution problems huff et al 2013 ahmed and lan 2012 ammonia nitrogen nh3 n is used in measuring the quantity of ammonia ions present in water or waste solvents morris et al 2019 it includes both the non ionized nh3 and ionized form nh4 which are both ph and temperature dependent in aqueous solutions nh3 n generally exists as ammonium ions nh4 at ph below 8 whereas nh3 is the predominant form when the ph is above 9 75 zhang et al 2018 these two species of nh3 n are the most common source of nitrogen contamination in drinking water and the primary cause of eutrophication which is harmful to fish and other aquatic organisms capodaglio et al 2016 liu et al 2018 in response to these issues research on wastewater treatment technologies has increased significantly in recent years owing to stringent environmental regulatory requirements for the disposal of nitrogen containing compounds into receiving water systems biological treatment which consists of a combination of aerobic nitrification and anaerobic denitrification using specific types of microorganisms is the most commonly employed method for treating municipal and industrial wastewaters with low nh3 n concentrations 100 mg l cho et al 2020 winkler and straka 2019 shao and wu 2021 even though this process is cheap and relatively easy to implement it has limited flexibility and is generally difficult to control since it is readily inhibited by low dissolved oxygen high levels of toxic organics alcohols aldehydes and phenols fluctuations in ph low winter temperatures and high concentrations of nh3 n you et al 2020 furthermore the process sometimes requires the addition of methanol addition of pollutants due to a lack or shortage of carbon sources for the denitrification stage karri et al 2018 including large clarifiers and aeration tanks making it difficult to implement in areas where land is expensive or limited it also requires long treatment times 1 week and large volumes of sludge are often produced which requires further disposal akpor and muchie 2010 other physicochemical treatment technologies such as air stripping limoli et al 2016 struvite precipitation wu and vaneeckhaute 2021 ion exchange jorgensen and weatherley 2003 activated carbon fiber adsorption zheng et al 2016 and breakpoint chlorination shao and wu 2021 can also be used to reduce or remove nh3 n from wastewater however most of these technologies require the use of large quantities of chemicals and often produce harmful emissions or secondary contaminants consequently new wastewater treatment technology developments are needed to effectively remove nh3 n from wastewater sources over the years advanced oxidation processes aops such as photocatalysis electrolysis zheng et al 2020 peroxone process o3 h2o2 fenton processes uv based processes uv h2o2 and liquid phase plasma discharge have attracted a lot of attention as viable alternative options for wastewater treatment owing to the in situ generation of strong oxygen based oxidizers such as hydrogen peroxide h2o2 atomic oxygen o ozone o3 as well as hydroxyl radicals oh which is an excellent oxidant e 2 85 v that is able to degrade hazardous compounds in water jiang et al 2014 miklos et al 2018 among these liquid phase plasma discharge has emerged as the most suitable option for wastewater treatment due to its high efficiency simple operation low energy cost and ability to remove pollutants from highly contaminated effluents without producing any harmful gasses and toxic sludge magureanu et al 2011 plasma is generally formed by applying a high voltage discharge electric field between two electrodes one high

electrical discharge plasma reactor types have demonstrated that plasma technology can efficiently remove a wide range of organic and inorganic contaminants in wastewater including 4 chlorophenol

vocs lu et al 2019 pharmaceuticals and personal care products magureanu et al 2018 guo et al 2020 however plasma based degradation studies of nh3 n removal from wastewater are very scarce to the best of the authors knowledge there are no studies on optimizing nh3 n removal from aqueous solutions by liquid phase plasma discharge using response surface methods rsm rsm is a set of statistical tools that can be used for process design and optimization by evaluating the interactive effects of various process parameters on a particular response variable under investigation the use of such statistical tools for optimizing process variables is essential for the efficient use of time and resources therefore the primary objective of this work was to fill this knowledge gap by using rsm to determine the effects of the primary operating variables including initial nh3 n concentration power and gas flow rate on the removal of ammonia from synthetic aqueous solutions treated by liquid phase plasma technology the optimal operating conditions for maximum nh3 n removal were also determined and an empirical model correlating the nh3 n removal efficiency to the three variables was then developed it is also the first time that a continuous flow plasma reactor with wastewater recirculation has been used to degrade remove nh3 n from aqueous solutions 2 materials and methods 2 1

controller c100l sierra instruments monterey ca oxygen was used as a working gas to increase the formation of oxidative radicals to enhance the degradation of nh3 n all exhaust gasses generated during experimentation were channeled to a fume hood via a flexible gas hose 2 2 experimental design and model development a three factor three level box behnken design bbd was used to determine the effects

being the most desired response 2 4 kinetic modeling during each run samples 5 ml were collected at 20 min intervals from the effluent streams of the reactor and analyzed to determine the changes in ph values conductivity the concentration of nh3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n the rate of nh3 n decomposition was evaluated according to a pseudo first order kinetic model as

and discussion 3 1 regression analysis for liquid phase plasma activity on nh3 n removal in this study the removal of nh3 n from aqueous solutions was investigated using a continuous flow liquid plasma discharge reactor the effects of process variables such as nh3 n concentration 50 200 mg l power input 150 300 w and gas flow rate 0 5 2 5 l min on the nh3 n removal efficiency were investigated using rsm according to the bbd the design matrix of the variables by bbd experimental design together with the predicted and experimental values of the responses i e nh3 n degradation energy efficiency and specific energy input multiple regression models linear interactive quadratic and cubic were used to analyze the experimental data and the significance of the regression coefficients was determined using the f test table 2 results from the model summary statistics and lack of fit test revealed that the quadratic model provided the best fit to the experimental data as a result the quadratic model was chosen for further analysis 3 2 quantitative effects of operational parameters on nh3 n removal the empirical relationship between response and variables was obtained from bbd analysis using multiple regression analysis the response function coefficients which represent the effects of each factor as well as their interactive effects on nh3 n degradation no3 n and no2 n production as well as the energy efficiency of the system are presented in eqs 10 11 12 and 13 respectively 10 y n h 3 n 97 69 8 776 a 2 798 b 1 1913 c 1 6 a b 0 453 a c 1 25 b c 5 3615 a 2 3

0027 c 2 the terms with positive signs indicated an interactive effect of the variables while those with negative signs represent an antagonistic effect of variables the larger coefficient value of each factor indicated the magnitude of its effect on a given response variable from eq 10 it could be seen from the coefficients that the air flow rate a and the amount of power input b together with the interaction between the air flow rate and initial nh3 n concentration ac exerted a significant positive linear effect in contrast the initial nh3 n concentration c and the remaining model terms exerted negative linear effects on nh3 n removal the nh3 n decomposition efficiency increased with a corresponding increase in gas flow rate a similar trend was also observed for the power input b which had a moderate effect on the efficiency of nh3 n decomposition while the conversion efficiency of nh3 n decreased slightly with an increase in initial nh3 n concentration a similar observation was reported by fan et al 2021 who investigated the effects of discharge voltage gas flow rate initial nh3 n concentration and ph on nh3 n removal from wastewater using a non thermal plasma reactor combined with a fixed quantity of zeolite particles of various sizes the authors found that the removal efficiency of nh3 n rose from 69 97 to 80 75 when the power input was raised from 2 2 kv to 2 6 kv a linear rise in nh3 n removal efficiency was also observed when the oxygen flow rate was increased from 0 5 l min to 1 0 l min after 30 min of treatment however gas flow rates over 1 l min had a negative effect on nh3 n removal which means that the clpd system described in this study is a much more superior design as the system can operate in stable condition at gas flow rates over 2 5 l min in general increasing the power input results in an increase in energy which generates high energy electrons ultraviolet rays and shock waves bashir et al 2021 wang et al 2010 thus more oxygen gas molecules passing through the discharge zone of the reactor as a result of an increase in gas flow rate would lead to higher dissociation rates of oxygen molecules more active species are produced as a result which increases the oxidation of pollutants krosuri et al 2021 in this study the efficiency of nh3 n decomposition ranged from 75 43 to 100 whereas the selectivity for gaseous nitrogen products ranged from 41 11 and 95 25 the production of undesirable by products no3 n and no2 n was mainly influenced by the power input b followed by the initial concentration of nh3 n c as shown in eqs 11 12 and fig 2 the generation of no3 n and no2 n increased linearly with these two factors whereas the gas flow rate had the opposite effect the amount of no3 n and no2 n produced ranged from 1 37 to 13 74 mg l and 0 664 to 4 202 mg l respectively the amount of nh3 n degraded per unit of energy consumed is a better indicator of the overall efficiency of the process from the coefficients in eq 13 it can be seen that the energy efficiency of the clpd system was mainly influenced by the initial nh3 n concentration and gas flow rate the results indicated that the energy efficiency increased linearly with a corresponding increase in initial nh3 n concentration but decreased steeply with sei this observation was probably due to the fact that as the sei increases the density of electrons in the discharge zone increases resulting in more electron atom molecule interactions and generation of more reactive species nonetheless it is possible that a large fraction of the electrons that are generated do not participate in the reaction and their energy is wasted thus reducing the energy yield of the process at high power levels the lowest energy efficiency obtained was 0 099 g kwh for 50 mg l nh3 n at 300 w and 1 5 l min gas flow rate with a sei of 12 kj l while the best energy yield was 0 7252 g kwh for 200 mg l nh3 n at 150 w and 1 5 l min gas flow rate with a sei of 6 kj l more nh3 n molecules participated in reaction when the initial concentration of nh3 n increased from 50 to 200 mg l therefore a much higher energy efficiency was obtained at high initial concentration of nh3 n the significance and adequacy of the quadratic model to accurately predict the nh3 n degradation process was validated using anova the detailed anova results are presented in table 3 the model s fisher s f value was 64 69 and its p value was less than 0 0001 which implies that the model is significant p values from t tests were also used to validate the significance of each coefficient in the model a p value less than 0 05 suggests that the various terms in the model are significant niazi et al 2015 thus the linear effect of coefficients a b and c i e gas flow rate p 0 0001 power p 0 0004 and initial nh3 n conc p 0 0290 are significant similarly among binary interactions the interactive effect of gas flow rate and power input p 0 0494 including p values for the quadratic terms a2 p 0 0001 and b2 p 0 0012 are also significant this implies that minor changes in the values of these variables will affect the nh3 n removal efficiency whereas model terms greater than 0 05 are not significant therefore c2 p 0 4706 ac p 0 4863 and bc p 0 0817 interaction model terms have no significant impact on the nh3 n removal efficiency the model s coefficient of determination r2 was 0 988 much closer to unity which reflected a good fit between the values predicted by the model and the experimental data fig 3 in other words the proposed quadratic model can describe 98 8 of the nh3 n degradation eq 10 furthermore the predicted r² 0 988 agreed reasonably well with the adjusted r² 0 973 the difference is less than 0 2 indicating that the quadratic model could adequately explain the relationship between the operating parameters and the percentage of nh3 n removal the lack of fit metric assesses the model s ability to describe data in the experimental domain at points that are not covered by the regression the non significant p 0 05 lack of fit relative to pure error suggested that the quadratic model satisfactorily explained the removal of nh3 n by the liquid plasma discharge system with a 95 confidence level the adequate precision which measures the signal to noise ratio was 26 775 this value together with the low coefficient of variation cv 1 32 and standard deviation sd 1 23 indicated that the experiments were highly accurate and reliable the relationship between all variables was further elucidated using response surface plots 3 3 interaction effects of model parameters to demonstrate the interactions among model parameters three dimensional 3d response surface plots were created and presented in fig 4 candioti et al 2014 the plots were generated by varying two independent variables within experimental ranges while keeping the third variable at the central point the interaction of ab had a significant influence on nh3 n decomposition with a p value 0 0494 while the binary interaction bc had the most impact p 0 0001 on the energy efficiency of the process fig 4 a showed the combined effect of gas flow rate and power on nh3 n removal efficiency while the initial concentration of nh3 n was kept constant it was observed that nh3 n degradation increased 95 100 with a correspondent increase in power input and gas flow rates between 1 5 and 2 5 l min fig 4 b shows the interactive effect between the power input and initial concentration of nh3 n on the energy efficiency of the process the response surface plot indicates that a low applied power and a high initial concentration of nh3 n are favourable increasing energy efficiency the high p value 0 05 of bc in table 3 also supports this moreover compared with the applied power the initial nh3 n concentration has a greater impact on the energy efficiency as evidenced by the sharp increase to when the concentration increases from 50 mg l to 200 mg l 3 4 multi response desirability optimization and model validation the goal of optimization is to determine the optimal values for the process parameters needed to maximize the percentage of nh3 n removal while reducing no2 n and no3 n generation as well as power consumption multi objective numerical optimization was executed using the desirability function in design expert v13 software by selecting specific constraints i e none maximum minimum target or in range for all the variables and responses all variables and responses were set within range while the percentage of nh3 n degradation and total nitrogen production were set at maximum forty three solutions were found that contained different levels of independent variables the solution with a maximum desirability value of 1 0 was selected as the optimized condition the optimized results obtained from the ramp functions at maximum desirability were presented in fig 5 the predicted conditions were gas flow rate 2 4 l min power 223 w reaction time 2 hrs for achieving 99 9 nh3 n removal with a concurrent production of 7 915 mg l and 1 979 mg l of no3 n and no2 n respectively the specific energy input is 5 1 kj l with a predicted energy yield of 0 55 g kwh in order to validate the predictive capability of the model two additional experiments were carried out using the optimal settings specified by the model the mean values of the experimental response were 98 91 nh3 n decomposition 92 91 nitrogen production 7 05 mg l no3 n and 2 83 mg l of no2 n the energy efficiency was 0 527 g kwh the results obtained were reasonably close to the predicted values and the experimental data mean was well within the 95 prediction interval pi table 4 hence the model validation was successfully completed 3 5 kinetics of ammonia oxidation process fig 6 shows the concentration profiles of nh3 n no3 n and no2 n that remained in the treated solution after 120 mins of treatment it is evident that a significant amount of nitrogen was lost from the system into the gas phase majorly as n2 gas this loss of nitrogen from the system was estimated from the total nitrogen mass balance eq 7 it was observed that the concentration of nh3 n decreased as a function of time during the plasma treatment and only a small fraction of no3 n and no2 n were produced at first the concentration of nh3 n decreased from 200 mg l c0 to 35 7 mg l after 1 hr which accounted for up to 77 8 nitrogen production efficiency the amount of no2 n and no3 n produced was 3 44 mg l and 3 97 mg l respectively after another hour of treatment the n2 production efficiency increased from 77 8 to 92 5 while the nh3 n conversion efficiency of the system increased from 81 8 to 98 21 the final amount of no2 n and no3 n were 3 26 and 6 51 mg l respectively it has been reported that no2 can react with nh4 to produce n2 and or be oxidized to no3 by oxygen gas this was probably the reason why the final concentration of no2 n was lower than that of no3 n lousteau et al 2015 the energy yield decreased as the nh3 n degradation efficiency increased this makes sense because as the nh3 n is progressively degraded less and less of the energy input is used for nh3 n removal as there is less of it at the later stage of the process the kinetic behavior of the reaction was established by fitting the nh3 n concentration profile over time to various kinetic models it was found that the decomposition of nh3 n by the clpd system was best described by a pseudo first order kinetic model as shown in fig 7 using a linearized least squares method the reaction rate constant was 0 03522 min 1 the variation of ln ci ct versus time followed a straight line pattern with a good correlation coefficient value r2 0 986 indicating that the pseudo first order kinetic model was appropriate to describe the degradation of nh3 n by the clpd process there are two forms of nh3 n in an aqueous solution free ammonia nh3 and ammonium ion nh4 both of which are usually in equilibrium according to the following expressions 14 n h 4 n h 3 h p k a 9 25 a t 25 c 15 k n h 3 h n h 4 the composition ratio of nh3 to nh4 depends on the ph and temperature of the solution the higher the ph value the larger the fraction of nh3 is which is more volatile conversely the proportion of ammonium ion is higher with a lower ph value at ph 7 nh3 n exists mainly in the form of nh4 while more than 90 is free ammonia when the ph is over 11 luo et al 2015 in this study the temperature of the nh3 solution initially at 25 c increased gradually with time and reached a steady state value of 60 c within 10 mins during the course of treatment the ph increased linearly over time from a mean value of 4 62 to 7 68 while the electrical conductivity changed from 2 2 to 2 7 ms cm as shown in fig 8 the increase in ph was probably due to the formation of oh ions and other active species from the ionization of water molecules since the reaction proceeded under acidic to neutral conditions the nh3 n was most likely present as the salt form nh4 which would not be stripped off by the gas phase this meant that the nh3 n removal was actually catalyzed by the active chemical species generated by the plasma discharge in the clpd system 3 6 possible reaction mechanisms for ammonia oxidation by liquid phase plasma discharge in liquid phase plasma discharge free electrons gain energy from the electric field generated between the discharge and ground electrodes resulting in high energy electrons these high energy electrons can interact with oxygen water molecules and other ionic compounds in the aqueous phase to initiate various physical and chemical reactions these processes may generate shock waves reactive chemical species such as oh o h h2 o2 h2o2 and intense ultraviolet uv radiation which can be detected as a spectrum of emitted light photons by optical emission spectroscopy oes augugliaro et al 2012 this spectrum of plasma emitted radiation is grated and the intensity is measured as a function of the wavelength devia et al 2015 the spectra obtained in this study were analyzed using the national institute of standards and technology atomic spectra database kramida et al 2021 including other published works misra et al 2014 to identify the various active chemical species present in the reactor during operation fig 9 shows the relative intensity of the optical emission spectra observed in the clpd system from oxygen gas flow rate 2 5 l min at different power input levels 300 w and 225 w respectively the magnitude of the emission intensity lines provides a qualitative indicator of chemical species concentration in the optical emission the results showed that the relative intensity of oes was strongly influenced by the magnitude of the discharge voltage for example an increase in power input from 225 w vrms 9 2 kv irms 9 08 ma to 300 w vrms 10 4 kv irms 11 2 ma resulted in a significant increase in the density intensity of the transition lines of all active radicals and ionic species this observation could be ascribed to the fact that stronger electric fields are produced when the power is increased and as a result collisions of high energy electron with oxygen molecules accelerates the generation of active radicals through ionization resulting in more light emissions the discharge produced a significant uv radiation that was clearly visible to the naked eye and was dominated by atomic oxygen lines at 777 04 and 844 14 nm which correspond to atomic transition 3p5p 3s5s and 3p3p 3s3s respectively these transitions arise from the decay of various excited states of oxygen atoms in addition molecular bands corresponding to transitions in the first negative system of the o2 ions b4σg a4πu as well as hydrogen atoms hα 3s 2p were found at 559 6 and 659 nm respectively the oh emission from the electronic transition of a2σ x2π with a band head at 310 2 nm was also visible for the oxygen plasma discharge these excited states can be generated due to both energetic electron impact excitation of oxygen atoms and energetic electron impact dissociation or penning ionization of o2 nh3 oh h2o2 and h2o molecules abbasi firouzjah et al 2013 malik et al 2001 the emission spectra obtained from this study are consistent with the results from other studies conducted by different research groups abbasi firouzjah et al 2013 rybkin et al 2008 lock et al 2011 o2 and oh molecules are the most important reactive species that are frequently generated by the plasma treatment of aqueous solutions they can oxidize most organic and inorganic compounds they come in contact with and are the primary source of hydrogen peroxide in plasma systems joshi et al 1995 during plasma

liquid phase plasma discharge process the effects of various plasma operating parameters including discharge power gas flow rate and initial concentration of nh3 n on the nh3 n removal efficiency as well as the binary interactions between these parameters were investigated using the box behnken experimental design of rsm all three independent variables were effective in the nh3 n degradation among them the gas flow rate was found to be the most significant parameter with a more pronounced effect the second order polynomial regression model fitted the experimental data points well with high correlation coefficients r2 98 8 and adjusted r2 97 3 the maximum efficiency of nh3 n removal was found to be 98 91 with n2 selectivity of 92 91 under optimal conditions i e initial nh3 n concentration of 200 mg l 223 w and gas flow rate of 2 4 l min these optimized conditions were very close to the mean values predicted by the model and were shown to be feasible through verification experiments performed in duplicate the removal of nh3 n by the clpd followed pseudo first order kinetics although the evolution of n2 was not tested it was assumed to be the primary end product as only small amounts of by products including no3 n and no2 n were found in the treated effluent the possible nh3 n degradation pathways have been suggested based on the identification of the intermediates in the liquid phase and plasma discharge plume using optical emission spectrometry this study demonstrates that plasma technology is a promising alternative for the effective removal of high concentrations of nh3 n from aqueous solutions the reactor is simple eco friendly and less expensive to build and operate another distinct advantage is that this technology can be easily integrated with other technologies however overall costs for implementing such a process still need to be established further research is now underway to improve the process kinetics and energy

15542,sedimentary denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox are two microbially mediated nitrogen removal pathways with distinct climatic feedbacks estuaries receive large fluxes of anthropogenic nitrogen and serve as hotspots for nitrogen loss applying 15n isotope pairing technique and sediment intact core incubation in two subtropical estuaries the yangtze river estuary yre and jiulong river estuary jre we show that denitrification predominates the sedimentary nitrogen loss with a minor contribution 8 6 7 5 from anammox particulate organic matter degradation sustains the sedimentary nitrogen removal linking the nitrogen transformations between water column and sediment our results indicate that estuarine sediments exhibit high areal nitrogen removal rate but play a relatively weak role in eliminating the nitrogen inputted from river basin due to the limited area the riverine excess nitrogen will eventually enter into the adjacent continental shelf and be removed via phytoplankton assimilation sedimentation degradation coupled nitrification denitrification in addition sedimentary denitrification causes 1 8 2 2 of nitrogen flow towards nitrous oxide n2o production and the derived n2o release flux accounts for 59 and 65 of the daily sea air n2o emission in the yre and jre respectively these findings contribute to a better understanding of estuarine sedimentary nitrogen removal and associated climate feedbacks and to the parameterization of earth system models graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords estuary denitrification anammox n2o emission coupled nitrification denitrification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox are two main microbially mediated nitrogen removal pathways in natural aquatic ecosystems playing vital roles in maintaining the homeostasis of earth s systems but with entirely different climatic feedbacks denitrification produces nitrous oxide n2o as a byproduct tiedje 1988 while anammox is a more climate friendly process involving no n2o emission strous et al 1998 marine sediments are hotspots for nitrogen sink resulting in approximately 50 70 of nitrogen loss from oceanic systems seitzinger et al 2006 the magnitude and proportion of these two processes largely determine the size of the nitrogen sink and n2o source at regional and global scales devol 2015 in general denitrification outcompetes anammox in most environments including the estuarine and coastal wetland sediments devol 2015 while in some pelagic sediments or even in oxygen minimum zones the relative contribution of anammox may exceed that of denitrification and can become the major nitrogen removal process thamdrup et al 2006 trimmer and nicholls 2009 previous studies have suggested that temperature organic matter nitrate and ammonium concentrations are key regulators for these two processes and their partitioning albert et al 2021 babbin et al 2014 tan et al 2020 however the environmental controls on the denitrification and anammox activities in different ecosystems remain underexplored n2o is a powerful greenhouse gas 298 times more potent than carbon dioxide in warming potential ravishankara et al 2009 atmospheric n2o concentrations have increased by 20 since 1750 with a steadily rate of increase of 0 73 0 03 ppb yr 1 over the last three decades ipcc 2014 anthropogenic induced n2o emissions are expected to continually increase in the future as a result of the growing population and food demand tian et al 2020 denitrification is one of the key driver for n2o production and the n2o yield in denitrification is a crucial parameter but is usually assumed as a constant in biogeochemical models hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 however limited studies have indicated that n2o yield is regulated by temperature water content oxygen levels and substrate availability grant and pattey 2008 kravchenko et al 2017 senbayram et al 2012 deciphering denitrification derived n2o production via field observations is important for parameterization and validation of earth system models to better predict future biogeochemical cycles and associated climatic feedbacks located at the land and ocean interface estuaries receive a large amount of reactive nitrogen from basins and deliver it into the coastal seas acting as natural reactors for the nitrogen biogeochemical cycle the global riverine nutrient transports have been more than doubled during the 20th century beusen et al 2016 in china the total nitrogen export into coastal waters increased by 4 6 folds with a main contribution from river discharge in the last 50 years wang et al 2020 such excess nitrogen loads significantly alter the nitrogen biogeochemical cycle and amplify the associated environmental and climatic feedbacks kessouri et al 2021 understanding the fate of reactive nitrogen and quantitatively assessing the estuarine nitrogen removal capacity and their roles in environmental and climatic feedbacks will be helpful for the control and mitigation of nitrogen pollution in coastal environments the yangtze river estuary yre and jiulong river estuary jre are two physically different subtropical estuaries in southeastern china the yre actually locates on the adjacent coastal shelf while the jre is a conventional estuary which discharges to the coastal system near xiamen island fig 1 even though the three gorges dam has reduced the transport of material from the yangtze river the fluxes of freshwater discharge and sediment transportation in the yre are about 60 and 200 times higher than those in the jre and the nitrogen loading in the yre is nearly two orders of magnitude greater supplementary table s1 previous studies mainly focused on the sedimentary nitrogen removal potential and n2o concentration in the water column chen et al 2015 deng et al 2015 li et al 2021 wang et al 2016 nevertheless the in situ sedimentary nitrogen removal rate associated n2o production and their environmental controls in these two estuaries are still not well constrained liu et al 2019 accordingly we hypothesize that sediment may act as a hotspot for riverine inputted reactive nitrogen removal with significant ecological and climatic feedbacks in these two estuaries to quantify better the fate of reactive nitrogen and associated n2o production in these two estuaries 15n isotope pairing measurements and intact sediment core incubation were applied in the yre and jre 1 to quantify the in situ rates of sedimentary denitrification anammox and denitrification derived n2o production 2 to evaluate the environmental factors for nitrogen removal and n2o emission 3 to determine the nitrogen removal capacity and their environmental and climatic feedbacks 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yre a subtropical estuary is located in the east coast of china fig 1a with an average annual precipitation of 1100 mm and a mean temperature of 29 c and 5 6 c in summer and winter respectively annually about 4 8 108 t of sediments and 9 0 1011 m3 of freshwater are exported into the yre and east china sea via yangtze river most of these sediments being trapped in the yre and the inner shelf of east china sea hu et al 2012 the yre and adjacent regions are facing eutrophication and seasonal hypoxia events due to the exponentially increase of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din concentration and labile organic matter in recent decades lin et al 2017 the jre is located on the southwest coast of china fig 1b it also has a typical subtropical climate with a monthly average temperature of 10 32 c and an average annual rainfall of 1200 mm the jiulong river delivers approximately 1 5 1010 m3 yr 1 and 2 2 106 t yr 1 of freshwater and sediments into the southern taiwan strait respectively with nearly 75 of which takes place in the wet season yu et al 2019 recently intensive agricultural activities on the jiulong river watershed have greatly increased the fertilizer utilization by 6 10 times leading to an increase of din loading and the frequently occurrence of harmful algal blooms yan et al 2012 2 2 sampling and pretreatment the sampling cruise in the yre was conducted onboard r v yanping ii from 21 july through 6 august 2017 representing the wet season in summer while in the jre we organized four cruises onboard r v ocean ii in winter december 2015 autumn september 2016 spring april 2017 and summer july 2018 in total 8 and 15 sites were investigated in the yre and jre respectively fig 1 bottom water was collected by applying a conductivity temperature depth ctd rosette sampler attached with 12 l niskin bottles the water was filtered 0 2 μm and preserved in 50 ml centrifuge tubes at 20 c for nutrients analysis including ammonium nh4 and nitrate plus nitrite nox concentration another 30 l of bottom water was directly collected and stored in tanks for later incubation experiments bulk sediment was collected using a box corer 20 20 cm intact sediment cores were then subsampled by inserting pvc tubes inner diameter 5 cm and length 30 cm after the overlying water was removed carefully fourteen and eight intact sediment cores were collected at each site in the yre and jre respectively one of these cores was applied to draw pore water using a rhizon sampling device seeberg elverfeldt et al 2005 with a 1 cm of resolution in the upper 6 cm depth and 2 cm of resolution in the deep sediments the sediments in other cores were adjusted to 23 cm height and bottom water from the corresponding site was gently added into these cores to obtain 7 cm of overlying water all of the cores were uncapped and equilibrated overnight in a tank with bottom water from the same station used to retrieve sediment profiles the do concentration in the overlying water was saturated and maintained by using an air pump the cores were incubated to determine sediment oxygen consumption soc rates and nitrogen removal rates after the intact core sampling the residual surface sediments 2 cm in the box corer were collected and stored at 20 c for surface sediment characteristics analysis including the porosity organic carbon and nitrogen content and their molar ratio c n 2 3 sediment oxygen consumption rates measurement after an overnight equilibration three cores were randomly selected and the initial dissolved oxygen do concentration in the overlying water was measured using an oxygen sensor ox 50 unisense denmark the microelectrode was calibrated in 100 air saturated and he purged anoxic bottom water before use then these cores were sealed with rubber stoppers leaving no headspace the overlying water was stirred using a small teflon coated magnet which was placed 5 cm above the sediment surface and driven by an external magnet trimmer et al 2006 we also prepared another control core only containing bottom water to correct soc rate due to the oxygen consumption in the water column all of the cores were incubated in the dark at in situ temperature for 3 5 h and then the do concentration in the overlying water was measured the final do concentration was within a range of 154 227 μmol l 1 then soc rates were calculated according to the difference of do concentration in overlying water before and after the incubation 2 4 benthic nitrogen loss and associated gas production rates determination the in situ benthic denitrification and anammox rates were determined using an 15n isotopic pairing technique nielsen 1992 trimmer et al 2006 the intact sediment cores were sealed then the 15no3 98 15n at sigma aldrich was added to the overlying water to a final concentration with the same magnitude as nox concentration in bottom water to obtain an accurate tracer concentration the volume of the added 15no3 was achieved according to the volume of the overlying water after the tracer addition about 30 min of preincubation was employed to obtain a stable 14no3 15no3 ratio in surface sediments hsu and kao 2013 in the yre ten sediment cores from each station were applied to a time series five time points incubation experiment the added 15n tracer in ten cores was adjusted to a same concentration of 20 μmol l 1 following preincubation two cores were sacrificed and taken as time zero the remaining eight cores were ended successively at four time points between 1 h and 5 h while in the jre the final 15n concentration was 100 μmol l 1 and only four sediment cores were used for the two time points incubation experiment at each site similarly two cores were stopped as initial values and then the other two cores were terminated after a 3 h incubation note all incubations were performed in the dark at in situ temperature and time point was sampled in duplicate to end the incubation the overlying water and top 2 cm of sediments were gently mixed dalsgaard et al 2000 the slurry samples were then transferred into five 12 ml gas tight vials exetainer labco pre filled with 0 5 ml of saturated zncl2 and a glass bead all of the fixed samples were kept upside down at room temperature for later 15n labeled gaseous products analysis 2 5 chemical analysis nox concentration in bottom water and pore water was measured via vanadium iii reduction with chemiluminescence detection braman and hendrix 1989 nh4 concentration was determined using indophenol blue spectrophotometric method with a 0 5 μmol l 1 detection limit pai et al 2001 the 29n2 30n2 45n2o and 46n2o in fixed samples were quantified using a thermo finnigan deltaplus advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer with an improved gas enrichment unit hsu and kao 2013 the porosity of sediment was obtained from the weight loss of fresh wet sediments after freeze drying to a constant value tan et al 2019 then the dry sediments were acidified to remove inorganic carbon by adding with 1 n hcl the contents of total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn were analyzed with a carlo erba ea 2100 elemental analyzer after the acidifying sediments were washed and dried again tan et al 2019 2 6 rate calculations the in situ rates of denitrification d14 anammox a14 denitrification derived n2o production d14 n2o and n2o yield n2oyield were quantified based on the 29n2 30n2 45n2o and 46n2o

pearson correlation was applied to test the correlations between nitrogen removal rates and different environmental variables in addition linear regression was fitted to examine the correlation between water column nox fueled denitrification and the difference between nox concentration in bottom water and surface porewater and between the coupled nitrification denitrification and sediment oxygen consumption a one way analysis of variance anova was performed to examine the spatial difference in nitrogen removal and n2o production rates all statistical analyses were conducted at a 0 05

nitrogen removal process with a minor contribution from anammox on average denitrification results in approximately 1 8 2 2 of nitrogen flow towards n2o production of the measured environmental factors denitrification showed positive correlations with bottom water temperature nox concentration and sediment oxygen consumption rate but a negative correlation with bottom water salinity table 2 anammox rates were significantly and positively correlated to bottom water temperature bottom water nox concentration nh4 concentration in both bottom water and porewater and sediment oxygen consumption but were negatively correlated to bottom water salinity table 2 the only relationship observed for ra against multiple environmental factors was the positive correlation with regard to the bottom water temperature and nh4 concentration table 2 unfortunately both the n2o production rate and yield presented no significant correlation with the investigated factors table 2 the p 14 w was negatively correlated to bottom water salinity and positively correlated to substrate concentration nox and nh4 and sediment oxygen consumption table 2 by contrast the p 14 n only showed significant and positive correlations with bottom water temperature and sediment oxygen consumption table 2 4 discussion 4 1 environmental controls for sedimentary denitrification and anammox denitrification prevails in subtropical estuarine sediments and outcompetes anammox to dominate the nitrogen loss processes fig 4 temperature salinity nox concentration and sediment oxygen consumption are the main environmental factors for the spatiotemporal variation of denitrification in yre and jre sediments table 2 temperature is a fundamental factor governing microbial metabolism rising temperature may directly stimulate the metabolism of denitrifiers and thus their activities in addition warming can promote denitrification indirectly by facilitating the sedimentary nitrification process since denitrifiers are partly fueled by the products of nitrifiers via the coupled nitrification denitrification table 2 and fig 6 the fluctuating temperature in subtropical regions may play a critical role in regulating the sedimentary denitrification rate at a seasonal scale the physical diffused and sedimentary nitrification produced nox are two substrate sources for denitrification in sediments the denitrification fueled by water column nox and the coupled nitrification denitrification were tightly correlated to the nox concentration gradient table 2 and fig 7 and sediment oxygen consumption rates table 2 and fig 8 respectively such linear correlations indicate that the denitrifying bacterial activities are strongly influenced by nitrate concentration the substrate driven sedimentary nitrogen loss exists widely in various aquatic ecosystems seitzinger et al 2006 liu et al 2019 have found that the relative importance of denitrification fueled by water column nox to total nitrogen loss decreased with a decreasing nitrate concentration seaward in the yangtze river estuary a compilation of observations from freshwater and marine systems also have indicated that nitrate concentration in the overlying water largely explain the variability in the water column nox supported denitrification in sediments seitzinger et al 2006 sedimentary nitrification depends on the ammonium produced by benthic organic matter decomposition assuming all the ammonium produced is converted to nitrate to support the coupled nitrification denitrification then organic matter degradation consumes 138 mol oxygen and produces 106 mol carbon dioxide and 16 mol nitrate resulting in an inversely correlation between nitrate production and oxygen consumption with a slope of 16 138 0 12 however the slope of 0 04 between coupled nitrification denitrification rate and sediment oxygen consumption rate in this study fig 8 suggests that approximately one third of ammonium generated from organic matter ammonification is nitrified to fuel the denitrification and the remaining is preserved and accumulated in sediments organic matter quantity and quality is a key regulator for the occurrence of heterotrophic denitrification and its proportion albert et al 2021 babbin et al 2014 bartl et al 2019 here we observed a significant correlation between denitrification and sediment oxygen consumption rate even though denitrification did not directly correlate to organic matter contents or c n ratio table 2 high quality organic matter is usually easier to be respired and thus swiftly consumes oxygen in sediments such a correlation may imply a regulation of labile organic matter on sedimentary denitrification the degradation of labile organic matter accelerates oxygen consumption and create a suboxic anoxic environment which promotes sedimentary nitrification and denitrification and subsequently their coupling mccarthy et al 2015 tan et al 2019 this indirect regulation can also be supported by the linear relationship between coupled nitrification denitrification and sediment oxygen consumption fig 8 sedimentary anammox is a relatively small but non negligible contributor to total nitrogen loss in subtropical estuaries anammox rates were significantly and positively correlated to denitrification rates supplementary fig s4a particularly to the denitrification fueled by water column nox and coupled nitrification denitrification rates supplementary fig s4b and c such correlations imply that the activity of anammox bacteria may largely depend on nitrite production via nitrification and nitrate reduction processes including denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium hou et al 2015 jensen et al 2011 the autotrophic anammox bacteria are much less competitive than the heterotrophic denitrifiers due to the slower growing less biomass yield and longer doubling time jetten et al 1999 anammox bacteria have a very high nitrite affinity with an apparent half saturation constant less than 3 μmol l 1 dalsgaard and thamdrup 2002 and thus can exist relying on the denitrification nitrification produced nitrite we thus deduced that even anammox rates were correlated to multiple environmental factors table 2 these factors may regulate anammox mainly in an indirect way via affecting the sedimentary denitrification and their coupling 4 2 environmental factors regulating sedimentary n2o production sedimentary denitrification drives a substantial n2o production in the yre and jre sediments fig 5 limited research has suggested that temperature ph do concentration the availability of organic matter and nitrate are key regulators for the sedimentary denitrification driven n2o production in aquatic ecosystems hylén et al 2021 mccrackin and elser 2010 su et al 2021 tan et al 2019 tan et al 2020 tan et al 2020 indicated that warming directly promotes denitrification driven n2o production and may direct more of removed nitrogen flow towards n2o release due to the different temperature response between n2o production and consumption in denitrification su et al 2021 have proved that acidification stimulates bacterial denitrification associated n2o production in estuarine sediments via altering the keystone taxa of denitrifiers and decreasing the microbial electron transfer efficiency due to the different oxygen tolerance of enzymes involved in denitrification high oxygen environments may favor n2o production hylén et al 2021 in addition sedimentary n2o production is susceptible to the bioavailability of nitrate and organic matter particularly in unproductive regions mccrackin and elser 2010 however we observed no significant correlations between sedimentary n2o production rates and any environmental factors table 2 highlighting the complex mechanisms of environmental controls on the denitrification driven n2o production 4 3 hotspots of nitrogen loss and n2o production in estuarine sediments we compiled the nitrogen removal rates and associated n2o production in various coastal ecosystems globally table 3 the sedimentary denitrification rates in this study are slightly higher than denitrification in many bays and continental shelf sediments and are comparable to the rates in most of estuarine sediments globally but are 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than those measured in hypereutrophic estuaries or wetlands table 3 the anammox rates are similar in magnitude in different regions globally except for the measurements in a constructed wetland which is 10 fold higher than our results table 3 for the sedimentary n2o production our results are comparable to the findings in other estuaries in china and also other global ecosystems table 3 accordingly such a comparison indicates that the yre and jre sediments are hotspots of nitrogen removal and n2o release by contrast the denitrification anammox total nitrogen removal relative contribution of anammox to total nitrogen removal denitrification fueled by water column nox denitrification derived n2o production and n2o yield are consistently higher in the jre than those in the yre since the jre is a normal enclosed estuary with higher nox and nh4 concentration higher organic matter content and higher sediment oxygen consumption rate while the yre is actually a coastal shelf fig 2 and see specific values in supplementary table s1 the sedimentary nitrogen removal flux was calculated by multiplying the site specific rate including the minimum maximum and average rate with the sediment area assuming a sediment area of 5466 km2 and 141 8 km2 in the yre and jre respectively we thus obtained the denitrification based and anammox based nitrogen removal fluxes of 49 7 151 2 t n d 1 and 1 7 8 4 t n d 1 average 89 5 35 4 t n d 1 and 4 5 2 3 t n d 1 in the yre sediments fig 9 a and of 1 1 5 2 t n d 1 and 0 01 0 90 t n d 1 average 2 9 1 3 t n d 1 and 0 4 0 3 t n d 1 in the jre sediments fig 9b respectively the total nitrogen loss fluxes were estimated to be 51 4 159 6 t n d 1 average 94 0 37 3 t n d 1 and 1 2 5 9 t n d 1 average 3 3 1 5 t n d 1 in the yre and jre sediments respectively fig 9 the riverine input fluxes of din and particulate organic nitrogen pon are approximately 4678 t n d 1 and 367 t n d 1 in the yre gao et al 2012 and 93 8 t n d 1 and 104 2 t n d 1 in the jre yan et al 2019 yan et al 2012 respectively as aforementioned the sedimentary nitrogen removal fluxes in the yre and jre regions which supported by water column delivered nox were 10 9 58 1 t n d 1 average 39 2 17 3 t n d 1 fig 9a and 0 4 3 3 t n d 1 average 1 7 1 0 t n d 1 fig 9b accounting for 0 2 1 2 0 8 0 4 and 0 4 3 5 1 8 1 1 of riverine inputted din flux respectively while nitrogen removal fluxes supported by sedimentary nitrification produced nox were 28 9 110 6 t n d 1 average 54 8 28 0 t n d 1 fig 9a and 0 6 3 4 t n d 1 average 1 6 0 8 t n d 1 fig 9b respectively since sedimentary nitrification depends on the particulate organic matter undergoing ammonification we thus estimated that 4 5 17 3 8 6 4 4 and 5 7 32 4 15 5 7 2 of riverine inputted pon was removed via coupled nitrification denitrification such findings underline that allochthonous or autochthonous pom plays significant roles in linking nitrogen transformations in the water column and sediments particularly in shelf seas with low bottom water nitrate concentration bartl et al 2019 seitzinger et al 2006 tan et al 2019 meanwhile the limited proportion of direct din removal indicates that the riverine reactive nitrogen is still retained in the ecosystem and may result in water eutrophication our results suggest that although estuarine sediments have high areal nitrogen removal rate but these are weak in eliminating the nitrogen inputted from river basin due to the limited area the excess nitrogen will eventually enter into the wide adjacent continental shelf and be removed via phytoplankton assimilation sedimentation degradation coupled nitrification denitrification the sedimentary denitrification derived n2o production fluxes were estimated to be 0 07 1 2 t n d 1 average 0 40 0 38 t n d 1 fig 9a and 0 01 0 16 t n d 1 average 0 05 0 04 t n d 1 fig 9b in the yre and jre respectively excluding the extremely high values at sites s3 and s11 fig 6 the average sea air n2o effluxes were 8 9 4 1 and 35 1 21 1 μmol n m 2 d 1 in the yre and jre respectively as reported by yang et al 2022 and chen et al 2015 the total sea air n2o effluxes in the yre and jre were then calculated to be 0 68 0 31 t n d 1 and 0 07 0 04 t n d 1 fig 9 averagely the sedimentary denitrification derived n2o production accounts for 58 7 62 2 and 64 6 70 3 of the daily sea air n2o emission in the yre and jre respectively suggesting that the estuarine sediments are a substantial n2o contributor in coastal environments tan et al 2019 yang et al 2022 5 conclusions we quantitatively decipher the roles of sediment nitrogen removal in environmental and climatic feedbacks in two subtropical estuaries in china estuarine sediments are hotspots for nitrogen removal with a strong positive climate feedback but are weak in eliminating the nitrogen inputted from river basin due to the limited area particulate organic matter links the inorganic nitrogen transformation in the water column and nitrogen removal in sediments as anthropogenic interference and global change intensify persistently the riverine inputted inorganic nutrients allochthonous and autochthonous particulate organic matter are projected to increase the increase of particulate organic matter deposition onto sediments may stimulate sedimentary nitrogen removal and associated n2o production in general our results highlight the

15542,sedimentary denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox are two microbially mediated nitrogen removal pathways with distinct climatic feedbacks estuaries receive large fluxes of anthropogenic nitrogen and serve as hotspots for nitrogen loss applying 15n isotope pairing technique and sediment intact core incubation in two subtropical estuaries the yangtze river estuary yre and jiulong river estuary jre we show that denitrification predominates the sedimentary nitrogen loss with a minor contribution 8 6 7 5 from anammox particulate organic matter degradation sustains the sedimentary nitrogen removal linking the nitrogen transformations between water column and sediment our results indicate that estuarine sediments exhibit high areal nitrogen removal rate but play a relatively weak role in eliminating the nitrogen inputted from river basin due to the limited area the riverine excess nitrogen will eventually enter into the adjacent continental shelf and be removed via phytoplankton assimilation sedimentation degradation coupled nitrification denitrification in addition sedimentary denitrification causes 1 8 2 2 of nitrogen flow towards nitrous oxide n2o production and the derived n2o release flux accounts for 59 and 65 of the daily sea air n2o emission in the yre and jre respectively these findings contribute to a better understanding of estuarine sedimentary nitrogen removal and associated climate feedbacks and to the parameterization of earth system models graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords estuary denitrification anammox n2o emission coupled nitrification denitrification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox are two main microbially mediated nitrogen removal pathways in natural aquatic ecosystems playing vital roles in maintaining the homeostasis of earth s systems but with entirely different climatic feedbacks denitrification produces nitrous oxide n2o as a byproduct tiedje 1988 while anammox is a more climate friendly process involving no n2o emission strous et al 1998 marine sediments are hotspots for nitrogen sink resulting in approximately 50 70 of nitrogen loss from oceanic systems seitzinger et al 2006 the magnitude and proportion of these two processes largely determine the size of the nitrogen sink and n2o source at regional and global scales devol 2015 in general denitrification outcompetes anammox in most environments including the estuarine and coastal wetland sediments devol 2015 while in some pelagic sediments or even in oxygen minimum zones the relative contribution of anammox may exceed that of denitrification and can become the major nitrogen removal process thamdrup et al 2006 trimmer and nicholls 2009 previous studies have suggested that temperature organic matter nitrate and ammonium concentrations are key regulators for these two processes and their partitioning albert et al 2021 babbin et al 2014 tan et al 2020 however the environmental controls on the denitrification and anammox activities in different ecosystems remain underexplored n2o is a powerful greenhouse gas 298 times more potent than carbon dioxide in warming potential ravishankara et al 2009 atmospheric n2o concentrations have increased by 20 since 1750 with a steadily rate of increase of 0 73 0 03 ppb yr 1 over the last three decades ipcc 2014 anthropogenic induced n2o emissions are expected to continually increase in the future as a result of the growing population and food demand tian et al 2020 denitrification is one of the key driver for n2o production and the n2o yield in denitrification is a crucial parameter but is usually assumed as a constant in biogeochemical models hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 however limited studies have indicated that n2o yield is regulated by temperature water content oxygen levels and substrate availability grant and pattey 2008 kravchenko et al 2017 senbayram et al 2012 deciphering denitrification derived n2o production via field observations is important for parameterization and validation of earth system models to better predict future biogeochemical cycles and associated climatic feedbacks located at the land and ocean interface estuaries receive a large amount of reactive nitrogen from basins and deliver it into the coastal seas acting as natural reactors for the nitrogen biogeochemical cycle the global riverine nutrient transports have been more than doubled during the 20th century beusen et al 2016 in china the total nitrogen export into coastal waters increased by 4 6 folds with a main contribution from river discharge in the last 50 years wang et al 2020 such excess nitrogen loads significantly alter the nitrogen biogeochemical cycle and amplify the associated environmental and climatic feedbacks kessouri et al 2021 understanding the fate of reactive nitrogen and quantitatively assessing the estuarine nitrogen removal capacity and their roles in environmental and climatic feedbacks will be helpful for the control and mitigation of nitrogen pollution in coastal environments the yangtze river estuary yre and jiulong river estuary jre are two physically different subtropical estuaries in southeastern china the yre actually locates on the adjacent coastal shelf while the jre is a conventional estuary which discharges to the coastal system near xiamen island fig 1 even though the three gorges dam has reduced the transport of material from the yangtze river the fluxes of freshwater discharge and sediment transportation in the yre are about 60 and 200 times higher than those in the jre and the nitrogen loading in the yre is nearly two orders of magnitude greater supplementary table s1 previous studies mainly focused on the sedimentary nitrogen removal potential and n2o concentration in the water column chen et al 2015 deng et al 2015 li et al 2021 wang et al 2016 nevertheless the in situ sedimentary nitrogen removal rate associated n2o production and their environmental controls in these two estuaries are still not well constrained liu et al 2019 accordingly we hypothesize that sediment may act as a hotspot for riverine inputted reactive nitrogen removal with significant ecological and climatic feedbacks in these two estuaries to quantify better the fate of reactive nitrogen and associated n2o production in these two estuaries 15n isotope pairing measurements and intact sediment core incubation were applied in the yre and jre 1 to quantify the in situ rates of sedimentary denitrification anammox and denitrification derived n2o production 2 to evaluate the environmental factors for nitrogen removal and n2o emission 3 to determine the nitrogen removal capacity and their environmental and climatic feedbacks 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yre a subtropical estuary is located in the east coast of china fig 1a with an average annual precipitation of 1100 mm and a mean temperature of 29 c and 5 6 c in summer and winter respectively annually about 4 8 108 t of sediments and 9 0 1011 m3 of freshwater are exported into the yre and east china sea via yangtze river most of these sediments being trapped in the yre and the inner shelf of east china sea hu et al 2012 the yre and adjacent regions are facing eutrophication and seasonal hypoxia events due to the exponentially increase of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din concentration and labile organic matter in recent decades lin et al 2017 the jre is located on the southwest coast of china fig 1b it also has a typical subtropical climate with a monthly average temperature of 10 32 c and an average annual rainfall of 1200 mm the jiulong river delivers approximately 1 5 1010 m3 yr 1 and 2 2 106 t yr 1 of freshwater and sediments into the southern taiwan strait respectively with nearly 75 of which takes place in the wet season yu et al 2019 recently intensive agricultural activities on the jiulong river watershed have greatly increased the fertilizer utilization by 6 10 times leading to an increase of din loading and the frequently occurrence of harmful algal blooms yan et al 2012 2 2 sampling and pretreatment the sampling cruise in the yre was conducted onboard r v yanping ii from 21 july through 6 august 2017 representing the wet season in summer while in the jre we organized four cruises onboard r v ocean ii in winter december 2015 autumn september 2016 spring april 2017 and summer july 2018 in total 8 and 15 sites were investigated in the yre and jre respectively fig 1 bottom water was collected by applying a conductivity temperature depth ctd rosette sampler attached with 12 l niskin bottles the water was filtered 0 2 μm and preserved in 50 ml centrifuge tubes at 20 c for nutrients analysis including ammonium nh4 and nitrate plus nitrite nox concentration another 30 l of bottom water was directly collected and stored in tanks for later incubation experiments bulk sediment was collected using a box corer 20 20 cm intact sediment cores were then subsampled by inserting pvc tubes inner diameter 5 cm and length 30 cm after the overlying water was removed carefully fourteen and eight intact sediment cores were collected at each site in the yre and jre respectively one of these cores was applied to draw pore water using a rhizon sampling device seeberg elverfeldt et al 2005 with a 1 cm of resolution in the upper 6 cm depth and 2 cm of resolution in the deep sediments the sediments in other cores were adjusted to 23 cm height and bottom water from the corresponding site was gently added into these cores to obtain 7 cm of overlying water all of the cores were uncapped and equilibrated overnight in a tank with bottom water from the same station used to retrieve sediment profiles the do concentration in the overlying water was saturated and maintained by using an air pump the cores were incubated to determine sediment oxygen consumption soc rates and nitrogen removal rates after the intact core sampling the residual surface sediments 2 cm in the box corer were collected and stored at 20 c for surface sediment characteristics analysis including the porosity organic carbon and nitrogen content and their molar ratio c n 2 3 sediment oxygen consumption rates measurement after an overnight equilibration three cores were randomly selected and the initial dissolved oxygen do concentration in the overlying water was measured using an oxygen sensor ox 50 unisense denmark the microelectrode was calibrated in 100 air saturated and he purged anoxic bottom water before use then these cores were sealed with rubber stoppers leaving no headspace the overlying water was stirred using a small teflon coated magnet which was placed 5 cm above the sediment surface and driven by an external magnet trimmer et al 2006 we also prepared another control core only containing bottom water to correct soc rate due to the oxygen consumption in the water column all of the cores were incubated in the dark at in situ temperature for 3 5 h and then the do concentration in the overlying water was measured the final do concentration was within a range of 154 227 μmol l 1 then soc rates were calculated according to the difference of do concentration in overlying water before and after the incubation 2 4 benthic nitrogen loss and associated gas production rates determination the in situ benthic denitrification and anammox rates were determined using an 15n isotopic pairing technique nielsen 1992 trimmer et al 2006 the intact sediment cores were sealed then the 15no3 98 15n at sigma aldrich was added to the overlying water to a final concentration with the same magnitude as nox concentration in bottom water to obtain an accurate tracer concentration the volume of the added 15no3 was achieved according to the volume of the overlying water after the tracer addition about 30 min of preincubation was employed to obtain a stable 14no3 15no3 ratio in surface sediments hsu and kao 2013 in the yre ten sediment cores from each station were applied to a time series five time points incubation experiment the added 15n tracer in ten cores was adjusted to a same concentration of 20 μmol l 1 following preincubation two cores were sacrificed and taken as time zero the remaining eight cores were ended successively at four time points between 1 h and 5 h while in the jre the final 15n concentration was 100 μmol l 1 and only four sediment cores were used for the two time points incubation experiment at each site similarly two cores were stopped as initial values and then the other two cores were terminated after a 3 h incubation note all incubations were performed in the dark at in situ temperature and time point was sampled in duplicate to end the incubation the overlying water and top 2 cm of sediments were gently mixed dalsgaard et al 2000 the slurry samples were then transferred into five 12 ml gas tight vials exetainer labco pre filled with 0 5 ml of saturated zncl2 and a glass bead all of the fixed samples were kept upside down at room temperature for later 15n labeled gaseous products analysis 2 5 chemical analysis nox concentration in bottom water and pore water was measured via vanadium iii reduction with chemiluminescence detection braman and hendrix 1989 nh4 concentration was determined using indophenol blue spectrophotometric method with a 0 5 μmol l 1 detection limit pai et al 2001 the 29n2 30n2 45n2o and 46n2o in fixed samples were quantified using a thermo finnigan deltaplus advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer with an improved gas enrichment unit hsu and kao 2013 the porosity of sediment was obtained from the weight loss of fresh wet sediments after freeze drying to a constant value tan et al 2019 then the dry sediments were acidified to remove inorganic carbon by adding with 1 n hcl the contents of total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn were analyzed with a carlo erba ea 2100 elemental analyzer after the acidifying sediments were washed and dried again tan et al 2019 2 6 rate calculations the in situ rates of denitrification d14 anammox a14 denitrification derived n2o production d14 n2o and n2o yield n2oyield were quantified based on the 29n2 30n2 45n2o and 46n2o

pearson correlation was applied to test the correlations between nitrogen removal rates and different environmental variables in addition linear regression was fitted to examine the correlation between water column nox fueled denitrification and the difference between nox concentration in bottom water and surface porewater and between the coupled nitrification denitrification and sediment oxygen consumption a one way analysis of variance anova was performed to examine the spatial difference in nitrogen removal and n2o production rates all statistical analyses were conducted at a 0 05 significance level using statistical package of social sciences spss version 19 0 3 results 3 1 environmental settings of the yre and jre in the yre the temperature and salinity in bottom water ranged from 19 6 to 24 1 c and from 26 5 to 34 5 respectively table 1 the lowest and highest nox concentrations were observed at sites s8 and s2 with values of 8 4 μmol l 1 and 51 1 μmol l 1 respectively table 1 nh4 concentrations were nearly in the same order of magnitude with a range of 0 3 2 0 μmol l 1 table 1 do concentration in bottom water exhibited an unsaturated pattern with a highest value of

from 0 06 to 0 09 respectively resulting in a c n ratio of 8 28 9 62 table 1 nox concentration in pore water decreased with depth and was completely depleted within the upper 2 cm sediments at most of the stations supplementary fig s1a in contrast the pore water nh4 accumulated in deep sediments and presented an increasing trend with depth supplementary fig s1b in the jre the bottom water

the production rates from other sites were 20 100 times lower with a range of 0 04 0 2 μmol n m 2 h 1 fig 5 sedimentary nitrogen loss supported by denitrification fueled by water column nox p 14 w via physical diffusion varied from 6 0 to 31 6 μmol n m 2 h 1 fig 6 the remaining sedimentary nitrogen losses were supported by coupled nitrification denitrification p 14 n with a range of 15 7 60 2 μmol n m 2 h 1 which had a higher contribution to total nitrogen loss range 35 3 78 7 average 59 0 13 8 fig 6 in the jre the denitrification rates in the jre were within the range of 22 7 75 6 44 3 109 1 29 6 108 7 and 33 1 63 9 μmol n m 2 h 1 in spring summer autumn and winter respectively fig 4 the average denitrification rates in summer and autumn of the jre were comparable with values of 72 1 33 3 μmol n m 2 h 1 and 73 4 36 7 μmol n m 2 h 1 respectively while denitrification decreased to 57 6 24 9 μmol n m 2 h 1 in spring and 46 7 17 1 μmol n m 2 h 1 in winter the sedimentary anammox rates ranged from 0 1 18 8 μmol n m 2 h 1 regardless of sites and seasons fig 4 the average anammox rates were highest in summer and lowest in winter the ra were similar in spring and summer with mean values of 16 3 7 3 and 15 7 6 2 respectively then decreased to 10 9 9 0 in autumn and to a lowest value of 1 1 1 0 in winter the denitrification derived n2 production rates varied from 22 5 to 107 5 μmol n m 2 h 1 in the jre fig 5 the denitrification derived n2o production rates were within the range of 0 2 6 1 μmol n m 2 h 1 in spring 0 6 2 0 μmol n m 2 h 1 in summer 0 4 1 2 μmol n m 2 h 1 in autumn and 0 5 3 3 μmol n m 2 h 1 in winter fig 5 n2o yielded a proportion of 0 3 8 0 in the jre fig 5 the p 14 w and p 14 n varied from 8 7 to 68 4 μmol n m 2 h 1 and 12 4 70 4 μmol n m 2 h 1 during four seasons in the jre respectively fig 6 the proportions of these two individual processes to total nitrogen removal were similar taken these two estuaries together denitrification is a dominant nitrogen removal process with a minor contribution from anammox on average denitrification results in approximately 1 8 2 2 of nitrogen flow towards n2o production of the measured environmental factors denitrification showed positive correlations with bottom water temperature nox concentration and sediment oxygen consumption rate but a negative correlation with bottom water salinity table 2 anammox rates were significantly and positively correlated to bottom water temperature bottom water nox concentration nh4 concentration in both bottom water and porewater and sediment oxygen consumption but were negatively correlated to bottom water salinity table 2 the only relationship observed for ra against multiple environmental factors was the positive correlation with regard to the bottom water temperature and nh4 concentration table 2 unfortunately both the n2o production rate and yield presented no significant correlation with the investigated factors table 2 the p 14 w was negatively correlated to bottom water salinity and positively correlated to substrate concentration nox and nh4 and sediment oxygen consumption table 2 by contrast the p 14 n only showed significant and positive correlations with bottom water temperature and sediment oxygen consumption table 2 4 discussion 4 1 environmental controls for sedimentary denitrification and anammox denitrification prevails in subtropical estuarine sediments and outcompetes anammox to dominate the nitrogen loss processes fig 4 temperature salinity nox concentration and sediment oxygen consumption are the main environmental factors for the spatiotemporal variation of denitrification in yre and jre sediments table 2 temperature is a fundamental factor governing microbial metabolism rising temperature may directly stimulate the metabolism of denitrifiers and thus their activities in addition warming can promote denitrification indirectly by facilitating the sedimentary nitrification process since denitrifiers are partly fueled by the products of nitrifiers via the coupled nitrification denitrification table 2 and fig 6 the fluctuating temperature in subtropical regions may play a critical role in regulating the sedimentary denitrification rate at a seasonal scale the physical diffused and sedimentary nitrification produced nox are two substrate sources for denitrification in sediments the denitrification fueled by water column nox and the coupled nitrification denitrification were tightly correlated to the nox concentration gradient table 2 and fig 7 and sediment oxygen consumption rates table 2 and fig 8 respectively such linear correlations indicate that the denitrifying bacterial activities are strongly influenced by nitrate concentration the substrate driven sedimentary nitrogen loss exists widely in various aquatic ecosystems seitzinger et al 2006 liu et al 2019 have found that the relative importance of denitrification fueled by water column nox to total nitrogen loss decreased with a decreasing nitrate concentration seaward in the yangtze river estuary a compilation of observations from freshwater and marine systems also have indicated that nitrate concentration in the overlying water largely explain the variability in the water column nox supported denitrification in sediments seitzinger et al 2006 sedimentary nitrification depends on the ammonium produced by benthic organic matter decomposition assuming all the ammonium produced is converted to nitrate to support the coupled nitrification denitrification then organic matter degradation consumes 138 mol oxygen and produces 106 mol carbon dioxide and 16 mol nitrate resulting in an inversely correlation between nitrate production and oxygen consumption with a slope of 16 138 0 12 however the slope of 0 04 between coupled nitrification denitrification rate and sediment oxygen consumption rate in this study fig 8 suggests that approximately one third of ammonium generated from organic matter ammonification is nitrified to fuel the denitrification and the remaining is preserved and accumulated in sediments organic matter quantity and quality is a key regulator for the occurrence of heterotrophic denitrification and its proportion albert et al 2021 babbin et al 2014 bartl et al 2019 here we observed a significant correlation between denitrification and sediment oxygen consumption rate even though denitrification did not directly correlate to organic matter contents or c n ratio table 2 high quality organic matter is usually easier to be respired and thus swiftly consumes oxygen in sediments such a correlation may imply a regulation of labile organic matter on sedimentary denitrification the degradation of labile organic matter accelerates oxygen consumption and create a suboxic anoxic environment which promotes sedimentary nitrification and denitrification and subsequently their coupling mccarthy et al 2015 tan et al 2019 this indirect regulation can also be supported by the linear relationship between coupled nitrification denitrification and sediment oxygen consumption fig 8 sedimentary anammox is a relatively small but non negligible contributor to total nitrogen loss in subtropical estuaries anammox rates were significantly and positively correlated to denitrification rates supplementary fig s4a particularly to the denitrification fueled by water column nox and coupled nitrification denitrification rates supplementary fig s4b and c such correlations imply that the activity of anammox bacteria may largely depend on nitrite production via nitrification and nitrate reduction processes including denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium hou et al 2015 jensen et al 2011 the autotrophic anammox bacteria are much less competitive than the heterotrophic denitrifiers due to the slower growing less biomass yield and longer doubling time jetten et al 1999 anammox bacteria have a very high nitrite affinity with an apparent half saturation constant less than 3 μmol l 1 dalsgaard and thamdrup 2002 and thus can exist relying on the denitrification nitrification produced nitrite we thus deduced that even anammox rates were correlated to multiple environmental factors table 2 these factors may regulate anammox mainly in an indirect way via affecting the sedimentary denitrification and their coupling 4 2 environmental factors regulating sedimentary n2o production sedimentary denitrification drives a substantial n2o production in the yre and jre sediments fig 5 limited research has suggested that temperature ph do concentration the availability of organic matter and nitrate are key regulators for the sedimentary denitrification driven n2o production in aquatic ecosystems hylén et al 2021 mccrackin and elser 2010 su et al 2021 tan et al 2019 tan et al 2020 tan et al 2020 indicated that warming directly promotes denitrification driven n2o production and may direct more of removed nitrogen flow towards n2o release due to the different temperature response between n2o production and consumption in denitrification su et al 2021 have proved that acidification stimulates bacterial denitrification associated n2o production in estuarine sediments via altering the keystone taxa of denitrifiers and decreasing the microbial electron transfer efficiency due to the different oxygen tolerance of enzymes involved in denitrification high oxygen environments may favor n2o production hylén et al 2021 in addition sedimentary n2o production is susceptible to the bioavailability of nitrate and organic matter particularly in unproductive regions mccrackin and elser 2010 however we observed no significant correlations between sedimentary n2o production rates and any environmental factors table 2 highlighting the complex mechanisms of environmental controls on the denitrification driven n2o production 4 3 hotspots of nitrogen loss and n2o production in estuarine sediments we compiled the nitrogen removal rates and associated n2o production in various coastal ecosystems globally table 3 the sedimentary denitrification rates in this study are slightly higher than denitrification in many bays and continental shelf sediments and are comparable to the rates in most of estuarine sediments globally but are 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than those measured in hypereutrophic estuaries or wetlands table 3 the anammox rates are similar in magnitude in different regions globally except for the measurements in a constructed wetland which is 10 fold higher than our results table 3 for the sedimentary n2o production our results are comparable to the findings in other estuaries in china and also other global ecosystems table 3 accordingly such a comparison indicates that the yre and jre sediments are hotspots of nitrogen removal and n2o release by contrast the denitrification anammox total nitrogen removal relative contribution of anammox to total nitrogen removal denitrification fueled by water column nox denitrification derived n2o production and n2o yield are consistently higher in the jre than those in the yre since the jre is a normal enclosed estuary with higher nox and nh4 concentration higher organic matter content and higher sediment oxygen consumption rate while the yre is actually a coastal shelf fig 2 and see specific values in supplementary table s1 the sedimentary nitrogen removal flux was calculated by multiplying the site specific rate including the minimum maximum and average rate with the sediment area assuming a sediment area of 5466 km2 and 141 8 km2 in the yre and jre respectively we thus obtained the denitrification based and anammox based nitrogen removal fluxes of 49 7 151 2 t n d 1 and 1 7 8 4 t n d 1 average 89 5 35 4 t n d 1 and 4 5 2 3 t n d 1 in the yre sediments fig 9 a and of 1 1 5 2 t n d 1 and 0 01 0 90 t n d 1 average 2 9 1 3 t n d 1 and 0 4 0 3 t n d 1 in the jre sediments fig 9b respectively the total nitrogen loss fluxes were estimated to be 51 4 159 6 t n d 1 average 94 0 37 3 t n d 1 and 1 2 5 9 t n d 1 average 3 3 1 5 t n d 1 in the yre and jre sediments respectively fig 9 the riverine input fluxes of din and particulate organic nitrogen pon are approximately 4678 t n d 1 and 367 t n d 1 in the yre gao et al 2012 and 93 8 t n d 1 and 104 2 t n d 1 in the jre yan et al 2019 yan et al 2012 respectively as aforementioned the sedimentary nitrogen removal fluxes in the yre and jre regions which supported by water column delivered nox were 10 9 58 1 t n d 1 average 39 2 17 3 t n d 1 fig 9a and 0 4 3 3 t n d 1 average 1 7 1 0 t n d 1 fig 9b accounting for 0 2 1 2 0 8 0 4 and 0 4 3 5 1 8 1 1 of riverine inputted din flux respectively while nitrogen removal fluxes supported by sedimentary nitrification produced nox were 28 9 110 6 t n d 1 average 54 8 28 0 t n d 1 fig 9a and 0 6 3 4 t n d 1 average 1 6 0 8 t n d 1 fig 9b respectively since sedimentary nitrification depends on the particulate organic matter undergoing ammonification we thus estimated that 4 5 17 3 8 6 4 4 and 5 7 32 4 15 5 7 2 of riverine inputted pon was removed via coupled nitrification denitrification such findings underline that allochthonous or autochthonous pom plays significant roles in linking nitrogen transformations in the water column and sediments particularly in shelf seas with low bottom water nitrate concentration bartl et al 2019 seitzinger et al 2006 tan et al 2019 meanwhile the limited proportion of direct din removal indicates that the riverine reactive nitrogen is still retained in the ecosystem and may result in water eutrophication our results suggest that although estuarine sediments have high areal nitrogen removal rate but these are weak in eliminating the nitrogen inputted from river basin due to the limited area the excess nitrogen will eventually enter into the wide adjacent continental shelf and be removed via phytoplankton assimilation sedimentation degradation coupled nitrification denitrification the sedimentary denitrification derived n2o production fluxes were estimated to be 0 07 1 2 t n d 1 average 0 40 0 38 t n d 1 fig 9a and 0 01 0 16 t n d 1 average 0 05 0 04 t n d 1 fig 9b in the yre and jre respectively excluding the extremely high values at sites s3 and s11 fig 6 the average sea air n2o effluxes were 8 9 4 1 and 35 1 21 1 μmol n m 2 d 1 in the yre and jre respectively as reported by yang et al 2022 and chen et al 2015 the total sea air n2o effluxes in the yre and jre were then calculated to be 0 68 0 31 t n d 1 and 0 07 0 04 t n d 1 fig 9 averagely the sedimentary denitrification derived n2o production accounts for 58 7 62 2 and 64 6 70 3 of the daily sea air n2o emission in the yre and jre respectively suggesting that the estuarine sediments are a substantial n2o contributor in coastal environments tan et al 2019 yang et al 2022 5 conclusions we quantitatively decipher the roles of sediment nitrogen removal in environmental and climatic feedbacks in two subtropical estuaries in china estuarine sediments are hotspots for nitrogen removal with a strong positive climate feedback but are weak in eliminating the nitrogen inputted from river basin due to the limited area particulate organic matter links the inorganic nitrogen transformation in the water column and nitrogen removal in sediments as anthropogenic interference and global change intensify persistently the riverine inputted inorganic nutrients allochthonous and autochthonous particulate organic matter are projected to increase the increase of particulate organic matter deposition onto sediments may stimulate sedimentary nitrogen removal and associated n2o production in general our results highlight the

15543,the impacts of ph on purification efficiency can be phenomenal in advanced oxidation processes aops because solution ph affects persulfate ps activation processes however consensus has not been reached on the regimes of ph regulated oxidation in persulfate based aops ps aops particularly the impacts of ph on carbon catalyzed generation of radical and nonradical species remain unclear in this work we evaluated three typical carbonaceous materials including pyrolytic carbon pc activated carbon ac and carbon nanotube cnt to activate ps for sulfamethoxazole smx degradation within a ph range from 4 to 9 the experiment revealed ph dependent smx removal in pc ps ac ps and cnt ps and the kinetics followed an order of ph 4 ph 7 ph 9 solution ph simultaneously affected smx adsorption and degradation but the latter was more profound chemical quenching experiment electrochemical measurement kinetics calculation and atr ftir tests collectively revealed that high ph was not favorable for both radical and nonradical oxidation in the pc ps system increased ph decreased the amount of phenolic oh on pc surface thereby restraining the generation of so4 and oh due to the lack of electron donors for ac ps system elevated ph hindered the interactions between ac and ps thus suppressing the formation of surface bound radicals cnt ps initiated an electron transfer pathway and increased ph reduced the oxidation potential of surface cnt ps complex which was not favorable for nonradical oxidation of adsorbed pollutants therefore outcomes of this work will advance the current knowledge on the intrinsic impacts of ph in ps aops catalyzed by carbonaceous materials for wastewater purification graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords carbon persulfate ph radicals nonradical

as ps activators however the possible metal leaching may induce secondary pollution and the development of metal free activators will address such issue recently the carbonaceous materials are efficient nonmetal activators in ps aops due to their characteristics such as rich porosity and large specific surface area ssa abundant surface functional groups and conjugated π electron system duan et al 2018a nie et al 2019 liang et al 2019 in nonmetal ps aops systems carbonaceous materials directly act as electron donors to ps to generate so4 and so4 may further convert to hydroxyl radical oh through oxidizing h2o or oh guan et al 2011 the electron rich sites in carbons include oxygen containing groups e g phenolic oh zhang et al 2018 sun et al 2017 defects and edges as well as persistent free radicals fang et al 2015 qin et al 2018 oh can react with organic pollutants via addition elimination electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction while so4 prefers to attack organic pollutants via electron transfer yang et al 2021 chen et al 2022 apart from radical species nonradical species such as surface activated ps ps and surface bound radicals have also been reported in recent studies ps will initiate an electron transfer pathway from the electron donor pollutant to the acceptor carbon ps complex over the conductive graphitic network ren et al 2022 surface bound radicals can be generated through further ps decomposition and surface confinement which directly attack adjacent organic pollutants enriched on carbon surface wang et al 2015 the two non free radical pathways are

ph inorganic substrates e g cl and dissolved organics can affect the removal efficiency of organic pollutants in ps aops solution ph is a vital factor of carbon based systems chen et al 2019 yuan et al 2020 while existing reports on the impact of ph remained controversial for example the removal of benzo a pyrene were ph dependent ph 3 9 in the bc500 ps bc biochar system guo et al 2020 and the pollutant removal efficiencies followed the order of acidic neutral alkaline conditions on the contrary other researchers reported that the removal of pollutants such as phenol rhodamine b and sulfamethoxazole was ph independent within the ph range of 3 9 for co2 activated biochar ps sun et al 2020 carbon aerogel ps jiang et al 2018 and n doped bc900 ps ho et al 2019 and nanodiamond ps duan et al 2016 however the impacts of ph are complex on solution properties catalyst surface chemistry as well as the molecular states of organics ps theoretically ph could affect both the adsorption and degradation in carbon ps systems pi et al 2019 ouyang et al 2017 on one hand ph might affect the dissociation of pollutants and surface charge of carbonaceous materials zheng et al 2013 teixidó et al 2011 thus affecting their electrostatic adsorption or h bonding on the other hand ph might affect the dissociation of ps thereby influencing the interaction with carbonaceous materials as well as the generated reactive oxygen species ros zhao et al 2013 ji et al 2015 chen et al 2018 therefore the efficiency of carbon based aops ps can be ph dependent in this study three typical carbonaceous

in a water bath oscillator 150 rpm 25 c the catalytic degradation tests were performed with fixed amounts of smx 10 mg l 1 ps 5 mmol l 1 and carbonaceous materials 1 or 0 1 g l 1 the dose of carbonaceous materials depended on their different catalytic performances blank experiment with the sole presence of carbon or ps was also performed to evaluate the impacts of ph different buffers were adopted with 10 mmol l 1 acetate for ph 4 10 mmol l 1 phosphate for ph 7 and 10 mmol l 1 borate for ph 9 at the given time intervals samples were withdrawn from the reaction solution and filtered through a membrane of 0 45 μm methanol was immediately added to quench the reaction the smx concentration was determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters 2489 usa the filtered membrane after the reaction was freeze dried and extracted with methanol by ultrasound treatment to detect residual smx on the surface of carbonaceous materials for comparison to investigate the impacts of solution ph without buffering the initial solution ph was set as 4 7 and 9 using dilute naoh and hcl solutions all experiments were conducted in triplicate and mean values were presented the same batch test was conducted for the analysis of ros and degradation products of smx in different systems to clarify the dominant ros quenching experiment was performed briefly ethanol was added

supplementary material the effect of the humic acid ha inorganic anions such as cl on smx removal was investigated the catalytic performance of the carbon ps systems was also evaluated in real water

shimadzu japan 2 5 computational methodology density functional theory dft calculations were applied to analyze the most vulnerable sites of smx molecule through the fukui function value fk and adsorption energy between carbonaceous materials and ps or smx using materials studio software du et al 2018 the relevant calculating procedure was presented in text s6 supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalytic removal of smx at different ph smx oxidation by ps alone was ineffective 6 99 in the ph range of 4 9 fig s1 adding carbonaceous materials of pc ac and cnt enhanced smx removal in the presence of ps figs 1 a c and s2 in the pc ps pc 1 g l 1 system smx removal was highly ph dependent and the maximum removal efficiency reached 33 0 at ph 4 which was higher than that at ph 7 16 6 and ph 9 9 11 fig 1a however smx removal in ac ps and cnt ps systems ac cnt 1 g l 1 was less ph dependent and smx was almost completely removed 97 7 at different ph in 20 min fig s2 interestingly if we decreased the doses of ac and cnt to 0 1 g l 1 smx removal became ph sensitive like the pc ps system for ac ps smx removal efficiencies followed the order of ph 4 98 2 ph 7 85 3 ph 9 69 7 fig 1b for cnt ps smx removal efficiencies followed the order of ph 4 69 4 ph 7 51 7 ph 9 45 0 fig 1c the totally different effects of ph on smx removal under two doses 0 1 g l 1 and 1 g l 1 in ac ps and cnt ps systems could be ascribed to the ultrahigh loading of catalyst 1 g l 1 which rapidly attained complete smx removal under such circumstances it is hard to identify the ph impacts and the conclusion of ph independence might be unreasonable in fact several studies indicated that the removal of organic pollutants such as smx and p chloroaniline was ph independent in carbon ps systems ho et al 2019 yao et al 2019 relatively high doses of carbonaceous materials 0 5 5 g l 1 were adopted to achieve high removal efficiency therefore in this study 0 1 g l 1 of catalyst ac or cnt was chosen to estimate the effect of ph outcomes indicated that smx removal in all carbon ps systems was ph dependent and the removal rate followed the same order of acidic neutral alkaline conditions to further investigate the ph impacts on the smx removal unbuffered ph solutions were applied in different catalytic systems results showed that smx removal in the pc ps pc 1 g l 1 system was highly ph dependent fig s3a while smx removal in ac ps and cnt ps systems ac cnt 0 1 g l 1 was ph independent fig s3b c to clarify the phenomena the final solution ph after the reaction was monitored in the pc ps system final ph slightly decreased compared to initial ph specifically final ph decreased to 3 3 at ph0 4 5 2 at ph0 7 and 7 2 at ph0 9 fig s4 however in the ac ps and cnt ps systems the final ph values were less than 4 1 regardless of the initial ph note that the low final ph value was due to the generation of proton and acidic products such as bisulfate lau et al 2007 previous studies also observed the ph independent removal of pollutants in carbonaceous material ps in unbuffered ph systems jiang et al 2018 wang et al 2019 yao et al 2019 forouzesh et al 2019 in summary the reasons of ph independence observed in carbon ps systems might collectively include the decreased ph with the prolonged time a low concentration of pollutants and a high dose of carbonaceous material or ps consequently resulting in the fast pollutant removal kinetics to reveal the effect of ph both the buffered solution and dose of carbonaceous material were considered in this study if not otherwise noted the dose of pc ac and cnt was set as 1 g l 1 0 1 g l 1 and 0 1 g l 1 respectively in the following text we also investigate the effects of ph on smx adsorption as well as radical and nonradical contributions to smx degradation through two parts of explanations the inherent reason for ph impacts was comprehensively interpreted 3 2 effect of ph on the adsorption contribution in the smx removal smx adsorption decreased with the increase of ph for pc fig s5a the maximum adsorption removal was 26 5 at ph 4 after 120 min reaction which was much higher than that of 7 82 at ph 7 and 6 56 at ph 9 the smx adsorptive removal in ac and cnt 0 1 and 1 g l 1 systems was ph dependent similar to that in pc system figs s5b c s6 s8 and tables s1 s2 and the maximum adsorption was obtained at the acidic condition to investigate the adsorption mechanism the zeta potential of carbonaceous material and smx species were investigated the surface charge of carbonaceous materials was mostly negative at ph 4 9 and increasing ph resulted in more negative charges fig s9a smx at ph 4 was mainly in the form of smx0 whereas the majority of smx existed as smx at ph 7 and 9 fig s9b considering the negative charged carbonaceous material and smx0 smx electrostatic interaction might not account for the adsorption instead h bonding and π π electron donor acceptor interactions occurred between carbonaceous materials and smx which could be promoted at low ph teixidó et al 2011 ahmed et al 2017 therefore smx adsorption decreased with the increase of ph in all three systems to demonstrate the effect of ph on the adsorptive contribution of smx in the carbonaceous material ps system the experiment of adsorption equilibrium before adding ps was performed fig s10 results showed that the adsorption was favorable for the degradation process and both of them participated in the removal of smx in carbon ps system moreover the smx adsorption amount after the 120 min reaction was examined by a methanol extraction method and the corresponding degradation amount was achieved by deducting the adsorption amount in the pc ps system smx adsorptive removal followed the order of ph 4 13 4 ph 7 8 10 ph 9 1 01 in fig s11a which was consistent with the order of total smx removal indicating that ph might affect the smx removal via influencing smx adsorption by pc in the pc ps system a positive correlation r2 0 999 was established between smx adsorption in pc system and smx degradation in pc ps system fig s12a which indicated that smx adsorption impacted the degradation however smx degradation dominated the smx removal following an order of ph 4 19 6 ph 7 8 50 ph 9 8 10 these results suggested that ph could affect both adsorption and degradation processes in the pc ps system and the latter one determined smx removal efficiency smx adsorption in ac or cnt was also proportional to smx degradation in ac ps or cnt ps fig s12b c but the smx adsorptive removal in ac ps 0 21 2 63 and cnt ps 0 0 58 systems was relatively low fig s11b c which demonstrated that the degradation removal was responsible for smx removal in ac ps and cnt ps systems and ph did not impact the adsorption in these two systems to further demonstrate the contribution of adsorption the rate constant k obs of smx removal by adsorption carbons only and oxidation carbon ps was compared results showed that k obs of pc alone system at ph 4 0 013 min 1 was higher than that of the pc ps system 0 010 min 1 fig 1d the k obs value of pc alone at ph 7 0 0029 min 1 was half of that of the pc ps system 0 0058 min 1 the k obs value of pc alone at ph 9 0 0023 min 1 was slightly less than that of the pc ps system 0 0029 min 1 these results indicated that smx adsorption impacted the oxidation especially at ph 4 which was consistent with the results of fig s11a but degradation dominated smx removal the k obs value in pc and pc ps systems followed the same order of ph 4 ph 7 ph 9 further verifying that ph could affect both adsorption and degradation processes in the pc ps system but the latter one had a dominant contribution to smx removal the k obs values of ac or cnt alone system at the corresponding ph value were much smaller compared with that of ac ps or cnt ps fig 1e f which indicated considerable synergy effect between carbon and ps given the calculated synergy index 2 55 13 8 based on the previously reported literature hayati et al 2022 moradi et al 2022 the outcomes demonstrated the negligible roles of adsorption in ac ps and cnt ps systems compared to degradation fig s11b c verifying that ph should affect the degradation process instead of adsorption in these two systems besides the adsorption energy eads between ac and smx calculated by density functional theory dft zhang et al 2021 li et al 2018 was 0 49 ev which was much lower than that between ac and ps 1 54 ev fig 2 a b similarly the eads value of smx cnt 0 88 ev was 0 42 time of ps cnt 2 10 ev fig 2c d these results underlined that ps activation on carbonaceous materials was more thermodynamically favorable than smx adsorption therefore ph is more prone to affecting the reaction of carbonaceous material and ps consequently regulating the generation of ros for smx degradation 3 3 effect of ph on the degradation contribution in the smx removal both radical and nonradical pathways contributed to smx degradation in carbon ps systems and ph might affect the generation of ros or pathways 3 3 1 radicals epr dmpo tests were conducted to examine the species of free radicals results showed that the typical dmpo oh adduct with an intensity of 1 2 2 1 was observed in the pc ps system at ph 4 7 and 9 fig s13a demonstrating the generation of oh the intensity of dmpo oh adduct decreased as ph raised from 4 to 9 indicating that ph might affect smx degradation via influencing the formation of oh which was evidenced by the radical quenching test previous research reported that ethanol could quench so4 and oh anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 here in the pc ps system the addition of ethanol severely inhibited the smx removal at ph 4 from 33 0 to 15 4 ph 7 from 16 6 to 3 11 ph 9 from 9 11 to 1 82 fig 3 a suggesting the dominant role of radicals and the reduced amount of smx degradation followed the order of ph 4 ph 7 ph 9 further verifying that increased solution ph inhibited the formation of radicals the contributions of radical and nonradical oxidation to the smx degradation were obtained based on the above tests figs 1a 3a and s11a results showed that in the pc ps system radicals dominated smx degradation following an order of ph 4 17 6 ph 7 13 5 ph 9 7 29 fig 3d to further distinguish the roles of radicals including so4 and oh kinetics calculation was performed fig s14 and table s3 and the methodology was supplied in text s3 results showed that in the pc ps system so4 oxidation decreased with an increase in ph while oh oxidation was barely influenced by ph fig s15a although the signal of so4 could not be detected by epr in this study it might be because the peak intensity of so4 was much lower than that of oh and so4 could easily decay into oh yan et al 2019 these results collectively verified that the degradation of smx in pc ps system was affected by ph through influencing the formation of so4 and oh the intensity of dmpo oh adduct at ph 4 7 and 9 in ac ps system was much lower than that of pc ps system especially at ph 4 fig s13a b however ps decomposition and corresponding so4 2 generation from ps decomposition in the ac ps system was higher than that in the pc ps system figs s16 s17 the outcome indicated that surface bound radical might exist in this system but it could not be captured by the spin trapping agent in the bulk solution and detected by the epr test liang et al 2019 in the ac ps system ethanol addition suppressed the smx removal at ph 4 from 98 2 to 90 9 ph 7 from 85 3 to 76 3 ph 9 from 69 7 to 54 7 fig 3b which demonstrated the negligible roles of free radical compared to the radical pathway nonradical oxidation was mainly responsible for the smx degradation in the ac ps system 54 5 88 2 vs 7 39 15 0 and the contribution of nonradical oxidation for smx degradation decreased with the increase in ph fig 3e to further explore the roles of radicals and nonradical processes kinetics calculation was performed fig s14 in the ac ps system although radicals including so4 and oh were not the dominant reactive species ph could slightly influence the generation of radicals in this system and nonradical oxidation of smx decreased with increased ph fig s15b which was consistent with the ethanol quenching experiment these results verified that ph affected the generation of surface bound radicals in ac ps system although the intensity of dmpo oh adduct at ph 4 7 and 9 in the cnt ps system was comparable to that of pc ps fig s13a and c the degradation of smx was much higher in the cnt ps system combined with the negligible inhibition of the smx removal by ethanol in the cnt ps system fig 3c it implied that nonradical oxidation was mainly responsible for the smx degradation instead of radical oxidation in the cnt ps system like ac ps system ph could barely affect the generation of radicals in the cnt ps system nonradical oxidation was the dominant pathway 33 5 52 6 compared with the radical pathway 11 6 16 3 in the ac ps system and nonradical oxidation of smx decreased as ph increased fig 3f which was also verified by the kinetics calculation fig s15c therefore ph affected the nonradical pathway in the cnt ps system 3 3 2 nonradical species to probe the existence of singlet oxygen 1o2 furfuryl alcohol ffa quenching test at ph 4 9 was performed results showed that ffa addition could not apparently reduce smx removal at the different ph in all carbon ps systems fig s18 which suggested that the contribution of 1o2 could be excluded to investigate the potential electron transfer pathway linear sweep voltammetry lsv measurement at ph 4 9 was performed in pc ps and ac ps systems the current was not improved in the co presence of ps and smx under all the ph conditions in contrast in cnt ps the increase of current was observed with the addition of both ps and smx fig s19 which indicated the existence of the electron transfer pathway in the cnt ps systems which is different from pc ps and ac ps to further verify the role of electron transfer open circuit potential measurements were also conducted in the cnt ps systems the open circuit potential of cnt obviously increased upon adding ps and then gradually decreased after the addition of smx fig s20 in the electron transfer process the formation of carbon ps was the vital step ren et al 2022 a positive linear relationship was observed between potentials of cnt ps and k obs r2 0 8235 fig s20 at different ph in the cnt ps system implying the electron transfer process meanwhile the conductivity of cnt 21 9 s cm 1 was significantly higher than that of pc and ac 0 00104 0 0237 s cm 1 table 1 due to the highly conjugated π electron system in cnt fig s21 which facilitated surface electron transfer in the cnt ps systems therefore in the cnt ps system ps and smx first co adsorbed on cnt and ps was spontaneously activated into cnt ps complexes cnt ps when the redox potential of cnt ps exceeded the oxidation potential of smx cnt ps extract electrons from smx to attain oxidation however the contribution of the electron transfer pathway decreased with the increase in ph it might be due to the high redox potential of cnt ps at ph 4 moderate redox potential at ph 7 and low redox potential at ph 9 which resulted in the decreased potential gap between cnt ps and smx as we have mentioned surface bound radical was the primary ros in the ac ps system other studies emphasized that adsorption of organics was the key step for the surface bound radical dominant degradation wang et al 2015 duan et al 2018b smx and ps first co adsorbed onto ac and ps reacted with ac to generate the complexes with a weak field ligand which was different from the strong field ligand in the electron transfer process these complexes with the weak field ligand were prone to generate the surface bound radicals to directly oxidize smx however the role of surface bound radicals decreased with increased ph because solution ph affected the decomposition rate of complexes into surface bound radicals based on the abovementioned results we concluded that ph affected the generation of radicals such as so4 oh in the pc ps system ph affected the generation of surface bound radicals in the ac ps system ph affected the generation of nonradical electron transfer pathway in the cnt ps system 3 4 mechanism of ph dependence atr ftir tests were usually used to elucidate the surface bonding interaction between carbon fraction and ps chen et al 2015 in the original pc system oxygen containing functional groups table 1 including oh at 3300 cm 1 broad peak cooh cooc at 1700 cm 1 c o at 1600 cm 1 phenolic oh at 1400 cm 1 were observed at ph 4 9 fig 4 a keiluweit et al 2010 the contents of phenolic oh on pc at ph 4 9 before and after the oxidation reaction were investigated results showed that the peak intensity of phenolic oh on pc decreased with increased solution ph fig 4b which indicated that increasing ph was unfavorable for phenolic oh to react with ps to generate free radicals e g so4 and oh additionally compared to the original pc in the pc ps system the peak intensity of phenolic oh decreased for reacted pc especially at ph 4 where smx degradation was the highest which demonstrated that phenolic oh on pc participated in the degradation these results proved that oxygen containing functional groups particularly phenolic oh were correlated with the catalytic performance zhang et al 2018 fang et al 2014 moreover this was consistent with the reported literature that bc550 was produced at 550 c to obtain reactive phenolic oh which are the active sites for the effective degradation of chlorobenzene zhang et al 2018 in the ac system c o at 1600 cm 1 and c o c at 1100 cm 1 were observed on ac at ph 4 9 while phenolic o h could not be observed on ac figs 4c and s22 compared to the original ac c o c of ac in the ac ps system remarkably shifted from 1080 cm 1 to 1088 cm 1 and new peaks representing s o at 1049 cm 1 and 1157 cm 1 formed at ph 4 the red shift of c o c and intensity of s o decreased as ph raised from 4 to 7 the red shift of c o c continued to decrease as ph increased to 9 figs 4c and s22 the phenomenon demonstrated that strong surface interaction occurred between ac and ps due to the multiple pores or high surface area of ac fig s23 and table 1 huang and zhang 2019 and it decreased with the increase of ph verifying that contributions of surface bound radicals for smx degradation were ph dependent which followed the order of ph 4 ph 7 ph 9 fig s15b different from pc and ac cnt has few oxygen groups fig 4d verified by low o c value of cnt table 1 the graphitic carbon network of cnt tended to initiate the surface electron transfer process ren et al 2022 and the potential of cnt ps would decrease with the increase of ph fig s20 high ph is not beneficial for the formation of cnt ps herein possible catalytic mechanisms of ps activation by different carbonaceous materials were proposed as eqs 1 5 to further explore the degradation mechanism the degradation products of smx was monitored dft calculations by the fukui function were theoretically employed to elucidate the degradation mechanism for the smx molecule and the calculated fk value reflected that the most vulnerable site of smx was the benzene ring and the linked amine group followed by the s n bond and isoxazole ring table s4 and fig s24 in this study the degradation products of smx were identified table s5 and the intensity of degradation products in pc ps ac ps and cnt ps systems followed the same order of ph 4 ph 7 ph 9 fig s25 further demonstrating the higher smx degradation efficiency under the acidic condition than that of neutral and alkaline conditions to demonstrate the mineralization degree of smx degradation toc removal was determined result showed that toc removal in different carbon ps systems followed the same order of ph 4 ph 7 ph 9 fig s26 for example toc removal was 98 5 at ph 4 84 9 at ph 7 53 3 at ph 9 respectively in ac ps system toc removal in ac ps system was much higher than that of pc ps and cnt ps systems indicating the highest mineralization degree in the ac ps system moreover ac ps system showed the lowest toxicity i e the least inhibition of vibrio fischeri and the highest germination rate followed by cnt ps and pc ps figs s27 and s28 which was in accordance with the mineralization degree besides although the catalytic performance of carbons decreased after 3nd runs they could be recovered after the thermal treatment 400 c n2 atmosphere fig s29 1 pc ac s 2 o 8 2 p c ox a c ox so 4 so 4 2 2 smx cnt s 2 o 8 2 sm x ox cnt 2 so 4 2 3 so 4 h 2 o so 4 2 oh h 4 so 4 o h so 4 2 oh 5 so 4 oh nonradical smx sm x ox 3 5 influence of environmental factors and application potential in real water matrixes the influence of environmental factors including cl and ha on smx removal were investigated the addition of 10 mm cl significantly inhibited smx removal in pc ps system at all three ph values especially at ph 4 fig s30 because cl consumed the free radicals however the negligible effect was observed in the ac ps and cnt ps systems showing the advantages of nonradical pathway the presence of 10 mg l 1 ha inhibited the smx removal in all three carbon ps systems especially for the cnt ps system because ha could quench the free radical and hinder the surface mediated electron transfer wang et al 2019 the carbon ps system also showed appreciable smx removal 68 8 in the real water matrixes fig s31 which might be collectively affected by the ph value and the complex contents such as toc and cl table s6 moreover smx removal in the real water matrixes followed the order of pc ps cnt ps ac ps which was consistent with the result of investigated system mentioned above fig 1a c 4 conclusion our findings showed that smx degradation was ph dependent and the efficiency followed the order of acidic neutral alkaline conditions ph affected the generation of radicals e g so4 and oh surface bound radical and nonradical electron transfer ros pathways in pc ps ac ps and cnt ps systems consequently influencing smx degradation the degree of ph impact in different carbon ps systems can be distinct closely related to the ros pathways responsible for the smx degradation given ph environment the specific carbonaceous materials can be selected to remove the pollutants considering the manufacturing cost and functional characteristics of carbonaceous materials besides our work also found that ph independent removal of pollutants can be obtained in ac ps or cnt ps system in unbuffered solution apart from increasing ps or carbon dosage considering the buffering characteristics of wastewater a feasible treatment method was appreciated in which wastewater was changed to less buffered solution before carbon ps was adopted to further efficiently eliminate organics regardless of the initial solution ph since proton and acidic products were released in ps based aops this study provided new insight into the ph dependent mechanisms of carbon catalyzed ps activation and antibiotic degradation further work is required to shed light on the removal efficiency of different organic pollutants co existing environmental factors such as inorganic ion and organic matters will also affect the ph dependence and the application of carbon

15543,the impacts of ph on purification efficiency can be phenomenal in advanced oxidation processes aops because solution ph affects persulfate ps activation processes however consensus has not been reached on the regimes of ph regulated oxidation in persulfate based aops ps aops particularly the impacts of ph on carbon catalyzed generation of radical and nonradical species remain unclear in this work we evaluated three typical carbonaceous materials including pyrolytic carbon pc activated carbon ac and carbon nanotube cnt to activate ps for sulfamethoxazole smx degradation within a ph range from 4 to 9 the experiment revealed ph dependent smx removal in pc ps ac ps and cnt ps and the kinetics followed an order of ph 4 ph 7 ph 9 solution ph simultaneously affected smx adsorption and degradation but the latter was more profound chemical quenching experiment electrochemical measurement kinetics calculation and atr ftir tests collectively revealed that high ph was not favorable for both radical and nonradical oxidation in the pc ps system increased ph decreased the amount of phenolic oh on pc surface thereby restraining the generation of so4 and oh due to the lack of electron donors for ac ps system elevated ph hindered the interactions between ac and ps thus suppressing the formation of surface bound radicals cnt ps initiated an electron transfer pathway and increased ph reduced the oxidation potential of surface cnt ps complex which was not favorable for nonradical oxidation of adsorbed pollutants therefore outcomes of this work will advance the current knowledge on the intrinsic impacts of ph in ps aops catalyzed by carbonaceous materials for wastewater purification graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords carbon persulfate ph radicals nonradical data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction persulfate based advanced oxidation processes ps aops have been extensively applied to eliminate organic pollutants due to the high oxidative potential of sulfate radical so4 2 5 3 1 v hu and long 2016 wacławek et al 2017 oh et al 2016 transition metal based catalysts such as zerovalent iron and iron oxide are commonly used as ps activators however the possible metal leaching may induce secondary pollution and the development of metal free activators will address such issue recently the carbonaceous materials are efficient nonmetal activators in ps aops due to their characteristics such as rich porosity and large specific surface area ssa abundant surface functional groups and conjugated π electron system duan et al 2018a nie et al 2019 liang et al 2019 in nonmetal ps aops systems carbonaceous materials directly act as electron donors to ps to generate so4 and so4 may further convert to hydroxyl radical oh through oxidizing h2o or oh guan et al 2011 the electron rich sites in carbons include oxygen containing groups e g phenolic oh zhang et al 2018 sun et al 2017 defects and edges as well as persistent free radicals fang et al 2015 qin et al 2018 oh can react with organic pollutants via addition elimination electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction while so4 prefers to attack organic pollutants via electron transfer yang et al 2021 chen et al 2022 apart from radical species nonradical species such as surface activated ps ps and surface bound radicals have also been reported in recent studies ps will initiate an electron transfer pathway from the electron donor pollutant to the acceptor carbon ps complex over the conductive graphitic network ren et al 2022 surface bound radicals can be generated through further ps decomposition and surface confinement which directly attack adjacent organic pollutants enriched on carbon surface wang et al 2015 the two non free radical pathways are determined by ssa and porosity wang et al 2015 conductivity ahn et al 2016 graphitic degree ren et al 2022 structural defects of carbonaceous materials shao et al 2020 water background factors such as ph inorganic substrates e g cl and dissolved organics can affect the removal efficiency of organic pollutants in ps aops solution ph is a vital factor of carbon based systems chen et al 2019 yuan et al 2020 while existing reports on the impact of ph remained controversial for example the removal of benzo a pyrene were ph dependent ph 3 9 in the bc500 ps bc biochar system guo et al 2020 and the pollutant removal efficiencies followed the order of acidic neutral alkaline conditions on the contrary other researchers reported that the removal of pollutants such as phenol rhodamine b and sulfamethoxazole was ph independent within the ph range of 3 9 for co2 activated biochar ps sun et al 2020 carbon aerogel ps jiang et al 2018 and n doped bc900 ps ho et al 2019 and nanodiamond ps duan et al 2016 however the impacts of ph are complex on solution properties catalyst surface chemistry as well as the molecular states of organics ps theoretically ph could affect both the adsorption and degradation in carbon ps systems pi et al 2019 ouyang et al 2017 on one hand ph might affect the dissociation of pollutants and surface charge of carbonaceous materials zheng et al 2013 teixidó et al 2011 thus affecting their electrostatic adsorption or h bonding on the other hand ph might affect the dissociation of ps thereby influencing the interaction with carbonaceous materials as well as the generated reactive oxygen species ros zhao et al 2013 ji et al 2015 chen et al 2018 therefore the efficiency of carbon based aops ps can be ph dependent in this study three typical carbonaceous materials including pyrolytic carbon pc commercial activated carbon ac and carbon nanotubes cnt were selected to understand the influence of ph on carbon ps systems a broad ph range ph 4 9 was investigated we specifically investigate the effects of ph on 1 the removal performance using antibiotic sulfamethoxazole smx as the model pollutant 2 the adsorption contribution and 3 degradation

in a water bath oscillator 150 rpm 25 c the catalytic degradation tests were performed with fixed amounts of smx 10 mg l 1 ps 5 mmol l 1 and carbonaceous materials 1 or 0 1 g l 1 the dose of carbonaceous materials depended on their different catalytic performances blank experiment with the sole presence of carbon or ps was also performed to evaluate the impacts of ph different buffers were adopted with 10 mmol l 1 acetate for ph 4 10 mmol l 1 phosphate for ph 7 and 10 mmol l 1 borate for ph 9 at the given time intervals samples were withdrawn from the reaction solution and filtered through a membrane of 0 45 μm methanol was immediately added to quench the reaction the smx concentration was determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters 2489 usa the filtered membrane after the reaction was freeze dried and extracted with methanol by ultrasound treatment to detect residual smx on the surface of carbonaceous materials for comparison to investigate the impacts of solution ph without buffering the initial solution ph was set as 4 7 and 9 using dilute naoh and hcl solutions all experiments were conducted in triplicate and mean values were presented the same batch test was conducted for the analysis of ros and degradation products of smx in different systems to clarify the dominant ros quenching experiment was performed briefly ethanol was added to the reaction solution prior to the addition of ps to investigate the contributions of free radicals anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 furfuryl alcohol ffa was used as a quencher to identify the role of singlet oxygen 1o2 meng et al 2020 to identify the electron transfer process electrochemical tests including linear sweep voltammetry lsv and open circuit potential measurements were conducted yun et al 2017 wang et al 2019 ren et al 2019 the details of electrochemical tests are shown in text s2 supplementary material to distinguish the contributions of so4 oh and nonradical pathway to smx degradation competitive kinetic experiment was performed based on the previously reported method dong et al 2020 liang et al 2021 yin et al 2020 the details of the tests were displayed in text s3 supplementary material the effect of the humic acid ha inorganic anions such as cl on smx removal was investigated the catalytic performance of the carbon ps systems was also evaluated in real water matrixes including lake water piggery wastewater and landfill leachate 2 4 analysis methods smx nb and ba were analyzed by hplc with a uv visible detector at wavelengths of 265 262 and 227 nm respectively athena c18 wp column 5 μm 4 6 mm 250 mm was used to separate the target organics for quantification the mobile phase with a flow rate of 0 8 ml min 1 was made of acetonitrile and 0 1 formic acid 65 35 v v the oxidation products of smx were identified by uhplc ms the detailed methodology of uhplc ms analysis was shown in text s4 supplementary material the toxicity was evaluated by

used for detecting free radicals on epr emx 8 2 7c bruker germany the concentration of ps was measured by spectrophotometrical method using ki lee et al 2015 solution ph was measured by a ph meter mettler delta 320 switzerland the concentration of so4 2 was analyzed by an ionic chromatographic analyzer ics 5000 thermo fisher the mineralization degree was determined by a toc analyzer toc v shimadzu japan 2 5 computational methodology density functional theory dft calculations were applied to analyze the most vulnerable sites of smx molecule through the fukui function value fk and adsorption energy between carbonaceous materials and ps or smx using materials studio software du et al 2018 the relevant calculating procedure was presented in text s6 supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalytic removal of smx at different ph smx oxidation by ps alone was ineffective 6 99 in the ph range of 4 9 fig s1 adding carbonaceous materials of pc ac and cnt enhanced smx removal in the presence of ps figs 1 a c and s2 in the pc ps pc 1 g l 1 system smx removal was highly ph dependent and the maximum removal efficiency reached 33 0 at ph 4 which was higher than that at ph 7 16 6 and ph 9 9 11 fig 1a however smx removal in ac ps and cnt ps systems ac cnt 1 g l 1 was less ph dependent and smx was almost completely removed 97 7 at different ph in 20 min fig s2 interestingly if we decreased the doses of ac and cnt to 0 1 g l 1 smx removal became ph sensitive like the pc ps system for ac ps smx removal efficiencies followed the order of ph 4 98 2 ph 7 85 3 ph 9 69 7 fig 1b for cnt ps smx removal efficiencies followed the order of ph 4 69 4 ph 7 51 7 ph 9 45 0 fig 1c the totally different effects of ph on smx removal under two doses 0 1 g l 1 and 1 g l 1 in ac ps and cnt ps systems could be ascribed to the ultrahigh loading of catalyst 1 g l 1 which rapidly attained complete smx removal under such circumstances it is hard to identify the ph impacts and the conclusion of ph independence might be unreasonable in fact several studies indicated that the removal of organic pollutants such as smx and p chloroaniline was ph independent in carbon ps systems ho et al 2019 yao et al 2019 relatively high doses of carbonaceous materials 0 5 5 g l 1 were adopted to achieve high removal efficiency therefore in this study 0 1 g l 1 of catalyst ac or cnt was chosen to estimate the effect of ph outcomes indicated that smx removal in all carbon ps systems was ph dependent and the removal rate followed the same order of acidic neutral alkaline conditions to further investigate the ph impacts on the smx removal unbuffered ph solutions were applied in different catalytic systems results showed that smx removal in the pc ps pc 1 g l 1 system was highly ph dependent fig s3a while smx removal in ac ps and cnt ps systems ac cnt 0 1 g l 1 was ph independent fig s3b c to clarify the phenomena the final solution ph after the reaction was monitored in the pc ps system final ph slightly decreased compared to initial ph specifically final ph decreased to 3 3 at ph0 4 5 2 at ph0 7 and 7 2 at ph0 9 fig s4 however in the ac ps and cnt ps systems the final ph values were less than 4 1 regardless of the initial ph note that the low final ph value was due to the generation of proton and acidic products such as bisulfate lau et al 2007 previous studies also observed the ph independent removal of pollutants in carbonaceous material ps in unbuffered ph systems jiang et al 2018 wang et al 2019 yao et al 2019 forouzesh et al 2019 in summary the reasons of ph independence observed in carbon ps systems might collectively include the decreased ph with the prolonged time a low concentration of pollutants and a high dose of carbonaceous material or ps consequently resulting in the fast pollutant removal kinetics to reveal the effect of ph both the buffered solution and dose of carbonaceous material were considered in this study if not otherwise noted the dose of pc ac and cnt was set as 1 g l 1 0 1 g l 1 and 0 1 g l 1 respectively in the following text we also investigate the effects of ph on smx adsorption as well as radical and nonradical contributions to smx degradation through two parts of explanations the inherent reason for ph impacts was comprehensively interpreted 3 2 effect of ph on the adsorption contribution in the smx removal smx adsorption decreased with the increase of ph for pc fig s5a the maximum adsorption removal was 26 5 at ph 4 after 120 min reaction which was much higher than that of 7 82 at ph 7 and 6 56 at ph 9 the smx adsorptive removal in ac and cnt 0 1 and 1 g l 1 systems was ph dependent similar to that in pc system figs s5b c s6 s8 and tables s1 s2 and the maximum adsorption was obtained at the acidic condition to investigate the adsorption mechanism the zeta potential of carbonaceous material and smx species were investigated the surface charge of carbonaceous materials was mostly negative at ph 4 9 and increasing ph resulted in more negative charges fig s9a smx at ph 4 was mainly in the form of smx0 whereas the majority of smx existed as smx at ph 7 and 9 fig s9b considering the negative charged carbonaceous material and smx0 smx electrostatic interaction might not account for the adsorption instead h bonding and π π electron donor acceptor interactions occurred between carbonaceous materials and smx which could be promoted at low ph teixidó et al 2011 ahmed et al 2017 therefore smx adsorption decreased with the increase of ph in all three systems to demonstrate the effect of ph on the adsorptive contribution of smx in the carbonaceous material ps system the experiment of adsorption equilibrium before adding ps was performed fig s10 results showed that the adsorption was favorable for the degradation process and both of them participated in the removal of smx in carbon ps system moreover the smx adsorption amount after the 120 min reaction was examined by a methanol extraction method and the corresponding degradation amount was achieved by deducting the adsorption amount in the pc ps system smx adsorptive removal followed the order of ph 4 13 4 ph 7 8 10 ph 9 1 01 in fig s11a which was consistent with the order of total smx removal indicating that ph might affect the smx removal via influencing smx adsorption by pc in the pc ps system a positive correlation r2 0 999 was established between smx adsorption in pc system and smx degradation in pc ps system fig s12a which indicated that smx adsorption impacted the degradation however smx degradation dominated the smx removal following an order of ph 4 19 6 ph 7 8 50 ph 9 8 10 these results suggested that ph could affect both adsorption and degradation processes in the pc ps system and the latter one determined smx removal efficiency smx adsorption in ac or cnt was also proportional to smx degradation in ac ps or cnt ps fig s12b c but the smx adsorptive removal in ac ps 0 21 2 63 and cnt ps 0 0 58 systems was relatively low fig s11b c which demonstrated that the degradation removal was responsible for smx removal in ac ps and cnt ps systems and ph did not impact the adsorption in these two systems to further demonstrate the contribution of adsorption the rate constant k obs of smx removal by adsorption carbons only and oxidation carbon ps was compared results showed that k obs of pc alone system at ph 4 0 013 min 1 was higher than that of the pc ps system 0 010 min 1 fig 1d the k obs value of pc alone at ph 7 0 0029 min 1 was half of that of the pc ps system 0 0058 min 1 the k obs value of pc alone at ph 9 0 0023 min 1 was slightly less than that of the pc ps system 0 0029 min 1 these results indicated that smx adsorption impacted the oxidation especially at ph 4 which was consistent with the results of fig s11a but degradation dominated smx removal the k obs value in pc and pc ps systems followed the same order of ph 4 ph 7 ph 9 further verifying that ph could affect both adsorption and degradation processes in the pc ps system but the latter one had a dominant contribution to smx removal the k obs values of ac or cnt alone system at the corresponding ph value were much smaller compared with that of ac ps or cnt ps fig 1e f which indicated considerable synergy effect between carbon and ps given the calculated synergy index 2 55 13 8 based on the previously reported literature hayati et al 2022 moradi et al 2022 the outcomes demonstrated the negligible roles of adsorption in ac ps and cnt ps systems compared to degradation fig s11b c verifying that ph should affect the degradation process instead of adsorption in these two systems besides the adsorption energy eads between ac and smx calculated by density functional theory dft zhang et al 2021 li et al 2018 was 0 49 ev which was much lower than that between ac and ps 1 54 ev fig 2 a b similarly the eads value of smx cnt 0 88 ev was 0 42 time of ps cnt 2 10 ev fig 2c d these results underlined that ps activation on carbonaceous materials was more thermodynamically favorable than smx adsorption therefore ph is more prone to affecting the reaction of carbonaceous material and ps consequently regulating the generation of ros for smx degradation 3 3 effect of ph on the degradation contribution in the smx removal both radical and nonradical pathways contributed to smx degradation in carbon ps systems and ph might affect the generation of ros or pathways 3 3 1 radicals epr dmpo tests were conducted to examine the species of free radicals results showed that the typical dmpo oh adduct with an intensity of 1 2 2 1 was observed in the pc ps system at ph 4 7 and 9 fig s13a demonstrating the generation of oh the intensity of dmpo oh adduct decreased as ph raised from 4 to 9 indicating that ph might affect smx degradation via influencing the formation of oh which was evidenced by the radical quenching test previous research reported that ethanol could quench so4 and oh anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 here in the pc ps system the addition of ethanol severely inhibited the smx removal at ph 4 from 33 0 to 15 4 ph 7 from 16 6 to 3 11 ph 9 from 9 11 to 1 82 fig 3 a suggesting the dominant role of radicals and the reduced amount of smx degradation followed the order of ph 4 ph 7 ph 9 further verifying that increased solution ph inhibited the formation of radicals the contributions of radical and nonradical oxidation to the smx degradation were obtained based on the above tests figs 1a 3a and s11a results showed that in the pc ps system radicals dominated smx degradation following an order of ph 4 17 6 ph 7 13 5 ph 9 7 29 fig 3d to further distinguish the roles of radicals including so4 and oh kinetics calculation was performed fig s14 and table s3 and the methodology was supplied in text s3 results showed that in the pc ps system so4 oxidation decreased with an increase in ph while oh oxidation was barely influenced by ph fig s15a although the signal of so4 could not be detected by epr in this study it might be because the peak intensity of so4 was much lower than that of oh and so4 could easily decay into oh yan et al 2019 these results collectively verified that the degradation of smx in pc ps system was affected by ph through influencing the formation of so4 and oh the intensity of dmpo oh adduct at ph 4 7 and 9 in ac ps system was much lower than that of pc ps system especially at ph 4 fig s13a b however ps decomposition and corresponding so4 2 generation from ps decomposition in the ac ps system was higher than that in the pc ps system figs s16 s17 the outcome indicated that surface bound radical might exist in this system but it could not be captured by the spin trapping agent in the bulk solution and detected by the epr test liang et al 2019 in the ac ps system ethanol addition suppressed the smx removal at ph 4 from 98 2 to 90 9 ph 7 from 85 3 to 76 3 ph 9 from 69 7 to 54 7 fig 3b which demonstrated the negligible roles of free radical compared to the radical pathway nonradical oxidation was mainly responsible for the smx degradation in the ac ps system 54 5 88 2 vs 7 39 15 0 and the contribution of nonradical oxidation for smx degradation decreased with the increase in ph fig 3e to further explore the roles of radicals and nonradical processes kinetics calculation was performed fig s14 in the ac ps system although radicals including so4 and oh were not the dominant reactive species ph could slightly influence the generation of radicals in this system and nonradical oxidation of smx decreased with increased ph fig s15b which was consistent with the ethanol quenching experiment these results verified that ph affected the generation of surface bound radicals in ac ps system although the intensity of dmpo oh adduct at ph 4 7 and 9 in the cnt ps system was comparable to that of pc ps fig s13a and c the degradation of smx was much higher in the cnt ps system combined with the negligible inhibition of the smx removal by ethanol in the cnt ps system fig 3c it implied that nonradical oxidation was mainly responsible for the smx degradation instead of radical oxidation in the cnt ps system like ac ps system ph could barely affect the generation of radicals in the cnt ps system nonradical oxidation was the dominant pathway 33 5 52 6 compared with the radical pathway 11 6 16 3 in the ac ps system and nonradical oxidation of smx decreased as ph increased fig 3f which was also verified by the kinetics calculation fig s15c therefore ph affected the nonradical pathway in the cnt ps system 3 3 2 nonradical species to probe the existence of singlet oxygen 1o2 furfuryl alcohol ffa quenching test at ph 4 9 was performed results showed that ffa addition could not apparently reduce smx removal at the different ph in all carbon ps systems fig s18 which suggested that the contribution of 1o2 could be excluded to investigate the potential electron transfer pathway linear sweep voltammetry lsv measurement at ph 4 9 was performed in pc ps and ac ps systems the current was not improved in the co presence of ps and smx under all the ph conditions in contrast in cnt ps the increase of current was observed with the addition of both ps and smx fig s19 which indicated the existence of the electron transfer pathway in the cnt ps systems which is different from pc ps and ac ps to further verify the role of electron transfer open circuit potential measurements were also conducted in the cnt ps systems the open circuit potential of cnt obviously increased upon adding ps and then gradually decreased after the addition of smx fig s20 in the electron transfer process the formation of carbon ps was the vital step ren et al 2022 a positive linear relationship was observed between potentials of cnt ps and k obs r2 0 8235 fig s20 at different ph in the cnt ps system implying the electron transfer process meanwhile the conductivity of cnt 21 9 s cm 1 was significantly higher than that of pc and ac 0 00104 0 0237 s cm 1 table 1 due to the highly conjugated π electron system in cnt fig s21 which facilitated surface electron transfer in the cnt ps systems therefore in the cnt ps system ps and smx first co adsorbed on cnt and ps was spontaneously activated into cnt ps complexes cnt ps when the redox potential of cnt ps exceeded the oxidation potential of smx cnt ps extract electrons from smx to attain oxidation however the contribution of the electron transfer pathway decreased with the increase in ph it might be due to the high redox potential of cnt ps at ph 4 moderate redox potential at ph 7 and low redox potential at ph 9 which resulted in the decreased potential gap between cnt ps and smx as we have mentioned surface bound radical was the primary ros in the ac ps system other studies emphasized that adsorption of organics was the key step for the surface bound radical dominant degradation wang et al 2015 duan et al 2018b smx and ps first co adsorbed onto ac and ps reacted with ac to generate the complexes with a weak field ligand which was different from the strong field ligand in the electron transfer process these complexes with the weak field ligand were prone to generate the surface bound radicals to directly oxidize smx however the role of surface bound radicals decreased with increased ph because solution ph affected the decomposition rate of complexes into surface bound radicals based on the abovementioned results we concluded that ph affected the generation of radicals such as so4 oh in the pc ps system ph affected the generation of surface bound radicals in the ac ps system ph affected the generation of nonradical electron transfer pathway in the cnt ps system 3 4 mechanism of ph dependence atr ftir tests were usually used to elucidate the surface bonding interaction between carbon fraction and ps chen et al 2015 in the original pc system oxygen containing functional groups table 1 including oh at 3300 cm 1 broad peak cooh cooc at 1700 cm 1 c o at 1600 cm 1 phenolic oh at 1400 cm 1 were observed at ph 4 9 fig 4 a keiluweit et al 2010 the contents of phenolic oh on pc at ph 4 9 before and after the oxidation reaction were investigated results showed that the peak intensity of phenolic oh on pc decreased with increased solution ph fig 4b which indicated that increasing ph was unfavorable for phenolic oh to react with ps to generate free radicals e g so4 and oh additionally compared to the original pc in the pc ps system the peak intensity of phenolic oh decreased for reacted pc especially at ph 4 where smx degradation was the highest which demonstrated that phenolic oh on pc participated in the degradation these results proved that oxygen containing functional groups particularly phenolic oh were correlated with the catalytic performance zhang et al 2018 fang et al 2014 moreover this was consistent with the reported literature that bc550 was produced at 550 c to obtain reactive phenolic oh which are the active sites for the effective degradation of chlorobenzene zhang et al 2018 in the ac system c o at 1600 cm 1 and c o c at 1100 cm 1 were observed on ac at ph 4 9 while phenolic o h could not be observed on ac figs 4c and s22 compared to the original ac c o c of ac in the ac ps system remarkably shifted from 1080 cm 1 to 1088 cm 1 and new peaks representing s o at 1049 cm 1 and 1157 cm 1 formed at ph 4 the red shift of c o c and intensity of s o decreased as ph raised from 4 to 7 the red shift of c o c continued to decrease as ph increased to 9 figs 4c and s22 the phenomenon demonstrated that strong surface interaction occurred between ac and ps due to the multiple pores or high surface area of ac fig s23 and table 1 huang and zhang 2019 and it decreased with the increase of ph verifying that contributions of surface bound radicals for smx degradation were ph dependent which followed the order of ph 4 ph 7 ph 9 fig s15b different from pc and ac cnt has few oxygen groups fig 4d verified by low o c value of cnt table 1 the graphitic carbon network of cnt tended to initiate the surface electron transfer process ren et al 2022 and the potential of cnt ps would decrease with the increase of ph fig s20 high ph is not beneficial for the formation of cnt ps herein possible catalytic mechanisms of ps activation by different carbonaceous materials were proposed as eqs 1 5 to further explore the degradation mechanism the degradation products of smx was monitored dft calculations by the fukui function were theoretically employed to elucidate the degradation mechanism for the smx molecule and the calculated fk value reflected that the most vulnerable site of smx was the benzene ring and the linked amine group followed by the s n bond and isoxazole ring table s4 and fig s24 in this study the degradation products of smx were identified table s5 and the intensity of degradation products in pc ps ac ps and cnt ps systems followed the same order of ph 4 ph 7 ph 9 fig s25 further demonstrating the higher smx degradation efficiency under the acidic condition than that of neutral and alkaline conditions to demonstrate the mineralization degree of smx degradation toc removal was determined result showed that toc removal in different carbon ps systems followed the same order of ph 4 ph 7 ph 9 fig s26 for example toc removal was 98 5 at ph 4 84 9 at ph 7 53 3 at ph 9 respectively in ac ps system toc removal in ac ps system was much higher than that of pc ps and cnt ps systems indicating the highest mineralization degree in the ac ps system moreover ac ps system showed the lowest toxicity i e the least inhibition of vibrio fischeri and the highest germination rate followed by cnt ps and pc ps figs s27 and s28 which was in accordance with the mineralization degree besides although the catalytic performance of carbons decreased after 3nd runs they could be recovered after the thermal treatment 400 c n2 atmosphere fig s29 1 pc ac s 2 o 8

application potential in real water matrixes the influence of environmental factors including cl and ha on smx removal were investigated the addition of 10 mm cl significantly inhibited smx removal in pc ps system at all three ph values especially at ph 4 fig s30 because cl consumed the free radicals however the negligible effect was observed in the ac ps and cnt ps systems showing the advantages of nonradical pathway the presence of 10 mg l 1 ha inhibited the smx removal in all three carbon ps systems especially for the cnt ps system because ha could quench the free radical and hinder the surface mediated electron transfer wang et al 2019 the carbon ps system also showed appreciable smx removal 68 8 in the real water matrixes fig s31 which might be collectively affected by the ph value and the complex contents such as toc and cl table s6 moreover smx removal in the real water matrixes followed the order of pc ps cnt ps ac ps which was consistent with the result of investigated system mentioned above fig 1a c 4 conclusion our findings showed that smx degradation was ph dependent and the efficiency followed the order of acidic neutral alkaline conditions ph affected the generation of radicals e g so4 and oh surface bound radical and nonradical electron transfer ros pathways in pc ps ac ps and cnt ps systems consequently influencing smx degradation the degree of ph impact in different carbon ps systems can be distinct closely related to the ros pathways responsible for the smx degradation given ph environment the specific carbonaceous materials can be selected to remove the pollutants considering the manufacturing cost and functional characteristics of carbonaceous materials besides our work also found that ph independent removal of pollutants can be obtained in ac ps or cnt ps system in unbuffered solution apart from increasing ps or carbon dosage considering the buffering characteristics of wastewater a feasible treatment method was appreciated in which wastewater was changed to less buffered solution before carbon ps was adopted to further efficiently eliminate organics regardless of the initial solution ph since proton and acidic products were released in ps based aops this study provided new insight into the ph dependent mechanisms of carbon catalyzed ps activation and antibiotic degradation further work is required to shed light on the removal efficiency of different organic pollutants co existing environmental factors such as inorganic ion and organic matters will also affect the ph dependence and the application of carbon based systems in the treatment of complex wastewater credit authorship contribution statement jun liang conceptualization methodology writing original draft kexin chen methodology formal analysis

15544,with increasing global water tensions the need for a comprehensive water management framework in persistent harsh conditions is crucial a framework was designed to devise a comprehensive and detailed plan that can strike a balance between all water resources and demands in contrast to previous studies this framework can be adopted for long lasting severe climatic conditions and suggests detailed cultivation patterns and reservoir management the framework adopts a comprehensive detailed novel multi objective and evolutionary based approach for optimal water management during continuous extreme events in sectors including agriculture industry and the environment sustainability ecological water demand and global warming potential economic welfare and equitability are allocation principles this framework utilizes complex metaheuristic algorithms that enable it to cope with big data and optimize complex systems with high precision for the case study of the karkheh basin the results show that for a full recovery of the hoor al azim wetland the basin cannot bear the agricultural water demand and such activities must be decreased drastically it is also shown that

decades the severity of floods and droughts in both frequency and magnitude has intensified due to climate change although harsh climates have historically been a human concern new trends in droughts indicate that the water balance in most regions is in a most fragile state and needs immediate attention such conditions are especially concerning in arid and semi arid regions not only the competition between different sectors for the allocation of water for agricultural industrial and domestic uses but also environmental concerns about the excessive use of aquifers during severe droughts reveal the importance of having a comprehensive policy and water allocation schemes abrishamchi et al 2007 masih et al 2009 muthuwatta et al 2010 nikoo et al 2019 shourian et al 2008 tayerani charmchi et al 2021b the very epitome of the above challenge can be seen in an arid to semi arid karkheh basin in western iran the water allocation scheme for each agricultural ecological industrial and domestic sector has been an ongoing debate as the karkheh basin economy is interwoven with the agriculture sector and it contributes to a large part of the khuzestan province s gross domestic product meanwhile the life of the iranian part of the hoor al azim wetland depends on the water that is provided by the karkheh river in the last 10 years of drought immense pressure has been put on the hoor al azim and due to the ignorance of the ecological demands of this wetland part of it has been destroyed and animal species have been exposed to extinction moreover this negligence has caused the hoor al azim wetland to become the center of intense dust storms in western iran which endangers the health of many citizens every year davtalab et al 2014 sarzaeim et al 2017 a wide range of research has been conducted to find optimal water allocation schemes among the existing methodologies two methods are more pervasive water allocation based on pinch analysis pa tayerani charmchi et al 2021a skouteris et al 2018 ng et al 2007 jia et al 2020 and water allocation based on equilibrium theory tayerani charmchi et al 2021a skouteris et al 2018 jia et al 2020 the main drawback of the former approach is that it cannot capture the trade off between different objectives equilibrium theory is the other commonly used approach in water allocation schemes the underlying idea of this method is to equitably distribute the water budget among different sectors xu et al 2019a as is discussed the persistent severe climate conditions impose arduous challenges on water management to consider all aspects of the water allocation scheme an advanced algorithm is required that can strike a balance between the different goals of a saucerful water allocation scheme metaheuristic algorithms are computational intelligence paradigms specifically used for the sophisticated solving of optimization problems one of the major metaheuristic optimization algorithms is particle swarm optimization pso abdel basset et al 2018 pso imitates the motion of a flock of birds in nature to elaborate this algorithm works based on particle movement and determines the best path via location position and velocity control abbasnia r shayanfar m khodam a n d abbasnia r shayanfar m khodam a n d to increases the performance of the classical pso algorithm in the current study an upgraded version of pso is implemented that is characterized by limiting the velocity of the particles this approach is known as speed constrained multi objective pso smpso which is capable of producing new effective particle positions in cases in which the emerged velocity is too large nebro et al 2009a dong et al 2022 hatamkhani and moridi 2021 additionally to guarantee that the obtained water allocation scheme is sustainable several factors must be taken into consideration first of all the water distribution among sectors should be done in a way that fulfills the ecological water demand second it is vital that the proposed water allocation scheme is without any discrimination to avoid some objectives being sacrificed for one or more other objectives observing these two criteria can ensure that the proposed water allocation plan is sustainable third the global warming potential of agricultural activities is considered as a separate objective to minimize so as to make sure the proposed water allocation scheme is also sustainable from the perspective of climate change fairness is another important pillar of sustainable development xu et al 2019a one of the most widely used perspectives to evaluate fairness is intragenerational equity the concentration of this criterion is on the fair administrating of common resources within the current or future generations kverndokk and rose n d the gini coefficient is one of the most popular indicators for intragenerational equity and has been widely used to evaluate the fairness of water resources allocation holden et al 2014 renard et al 2019 furthermore in the existing literature there are other perspectives through which to evaluate the equity of water allocation such as intergenerational fairness holden et al 2014 one of the famous criteria of this group is the bentham rawls welfare function which consists of two aspects the weighted sum of the conventional net present welfare bentham and the welfare of the worst off generation rawls tol 2013 alvarez cuadrado and van long 2009 this criterion is capable of compromising with the inner temporal water allocation scheme in an effort to maximize the social welfare function in developing regions there has always been heated debate among local farmers and regulatory officials about confining agricultural activities due to ecological concerns especially when agriculture is the main source of income for the local farmers local farmers accuse the high ranking legislative bodies of not taking their economic concerns into account for this reason local farmers believe that methods should be considered that cover their economic concerns in addition to environmental concerns to this end the current study examines and compares two water allocation scenarios the first scenario s main objective is to fully satisfy the ecological water demand by reducing agricultural activities the second scenario which is preferable to local farmers compromises the allocated ecological water by striking a balance between agricultural activities and ecological water demand this study compares these two scenarios to investigate what the water allocation scheme will look like for each of them and whether it is still possible to revive the hoor al azim wetland while the allocated ecological water is compromised for agricultural activities under the second scenario finding the optimal water management strategy especially in extreme events is the main question that the present study tries to answer such water resource allocation schemes can dramatically improve resilience in water systems furthermore the optimal water management strategy can avoid instability and conflicts due to water stress the following points highlight the novelty and importance of this research a novel framework has been developed for both the water allocation scheme and the calculation of its threshold in extreme events 4d and 3d evolutionary based multi objective optimization has been designed for the water system and the optimal crop cultivation pattern has been obtained the framework has been implemented for the karkheh basin and the optimal scenarios of the water allocation scheme for different sectors and multi crop cultivation patterns for 10 years of extreme drought have been carried out 2 description of the study area the present study focuses on the south karkheh subbasin fig 1 which is a semi arid region located in the southwest of iran between 31 to 32 northern latitude and 48 to 49 eastern longitude this subbasin consists of five subcatchments dasht e abbas dosalegh arayez hamidiyeh and azadegan karkheh dam in this subbasin in the northwest of khuzestan has been operational since 2002 with the aim of irrigating 320 000 hectares of agricultural lands and generating hydroelectric power masih et al 2010 as well as helping to preserve and sustain the hoor al azim as a vital ramsar site for the ecology of the subbasin the 10 main crops of this subbasin are winter wheat barley maize beans cucumber tomato watermelon alfalfa sorghum and rapeseed in this study a comprehensive water allocation scheme in the case of a 10 year long extreme drought is developed with the goal of minimizing the damage to the hoor al azim or in some cases fully reviving it by meeting the required ecological water demand and maximizing the agricultural profit the input parameters of the proposed framework are listed in table 1 these parameters must be adjusted for different region 3 methodology the schematic of the framework is presented in fig 2 the detailed schematic of the framework is illustrated in appendix i 3 1 synthetic streamflow generation there are two types of approaches to synthetic streamflow generation indirect and direct in the indirect method the input parameters of a hydrologic model such as precipitation and temperature series are fed to climate models to indirectly generate synthetic streamflow steinschneider et al 2015 direct approaches use statistical techniques directly on the historical data of streamflow to produce synthetic streamflow the current study implements the direct approach the two main classes of direct methods are the bootstrap method and autoregressive ar models the main drawback of the bootstrap method is that it cannot generate a time series with autocorrelation on the other hand ar models are developed to generate autocorrelated timeseries the first order markovian autoregressive model can be named as one of the first models of this group generally ar models have the ability to capture the historic autocorrelation the biggest issue with ar models is that they impose intra annual stationarity in the correlation structure hence any changes in the rainfall runoff relationship due to the infiltration rates and evapotranspiration is ignored for these reasons neither autoregressive models nor bootstrap based methods can correctly account for seasonal changes and precisely reproduce the historic autocorrelation of historic data at the same time in the current study the kirsch method kirsch et al 2013a is implemented which can properly address the shortcomings of both the bootstrap and the ar models this method is capable of producing autocorrelated time series that can properly take into account the autocorrelation function and the seasonal correlation structure the foundation of this method is based on modified fractional gaussian noise one of the most important advantages of modified fractional gaussian noise is that it can preserve the seasonal patterns in the correlation structure additionally this method can precisely reproduce the autocorrelation of the historic record therefore the kirsch method is capable of overcoming the drawbacks of the ar and bootstrap methods the kirsch method s steps can be summarized as follows herman et al 2015 kasprzyk et al 2013 kirsch et al 2013b synthetic streamflow generation n d transform the historical streamflow data from real space to log space and standardize them obtain the uncorrelated matrix of historical data by bootstrapping the log space historical matrix obtain the historical data correlation matrix by using cholesky decomposition generate a standardized synthetic dataset by imposing the historical correlation matrix upon the uncorrelated matrix to preserve the seasonal correlation de standardize the generated synthetic data and convert them back into real space repeat above steps with shifting historical dataset by 6 months to preserve year to year correlation karkheh river hydrological data have been collected from eight gauging stations the hydrological data are adopted from the dataset of the iran water resource management company iran water resource management company n d fig 3 illustrates the flow duration curve of the karkheh river for 2 000 synthetic realizations as is shown the fig 3 the synthetic dataset is generated in a way that it consists of extremely low flow rates with higher frequency while preserving the general correlation to historic data based on the flow duration curve a 10 year extreme drought is generated fig 4 indicates the statistical assessment of the monthly synthetic hydrological variables that are generated from a 20 member ensemble of the synthetic dataset for 1000 realizations fig 4 a compares the synthetic and historical monthly flow rate of the karkheh river as is shown the tails and mean fig 4 b of the synthetic variables have lower values compared to the historical data this demonstrates that the synthetic flow generation method has generated drought conditions properly the minimum and mean of synthetic values are lower than the historical values fig 4 c compares the standard deviations of synthetic streamflow and its historical values this comparison illustrates that the synthetic streamflow generation algorithm successfully generates a synthetic dataset that has the same standard deviation as the historical dataset in other words although the synthetic data can intensify the magnitude and frequency of extreme conditions they preserve the rhythm and spread of historical data as the generated synthetic data are not normally distributed levene s test was employed to statistically prove that the variance of synthetic and historical data is identical the p values associated with levene s test are indicated in fig 4 d the results show that none of the synthetic variances are dissimilar at a certain level of 0 05 black bold line based on the obtained synthetic streamflow dataset a 10 year scenario for the karkheh river s mass flow rate with respect to extreme drought was generated fig 5 each point in fig 5 represents the total inflow of the karkheh dam in million cubic meters mcm of water per month points between vertical lines indicate the most severe 2 year drought condition over the 10 year period the results show that if such a situation occurs more than 2 years in a row the water system balance should be considered broken and all agricultural and industrial activities must be stopped immediately of course this threshold varies according to the amount of initial water storage in the dam 3 2 scenarios as discussed above two water allocation scenarios are considered in this study the reduced agricultural activities scenario and the compromised allocated ecological water scenario the first scenario s main objective is to satisfy the ecological water demand by reducing agricultural activities in this scenario the agricultural activities that consume the biggest portion of the karkheh river inflow must be decreased to the lowest value or even zero at certain times during a 10 year period the three objectives in this scenario are to minimize the gini coefficient of the five subcatchment areas to minimize the global warming potential of crops and to maximize the total agricultural benefit the second scenario on the other hand compromises allocated ecological water by striking a balance between agricultural activities and ecological water demand in such a water allocation scheme although the water demands required for the complete restoration of the wetland are not provided the amount of water allocated to hoor al azim is maximized this water allocation scheme is considered to be more practical because the livelihood of the people of this region depends highly on agriculture and it is unlikely that local leaders or authorities would bear the cost of stopping agricultural activities in addition to the three objectives of the reduced agricultural activities scenario the compromised allocated ecological water scenario has a fourth objective of maximizing the ecological water demand although not all the water needed for the full recovery of hoor al azim is provided 3 3 annual agricultural benefit as discussed above the main income of the people of this area is from agriculture because the karkheh basin is a semi arid region finding a water allocation scheme for a multi crop cultivation pattern is of great importance the annual agricultural benefit for the multi crop cultivation pattern

potential gwp is an indicator that can reveal the severity of ghg emissions caused by agricultural activities and it is measured in co2 equivalent a goal of this study is to minimize the gwp the total gwp kg co2 eq ha 1 consists of ghg emissions from farming practices including fertilizers biocide herbicide insecticide and fungicide machinery practices farm tillage and electricity consumption for irrigation the total gwp is calculated as follows li et al 2020 4 g w p t g w p f e r t i l i z e r g w p b i o c i d e g w p m a c h i n e r y g w p e l e c t r i c i t y here g w p f e r t i l i z e

quantify inequality in resource allocation lopes et al 2015 nishi et al 2015 therefore considering the gini coefficient creates a path that can help local authorities to allocate water in times of drought to different subcatchments without triggering conflict and dispute among local leaders though it will decrease the total income of the subbasin the gini coefficient for water allocation can be quantified as xu et al 2019b 9 g i n i 1 t t 1 t 1 2 n i 1 n w t i a b t i x 1 n y 1 n w t x a b t x w t y a b t y where t and n are the number of years and subcatchments respectively w t n indicates the allocated water for year t and subcatchment n and can be defined as 10 w t n c 1 c e t a t n c a t n c n where n and c represent days in a month and the number of crops respectively the main reason for implementing the gini index is to distribute the water budget equitably among subcatchments to illustrate let us consider a case in which the gini index is not included in the model because one of the objectives of the metaheuristic algorithm is to maximize the total agricultural net benefit the model will give the whole water budget to the biggest subcatchment in this study azadegan in this case other subcatchments will not receive any water for agricultural activities this is not acceptable to local farmers because it is not an equitable water allocation scheme by implementing the gini index as an objective and trying to minimize it the algorithm can reach an optimal solution that resolves this problem and fulfills the fairness of the framework 3 6 constraints and decision variables each objective function is subject to constraints and calculated by certain pools of decision variables in this section the constraints and decision variables are discussed eq 1 is subject to the following 11 p c a t c y t c c c a t c 0 c c a n d t t this guarantees that the benefit of farmland activities is not negative eq 2 is subject to the following 12 0 7 e t m i e t a t c e t m i c c t t a n d i n here e t a t c is a decision variable and the previous constraint was applied on the e t a t c bound by changing the coefficient of e t m i the length of the decision variable bound can be changed this constraint guarantees that crops will receive enough irrigation the lower bound of this constraint is irrigation under water stress and the upper bound demonstrates irrigation without any water stress on the crop for the former the crop yield is at its highest value while for the latter the crop yield decreases hence irrigation under water stress will result in saving water at the expense of sacrificing revenue therefore by setting this constraint the optimization algorithm can decide whether it is beneficial to put water stress on crops or not and whether it is beneficial e t a t c is a decision variable the total area under cultivation for each subcatchment can be obtained as the following 13 a t s u b c a t c h m e n t c 1 n a t c eq 13 is subject to the following 14 0 a t s u b c a t c h m e n t a m a x s u b c a t c h m e n t this constraint is meant to make sure that the assigned farmland for each subcatchment by the optimization algorithm is not higher than the available farmland in each subcatchment eq 9 is subject to the following 15 g i n i t 1 t t this constraint is meant to make sure that the gini index stays within a reasonable bounds during the persistent drought the water balance equation for this system can be quantified as follows 16 w b t d i t w s w t a w d t e w d t d w d t i w d t e t d s t 17 s t s t 1 w b t here wb and s represent balance and dam storage respectively the subscript t shows the current time step s 0 is the amount of water stored in the dam at the start of 10 years of extreme drought eq 17 is subject to 18 s t l c d t t by applying this constraint the dam storage will not go below the least capacity of dam 1600 m c m is the lcd of the karkheh dam including dead storage capacity and the ecological demand behind the dam nikoo et al 2019 to elaborate eq 16 calculates the required changes in the dam storage for each time step and eq 17 updates the current time step dam storage with respect to the required changes which are calculated in eq 16 by applying eq 18 as a constraint the metaheuristic approach can control that the dam storage does not fall below the least storage capacity of the dam in each time step based on the water allocation scheme two kinds of ecological water demand can be defined as decision variables 19 m e d e w d t here med shows the minimum ecological demand for the current work med is the amount of water that will fully restore hoor al azim wetland this bound is used for the water allocation scheme that does not compromise ecological water demand hence by applying this constraint the ecological water demand will be fully provided on the other hand the ecological water demand constraint for the water allocation scheme that compromises ecological water demand can be defined as follows 20 0 e w d t m e d this constraint allows the optimization algorithm to choose values lower than the required ecological demand in this case another objective function is added which can be defined as the following 21 m a x i m i z e t 1 t e w d t this objective is added to make sure that although the optimization algorithm is allowed to assign less ecological water than what is required the optimization algorithm tries to maximize the allocated ecological water in an effort to minimize the damages imposed by not fully satisfying the ecological water demand 3 7 optimization algorithm in the current study a speed constrained multi objective pso smpso algorithm nebro et al 2009b is implemented for multi objective optimization the pso algorithm is inspired by the social behavior of fish schooling or bird flocking kennedy and eberhart 1995 in the family of pso algorithms the population of solutions is called a swarm and each potential solution is known as a particle the core of the pso algorithm s update for the i th particle x i at generation t can be expressed as 22 x i t x i t 1 v i t where v i t is the velocity of the i th particle at generation and t is defined as 23 v i t w v i t 1 c 1 r 1 x p i x i c 2 r 2 x g i x i here x p i is the best solution that the i th particle x i has encountered on the other hand x g i represents the best particle leader that the entire swarm has encountered for controlling the trade off between the local and global experience parameter w is introduced which is also known as the inertia weight of the particle c 1 and c 2 are introduced to control the effect of the personal and global best particles respectively in addition r1 and r2 are two random variables drawn from uniform distribution in the range 0 1 for controlling the particle s velocity smpso utilizes a constriction coefficient χ as well as a mechanism that further bounds the accumulated velocity in each particle a detailed discussion about the proposed constriction coefficient and implemented constraints in smpso can be found in clerc and kennedy 2002 4 results the pareto frontier obtained from the speed constrained multi objective pso algorithm for the compromised allocated ecological water scenario and the reduced agricultural activities scenario is illustrated in figs 6 and fig 7 respectively the compromised allocated ecological water scenario seeks to strike a balance between agricultural water demand gwp and gini coefficient by compromising with ecological water demand in contrast the reduced agricultural activities scenario does not compromise ecological water demand in this scenario all the water that is needed to recover the hoor al azim will be supplied in 10 years needless to say the agriculture revenue in the reduced agricultural activities scenario is less than in the compromised allocated ecological water scenario both choosing between the scenarios and choosing the optimum point from the pareto frontier of each scenario depends on the decision makers there is also a system threshold for water balance if the karkheh dam inflow is either similar to the drought scenario between the dashed red lines in fig 5 for more than 2 years or it is less than that for 1 year in any time window in 10 years the water system should be considered broken and all the karkheh dam inflow should be dumped into the hoor al azim as shown in fig 6 the total allocated ecological water for the compromised allocated ecological water scenario varies from almost 0 to about 6 400 mcm choosing the total allocated ecological water from this range is dependent on the decision makers in contrast to this scenario s pareto frontier the total ecological allocated water is constant and equal to the ecological water demand for the hoor al azim wetland in 10 years for all of the pareto optimal points the comparison of fig 7 and fig 6 illustrates that the agricultural revenue in the reduced agricultural activities scenario is much less than in the compromised allocated ecological water scenario on the other hand although the gini coefficient of both scenarios expands from 0 2 to about 0 8 the concentration of a higher gini coefficient in the reduced agricultural activities scenario s pareto optimal points is higher the difference between agricultural revenue in the reduced agricultural activities scenario and the compromised allocated ecological water scenario is the amount of money from farmers pockets that is spent to conserve the hoor al azim wetland this amount can be compensated by subsidies or other incentives from fig 7 and fig 6 and based on the pareto optimal solution the total amount of compensation can be calculated the exact policy of such subsidies and their effect on the gini coefficient can be investigated in future studies 4 1 optimally allocated agriculture water for the proposed water allocation schemes the natural question arises of when where and how many hectares of which type of crops should be cultivated for instance in a situation in which the decision has been made to allocate about 4 000 mcm of water to the ecological sector in the compromised allocated ecological water scenario the question is what the crops cultivation pattern will be before answering this question it is vital to answer how much water should be allocated to the agricultural sector the optimal amount of water that is allocated to the agricultural sector under the compromised allocated ecological water scenario and the reduced agricultural activities scenario are represented the in figs 8 and fig 9 respectively the water consumption of each crop is calculated based on the fao equation eq 2 for deficit irrigation johl 1979 as is shown in fig 8 regarding the compromised allocated ecological water in the first 2 years of drought subcatchments azadegan with 170 and 300 mcm and dosalegh with 200 and 180 mcm have the largest share of water consumption for agriculture azadegan with 60 000 ha and dosalegh with 17 140 ha have the biggest and lowest potential cultivation area among the other subcatchments the trends among the different subcatchments illustrate that the amount of water allocated for the agricultural demand in azadegan for years 1 to 4 does not vary much however this amount experiences a peak in year 5 600 mcm and then decreases until year 9 100 mcm in the 10th year this figure experiences another peak 420 mcm other subcatchments also show the same periodic pattern but with a different frequency and peak which depend on the potential cultivation area and the irrigation efficiency of each subcatchment the irrigation efficiencies of these subcatchments are approximately the same ranging from 45 to 50 the results of the stochastic multi objective optimization of the compromised allocated ecological water scenario water scheme illustrate that each subcatchment has a unique frequency for agricultural water allocation to elaborate the amount of water allocated to each subcatchment for agricultural activities follows a sinusoidal behavior for example let us assume the allocated agricultural water to azadegan in the first 5 years as is shown in fig 8 the amount of allocated agricultural water starts increasing from approximately 150 mcm in the 1st year to 320 mcm roughly double in the 2nd year however the latter amount starts to decrease in the 3rd and 4th year after the 4th year the allocated agricultural water starts to rise again to 600 mcm these fluctuations exhibit a sinusoidal behavior additionally results indicate that each subcatchment follows this behavior with its own frequency in other words the agricultural water allocated to each subcatchment increases and decreases in its own time intervals different from other subcatchments in this study the unique frequency for agricultural water allocation periodicity is referred to this phenomenon the optimal allocated agricultural water for the reduced agricultural activities scenario is demonstrated in fig 9 the comparison between fig 8 and fig 9 reveals that in the reduced agricultural activities scenario the main focus is on crops with a higher water resistance such as rapeseed and beans what can also be seen is that crop diversity has decreased in the reduced agricultural activities scenario the results show that approaching the last years of drought under the reduced agricultural activities scenario reduces the diversity of agricultural products as is illustrated in fig 9 the subcatchments dasht e abbas 0 3 mcm in the 1st year and arayez 0 4 mcm in the 2nd year of droughts have the largest share of agricultural water consumption it is worth mentioning again that azadegan has the biggest cultivation area among other subcatchments the trends between different years show that similarly to the compromised allocated ecological water scenario the water allocation for agriculture increases and decreases periodically between drought years the decrease in water allocation intensifies in the last few years in general the amount of cultivation in the reduced agricultural activities scenario is significantly reduced and in each subcatchment one crop per year is the dominant crop based on this reduction the optimal amount of subsidies for each subcatchment for each crop can be calculated for 10 years the subsidy regime calculated based on this framework is optimal from two perspectives minimizing the gini coefficient and supplying the full amount of water needed for ecological demand 4 2 cultivation pattern the area under cultivation of each subcatchment in each year of the compromised allocated ecological water scenario is presented in fig 10 only the cultivation pattern under this scenario is discussed because the crop cultivation for the reduced agricultural activities must decrease to close to zero comparing figs 8 and 10 reveals that the area under cultivation for each crop also follows a certain pattern fig 10 demonstrates the percentage of land that is under cultivation for each subcatchment this percentage increases as the allocated water for the agricultural demands increases but how many hectares of each subcatchment should go under cultivation in other words what will be the crops cultivation pattern for each subcatchment fig 11 indicates the crops cultivation pattern for 10 years under extreme water stress and under the compromised allocated ecological water scenario ten main crops winter wheat barley maize beans cucumber tomato watermelon alfalfa sorghum and rapeseed historically cultivated by the local farmers have been considered for the cultivation pattern in this region fig 11 a shows the cultivation pattern for the subcatchment dasht e abbas with potential farmland of 19 024 ha as is shown in fig 11 a at the start of the drought period only 6 000 to 9 000 ha of this subcatchment should be going under cultivation the main crops for this period are cucumber 1st year 2200 ha 35 beans 2nd year 1800ha 23 and rapeseed 3rd year 4000ha 37 in the smaller subcatchments such as dasht e abbas crops with less resistance to water stress i e with higher water demand have the largest portion such crops have a higher net benefit for instance as it is shown in fig 11 in dasht e abbas cucumber consumes the largest portion of water in the 1st year of drought 60 mcm meanwhile cucumber makes a higher profit in comparison to a crop more resistant to water stress such as wheat in the same area under cultivation in contrast during the climax of the drought period the percentage under cultivation for winter wheat and maize increases this trend continues to the point at which in the last year of the drought winter wheat has the highest portion 170 mcm 20 fig 11 e shows the crops cultivation scheme in azadegan which with 60 000 ha of farmland is the biggest subcatchment this subcatchment is of great importance because it accounts for the largest share in both the water consumption and economic benefits of the basin as it is shown in fig 11 e wheat cultivation in this area accounts for a small percentage and in the first few years the concentration is on cucumber 2nd year 7 500 ha 30 and watermelon 3rd year 10 000 ha 60 in the period of the climax however barley 5th year 8 000 ha 30 and tomato 6th year 22 000 ha 75 constitute the dominant percentage of cultivation the same conclusion can be inferred for other subcatchments 4 3 dam storage and allocated ecological water the important questions regarding the proposed water allocation schemes are whether these schemes satisfy the requirement of the karkheh dam for electricity generation and how karkheh dam water storage will vary in 10 years under this water allocation scheme fig 12 illustrates how the amount of storage water will vary in 10 years based on the compromised allocated ecological water scheme in the three 1st years by cultivating crops with higher water demand and profit but with less area under cultivation the amount of stored water for the peak of the drought period will increase 6 000 mcm the rate of water usage then decreases by cultivating crops with higher resistance to water stress the feasibility study indicates that if the climax of the drought period lasts more than 2 years in a row any water allocation scheme is infeasible and the water balance will be broken in this situation the dam valves should remain open and all the inflow should be allocated to the ecological water demand this also depends on the initial storage of the dam the present study considers the initial storage as 5 000 mcm which is the threshold for the studied drought scenario based on the reduced agricultural activities scheme in the three 1st years similarly to the compromised allocated ecological water scenario crops with both higher water demand and profit should be cultivated however this amount is significantly less for the reduced agricultural activities scenario and the dominant share of water is allocated to ecological demand each year in the reduced agricultural activities scenario identically to the compromised allocated ecological water scenario the amount of stored water is increased to reach its peak in the 18th month of the drought period 5 500 mcm the rate of water usage then decreases by cultivating crops with higher resistance to water stress the allocation of the ecological water demand is another aspect of this water allocation scheme the cumulative allocated ecological water for both the compromised allocated ecological water scenario and the reduced agricultural activities scenario is represented in fig 13 for the compromised allocated ecological water scenario the maximum optimal allocated ecological water is 6 427 mcm less than half of the minimum bound 16 000 mcm this value also can vary with the initial storage as discussed this value is obtained from the compromised allocated ecological water scenario which compromises with ecological water demand in other words in the compromised allocated ecological water scenario economic profit is the main focus in contrast the reduced agricultural activities scenario s main focus is the ecological demand for retrieving the hoor al azim wetland although the ecological demand is fully met in this scenario the economic benefit is decreased both scenarios are optimized and both scenarios water allocation scheme is optimal therefore deciding which water allocation scheme should be implemented depends on the decision makers and whether they want to compromise the ecological water demand or not on the other hand for the reduced agricultural activities scenario the maximum optimal allocated ecological water is 16 000 mcm the minimum total amount that is needed to preserve the hoor al azim this value also can vary with the initial storage this amount of ecological water demand is obtained from the reduced agricultural activities scenario that does not compromise ecological water demand to summarize in the reduced agricultural activities scenario the focus is not economic profit but rather the ecological demand for conserving and retrieving the hoor al azim wetland 4 4 fitted pareto curve the fitted surface to the pareto optimal solution for the compromised allocated ecological water scenario and the reduced agricultural activities scenario is represented in fig 14 and 15 respectively this curve represents the trends between objectives and predicts the values of objectives in the case of higher water availability higher net benefit as is shown in fig 14 the net benefit and gini coefficient have a roughly linear direct relation in other words the net benefits increase with the increase of the gini coefficient hence although employing a compromised allocated ecological water scenario will lead to higher agricultural benefits it will also lead to a higher gini coefficient on the other hand the slope of this trend increases when the value of gwp increases this means that the sensitivity of the gini coefficient to net benefit can vary by the value of the gwp the higher the gwp the more sensitive the gini coefficient to the net benefit the net benefit and gwp have a direct non linear relation this means the net benefit is more sensitive to gwp in comparison to the gini coefficient to elaborate the value of the gwp can have a higher impact on the net benefit than the gini coefficient the sensitivity between the net benefit and the gwp increases as the gini coefficient increases this means that in a more unequal situation not only is the figure of the net benefit and the gwp higher but a change in one of them also results in a higher change in another one thus the resilience of the system can be maintained by keeping the value of the gini coefficient low as shown in fig 15 for the fitted curve to the pareto optimal solutions for the reduced agricultural activities scenario the values of different objectives can be estimated all the points on this curve satisfy the needed ecological demand for conserving the hoor al azim wetland fig 15 shows that the gini coefficient and net benefit do not have a linear relationship anymore with the increase of the net benefit the figure of the gini coefficient increases fast at the beginning and more slowly when it reaches approximately 0 4 after 0 4 the slope of the net benefit increases the increment of this slope increases by shifting up the net benefit curve in addition the lowest slope of the curve moves backward this reveals that for the higher net benefit the gini coefficient increases faster and makes the water allocation scheme more vulnerable to inequity in contrast with the relationship between the gini coefficient and the net benefit in the compromised allocated ecological water scenario in the reduced agricultural activities scenario there is a point in each line where the net benefit is at the highest possible value and the gini coefficient is between 0 2 to 0 5 however the amount of the gwp is also at the highest value it should be noted that the main difference between the pareto fitted surfaces of the reduced agricultural activities and the compromised allocated ecological water scenarios is that in the former scenario the concavity of the surface is downward but in the latter scenario the concavity of the surface is upward therefore the compromised allocated ecological water scenario has a lower limit for the net benefit while the reduced agricultural activities scenario has an upper limit for the net benefit this illustrates that the reduced agricultural activities scenario is bounded by the net benefit and the net benefit cannot be arbitrarily increased however the compromised allocated ecological water scenario is not bounded on the net benefit and the net benefit can be increased as much as desired at the cost of sacrificing other objectives fig 16 and 17 illustrate the coloration between each objective under the compromised allocated ecological water scenario and the reduced agricultural activities scenario respectively as is illustrated in fig 16 with the increase of the net benefit both the gini coefficient and the gwp increase moreover the gini coefficient can impose a limitation on both the gwp and the net benefit for instance although the gwp can increase up to 7 mton co2 eq if the gini coefficient is less than 0 2 the net benefit cannot exceed 7 million usd in contrast if the gwp is lower than 20 mton co2 eq the net benefit cannot increase by more than 4 million usd the whole trade off between these three objectives can be inferred from fig 16 as is illustrated in fig 17 identically to the compromised allocated ecological water scenario the gini coefficient can impose a limitation on the net benefit and the gwp for example although the gwp can increase up to 17 5 tons co2 eq if the gini coefficient is less than 0 2 the net benefit cannot exceed 0 8 million usd in contrast if the gwp is lower than 2 5 ton co2 eq the net benefit cannot increase by more than 0 2 million usd the most important difference between the reduced agricultural activities scenario and the compromised allocated ecological water scenario is that the sensitivity of the gwp and the net benefit to the gini coefficient is much higher than the compromised allocated ecological water scenario this shows that keeping the gini coefficient within the reasonable bound in the case of supplying the total needed ecological water is more difficult because the water allocation scheme is much more sensitive figs 16 and 17 can be used by the decision makers to find out given a certain amount of net benefit what the gwp and the gini coefficient will be furthermore the gini coefficient under the compromised allocated ecological water and the reduced agricultural activities scheme is represented in fig 18 the gini coefficient of 10 years for the compromised allocated ecological water scenario shows that as the drought progresses the gini coefficient increases similarly for the reduced agricultural activities scenario the gini coefficient increases as the drought continues however this upsurge in the reduced agricultural activities scenario is higher in comparison to the compromised allocated ecological water scenario and it will lead to higher inequality 5 discussion results indicate that although the optimal allocated agricultural water can vary slightly due to the stochastic nature of the current methodology the periodicity of each subcatchment remains constant for each pareto optimal solution and different from other pareto optimal solutions on the pareto surface in other words the periodicity changes from one point to another point on the pareto surface if the chosen point is from the same coordinates of the pareto surface this periodicity will remain constant while the amount of the allocated agricultural water can vary slightly finding this robust periodicity that is not affected by the uncertainty for each subcatchment can strike a balance between agricultural benefit equity and sustainability among all subcatchments of course this periodicity changes for different water systems and can be calculated using the developed framework in other words finding the optimal water allocation scheme is boiled down to finding the periodicity of each subcatchment the relation between different objectives shows that with the increase of the net benefit both the gini coefficient and the gwp increase moreover the gini coefficient can impose a limitation on both the gwp and the net benefit the most important difference between different scenarios is that the sensitivity of the gwp and the net benefit to the gini coefficient of one scenario can be much higher than in other scenarios this shows that keeping the gini coefficient within the reasonable bound in the case of supplying the total needed ecological water is more difficult because the water allocation scheme is much more sensitive furthermore results show that as the drought progresses the gini coefficient increases however this upsurge in one scenario can be higher in comparison to other scenarios which will lead to higher inequality in general the results indicate that the higher agricultural net benefit will lead to a faster increase of the gini coefficient and make the water allocation scheme more vulnerable to inequity 6 conclusion in the present research study a novel evolutionary based framework is introduced that can calculate the 10 year optimal water allocation scheme for different sectors from agricultural and industrial uses to ecological water demand two main scenarios are considered for evolutionary optimization the first is to consider the allocated ecological water demand as an objective function and try to maximize it on this basis the second considers a fixed amount and optimizes other objective functions three other objective functions are the net benefit the global warming potential gwp and the gini coefficient in the reduced agricultural activities scenario the main priority is to fulfill ecological water demand while in the compromised allocated ecological water scenario although one of the objectives is to maximize the ecological water demand the priority is to maximize agricultural benefit the comparison between these two pareto frontiers for the karkheh basin reveals that in the case of the full recovery of the hoor al azim the basin cannot bear the agricultural water demand and such activities must be decreased drastically the fitted pareto curve for both scenarios is obtained to investigate the relation between objective functions the relation between objectives for the reduced agricultural activities scenario illustrates that the increase of the net benefit will result in a fast increase in the gini coefficient up to approximately 0 4 the interesting result from this correlation is that the higher agricultural net benefit will lead to a faster increase of the gini coefficient and make the water allocation scheme more vulnerable to inequity the trends in the reduced agricultural activities scenario and the compromised allocated ecological water scenario demonstrate that the gini coefficient can impose a limitation on the net benefit and gwp however the sensitivity to the gini coefficient in the two scenarios is different in the reduced agricultural activities scenario the sensitivity of the gwp and net benefit to the gini coefficient is much higher than in the compromised allocated ecological water scenario therefore preserving the gini coefficient in the reasonable value in the case of supplying the total ecological water demand is more difficult because the water allocation scheme is more sensitive in the compromised allocated ecological water scenario on the other hand the net benefit is more sensitive to gwp

15544,with increasing global water tensions the need for a comprehensive water management framework in persistent harsh conditions is crucial a framework was designed to devise a comprehensive and detailed plan that can strike a balance between all water resources and demands in contrast to previous studies this framework can be adopted for long lasting severe climatic conditions and suggests detailed cultivation patterns and reservoir management the framework adopts a comprehensive detailed novel multi objective and evolutionary based approach for optimal water management during continuous extreme events in sectors including agriculture industry and the environment sustainability ecological water demand and global warming potential economic welfare and equitability are allocation principles this framework utilizes complex metaheuristic algorithms that enable it to cope with big data and optimize complex systems with high precision for the case study of the karkheh basin the results show that for a full recovery of the hoor al azim wetland the basin cannot bear the agricultural water demand and such activities must be decreased drastically it is also shown that

decades the severity of floods and droughts in both frequency and magnitude has intensified due to climate change although harsh climates have historically been a human concern new trends in droughts indicate that the water balance in most regions is in a most fragile state and needs immediate attention such conditions are especially concerning in arid and semi arid regions not only the competition between different sectors for the allocation of water for agricultural industrial and domestic uses but also environmental concerns about the excessive use of aquifers during severe droughts reveal the importance of having a comprehensive policy and water allocation schemes abrishamchi et al 2007 masih et al 2009 muthuwatta et al 2010 nikoo et al 2019 shourian et al 2008 tayerani charmchi et al 2021b the very epitome of the above challenge can be seen in an arid to semi arid karkheh basin in western iran the water allocation scheme for each agricultural ecological industrial and domestic sector has been an ongoing debate as the karkheh basin economy is interwoven with the agriculture sector and it contributes to a large part of the khuzestan province s gross domestic product meanwhile the life of the iranian part of the hoor al azim wetland depends on the water that is provided by the karkheh river in the last 10 years of drought immense pressure has been put on the hoor al azim and due to the ignorance of the ecological demands of this wetland part of it has been destroyed and animal species have been exposed to extinction moreover this negligence has caused the hoor al azim wetland to become the center of intense dust storms in western iran which endangers the health of many citizens every year davtalab et al 2014 sarzaeim et al 2017 a wide range of research has been conducted to find optimal water allocation schemes among the existing methodologies two methods are more pervasive water allocation based on pinch analysis pa tayerani charmchi et al 2021a skouteris et al 2018 ng et al 2007 jia et al 2020 and water allocation based on equilibrium theory tayerani charmchi et al 2021a skouteris et al 2018 jia et al 2020 the main drawback of the former approach is that it cannot capture the trade off between different objectives equilibrium theory is the other commonly used approach in water allocation schemes the underlying idea of this method is to equitably distribute the water budget among different sectors xu et al 2019a as is discussed the persistent severe climate conditions impose arduous challenges on water management to consider all aspects of the water allocation scheme an advanced algorithm is required that can strike a balance between the different goals of a saucerful water allocation scheme metaheuristic algorithms are computational intelligence paradigms specifically used for the sophisticated solving of optimization problems one of the major metaheuristic optimization algorithms is particle swarm optimization pso abdel basset et al 2018 pso imitates the motion of a flock of birds in nature to elaborate this algorithm works based on particle movement and determines the best path via location position and velocity control abbasnia r shayanfar m khodam a n d abbasnia r shayanfar m khodam a n d to increases the performance of the classical pso algorithm in the current study an upgraded version of pso is implemented that is characterized by limiting the velocity of the particles this approach is known as speed constrained multi objective pso smpso which is capable of producing new effective particle positions in cases in which the emerged velocity is too large nebro et al 2009a dong et al 2022 hatamkhani and moridi 2021 additionally to guarantee that the obtained water allocation scheme is sustainable several factors must be taken into consideration first of all the water distribution among sectors should be done in a way that fulfills the ecological water demand second it is vital that the proposed water allocation scheme is without any discrimination to avoid some objectives being sacrificed for one or more other objectives observing these two criteria can ensure that the proposed water allocation plan is sustainable third the global warming potential of agricultural activities is considered as a separate objective to minimize so as to make sure the proposed water allocation scheme is also sustainable from the perspective of climate change fairness is another important pillar of sustainable development xu et al 2019a one of the most widely used perspectives to evaluate fairness is intragenerational equity the concentration of this criterion is on the fair administrating of common resources within the current or future generations kverndokk and rose n d the gini coefficient is one of the most popular indicators for intragenerational equity and has been widely used to evaluate the fairness of water resources allocation holden et al 2014 renard et al 2019 furthermore in the existing literature there are other perspectives through which to evaluate the equity of water allocation such as intergenerational fairness holden et al 2014 one of the famous criteria of this group is the bentham rawls welfare function which consists of two aspects the weighted sum of the conventional net present welfare bentham and the welfare of the worst off generation rawls tol 2013 alvarez cuadrado and van long 2009 this criterion is capable of compromising with the inner temporal water allocation scheme in an effort to maximize the social welfare function in developing regions there has always been heated debate among local farmers and regulatory officials about confining agricultural activities due to ecological concerns especially when agriculture is the main source of income for the local farmers local farmers accuse the high ranking legislative bodies of not taking their economic concerns into account for this reason local farmers believe that methods should be considered that cover their economic concerns in addition to environmental concerns to this end the current study examines and compares two water allocation scenarios the first scenario s main objective is to fully satisfy the ecological water demand by reducing agricultural activities the second scenario which is preferable to local farmers compromises the allocated ecological water by striking a balance between agricultural activities and ecological water demand this study compares these two scenarios to investigate what the water allocation scheme will look like for each of them and whether it is still possible to revive the hoor al azim wetland while the allocated ecological water is compromised for agricultural activities under the second scenario finding the optimal water management strategy especially in extreme events is the main question that the present study tries to answer such water resource allocation schemes can dramatically improve resilience in water systems furthermore the optimal water management strategy can avoid instability and conflicts due to water stress the following points highlight the novelty and importance of this research a novel framework has been developed for both the water allocation scheme and the calculation of its threshold in extreme events 4d and 3d evolutionary based multi objective optimization has been designed for the water system and the optimal crop cultivation pattern has been obtained the framework has been implemented for the karkheh basin and the optimal scenarios of the water allocation scheme for different sectors and multi crop cultivation patterns for 10 years of extreme drought have been carried out 2 description of the study area the present study focuses on the south karkheh subbasin fig 1 which is a semi arid region located in the southwest of iran between 31 to 32 northern latitude and 48 to 49 eastern longitude this subbasin consists of five subcatchments dasht e abbas dosalegh arayez hamidiyeh and azadegan karkheh dam in this subbasin in the northwest of khuzestan has been operational since 2002 with the aim of irrigating 320 000 hectares of agricultural lands and generating hydroelectric power masih et al 2010 as well as helping to preserve and sustain the hoor al azim as a vital ramsar site for the ecology of the subbasin the 10 main crops of this subbasin are winter wheat barley maize beans cucumber tomato watermelon alfalfa sorghum and rapeseed in this study a comprehensive water allocation scheme in the case of a 10 year long extreme drought is developed with the goal of minimizing the damage to the hoor al azim or in some cases fully reviving it by meeting the required ecological water demand and maximizing the agricultural profit the input parameters of the proposed framework are listed in table 1 these parameters must be adjusted for different region 3 methodology the schematic of the framework is presented in fig 2 the detailed schematic of the framework is illustrated in appendix i 3 1 synthetic streamflow generation there are two types of approaches to synthetic streamflow generation indirect and direct in the indirect method the input parameters of a hydrologic model such as precipitation and temperature series are fed to climate models to indirectly generate synthetic streamflow steinschneider et al 2015 direct approaches use statistical techniques directly on the historical data of streamflow to produce synthetic streamflow the current study implements the direct approach the two main classes of direct methods are the bootstrap method and autoregressive ar models the main drawback of the bootstrap method is that it cannot generate a time series with autocorrelation on the other hand ar models are developed to generate autocorrelated timeseries the first order markovian autoregressive model can be named as one of the first models of this group generally ar models have the ability to capture the historic autocorrelation the biggest issue with ar models is that they impose intra annual stationarity in the correlation structure hence any changes in the rainfall runoff relationship due to the infiltration rates and evapotranspiration is ignored for these reasons neither autoregressive models nor bootstrap based methods can correctly account for seasonal changes and precisely reproduce the historic autocorrelation of historic data at the same time in the current study the kirsch method kirsch et al 2013a is implemented which can properly address the shortcomings of both the bootstrap and the ar models this method is capable of producing autocorrelated time series that can properly take into account the autocorrelation function and the seasonal correlation structure the foundation of this method is based on modified fractional gaussian noise one of the most important advantages of modified fractional gaussian noise is that it can preserve the seasonal patterns in the correlation structure additionally this method can precisely reproduce the autocorrelation of the historic record therefore the kirsch method is capable of overcoming the drawbacks of the ar and bootstrap methods the kirsch method s steps can be summarized as follows herman et al 2015 kasprzyk et al 2013 kirsch et al 2013b synthetic streamflow generation n d transform the historical streamflow data from real space to log space and standardize them obtain the uncorrelated matrix of historical data by bootstrapping the log space historical matrix obtain the historical data correlation matrix by using cholesky decomposition generate a standardized synthetic dataset by imposing the historical correlation matrix upon the uncorrelated matrix to preserve the seasonal correlation de standardize the generated synthetic data and convert them back into real space repeat above steps with shifting historical dataset by 6 months to preserve year to year correlation karkheh river hydrological data have been collected from eight gauging stations the hydrological data are adopted from the dataset of the iran water resource management company iran water resource management company n d fig 3 illustrates the flow duration curve of the karkheh river for 2 000 synthetic realizations as is shown the fig 3 the synthetic dataset is generated in a way that it consists of extremely low flow rates with higher frequency while preserving the general correlation to historic data based on the flow duration curve a 10 year extreme drought is generated fig 4 indicates the statistical assessment of the monthly synthetic hydrological variables that are generated from a 20 member ensemble of the synthetic dataset for 1000 realizations fig 4 a compares the synthetic and historical monthly flow rate of the karkheh river as is shown the tails and mean fig 4 b of the synthetic variables have lower values compared to the historical data this demonstrates that the synthetic flow generation method has generated drought conditions properly the minimum and mean of synthetic values are lower than the historical values fig 4 c compares the standard deviations of synthetic streamflow and its historical values this comparison illustrates that the synthetic streamflow generation algorithm successfully generates a synthetic dataset that has the same standard deviation as the historical dataset in other words although the synthetic data can intensify the magnitude and frequency of extreme conditions they preserve the rhythm and spread of historical data as the generated synthetic data are not normally distributed levene s test was employed to statistically prove that the variance of synthetic and historical data is identical the p values associated with levene s test are indicated in fig 4 d the results show that none of the synthetic variances are dissimilar at a certain level of 0 05 black bold line based on the obtained synthetic streamflow dataset a 10 year scenario for the karkheh river s mass flow rate with respect to extreme drought was generated fig 5 each point in fig 5 represents the total inflow of the karkheh dam in million cubic meters mcm of water per month points between vertical lines indicate the most severe 2 year drought condition over the 10 year period the results show that if such a situation occurs more than 2 years in a row the water system balance should be considered broken and all agricultural and industrial activities must be stopped immediately of course this threshold varies according to the amount of initial water storage in the dam 3 2 scenarios as discussed above two water allocation scenarios are considered in this study the reduced agricultural activities scenario and the compromised allocated ecological water scenario the first scenario s main objective is to satisfy the ecological water demand by reducing agricultural activities in this scenario the agricultural activities that consume the biggest portion of the karkheh river inflow must be decreased to the lowest value or even zero at certain times during a 10 year period the three objectives in this scenario are to minimize the gini coefficient of the five subcatchment areas to minimize the global warming potential of crops and to maximize the total agricultural benefit the second scenario on the other hand compromises allocated ecological water by striking a balance between agricultural activities and ecological water demand in such a water allocation scheme although the water demands required for the complete restoration of the wetland are not provided the amount of water allocated to hoor al azim is maximized this water allocation scheme is considered to be more practical because the livelihood of the people of this region depends highly on agriculture and it is unlikely that local leaders or authorities would bear the cost of stopping agricultural activities in addition to the three objectives of the reduced agricultural activities scenario the compromised allocated ecological water scenario has a fourth objective of maximizing the ecological water demand although not all the water needed for the full recovery of hoor al azim is provided 3 3 annual agricultural benefit as discussed above the main income of the people of this area is from agriculture because the karkheh basin is a semi arid region finding a water allocation scheme for a multi crop cultivation pattern is of great importance the annual agricultural benefit for the multi crop cultivation pattern can be obtained as follows 1 a b t c 1 n p c a t c y t c c c a t c here a b t is the annual benefit and n is the number of crops y t c denotes each crop yield under the deficit irrigation for year t

activities in the same study region johl 1979 3 4 global warming potential agricultural activities are one of the main sources of greenhouse gas ghg emissions tubiello 2019 the global warming potential gwp is an indicator that can reveal the severity of ghg emissions caused by agricultural activities and it is measured in co2 equivalent a goal of this study is to minimize the gwp the total gwp kg co2 eq ha 1 consists of ghg emissions from farming practices including fertilizers biocide herbicide insecticide and fungicide machinery practices farm tillage and electricity consumption for irrigation the total gwp is calculated as follows li et al 2020 4 g w p t g w p f e r t i l i z e r g w p b i o c i d e g w p m a c h i n e r y g w p e l e c t r i c i t y here g w p f e r t i l i z e

factors respectively these values are based on the solid broilers manure storage process in an intensive system the coefficient 298 is a factor that converts n2o over a 100 year time horizon ipcc 2013 this means that n2o has a gwp 273 times that of co2 for a 100 year timescale the 1 accounts for the n2o volatile rate kanagawa 2006 the coefficients 8 3 1 50 and 0 98 account for the co2 eq emissions associated with the transportation and manufacture per unit of chemical fertilizer xiao et al 2019 g w p b i o c i d e can be calculated as follows banaeian et al 2020 6 g w p b i o c i d e h e r b i

are the associated conversion factors to co2 equivalent per unit the g w p e l e c t r i c i t y that is associated with irrigation can be determined as follows khoshnevisan et al 2013 8 g w p e l e c t r i c i t y e l e c t r i c i t y k w h h a 0 608 as before 0 608 is the associated conversion factor to co2 equivalent per unit 3 5 gini coefficient the gini coefficient has been widely used to quantify inequality in resource allocation lopes et al 2015 nishi et al 2015 therefore considering the gini coefficient creates a path that can help local authorities to allocate water in times of drought to different subcatchments without triggering conflict and dispute among local leaders though it will decrease the total income of the subbasin the gini coefficient for water allocation can be quantified as xu et al 2019b 9 g i n i 1 t t 1 t 1 2 n i 1 n w t i a b t i x 1 n y 1 n w t x a b t x w t y a b t y where t and n are the number of years and subcatchments respectively w t n indicates the allocated water for year t and subcatchment n and can be defined as 10 w t n c 1 c e t a t n c a t n c n where n and c represent days in a month and the number of crops respectively the main reason for implementing the gini index is to distribute the water budget equitably among subcatchments to illustrate let us consider a case in which the gini index is not included in the model because one of the objectives of the metaheuristic algorithm is to maximize the total agricultural net benefit the model will give the whole water budget to the biggest subcatchment in this study azadegan in this case other subcatchments will not receive any water for agricultural activities this is not acceptable to local farmers because it is not an equitable water allocation scheme by implementing the gini index as an objective and trying to minimize it the algorithm can reach an optimal solution that resolves this problem and fulfills the fairness of the framework 3 6 constraints and decision variables each objective function is subject to constraints and calculated by certain pools of decision variables in this section the constraints and decision variables are discussed eq 1 is subject to the following 11 p c a t c y t c c c a t c 0 c c a n d t t this guarantees that the benefit of farmland activities is not negative eq 2 is subject to the following 12 0 7 e t m i e t a t c e t m i c c t t a n d i n here e t a t c is a decision variable and the previous constraint was applied on the e t a t c bound by changing the coefficient of e t m i the length of the decision variable bound can be changed this constraint guarantees that crops will receive enough irrigation the lower bound of this constraint is irrigation under water stress and the upper bound demonstrates irrigation without any water stress on the crop for the former the crop yield is at its highest value while for the latter the crop yield decreases hence irrigation under water stress will result in saving water at the expense of sacrificing revenue therefore by setting this constraint the optimization algorithm can decide whether it is beneficial to put water stress on crops or not and whether it is beneficial e t a t c is a decision variable the total area under cultivation for each subcatchment can be obtained as the following 13 a t s u b c a t c h m e n t c 1 n a t c eq 13 is subject to the following 14 0 a t s u b c a t c h m e n t a m a x s u b c a t c h m e n t this constraint is meant to make sure that the assigned farmland for each subcatchment by the optimization algorithm is not higher than the available farmland in each subcatchment eq 9 is subject to the following 15 g i n i t 1 t t this constraint is meant to make sure that the gini index stays within a reasonable bounds during the persistent drought the water balance equation for this system can be quantified as follows 16 w b t d i t w s w t a w d t e w d t d w d t i w d t e t d s t 17 s t s t 1 w b t here wb and s represent balance and dam storage respectively the subscript t shows the current time step s 0 is the amount of water stored in the dam at the start of 10 years of extreme drought eq 17 is subject to 18 s t l c d t t by applying this constraint the dam storage will not go below the least capacity of dam 1600 m c m is the lcd of the karkheh dam including dead storage capacity and the ecological demand behind the dam nikoo et al 2019 to elaborate eq 16 calculates the required changes in the dam storage for each time step and eq 17 updates the current time step dam storage with respect to the required changes which are calculated in eq 16 by applying eq 18 as a constraint the metaheuristic approach can control that the dam storage does not fall below the least storage capacity of the dam in each time step based on the water allocation scheme two kinds of ecological water demand can be defined as decision variables 19 m e d e w d t here med shows the minimum ecological demand for the current work med is the amount of water that will fully restore hoor al azim wetland this bound is used for the water allocation scheme that does not compromise ecological water demand hence by applying this constraint the ecological water demand will be fully provided on the other hand the ecological water demand constraint for the water allocation scheme that compromises ecological water demand can be defined as follows 20 0 e w d t m e d this constraint allows the optimization algorithm to choose values lower than the required ecological demand in this case another objective function is added which can be defined as the following 21 m a x i m i z e t 1 t e w d t this objective is added to make sure that although the optimization algorithm is allowed to assign less ecological water than what is required the optimization algorithm tries to maximize the allocated ecological water in an effort to minimize the damages imposed by not fully satisfying the ecological water demand 3 7 optimization algorithm in the current study a speed constrained multi objective pso smpso algorithm nebro et al 2009b is implemented for multi objective optimization the pso algorithm is inspired by the social behavior of fish schooling or bird flocking kennedy and eberhart 1995 in the family of pso algorithms the population of solutions is called a swarm and each potential solution is known as a particle the core of the pso algorithm s update for the i th particle x i at generation t can be expressed as 22 x i t x i t 1 v i t where v i t is the velocity of the i th particle at generation and t is defined as 23 v i t w v i t 1 c 1 r 1 x p i x i c 2 r 2 x g i x i here x p i is the best solution that the i th particle x i has encountered on the other hand x g i represents the best particle leader that the entire swarm has encountered for controlling the trade off between the local and global experience parameter w is introduced which is also known as the inertia weight of the particle c 1 and c 2 are introduced to control the effect of the personal and global best particles respectively in addition r1 and r2 are two random variables drawn from uniform distribution in the range 0 1 for controlling the particle s velocity smpso utilizes a constriction coefficient χ as well as a mechanism that further bounds the accumulated velocity in each particle a detailed discussion about the proposed constriction coefficient and implemented constraints in smpso can be found in clerc and kennedy 2002 4 results the pareto frontier obtained from the speed constrained multi objective pso algorithm for the compromised allocated ecological water scenario and the reduced agricultural activities scenario is illustrated in figs 6 and fig 7 respectively the compromised allocated ecological water scenario seeks to strike a balance between agricultural water demand gwp and gini coefficient by compromising with ecological water demand in contrast the reduced agricultural activities scenario does not compromise ecological water demand in this scenario all the water that is needed to recover the hoor al azim will be supplied in 10 years needless to say the agriculture revenue in the reduced agricultural activities scenario is less than in the compromised allocated ecological water scenario both choosing between the scenarios and choosing the optimum point from the pareto frontier of each scenario depends on the decision makers there is also a system threshold for water balance if the karkheh dam inflow is either similar to the drought scenario between the dashed red lines in fig 5 for more than 2 years or it is less than that for 1 year in any time window in 10 years the water system should be considered broken and all the karkheh dam inflow should be dumped into the hoor al azim as shown in fig 6 the total allocated ecological water for the compromised allocated ecological water scenario varies from almost 0 to about 6 400 mcm choosing the total allocated ecological water from this range is dependent on the decision makers in contrast to this scenario s pareto frontier the total ecological allocated water is constant and equal to the ecological water demand for the hoor al azim wetland in 10 years for all of the pareto optimal points the comparison of fig 7 and fig 6 illustrates that the agricultural revenue in the reduced agricultural activities scenario is much less than in the compromised allocated ecological water scenario on the other hand although the gini coefficient of both scenarios expands from 0 2 to about 0 8 the concentration of a higher gini coefficient in the reduced agricultural activities scenario s pareto optimal points is higher the difference between agricultural revenue in the reduced agricultural activities scenario and the compromised allocated ecological water scenario is the amount of money from farmers pockets that is spent to conserve the hoor al azim wetland this amount can be compensated by subsidies or other incentives from fig 7 and fig 6 and based on the pareto optimal solution the total amount of compensation can be calculated the exact policy of such subsidies and their effect on the gini coefficient can be investigated in future studies 4 1 optimally allocated agriculture water for the proposed water allocation schemes the natural question arises of when where and how many hectares of which type of crops should be cultivated for instance in a situation in which the decision has been made to allocate about 4 000 mcm of water to the ecological sector in the compromised allocated ecological water scenario the question is what the crops cultivation pattern will be before answering this question it is vital to answer how much water should be allocated to the agricultural sector the optimal amount of water that is allocated to the agricultural sector under the compromised allocated ecological water scenario and the reduced agricultural activities scenario are represented the in figs 8 and fig 9 respectively the water consumption of each crop is calculated based on the fao equation eq 2 for deficit irrigation johl 1979 as is shown in fig 8 regarding the compromised allocated ecological water in the first 2 years of drought subcatchments azadegan with 170 and 300 mcm and dosalegh with 200 and 180 mcm have the largest share of water consumption for agriculture azadegan with 60 000 ha and dosalegh with 17 140 ha have the biggest and lowest potential cultivation area among the other subcatchments the trends among the different subcatchments illustrate that the amount of water allocated for the agricultural demand in azadegan for years 1 to 4 does not vary much however this amount experiences a peak in year 5 600 mcm and then decreases until year 9 100 mcm in the 10th year this figure experiences another peak 420 mcm other subcatchments also show the same periodic pattern but with a different frequency and peak which depend on the potential cultivation area and the irrigation efficiency of each subcatchment the irrigation efficiencies of these subcatchments are approximately the same ranging from 45 to 50 the results of the stochastic multi objective optimization of the compromised allocated ecological water scenario water scheme illustrate that each subcatchment has a unique frequency for agricultural water allocation to elaborate the amount of water allocated to each subcatchment for agricultural activities follows a sinusoidal behavior for example let us assume the allocated agricultural water to azadegan in the first 5 years as is shown in fig 8 the amount of allocated agricultural water starts increasing from approximately 150 mcm in the 1st year to 320 mcm roughly double in the 2nd year however the latter amount starts to decrease in the 3rd and 4th year after the 4th year the allocated agricultural water starts to rise again to 600 mcm these fluctuations exhibit a sinusoidal behavior additionally results indicate that each subcatchment follows this behavior with its own frequency in other words the agricultural water allocated to each subcatchment increases and decreases in its own time intervals different from other subcatchments in this study the unique frequency for agricultural water allocation periodicity is referred to this phenomenon the optimal allocated agricultural water for the reduced agricultural activities scenario is demonstrated in fig 9 the comparison between fig 8 and fig 9 reveals that in the reduced agricultural activities scenario the main focus is on crops with a higher water resistance such as rapeseed and beans what can also be seen is that crop diversity has decreased in the reduced agricultural activities scenario the results show that approaching the last years of drought under the reduced agricultural activities scenario reduces the diversity of agricultural products as is illustrated in fig 9 the subcatchments dasht e abbas 0 3 mcm in the 1st year and arayez 0 4 mcm in the 2nd year of droughts have the largest share of agricultural water consumption it is worth mentioning again that azadegan has the biggest cultivation area among other subcatchments the trends between different years show that similarly to the compromised allocated ecological water scenario the water allocation for agriculture increases and decreases periodically between drought years the decrease in water allocation intensifies in the last few years in general the amount of cultivation in the reduced agricultural activities scenario is significantly reduced and in each subcatchment one crop per year is the dominant crop based on this reduction the optimal amount of subsidies for each subcatchment for each crop can be calculated for 10 years the subsidy regime calculated based on this framework is optimal from two perspectives minimizing the gini coefficient and supplying the full amount of water needed for ecological demand 4 2 cultivation pattern the area under cultivation of each subcatchment in each year of the compromised allocated ecological water scenario is presented in fig 10 only the cultivation pattern under this scenario is discussed because the crop cultivation for the reduced agricultural activities must decrease to close to zero comparing figs 8 and 10 reveals that the area under cultivation for each crop also follows a certain pattern fig 10 demonstrates the percentage of land that is under cultivation for each subcatchment this percentage increases as the allocated water for the agricultural demands increases but how many hectares of each subcatchment should go under cultivation in other words what will be the crops cultivation pattern for each subcatchment fig 11 indicates the crops cultivation pattern for 10 years under extreme water stress and under the compromised allocated ecological water scenario ten main crops winter wheat barley maize beans cucumber tomato watermelon alfalfa sorghum and rapeseed historically cultivated by the local farmers have been considered for the cultivation pattern in this region fig 11 a shows the cultivation pattern for the subcatchment dasht e abbas with potential farmland of 19 024 ha as is shown in fig 11 a at the start of the drought period only 6 000 to 9 000 ha of this subcatchment should be going under cultivation the main crops for this period are cucumber 1st year 2200 ha 35 beans 2nd year 1800ha 23 and rapeseed 3rd year 4000ha 37 in the smaller subcatchments such as dasht e abbas crops with less resistance to water stress i e with higher water demand have the largest portion such crops have a higher net benefit for instance as it is shown in fig 11 in dasht e abbas cucumber consumes the largest portion of water in the 1st year of drought 60 mcm meanwhile cucumber makes a higher profit in comparison to a crop more resistant to water stress such as wheat in the same area under cultivation in contrast during the climax of the drought period the percentage under cultivation for winter wheat and maize increases this trend continues to the point at which in the last year of the drought winter wheat has the highest portion 170 mcm 20 fig 11 e shows the crops cultivation scheme in azadegan which with 60 000 ha of farmland is the biggest subcatchment this subcatchment is of great importance because it accounts for the largest share in both the water consumption and economic benefits of the basin as it is shown in fig 11 e wheat cultivation in this area accounts for a small percentage and in the first few years the concentration is on cucumber 2nd year 7 500 ha 30 and watermelon 3rd year 10 000 ha 60 in the period of the climax however barley 5th year 8 000 ha 30 and tomato 6th year 22 000 ha 75 constitute the dominant percentage of cultivation the same conclusion can be inferred for other subcatchments 4 3 dam storage and allocated ecological water the important questions regarding the proposed water allocation schemes are whether these schemes satisfy the requirement of the karkheh dam for electricity generation and how karkheh dam water storage will vary in 10 years under this water allocation scheme fig 12 illustrates how the amount of storage water will vary in 10 years based on the compromised allocated ecological water scheme in the three 1st years by cultivating crops with higher water demand and profit but with less area under cultivation the amount of stored water for the peak of the drought period will increase 6 000 mcm the rate of water usage then decreases by cultivating crops with higher resistance to water stress the feasibility study indicates that if the climax of the drought period lasts more than 2 years in a row any water allocation scheme is infeasible and the water balance will be broken in this situation the dam valves should remain open and all the inflow should be allocated to the ecological water demand this also depends on the initial storage of the dam the present study considers the initial storage as 5 000 mcm which is the threshold for the studied drought scenario based on the reduced agricultural activities scheme in the three 1st years similarly to the compromised allocated ecological water scenario crops with both higher water demand and profit should be cultivated however this amount is significantly less for the reduced agricultural activities scenario and the dominant share of water is allocated to ecological demand each year in the reduced agricultural activities scenario identically to the compromised allocated ecological water scenario the amount of stored water is increased to reach its peak in the 18th month of the drought period 5 500 mcm the rate of water usage then decreases by cultivating crops with higher resistance to water stress the allocation of the ecological water demand is another aspect of this water allocation scheme the cumulative allocated ecological water for both the compromised allocated ecological water scenario and the reduced agricultural activities scenario is represented in fig 13 for the compromised allocated ecological water scenario the maximum optimal allocated ecological water is 6 427 mcm less than half of the minimum bound 16 000 mcm this value also can vary with the initial storage as discussed this value is obtained from the compromised allocated ecological water scenario which compromises with ecological water demand in other words in the compromised allocated ecological water scenario economic profit is the main focus in contrast the reduced agricultural activities scenario s main focus is the ecological demand for retrieving the hoor al azim wetland although the ecological demand is fully met in this scenario the economic benefit is decreased both scenarios are optimized and both scenarios water allocation scheme is optimal therefore deciding which water allocation scheme should be implemented depends on the decision makers and whether they want to compromise the ecological water demand or not on the other hand for the reduced agricultural activities scenario the maximum optimal allocated ecological water is 16 000 mcm the minimum total amount that is needed to preserve the hoor al azim this value also can vary with the initial storage this amount of ecological water demand is obtained from the reduced agricultural activities scenario that does not compromise ecological water demand to summarize in the reduced agricultural activities scenario the focus is not economic profit but rather the ecological demand for conserving and retrieving the hoor al azim wetland 4 4 fitted pareto curve the fitted surface to the pareto optimal solution for the compromised allocated ecological water scenario and the reduced agricultural activities scenario is represented in fig 14 and 15 respectively this curve represents the trends between objectives and predicts the values of objectives in the case of higher water availability higher net benefit as is shown in fig 14 the net benefit and gini coefficient have a roughly linear direct relation in other words the net benefits increase with the increase of the gini coefficient hence although employing a compromised allocated ecological water scenario will lead to higher agricultural benefits it will also lead to a higher gini coefficient on the other hand the slope of this trend increases when the value of gwp increases this means that the sensitivity of the gini coefficient to net benefit can vary by the value of the gwp the higher the gwp the more sensitive the gini coefficient to the net benefit the net benefit and gwp have a direct non linear relation this means the net benefit is more sensitive to gwp in comparison to the gini coefficient to elaborate the value of the gwp can have a higher impact on the net benefit than the gini coefficient the sensitivity between the net benefit and the gwp increases as the gini coefficient increases this means that in a more unequal situation not only is the figure of the net benefit and the gwp higher but a change in one of them also results in a higher change in another one thus the resilience of the system can be maintained by keeping the value of the gini coefficient low as shown in fig 15 for the fitted curve to the pareto optimal solutions for the reduced agricultural activities scenario the values of different objectives can be estimated all the points on this curve satisfy the needed ecological demand for conserving the hoor al azim wetland fig 15 shows that the gini coefficient and net benefit do not have a linear relationship anymore with the increase of the net benefit the figure of the gini coefficient increases fast at the beginning and more slowly when it reaches approximately 0 4 after 0 4 the slope of the net benefit increases the increment of this slope increases by shifting up the net benefit curve in addition the lowest slope of the curve moves backward this reveals that for the higher net benefit the gini coefficient increases faster and makes the water allocation scheme more vulnerable to inequity in contrast with the relationship between the gini coefficient and the net benefit in the compromised allocated ecological water scenario in the reduced agricultural activities scenario there is a point in each line where the net benefit is at the highest possible value and the gini coefficient is between 0 2 to 0 5 however the amount of the gwp is also at the highest value it should be noted that the main difference between the pareto fitted surfaces of the reduced agricultural activities and the compromised allocated ecological water scenarios is that in the former scenario the concavity of the surface is downward but in the latter scenario the concavity of the surface is upward therefore the compromised allocated ecological water scenario has a lower limit for the net benefit while the reduced agricultural activities scenario has an upper limit for the net benefit this illustrates that the reduced agricultural activities scenario is bounded by the net benefit and the net benefit cannot be arbitrarily increased however the compromised allocated ecological water scenario is not bounded on the net benefit and the net benefit can be increased as much as desired at the cost of sacrificing other objectives fig 16 and 17 illustrate the coloration between each objective under the compromised allocated ecological water scenario and the reduced agricultural activities scenario respectively as is illustrated in fig 16 with the increase of the net benefit both the gini coefficient and the gwp increase moreover the gini coefficient can impose a limitation on both the gwp and the net benefit for instance although the gwp can increase up to 7 mton co2 eq if the gini coefficient is less than 0 2 the net benefit cannot exceed 7 million usd in contrast if the gwp is lower than 20 mton co2 eq the net benefit cannot increase by more than 4 million usd the whole trade off between these three objectives can be inferred from fig 16 as is illustrated in fig 17 identically to the compromised allocated ecological water scenario the gini coefficient can impose a limitation on the net benefit and the gwp for example although the gwp can increase up to 17 5 tons co2 eq if the gini coefficient is less than 0 2 the net benefit cannot exceed 0 8 million usd in contrast if the gwp is lower than 2 5 ton co2 eq the net benefit cannot increase by more than 0 2 million usd the most important difference between the reduced agricultural activities scenario and the compromised allocated ecological water scenario is that the sensitivity of the gwp and the net benefit to the gini coefficient is much higher than the compromised allocated ecological water scenario this shows that keeping the gini coefficient within the reasonable bound in the case of supplying the total needed ecological water is more difficult because the water allocation scheme is much more sensitive figs 16 and 17 can be used by the decision makers to find out given a certain amount of net benefit what the gwp and the gini coefficient will be furthermore the gini coefficient under the compromised allocated ecological water and the reduced agricultural activities scheme is represented in fig 18 the gini coefficient of 10 years for the compromised allocated ecological water scenario shows that as the drought progresses the gini coefficient increases similarly for the reduced agricultural activities scenario the gini coefficient increases as the drought continues however this upsurge in the reduced agricultural activities scenario is higher in comparison to the compromised allocated ecological water scenario and it will lead to higher inequality 5 discussion results indicate that although the optimal allocated agricultural water can vary slightly due to the stochastic nature of the current methodology the periodicity of each subcatchment remains constant for each pareto optimal solution and different from other pareto optimal solutions on the pareto surface in other words the periodicity changes from one point to another point on the pareto surface if the chosen point is from the same coordinates of the pareto surface this periodicity will remain constant while the amount of the allocated agricultural water can vary slightly finding this robust periodicity that is not affected by the uncertainty for each subcatchment can strike a balance between agricultural benefit equity and sustainability among all subcatchments of course this periodicity changes for different water systems and can be calculated using the developed framework in other words finding the optimal water allocation scheme is boiled down to finding the periodicity of each subcatchment the relation between different objectives shows that with the increase of the net benefit both the gini coefficient and the gwp increase moreover the gini coefficient can impose a limitation on both the gwp and the net benefit the most important difference between different scenarios is that the sensitivity of the gwp and the net benefit to the gini coefficient of one scenario can be much higher than in other scenarios this shows that keeping the gini coefficient within the reasonable bound in the case of supplying the total needed ecological water is more difficult because the water allocation scheme is much more sensitive furthermore results show that as the drought progresses the gini coefficient increases however this upsurge in one scenario can be higher in comparison to other scenarios which will lead to higher inequality in general the results indicate that the higher agricultural net benefit will lead to a faster increase of the gini coefficient and make the water allocation scheme more vulnerable to inequity 6 conclusion in the present research study a novel evolutionary based framework is introduced that can calculate the 10 year optimal water allocation scheme for different sectors from agricultural and industrial uses to ecological water demand two main scenarios are considered for evolutionary optimization the first is to consider the allocated ecological water demand as an objective function and try to maximize it on this basis the second considers a fixed amount and optimizes other objective functions three other objective functions are the net benefit the global warming potential gwp and the gini coefficient in the reduced agricultural activities scenario the main priority is to fulfill ecological water demand while in the compromised allocated ecological water scenario although one of the objectives is to maximize the ecological water demand the priority is to maximize agricultural benefit the comparison between these two pareto frontiers for the karkheh basin reveals that in the case of the full recovery of the hoor al azim the basin cannot bear the agricultural water demand and such activities must be decreased drastically the fitted pareto curve for both scenarios is obtained to investigate the relation between objective functions the relation between objectives for the reduced agricultural activities scenario illustrates that the increase of the net benefit will result in a fast increase in the gini coefficient up to approximately 0 4 the interesting result from this correlation is that the higher agricultural net benefit will lead to a faster increase of the gini coefficient and make the water allocation scheme more vulnerable to inequity the trends in the reduced agricultural activities scenario and the compromised allocated ecological water scenario demonstrate that the gini coefficient can impose a limitation on the net benefit and gwp however the sensitivity to the gini coefficient in the two scenarios is different in the reduced agricultural activities scenario the sensitivity of the gwp and net benefit to the gini coefficient is much higher than in the compromised allocated ecological water scenario therefore preserving the gini coefficient in the reasonable value in the case of supplying the total ecological water demand is more difficult because the water allocation scheme is more sensitive in the compromised allocated ecological water scenario on the other hand the net benefit is more sensitive to gwp in comparison to the gini coefficient eqn 3 8 10 12 14 15 19 23 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships
