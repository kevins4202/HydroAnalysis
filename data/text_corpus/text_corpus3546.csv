techniques have been applied prior to thermal process to reduce energy consumption of zld systems capacitive deionization cdi is an emerging desalination technique and has yet to be extensively

contain high concentrations of contaminants such as tds hardness heavy metal and organics walrand görller 1995 table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of brines generated from different industries discharge of untreated industrial brines could lead to adverse aquatic environment impacts due to salinity rise and toxic artificial organics fernández torquemada et al 2005 roberts et al 2010 proper disposal and management of industrial brines are required disposal of brines to surface water bodies municipal sewers deep well and evaporation ponds have been commonly practiced ahmed et al 2000 arnal et al 2005 umar et al 2015 increase in global awareness of industrial brine hazards has led to more stringent regulations mickley 2007 sethi et al 2006 public utilities board 2007 and compliance practices had led to costlier disposal methods arnal et al 2005 glueckstern and priel 1997 leong et al 2014 mickley 2007 morillo et al 2014 tong and elimelech 2016 for desalination plants the cost for brine disposal takes up 5 33 of the total desalination cost arnal et al 2005 glueckstern and priel 1997 morillo et al 2014 more stringent regulations and increase in brine disposal cost have led to increasing zero liquid discharge zld practices over the recent years the concept of zld is a management strategy for wastewater especially brine that aims to eliminate liquid waste from leaving the plant while concurrently recover water and salt by products for reuse badruzzaman et al 2009 early zld systems were based on stand alone thermal processes namely thermal evaporators followed by thermal crystallizers which are energy intensive thermal evaporation consumes energy typically in the range between 20 and 25 kwh m3 of treated feed while the energy demand for thermal crystallizer is about 2 3 times higher tong and elimelech 2016 although the overall water recovery increases significantly using conventional zld systems direct concentration of industrial brine using thermal evaporators and crystallizers leads to high demand of energy 1 2 potential application of cdi process in zld systems thermal processes are indispensable in the zld systems even though they are energy intensive recent zld systems implement preconcentrators prior to thermal process to reduce total cost pérez gonzález et al 2012 tong and elimelech 2016 preconcentrators further reduce the brine volume which leads to cost reduction of the subsequent thermal processes capacitive deionization cdi is an emerging electricity based and energy saving desalination technique with potential preconcentration application for zld table 2 summarizes the key features of cdi and other preconcentrators in zld systems for industrial brine treatment such as low fouling ro electrodialysis reversal edr forward osmosis fo and membrane distillation md tong and elimelech 2016 tsai et al 2017 ro technology is a widely applied desalination process due to its relative cost and energy effectiveness however concentrating brines to tds higher than 75 000 ppm using ro would not be economically feasible as it would require extremely high pressure to overcome the osmotic pressure tong and elimelech 2016 the brine concentration from non pressure driven processes namely md edr fo and cdi however are not limited by the osmotic pressure and could exceed 75 000 ppm studies have reported that brine tds concentrations from md edr and fo could exceed 200 000 ppm tong and elimelech 2016 as for cdi atlantis technologies usa a commercial company claimed their cdi system could achieve a brine concentration of 100 000 ppm treating shale gas produced wastewater atlantis technologies 2012 as shown in table 2 cdi process could be a potential energy efficient desalination technique to achieve brine concentration beyond 75 000 ppm the involvement of thermal processes for md al obaidani et al 2008 and fo johnson et al 2018 increases their energy consumption significantly when waste heat is unavailable this could escalate their energy requirement to be comparable with thermal evaporators energy consumption of 0 7 and 0 53 kwhe 1000 ppm tds removed were reported for the edr bernardes et al 2016 and cdi zhao et al 2013b processes respectively in view that cdi development is still relatively at its infancy stage compared with edr and ro research and development incorporating energy recovery in the process could further enhance its energy efficiency in the future andres and yoshihara 2016 kang et al 2016 fouling is a major operational issue in membrane based pre concentrators ro is known for its high fouling tendency jiang et al 2017 due to the pressure driven operation extensive pretreatment may be required for ro to further concentrate industrial brines kumar et al 2006 semblante et al 2018 fouling was reported to be less pronounced in md tijing et al 2015 tow et al 2018 fo shaffer et al 2015 edr bernardes et al 2016 and cdi almarzooqi et al 2014 compared with ro as no external pressure is required in the former processes as an electro membrane based process similar to edr fouling in cdi could be further mitigated by reversing the operational potential section 4 1 in addition silica fouling typically does not occur in cdi operation as silica is generally uncharged use of cdi process in concentrating industrial brines for zld application have yet to be explored extensively though cdi is comparative to other pre concentration techniques challenges from treating industrial brines may face concerns such as insufficient salt removal and high fouling propensity this paper critically reviewed contributing factors related to these challenges including cdi cell architectures section 3 operational strategies section 4 and fouling control section 5 in addition this review identified possible optimization methods and strategies to overcome the challenges which provided insights on the feasibility of using cdi to concentrate industrial brines a design guide for cdi process applied to concentrate industrial brines is included in this review from the abovementioned understanding the design guide could be used to establish valuable decision making criteria for cdi process optimization in treating industrial brines 2 technical background of capacitive deionization process 2 1 desalination mechanism desalination mechanism of cdi process is widely recognized as electrosorption it describes the process when counter ions are immobilized by electrical double layers edl almarzooqi et al 2014 porada et al 2013 suss et al 2015 zhao 2013 counter ions ions carrying opposite charges to the electrode are attracted to the electrode surface while co ions ions carrying same charges as the electrode are repelled from electrode surface according to the gouy chapman stern gcs theory edl which is formed within micropores inside cdi electrodes refers to the two layers next to the electrode solution interface where ions are compactly and diffusively distributed biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 biesheuvel et al 2011 a schematic of the edl structure is shown in fig 1 in this review micropores describe the pore space inside carbon particles while macropores refer to the inter particle space between carbon particles micropores account for large surface area while macropores serve as pathways for ion transportation it is often assumed that initial salt concentration in macropores is the same as that in the bulk solution biesheuvel et al 2011 porada et al 2013 during the adsorption step of cdi process bulk solution flows between a pair of charged porous electrodes and counter ions migrate to the surface of electrodes under electro static force when an external voltage is applied these counter ions are then immobilized and stored within the edls namely cations are stored in the negatively charged electrode while anions are stored in the positively charged electrode once counter ions are immobilized and electrically adsorbed within the edls they are deemed as separated or removed from the solution this results in the production of a diluted stream to regenerate the adsorption capacity of electrodes adsorbed ions must be released through the desorption step or regeneration step desorption step is normally achieved by removing or reversing the external voltage a concentrated stream is produced as desorbed ions migrate back to the bulk solution desalination through cdi is achieved in non continuous mode with alternate adsorption and desorption steps that complete an operational cycle two streams are produced in each cycle namely a diluted stream as product water and a concentrated stream as concentrated brine a schematic of a full cdi cycle is shown in fig 2 2 2 challenges for cdi process in treatment of industrial brines 2 2 1 energy and removal efficiency for treating high tds feed cdi process have been applied mainly for water and wastewater with tds 4000 ppm namely ground water remediation farmer et al 1997 brackish water desalination laxman et al 2015 and reclamation of industrial wastewater lee et al 2006 industrial brine typically contains tds concentration several times higher than 4000 ppm table 1 even though the feed osmotic pressure may not be an operational limit in cdi process consideration on critical issues such as increase in energy consumption reduced energy efficiency and insufficient salt removal need to be evaluated when treating high tds feed as an electricity based desalination technique the cdi energy consumption is in near linear relation with salt removal hence the energy consumption would increase with increasing feed tds in order to achieve a similar dilute stream quality by removing more salts increasing feed tds could also lead to a decrease in energy efficiency one reason is that more co ion expulsion could occur under higher solution concentrations co ion expulsion could lead to reduced charge efficiency which is further discussed in section 3 1 another source of energy loss in cdi processes is the resistive loss which was reported to increase almost proportionally to current hemmatifar et al 2016 the resistive loss would increase for treating feed with higher tds as higher current would be needed to maintain the desired salt removal and recovery ratio it was demonstrated that the energy consumption per adsorbed ion increases linearly when increasing operational currents are applied to maintain or increase the salt removal and water recovery for feed tds from 1000 ppm to 5000 ppm zhao et al 2012a 2013b the decrease in energy efficiency is another consideration that limits most cdi applications to process feed with tds concentration below 4000 ppm energy loss through faradaic reactions was shown to be minimal hemmatifar et al 2018 wang et al 2019 parasitic currents were reported to contribute less than 4 of the total operational currents qu et al 2016 hemmatifar et al 2016 faradaic loss could dominate over resistive loss under extreme operational conditions such as current density lower than 1 5 a m2 and cycle duration over 100 min hemmatifar et al 2016 these operating conditions would not be applicable for treating high tds industrial brines because this would lead to extremely slow desalination rate and long operation time hence faradaic loss may be negligible compared with the resistive loss when applied for treatment of high tds industrial brines it has been recommended that a proper cdi electrode should have an adsorption capacity of 8 mg nacl per gram of electrodes mg g at cell voltage of 1 2 v porada et al 2013 the adsorption capacity of some commercial capacitive electrodes could reach 14 18 mg g zhao et al 2013b 2013c however the highest reported feed concentration using these electrodes was merely around 5800 ppm which is lower than the typical brine concentrations in table 1 this is due to the total adsorption capacity under similar operational conditions of these static electrode cdi cells is limited by both the adsorption capacity of the electrode materials and the electrode mass used in the cdi cells which are typically fixed with the setup the fixed total adsorption capacity of static electrode cdi cells could lead to insufficient salt removal in a single adsorption step when treating high tds feed under such circumstances further downstream desalination processes would be required to polish the cdi effluent to meet the desired quality moreover the fixed total adsorption capacity could result in limited brine concentration as it would restrict the amount of desorbing ions in a single desorption step limited brine concentration from cdi process does not favor a cost effective zld system because it may require more downstream thermal treatments which account for the major part of the total zld cost tong and elimelech 2016 despite the technical drawback highlighted further research and development in cdi has explored its potential for treatment of high tds feed from industrial brines lab scale experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of cdi application on treating feed with tds up to seawater concentration using synthetic nacl solutions jeon et al 2013 the desalination application of a commercial cdi system from atlantis us for treating shale gas produced wastewater with tds concentration of 100 000 ppm was reported atlantis technologies 2012 modification on cdi cell architectures and changing operational strategies could facilitate high tds removal without compromising the energy efficiency the impact of cell architectures and operational strategies on salt removal energy consumption and energy efficiency of cdi for high tds removal are discussed in sections 3 and 4 respectively 2 2 2 inorganic scaling and organic fouling the use of industrial water generally employs pre treatments with microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf and other techniques which could minimize the downstream fouling potential from non dissolved contaminants such as bacteria and colloids in industrial brines jiang et al 2017 nonetheless fouling issues due to inorganic scaling and organic fouling remain as operational challenges that need to be addressed in the cdi process treating industrial brines that contain high concentrations of multivalent ions and dissolved organics the occurrence of inorganic scaling and organic fouling would lead to reduced salt removal tao et al 2011 increased energy consumption chen et al 2018 and eventually system shutdown yu et al 2014 if not managed carefully in the cdi process therefore an understanding on the underlying mechanism is critical to formulate effective fouling mitigation methods for the cdi process dissolved organics in wastewater namely humic substances lee et al 2002 li and elimelech 2004 bovine serum albumin bsa lee et al 2009a park et al 2005 dodecyl benzene sulfonate dbs lee et al 2009a wang et al 2017 and alginate chen et al 2018 are normally negatively charged and would act similarly as ions under an electric field these charged organic and inorganic ions in the wastewater migrate and accumulate towards the electrodes during the adsorption step of the cdi process this accumulation could create a super saturation condition near the electrode surfaces provided with sufficient time inorganic salts i e calcium magnesium carbonate gypsum calcium magnesium hydroxide and hydroxides of heavy metals and organics would precipitate and deposit to the effective adsorption site under such super saturation conditions al amoudi 2010 lado et al 2015 wang et al 2016 moreover the ph change in the electrodes could lead to foulant formation faradaic processes on the electrode surface could lead to basic cathodes and acidic anodes during the adsorption steps due to reduction of oxygen and water oxidation of carbon and other faradaic reactions related to the functional groups on the electrode surface dykstra et al 2017 yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a the increase in ph at cathodes could accelerate precipitation of multi valent cations by forming hydroxides with low solubility products especially heavy metal ions the acidic condition at anodes could reduce the surface charge of dissolved organics that promotes aggregation of organics due to lower inter repulsion force jiang et al 2017 ang and elimelech 2007 both inorganic scaling and organic fouling would reduce active adsorption capacity and increase migration resistance for ions leading to lower salt removal and higher energy consumption lado et al 2015 mossad and zou 2013 wang et al 2015 2018 zhang et al 2013 lado et al 2015 reported that the cdi cell adsorption capacity dropped by 30 after 35 cycles and caso4 was found accumulated with an amount of 10 8 mg caso4 per gram of electrode over 6 operation cycles using feed containing 3 mm caso4 in another study approximately 9 reduction in salt removal was observed in cdi process treating biological treated effluent with 7 0 ppm toc compared to controlling synthetic nacl solution wang et al 2015 concurrently higher energy consumptions were reported in organic fouled cdi cells the energy consumption of a lab scale cdi unit was increased by 56 8 and 26 3 with the addition of 50 ppm humic acid ha and sodium alginate in the feed respectively compared with feed containing only 75 ppm nacl chen et al 2018 in another cdi process study higher energy consumption was recorded from 3 25 kwh m3 to 4 52 kwh m3 when ha concentrations in the feed was increased from 3 ppm to 10 ppm mossad and zou 2013 fouling in cdi process could be worsened when treating real industrial brines due to the co existence of inorganic and organic compounds the interaction between inorganic and organic compounds could intensify the extent of fouling compared with individual inorganic scaling or organic fouling guo et al 2014 for instance divalent ions like ca2 could interact specifically with the carboxylic groups in nature organic matters nom to form metal humic complexes li and elimelech 2004 wang et al 2016 ha deposition onto iem of a membrane cdi mcdi module showed significant increase from 40 3 to 175 7 μg cm2 in the presence of ca2 ions chen et al 2018 hence multiple fouling mitigation strategies may need to be engaged simultaneously in cdi process treating industrial brines in addition extra caution would be required for using cdi process to treat industrial brines containing heavy metal ions due to the slow desorption and the partially irreversible chemical adsorption of heavy metal ions desorption of heavy metal ions could be 20 slower than na due to their high valence lado et al 2014 heavy metals can form valent bonds with electrode surface through complexation chelation and ion exchange amuda et al 2007 inyang et al 2016 kołodyńska et al 2017 they can also induce redox reactions to the electrodes as noted with arsenic ions and chromium ions kumar et al 2014 xu et al 2018 the chemical interactions between heavy metals and electrode surface lead to partially irreversible adsorption of heavy metals which eventually causes accumulation of heavy metals in electrodes desorption efficiencies of 62 and 24 were reported for cu2 and pb2 respectively from a lab scale cdi test li et al 2018 their complex deposition in cdi electrodes were also observed li et al 2018 huang et al 2016 thus pretreatment techniques section 5 1 such as chemical softening is recommended for industrial brines containing noticeable concentrations of heavy metals to avoid chemical deterioration of electrodes and excessive chemical cleaning silica in water and wastewater is typically uncharged under the commonly applied operating conditions which has rendered it to be ineffectively removed by electro membrane systems such as edr and cdi processes allison 1995 bernardes et al 2016 therefore cdi operation is not limited by silica fouling compared to pressure based membrane processes like ro and fo mi and elimelech 2013 semiat et al 2003 similar to any membrane based processes fouling is inevitable in cdi cdi process is believed to experience less severe fouling compared with nf and ro due to the non pressure driven nature of the process almarzooqi et al 2014 choi et al 2019 suss et al 2015 however the complex characteristics and high concentrations of foulants in industrial brines elevate its fouling potential to a more noticeable level compared with common brackish water and domestic wastewater therefore effective fouling mitigation strategies in the cdi process would need to be established for the process to be feasibly applied to concentrate industrial brines cell architectures operational strategies and fouling control could impact the fouling severity in cdi process treating industrial brines this paper reviews their impacts on fouling mitigation in section 3 4 and 5 respectively 3 cell architecture of cdi 3 1 classic cdi classic cdi membrane cdi mcdi and flow electrode cdi fcdi are the current prevailing cell architectures classic cdi is the most conventional cell architecture in which pairs of electrodes are separated by non conductive spacers it is easy to set up and is widely reported in literature and applied in industry andres and yoshihara 2016 hou et al 2014 jung et al 2007 seo et al 2010 xu et al 2008 however classic cdi would not be feasible for industrial brine treatment compared with mcdi and fcdi architectures because it might encounter drawbacks from insufficient salt removal low energy efficiency and severe fouling the classic cdi is a static electrode architecture and thus the total adsorption capacity from one adsorption step is limited by the adsorption capacity of the electrode materials and the allocated electrode mass adding to this the charge efficiency of the classic cdi is lower than that of the mcdi and decreases with increasing feed tds concentrations charge efficiency is defined as the ratio between the amount of adsorbed ion by electrodes and the charge transferred between electrodes for adsorption zhao et al 2009 it is normally used to quantify energy efficiency of cdi ideally one charge transferred between electrodes results in one monovalent salt molecule removal in adsorption step leading to a unity of charge efficiency in actual applications charge efficiency is always smaller than unity due to non ideal electric compensation mechanisms suss et al 2015 one of the major compensation mechanisms is co ion expulsion porada et al 2013 suss et al 2015 co ions coexist with counter ions in edl region when electrode is neutral charge transfer between electrodes is thus partially converted into the expulsion of co ions out of edls rather than the adsorption of counter ions into edls in this way charge efficiency is lowered from unity in the classic cdi co ions expelled from edls ultimately end up in spacer channels which reduces the overall salt removal and thus the charge efficiency biesheuvel et al 2011 porada et al 2013 zhao et al 2009 a charge efficiency of 0 6 was reported using a classic cdi setup with 1 0 v adsorption voltage and 20 mm nacl solution as the feed biesheuvel et al 2011 charge efficiency in the classic cdi could be further lowered by increasing the tds concentration in the feed due to higher initial co ion concentration in edls which could lead to more expulsion of co ions in the adsorption step it has been demonstrated zhao et al 2012a that when feed tds concentration was increased from 1000 ppm to 11 600 ppm the charge efficiency of the classic cdi unit decreased from 0 8 to 0 6 the significant drop in charge efficiency at high ionic concentrations is one of the reasons that application of classic cdi is limited to treatment of low tds feed 4000 ppm laxman et al 2015 lee et al 2006 another obstacle limiting the classic cdi for industrial brine treatment is the high fouling propensity it is well known that porous carbon is intrinsically a good adsorbent for organics due to its porous structure surface chemical functional groups and active sites in forms of edges dislocations and discontinuities bansal and goyal 2005 therefore classic cdi is prone to organic fouling as its porous carbon electrodes are exposed to organics in the feed directly mossad and zou 2013 wang et al 2015 as mentioned in section 2 2 2 it has been demonstrated that low level of organic concentration 10 ppm could lead to obvious fouling of the electrodes in a classic cdi cell this resulted in slower and less salt removal within 2 h of operation wang et al 2015 2018 hence classic cdi architecture may not be feasible for concentrating industrial brine due to its low energy efficiency high sensitivity to tds concentrations and susceptibility to fouling 3 2 membrane cdi mcdi the concept of membrane cdi mcdi was proposed by lee et al in 2006 and is currently a widely applied design for many different applications due to its higher salt removal and charge efficiency more versatile operating conditions and better fouling resistance compared with classic cdi biesheuvel et al 2011 lee et al 2006 li and zou 2011 porada et al 2013 zhao et al 2012a mcdi incorporates ion exchange membranes iem onto the electrode surface facing flow channel iems are semi permeable to ions carrying either positive or negative charges namely anion exchange membrane aem is only permeable to anions while cation exchange membrane cem only allows cations to pass through the adverse impact of co ion expulsion could be minimized with an aem placed before the anode and a cem placed before the cathode in mcdi the expelled co ions during adsorption steps would be entrapped within the macropores of electrodes instead of ending up in the flow channel due to the rejection by iems these entrapped co ions could further attract more counter ions into electrodes to achieve charge equilibrium which results in an increase in total salt removal biesheuvel et al 2011 demonstrated through lab scale experiments that the mcdi could achieve 20 more salt removal compared with the classic cdi when treating 1200 ppm of nacl solution another lab scale experiment demonstrated nearly 30 increase in salt removal capacity of the mcdi compared with the classic cdi when treating 400 ppm nacl laxman et al 2015 the charge efficiency of the mcdi is higher and more stable than that of the classic cdi with increasing feed concentration it was demonstrated that the charge efficiency of the mcdi was more than 4 times of the classic cdi when treating 400 ppm of nacl solution laxman et al 2015 another direct comparison between classic cdi and mcdi showed that the charge efficiency of mcdi remained around 0 8 while that of classic cdi dropped from 0 8 to 0 6 with feed concentration increasing from 1000 ppm to 10 000 ppm zhao et al 2012a the reason is that the entrapped co ions in adsorption step of mcdi no matter how high their concentrations are could attract extra counter ions to achieve charge equilibrium in the macropores of electrodes hence increasing feed concentration in mcdi would not reduce the charge efficiency as much as it would in classic cdi another advantage of the mcdi over the classic cdi is that mcdi could enhance the desalination performance under different operational strategies such as reversed voltage desorption rvd constant current adsorption cca and constant current desorption ccd rvd cleans up counter ions from electrodes more effectively in the mcdi than the classic cdi the ideal constant effluent concentrations of cca and ccd can only be achieved with iems in the mcdi the impact of cell architecture on different operational strategies is discussed in section 4 1 fouling could occur less extensively in mcdi kim et al 2010 chen et al 2018 mcdi effluent was reported to have lower ph fluctuation compared with that of classic cdi yu et al 2018 due to reduced faradaic processes the lower ph fluctuation could reduce the scaling risk under strong basic conditions furthermore the incorporation of iems provides moderate physical protection for electrodes from organic fouling as majority of the fouling layer was observed on the iem surfaces chen et al 2018 sem images of the electrodes of the mcdi and the classic cdi showed that less organic deposition was observed on electrodes from the mcdi setup compared with that from the classic cdi setup chen et al 2018 it is noteworthy that small molecular weight organics such as ha and alginate chen et al 2018 and multivalent ions kim et al 2018 are still able to penetrate through iems they could eventually deposit in the electrode pores and cause fouling to the electrodes of the mcdi which might require periodical chemical cleaning nonetheless mcdi shows lower fouling propensity compared with classic cdi due to the physical protection of electrodes by iems and less ph fluctuation the mcdi could achieve higher adsorption capacity enhanced energy efficiency more flexible operational modes and enhanced fouling resistance compared with the classic cdi which are essential for concentration of industrial brines however the static electrode design of the mcdi architecture has limited its total adsorption capacity in a single adsorption step and may not be sufficient for treating the high tds 10 000 ppm in industrial brines further research on optimization of the mcdi architecture with different operational strategies section 4 would be useful under such circumstances in addition comprehensive evaluation on the fouling severity and mechanism of mcdi could aid in developing fouling mitigation strategies the robustness and long term application of the mcdi for treating high fouling potential feed would still need to be demonstrated even though the mcdi is currently industrial scale ready atlantis technologies 2012 biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 suss et al 2015 3 3 flow electrode cdi fcdi classic cdi and mcdi are cyclical processes that require electrode regeneration once their electrodes are saturated their non continuous operation requires complicated control design and would lead to loss of product water during the step switch the concept of flow electrode cdi fcdi was proposed in 2013 to overcome this drawback jeon et al 2013 the conventional static electrodes are replaced by slurry based electrode which can be pumped through the electrode compartments in the fcdi cell the electrode compartment and flow channel are separated by iems desorption or regeneration of electrodes are conducted in a side stream system outside the fcdi cell in this way continuous desalination can be achieved as regenerated electrodes are constantly available in the desalination cell water recovery of fcdi could be increased due to the separation of desorption and adsorption processes desorption steps in static electrode cdis sacrifice part of the feed stream as concentrated stream to accommodate the desorbed ions however feed stream in the fcdi only undergoes continuous adsorption process as the desorption process is independent of the adsorption process in this way feed loss could be minimized in the fcdi water recoveries of up to 90 gendel et al 2014 rommerskirchen et al 2015 were reported using different regeneration schemes in the fcdi process another merit of fcdi is its dynamic total adsorption capacity the electrode density in the electrode compartment and the electrode contact area with the feed channel in the fcdi cell could be adjusted to facilitate desirable removal for high tds feed jeon et al 2013 ma et al 2018 yang et al 2017a common practices include the addition of more electrode particles in the electrode slurry yang et al 2017a widening and deepening the electrode flow path and adding more electrode flow paths in the electrode compartment jeon et al 2013 as such the fcdi could provide sufficient and dynamic salt adsorption sites yang et al 2017a to remove the high salt content in industrial brines close to complete salt removal was reported when the carbon content in the electrode was raised from 6 89 wt to 11 1 wt yang et al 2017a salt removal of 95 42 in treating a feed containing 35 000 ppm nacl was achieved by increasing the contact area over 20 times between the electrode compartment and the feed channel jeon et al 2013 to date the fcdi is still at lab scale stage which requires further development in terms of optimization on energy consumption for high tds feed 2000 ppm fang et al 2018 he et al 2018 ma et al 2018 long term continuous regeneration step he et al 2018 yang et al 2017a and assessment on its feasibility for large scale operation 125 ml min lee et al 2018 yang et al 2016 2017b mechanism severity and reversibility of fouling in the fcdi process have not been extensively studied therefore further research and development for the fcdi is required before it is pilot or full scale ready for implementation summary of the three cdi cell architectures and their feasibility of treating industrial brines is shown in table 3 4 operational strategies of cdi 4 1 adsorption and desorption modes operation modes for adsorption step in cdi process include constant current adsorption cca and constant voltage adsorption cva operation modes for desorption step on the other hand include zero voltage desorption zvd reverse current desorption rcd and reverse voltage desorption rvd han et al 2015 zhao et al 2012a 2012b the most conventional sequence to operate cdi process is cva zvd under cva the effluent salt concentration reaches a minimum in the beginning when salt removal is the fastest and slowly increases back to feed value as the removal rate slows down with increasing counter edl voltage porada et al 2013 zhao et al 2012a during zvd counter ions are desorbed from electrodes spontaneously under mutual repulsion until the salt concentration in macropores approaches that of bulk solution biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 porada et al 2013 desorption is the fastest at the beginning of zvd as concentration of counter ions in edls is at its maximum a short peak of salt concentration can thus be observed zhao et al 2012a desorption slows down as edls approach charge neutrality concentration of the concentrated stream slowly decays back to the feed value given sufficient desorption time effluent salt concentration profile with time under operational cycles of cva and zvd is shown in fig 3 a rvd has been demonstrated with faster desorption rate and more effective desorption than zvd for high tds concentrations in addition to spontaneous mutual repulsion desorption under rvd is partially driven by the reversed electric field as well which could accelerate the desorption rate biesheuvel et al 2011 porada et al 2013 desorption step and cycle time could thus be shortened moreover desorption is more effective under rvd than zvd desorption of counter ions is terminated when electrode is charge neutral under zvd while it continues until electrodes are fully depleted of counter ions under rvd as a result rvd could achieve more effective clean up of counter ions from electrodes so that electrodes could adsorb more counter ions during the next adsorption step porada et al 2013 a 20 increase in salt removal during the subsequent adsorption step was demonstrated by switching from zvd to rvd biesheuvel et al 2011 it is noteworthy that the clean up effect of counter ions under rvd is more significant in the mcdi than in the classic cdi co ions in the bulk solution are adsorbed into electrodes in the classic cdi when reversed voltage is applied for the desorption step these co ions would cause co ion expulsion in the next adsorption step and reduce salt removal and charge efficiency however the adsorption of co ions from the bulk solution is rejected by iems and thus co ion expulsion during the subsequent adsorption step is minimized in the mcdi besides the improvement on the adsorption capacity another merit for rvd operation might be the relaxation of fouling periodic reversal of polarity is applied in the edr process to reduce fouling severity the polarity reversal could stop further contaminant accumulation allison 1995 and even break up freshly precipitated scale before any irreversible damage could occur grebenyuk and grebenyuk 2002 valero and arbós 2010 similar relaxation of fouling could be achieved by rvd in the cdi process the reversed polarity in the cdi desorption step could serve the same purpose as periodic polarity reversal in the edr process to mitigate the impact of fouling however the effectiveness of rvd in mitigating fouling of cdi might be less significant compared with the reversed polarity in edr due to less flushing in cdi compartments of both concentrated and diluted streams in edr are continuously flushed with inlets which enhances the foulants removal this flushing effect is weakened for the electrodes in cdi processes as the tortuous water pathways inside the electrodes reduce the flow velocity significantly the flushing effect could even be negligible in mcdi as the electrodes are isolated from the feed stream by the iems little information is available on the effectiveness of rvd in fouling mitigation as majority of the cdi fouling study under rvd focused only on the fouling mechanism chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 rather than its anti fouling performance therefore there is a need to further investigate the anti fouling performance operated under zvd and rvd modes in summary rvd has the advantage over conventional zvd in handling industrial brines with high tds and high fouling potential however it requires external energy input further research on the cost effectiveness of rvd in salt removal and fouling relaxation would be needed to evaluate the practical feasibility of applying rvd for industrial brine treatment the major benefit of applying cca saleem et al 2016 zhao et al 2013c or rcd zhao et al 2012a 2013c is constant and tunable effluent concentration during cca the constant applied current is ideally translated to constant ionic current resulting in constant salt removal rate from the bulk solution and thus constant salt concentration in the effluent fig 3 b saleem et al 2016 zhao et al 2012a the voltage required to maintain the constant current would steadily increase due to the increasing counter edl voltage and lower electrolyte concentration zhao et al 2012a when the voltage reaches certain pre set thresholds such as 1 2 v 1 4 v and 1 6 v kang et al 2014 jande and kim 2013 zhao et al 2013c cca stops and desorption step takes place constant concentration at cca mode can only be achieved with iems incorporated in the cdi cell architecture practically the ionic current is carried by counter ions adsorption flux and co ion expulsion flux with the rejection of iems the co ion expulsion flux is minimized in mcdi thus the constant ionic current translates to constant counter ion adsorption flux solely in classic cdi without iems constant ionic current cannot fully translate into constant counter ion adsorption flux since both counter ions and co ions carry the ionic current as a result the effluent concentration could not level off to the desired constant low plateau quickly under constant current operation porada et al 2013 the constant and tunable effluent concentration from cca is advantageous for high tds removal from industrial brines due to the ease in quality control similar to cca rcd could produce ideal constant concentration for the concentrate stream only with the presence of iems it could also provide better clean up effect of electrodes during the desorption step and could relax the adsorbed fouling however the relaxation mechanisms leading to fouling mitigation in rcd would need further investigations hence adsorption and desorption modes could affect the performance of the cdi process the clean up effect from reversed polarity operations rvd rcd could lead to higher adsorption capacity for the next adsorption cycle which is in favor of the high tds removal for industrial brines reversed polarity operations could relieve the fouling formation in cdi as well which is beneficial in treating industrial brines with high fouling potential however effective fouling mitigation effect from reversed polarity operation has yet to be demonstrated comprehensively main benefit of constant current operations cca rcd is the constant effluent concentration which simplify the operational control especially when multi stage operation for high tds applications is involved section 4 2 it is noteworthy that rvd and rcd are not recommended for the classic cdi operation as optimum rvd and rcd could only be achieved with the presence of iems a summary of key features of the abovementioned operational modes is provided in table 4 4 2 long electrode multi stage cdi and brine recirculation the use of longer electrode in the cdi cell could provide more fresh electrode mass for the adsorption step this in turn could contribute to higher salt removal when static electrode architectures such as the classic cdi and the mcdi are applied for treating high tds feed though electrode mass could be increased by increasing electrode thickness the ion accessibility to the micropores embedded deeper in electrodes would be lower in thicker electrodes oren 2008 porada et al 2012 comparatively lengthening the electrode would be a more effective design to promote better contact between ions in the feed stream and adsorption sites in the electrodes along the flow path this method is used in the cdi cell from the atlantis technologies usa a 100 times 1 10 m longer than conventional electrode length was used that increased the feed tds limit to over 100 000 ppm atlantis technologies 2012 this tds limit is at least 25 times more than what the conventional cdi process could accommodate and would be useful for zld applications however extension of electrode length would require re engineering of the cdi modules namely spacer housing and power supply which might involve higher capital cost multi stage operation is another strategy for dealing with high tds applications without the need of re engineering the modules for static electrode architectures it refers to the process when feed stream passes through multiple cdi stages each stage removes a portion of salt from the feed until the target effluent tds concentration is attained this strategy allows the cdi to remove high tds from the feed as long as sufficient stages are provided another advantage of multi stage operation is high water recovery though the feed loss as concentrate stream at each single stage is inevitable it can be partially compensated in multi stage operation by returning the concentrate from sequential stages to the upstream stages the return mode enables concentrate streams to be diluted again by upstream stages and eventually produced as diluted product water in this way the volume of concentrate streams from multi stages is minimized and the overall water recovery increases long electrodes and multi stage operation would increase the electrode mass for adsorption as a result they could reduce the energy penalty from extra ion adsorption per adsorption site zhao et al 2012b 2013b however to our knowledge little information is available on the energy optimization of cdi at high tds concentrations 4000 ppm for these two strategies further researches on energy optimization of using these two strategies are needed to improve the cost effectiveness of the cdi process for high tds applications moreover the concentration of foulants in the final brine from these two strategies would rise with increased water recovery this would impose higher fouling risk in the later sections i e further downstream of the long electrode or in later stages of the multi stage cdi process further researches on the fouling potential of the two strategies are also needed for establishing feasible operating protocols brine recirculation could be applied to promote production of highly concentrated cdi brine for zld process brine recirculation in the cdi refers to the process that brine stream from previous desorption step is partially recirculated as brine streams for subsequent desorption steps concentration of the recirculated brine stream after multiple desorption steps could be significantly higher than that through single pass desorption continuous brine recirculation has been demonstrated for the mcdi hassanvand et al 2017 during this mode of operation the concentration ratio between recirculated brine and feed reached 2 while water recovery was increased over 40 desorption with higher brine concentration was demonstrated to be more energy efficient for the cdi it was reported garcía quismondo et al 2016 the overall energy efficiency increased from 66 to 79 82 when brine concentrations in the desorption step were increased from 0 05 m to 3 5 m using nacl solutions higher brine concentration has lower electrolyte resistance the lower electrolyte resistance allows higher desorption current density which is in favor of current efficiency in the desorption step garcía quismondo et al 2016 brine recirculation could potentially enhance the cost effectiveness of cdi process in generating highly concentrated brine for zld purpose at the current state brine recirculation has only been demonstrated at laboratory scale further efforts in operation optimization and scaling up are required moreover brine recirculation might increase the fouling potential of the recirculating brine as the concentration of foulants could build up as well the impact on the fouling propensity from brine recirculation under long term operation would need to be further evaluated 5 fouling control 5 1 pretreatment pretreatment refers to processes that remove fouling precursors prior to the cdi process this minimises fouling potential of the waste stream it has been reported that pretreatment method comprised of biological activated carbon bac and ultrafiltration uf can significantly prolong continuous operation of cdi in treating reverse osmosis concentrate roc generated from domestic wastewater reclamation process lee et al 2009b the operation time of the cdi process was doubled as the toc concentration was reduced by 39 9 from 24 6 ppm similar finding was reported by yu et al 2014 about 10 25 toc concentration reduction in the domestic roc stream from original toc concentration of 22 3 ppm using bac was able to extend the operational time by more than 14 times extensive pretreatment prior to the cdi process would be required for industrial brines due to their high toc concentration other pretreatment techniques may also be applied effectively to remove fouling precursor namely conventional chemical softening electro coagulation ec and nanofiltration nf biro and vončina 2016 semblante et al 2018 however the effectiveness of these pretreatment methods on industrial brine prior to cdi process would need to be extensively evaluated due to the presence of diverse types and nature of fouling precursors in the brine 5 2 antiscaling by antiscalants and monovalent ions antiscalant is a type of chemical agent that inhibits inorganic scale formation by altering one or more aspects of the crystallization process antony et al 2011 hasson et al 2011 it was originally designed for scale inhibition for boilers and is widely used in membrane processes like nf ro fritzmann et al 2007 and edr hanrahan et al 2016 myint et al 2013 it is important to note that antiscalant could pose two contradicting effects on cdi performance i e inhibition of inorganic scaling and fouling caused by antiscalant dosing antiscalant in the cdi process could reduce inorganic scaling severity however it could also cause fouling by itself such phenomena had been observed in the edr process it has been highlighted that antiscalants like polyacrylates and sodium hexametaphosphate could cause severe fouling on the iem surface of the edr allison 1995 the sodium hexametaphosphate fouling was apparent that rendered the edr performance to decline after 1 h of operation pretreatments of lime softening and media filtration were applied prior to the edr process to remove the sodium hexametaphosphate the operation duration was successfully extended to two months with sodium hexametaphosphate effectively removed by the pretreatments allison 1995 industrial brines may contain active antiscalant residue if antiscalant is used during the production of industrial brine from upstream processes such as nf and ro fritzmann et al 2007 there is significant merit to evaluate the impact of residual antiscalant in industrial brines to cdi process additional antiscalant dosing might be required in the cdi process if residual antiscalants in brines are not sufficient for effective control of inorganic scaling on the other hand pre removal of residual antiscalant prior to the cdi process might be needed if the residual antiscalants could cause significant fouling in summary impact of residual antiscalant selection of suitable antiscalant and optimized antiscalant in the cdi process would need to be determined for effective inorganic scaling control 5 3 antifouling modification of cdi materials antifouling modification of iem or electrode in the cdi cell have been studied to enhance fouling resistance enhancement of fouling resistance of iems is important as their surfaces are directly in contact with fouling precursors in the feed stream two major mechanisms of organic fouling to iems are identified as i electrostatic interaction between organic substance and membrane fixed charge and ii affinity interaction between the organic and membrane matrix mikhaylin and bazinet 2016 tanaka et al 2012 wang et al 2017 hence modification on the surface charge density and hydrophilic hydrophobic balance of iem surfaces could enhance the anti fouling performance mikhaylin and bazinet 2016 it was demonstrated that increasing negative charge density and hydrophilicity on surface of aem neosepta amx contributed to the improvement of antifouling performance to sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate sdbs mulyati et al 2012 the water contact angle was reduced by 5 and the zeta potential was reduced by 11 mv as a result the time for sdbs fouling to occur was extended by more than 4 times mulyati et al 2012 similar anti fouling modifications were also demonstrated by other studies tanaka et al 2011 vaselbehagh et al 2014 however most of these anti fouling modifications on iems were examined for edr rather than cdi applications an understanding on the effectiveness of these anti fouling modification for the cdi process is important as it could facilitate mitigation of fouling problem further research on effectiveness durability and cost of anti fouling modifications on iems in the cdi process would need to be investigated for the treatment of industrial brines anti fouling property for electrodes of the cdi is important as well since electrodes could still be fouled by small molecular weight organics section 3 2 several anti fouling modifications on cdi electrodes have been reported it has been demonstrated zhang et al 2018b that a porous carbon electrode modified by zwitterionic polymers was able to maintain its original adsorption capacity even after 100 cycles of operation with 100 ppm of bsa while the adsorption capacity of unmodified electrodes was reduced by half results from field emission sem showed no significant bsa deposition on the modified electrode compared with the unmodified bsa fouled electrode another modification using tio2 reduced graphene oxide rgo evaluated by zhang and his co workers zhang and jia 2015 exhibited photocatalytic ability of removing ha under visible light the photocatalytic oxidation of ha due to the incorporation of tio2 rgo could relieve organic fouling by nearly 40 in 4 h though it was reported that antifouling modification could improve the fouling resistance of electrodes the antifouling performance in treating actual industrial brines under long term operation would need to be further investigated due to the complexity and high concentration of foulants 5 4 chemical cleaning periodic chemical cleaning is commonly used to complement the fouling control regime in desalination processes including the cdi process it could aid fouling removal and could recover the desalination performance common chemical agents used for cleaning are hcl citric acid naoh edta etc garcia vasquez et al 2016 guo et al 2015 peng et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 acidic cleaning mainly removes hydroxide and carbonate scaling while alkaline cleaning targets organic fouling mossad and zou 2013 wang et al 2018 the fundamental study on inorganic scaling and organic fouling of the cdi performed by mossad et al 2013 showed acid cleaning provided 83 9 of total ferric scalant removal while alkaline cleaning accounted for 84 of total organic foulant removal in another report removal of organic fouling in the cdi caused by protein and humic acid during domestic wastewater treatment was also shown to be 10 times more effective with alkaline cleaning 0 01 m of naoh compared with acid cleaning 0 01 m hcl wang et al 2015 a similar conclusion was drawn when 2 citric acid used for clean in place cip in the cdi process was found ineffective in removing organic fouling yu et al 2014 as most wastewater contains multivalent ions and organic foulants both acidic and alkaline cleanings would be required to achieve optimum cleaning effects for instance cleaning strategy using citric acid and naoh was successful in recovering tds removal efficiency in the cdi module zhang et al 2013 calcium magnesium and ferric scalants were initially removed by 0 01m citric acid followed by 0 01m naoh solution to remove the organic foulants tds removal efficiency regained the original level after the two step cleaning zhang et al 2013 acid and alkaline cleaning are less pronounced for gypsum scaling removal due to the ph insensitivity of gypsum solubility cleaning methods for gypsum scale removal such as deionized water flush asraf snir et al 2016 mi and elimelech 2010 and edta cikes et al 1990 peng et al 2015 rinse have been demonstrated in edr md fo and ro applications occurrence of gypsum scaling was reported for a lab scale cdi system treating synthetic caso4 solutions up to 600 ppm lado et al 2015 however the abovementioned control methods for gypsum scaling are yet to be demonstrated in the cdi process gypsum scaling would be a significant concern for the cdi process especially in the treatment of industrial brine containing high concentrations of ca2 and so4 2 hence understanding the mechanism and control of gypsum scaling in cdi applications would be essential to promote a feasible cdi process for industrial brine treatment the complexity of industrial brine characteristics may require multi level fouling mitigation strategies covering pretreatment antifouling modification on cdi materials use of antiscalant and chemical cleaning optimization of these multi level fouling mitigation strategies could enhance the cost effectiveness of the cdi process for its long term industrial brine treatment this would require further research to establish the integrated fouling mitigation protocol for the cdi process 6 conclusion high tds concentration and high fouling potential are the two major challenges in applying the cdi process to concentrate industrial brines for zld purpose cell architecture operational strategies and fouling controls for the cdi process are reviewed to address these challenges and to establish optimization strategies a summary of the findings from this review is shown in fig 4 in general cell architectures could affect salt removal charge efficiency and fouling resistance of the cdi process salt removal and charge efficiency are higher in the mcdi compared with the classic cdi due to the incorporation of iems continuous desalination high feed tds up to seawater level and high water recovery up to 90 have been demonstrated for the fcdi further research with large scale and long term operation would be needed to access the feasibility of using these cell architectures for industrial brine treatment operational strategies including rvd multi stage operation and brine recirculation are potential means to enhance the feasibility of using the cdi process in zld systems rvd not only enhances the salt removal but also has potential to mitigate fouling multi stage operation could increase salt removal and water recovery for static electrode architectures brine recirculation is able to promote the production of highly concentrated brine from the cdi process and increase the overall water recovery on the other hand increased water recovery and higher brine concentration from these operational strategies may increase energy consumption and the risk of fouling in the cdi process further research on integration and optimization of these operational strategies is needed for developing effective operational protocols for the cdi process to concentrate industrial brines the risk of fouling brought by industrial brine could be minimized through fouling control methods as well i e pretreatment addition of antiscalant antifouling modification and chemical cleaning removal of foulants by pretreatment is able to reduce the fouling severity and prolong intervals between chemical cleanings pretreatment could be a cost effective way to prevent persistent fouling such as heavy metal scaling which is difficult to be removed by chemical cleaning addition of antiscalant and antifouling modification could increase the fouling resistance so that the cdi could treat feed with challenging organic concentrations more research with real wastewater and long term operation would be needed to further evaluate the cost effectiveness of antiscalant and antifouling modification in the cdi process chemical cleaning is effective in removal of foulants using chemical agents such as hcl citric acid naoh and edta which could serve as the last strategy to recover the performance of cdi from fouling it could be more effective and efficient to apply integrated fouling control methods than individual method when cdi process is applied for treatment of industrial brines with high fouling potential declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
17730,thermal based zero liquid discharge zld process has been used for managing industrial brine however conventional thermal zld process is very energy intensive in view of this pre concentration techniques have been applied prior to thermal process to reduce energy consumption of zld systems capacitive deionization cdi is an emerging desalination technique and has yet to be extensively explored for the treatment of industrial brine especially for zld applications high concentration of total dissolved solids tds and high fouling potential of industrial brine are two major challenges in cdi process this paper reviews the possible factors for optimizing cdi process in industrial brine treatment namely cell architectures strategies in operation and fouling control cell architectures of membrane cdi mcdi and flow electrode cdi cdi are preferred options for treating industrial brine compared with classic cdi in terms of energy consumption and fouling propensity there are other operational strategies that could enhance the feasibility of using cdi process for zld application these include reversed voltage desorption multi stage operation brine recirculation and fouling control fouling control methods comprise pretreatment antifouling modification antiscalant and chemical cleaning these methods could be integrated to optimize fouling mitigation in addition to providing insights on feasibility of using cdi to concentrate industrial brines this review also proposed guidelines for optimizing cdi process applied to treat industrial brines for zld applications

discharge of untreated industrial brines could lead to adverse aquatic environment impacts due to salinity rise and toxic artificial organics fernández torquemada et al 2005 roberts et al 2010 proper disposal and management of industrial brines are required disposal of brines to surface water bodies municipal sewers deep well and evaporation ponds have been commonly practiced ahmed et al 2000 arnal et al 2005 umar et al 2015 increase in global awareness of industrial brine hazards has led to more stringent regulations mickley 2007 sethi et al 2006 public utilities board 2007 and compliance practices had led to costlier disposal methods arnal et al 2005 glueckstern and priel 1997 leong et al 2014 mickley 2007 morillo et al 2014 tong and elimelech 2016 for desalination plants the cost for brine disposal takes up 5 33 of the total desalination cost arnal et al 2005 glueckstern and priel 1997 morillo et al 2014 more stringent regulations and increase in brine disposal cost have led to increasing zero liquid discharge zld practices over the recent years the concept of zld is a management strategy for wastewater especially brine that aims to eliminate liquid waste from leaving the plant while concurrently recover water and salt by products for reuse badruzzaman et al 2009 early zld systems were based on stand alone thermal processes namely thermal evaporators followed by thermal crystallizers which are energy intensive thermal evaporation consumes energy typically in the range between 20 and 25 kwh m3 of treated feed while the energy demand for thermal crystallizer is about 2 3 times higher tong and elimelech 2016 although the overall water recovery increases significantly using conventional zld systems direct concentration of industrial brine using thermal evaporators and crystallizers leads to high demand of energy 1 2 potential application of cdi process in zld systems thermal processes are indispensable in the zld systems even though they are energy intensive recent zld systems implement preconcentrators prior to thermal process to reduce total cost pérez gonzález et al 2012 tong and elimelech 2016 preconcentrators further reduce the brine volume which leads to cost reduction of the subsequent thermal processes capacitive deionization cdi is an emerging electricity based and energy saving desalination technique with potential preconcentration application for zld table 2 summarizes the key features of cdi and other preconcentrators in zld systems for industrial brine treatment such as low fouling ro electrodialysis reversal edr forward osmosis fo and membrane distillation md tong and elimelech 2016 tsai et al 2017 ro technology is a widely applied desalination process due to its relative cost and energy effectiveness however concentrating brines to tds higher than 75 000 ppm using ro would not be economically feasible as it would require extremely high pressure to overcome the osmotic pressure tong and elimelech 2016 the brine concentration from non pressure driven processes namely md edr fo and cdi however are not limited by the osmotic pressure and could exceed 75 000 ppm studies have reported that brine tds concentrations from md edr and fo could exceed 200 000 ppm tong and elimelech 2016 as for cdi atlantis technologies usa a commercial company claimed their cdi system could achieve a brine concentration of 100 000 ppm treating shale gas produced wastewater atlantis technologies 2012 as shown in table 2 cdi process could be a potential energy efficient desalination technique to achieve brine concentration beyond 75 000 ppm the involvement of thermal processes for md al obaidani et al 2008 and fo johnson et al 2018 increases their energy consumption significantly when waste heat is unavailable this could escalate their energy requirement to be comparable with thermal evaporators energy consumption of 0 7 and 0 53 kwhe 1000 ppm tds removed were reported for the edr bernardes et al 2016 and cdi zhao et al 2013b processes respectively in view that cdi development is still relatively at its infancy stage compared with edr and ro research and development incorporating energy recovery in the process could further enhance its energy efficiency in the future andres and yoshihara 2016 kang et al 2016 fouling is a major operational issue in membrane based pre concentrators ro is known for its high fouling tendency jiang et al 2017 due to the pressure driven operation extensive pretreatment may be required for ro to further concentrate industrial brines kumar et al 2006 semblante et al 2018 fouling was reported to be less pronounced in md tijing et al 2015 tow et al 2018 fo shaffer et al 2015 edr bernardes et al 2016 and cdi almarzooqi et al 2014 compared with ro as no external pressure is required in the former processes as an electro membrane based process similar to edr fouling in cdi could be further mitigated by reversing the operational potential section 4 1 in addition silica fouling typically does not occur in cdi operation as silica is generally uncharged use of cdi process in concentrating industrial brines for zld application have yet to be explored extensively though cdi is comparative to other pre concentration techniques challenges from treating industrial brines may face concerns such as insufficient salt removal and high fouling propensity this paper critically reviewed contributing factors related to these challenges including cdi cell architectures section 3 operational strategies section 4 and fouling control section 5 in addition this review identified possible optimization methods and strategies to overcome the challenges which provided insights on the feasibility of using cdi to concentrate industrial brines a design guide for cdi process applied to concentrate industrial brines is included in this review from the abovementioned understanding the design guide could be used to establish valuable decision making criteria for cdi process optimization in treating industrial brines 2 technical background of capacitive deionization process 2 1 desalination mechanism desalination mechanism of cdi process is widely recognized as electrosorption it describes the process when counter ions are immobilized by electrical double layers edl almarzooqi et al 2014 porada et al 2013 suss et al 2015 zhao 2013 counter ions ions carrying opposite charges to the electrode are attracted to the electrode surface while co ions ions carrying same charges as the electrode are repelled from electrode surface according to the gouy chapman stern gcs theory edl which is formed within micropores inside cdi electrodes refers to the two layers next to the electrode solution interface where ions are compactly and diffusively distributed biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 biesheuvel et al 2011 a schematic of the edl structure is shown in fig 1 in this review micropores describe the pore space inside carbon particles while macropores refer to the inter particle space between carbon particles micropores account for large surface area while macropores serve as pathways for ion transportation it is often assumed that initial salt concentration in macropores is the same as that in the bulk solution biesheuvel et al 2011 porada et al 2013 during the adsorption step of cdi process bulk solution flows between a pair of charged porous electrodes and counter ions migrate to the surface of electrodes under electro static force when an external voltage is applied these counter ions are then immobilized and stored within the edls namely cations are stored in the negatively charged electrode while anions are stored in the positively charged electrode once counter ions are immobilized and electrically adsorbed within the edls they are deemed as separated or removed from the solution this results in the production of a diluted stream to regenerate the adsorption capacity of electrodes adsorbed ions must be released through the desorption step or regeneration step desorption step is normally achieved by removing or reversing the external voltage a concentrated stream is produced as desorbed ions migrate back to the bulk solution desalination through cdi is achieved in non continuous mode with alternate adsorption and desorption steps that complete an operational cycle two streams are produced in each cycle namely a diluted stream as product water and a concentrated stream as concentrated brine a schematic of a full cdi cycle is shown in fig 2 2 2 challenges for cdi process in treatment of industrial brines 2 2 1 energy and removal efficiency for treating high tds feed cdi process have been applied mainly for water and wastewater with tds 4000 ppm namely ground water remediation farmer et al 1997 brackish water desalination laxman et al 2015 and reclamation of industrial wastewater lee et al 2006 industrial brine typically contains tds concentration several times higher than 4000 ppm table 1 even though the feed osmotic pressure may not be an operational limit in cdi process consideration on critical issues such as increase in energy consumption reduced energy efficiency and insufficient salt removal need to be evaluated when treating high tds feed as an electricity based desalination technique the cdi energy consumption is in near linear relation with salt removal hence the energy consumption would increase with increasing feed tds in order to achieve a similar dilute stream quality by removing more salts increasing feed tds could also lead to a decrease in energy efficiency one reason is that more co ion expulsion could occur under higher solution concentrations co ion expulsion could lead to reduced charge efficiency which is further discussed in section 3 1 another source of energy loss in cdi processes is the resistive loss which was reported to increase almost proportionally to current hemmatifar et al 2016 the resistive loss would increase for treating feed with higher tds as higher current would be needed to maintain the desired salt removal and recovery ratio it was demonstrated that the energy consumption per adsorbed ion increases linearly when increasing operational currents are applied to maintain or increase the salt removal and water recovery for feed tds from 1000 ppm to 5000 ppm zhao et al 2012a 2013b the decrease in energy efficiency is another consideration that limits most cdi applications to process feed with tds concentration below 4000 ppm energy loss through faradaic reactions was shown to be minimal hemmatifar et al 2018 wang et al 2019 parasitic currents were reported to contribute less than 4 of the total operational currents qu et al 2016 hemmatifar et al 2016 faradaic loss could dominate over resistive loss under extreme operational conditions such as current density lower than 1 5 a m2 and cycle duration over 100 min hemmatifar et al 2016 these operating conditions would not be applicable for treating high tds industrial brines because this would lead to extremely slow desalination rate and long operation time hence faradaic loss may be negligible compared with the resistive loss when applied for treatment of high tds industrial brines it has been recommended that a proper cdi electrode should have an adsorption capacity of 8 mg nacl per gram of electrodes mg g at cell voltage of 1 2 v porada et al 2013 the adsorption capacity of some commercial capacitive electrodes could reach 14 18 mg g zhao et al 2013b 2013c however the highest reported feed concentration using these electrodes was merely around 5800 ppm which is lower than the typical brine concentrations in table 1 this is due to the total adsorption capacity under similar operational conditions of these static electrode cdi cells is limited by both the adsorption capacity of the electrode materials and the electrode mass used in the cdi cells which are typically fixed with the setup the fixed total adsorption capacity of static electrode cdi cells could lead to insufficient salt removal in a single adsorption step when treating high tds feed under such circumstances further downstream desalination processes would be required to polish the cdi effluent to meet the desired quality moreover the fixed total adsorption capacity could result in limited brine concentration as it would restrict the amount of desorbing ions in a single desorption step limited brine concentration from cdi process does not favor a cost effective zld system because it may require more downstream thermal treatments which account for the major part of the total zld cost tong and elimelech 2016 despite the technical drawback highlighted further research and development in cdi has explored its potential for treatment of high tds feed from industrial brines lab scale experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of cdi application on treating feed with tds up to seawater concentration using synthetic nacl solutions jeon et al 2013 the desalination application of a commercial cdi system from atlantis us for treating shale gas produced wastewater with tds concentration of 100 000 ppm was reported atlantis technologies 2012 modification on cdi cell architectures and changing operational strategies could facilitate high tds removal without compromising the energy efficiency the impact of cell architectures and operational strategies on salt removal energy consumption and energy efficiency of cdi for high tds removal are discussed in sections 3 and 4 respectively 2 2 2 inorganic scaling and organic fouling the use of industrial water generally employs pre treatments with microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf and other techniques which could minimize the downstream fouling potential from non dissolved contaminants such as bacteria and colloids in industrial brines jiang et al 2017 nonetheless fouling issues due to inorganic scaling and organic fouling remain as operational challenges that need to be addressed in the cdi process treating industrial brines that contain high concentrations of multivalent ions and dissolved organics the occurrence of inorganic scaling and organic fouling would lead to reduced salt removal tao et al 2011 increased energy consumption chen et al 2018 and eventually system shutdown yu et al 2014 if not managed carefully in the cdi process therefore an understanding on the underlying mechanism is critical to formulate effective fouling mitigation methods for the cdi process dissolved organics in wastewater namely humic substances lee et al 2002 li and elimelech 2004 bovine serum albumin bsa lee et al 2009a park et al 2005 dodecyl benzene sulfonate dbs lee et al 2009a wang et al 2017 and alginate chen et al 2018 are normally negatively charged and would act similarly as ions under an electric field these charged organic and inorganic ions in the wastewater migrate and accumulate towards the electrodes during the adsorption step of the cdi process this accumulation could create a super saturation condition near the electrode surfaces provided with sufficient time inorganic salts i e calcium magnesium carbonate gypsum calcium magnesium hydroxide and hydroxides of heavy metals and organics would precipitate and deposit to the effective adsorption site under such super saturation conditions al amoudi 2010 lado et al 2015 wang et al 2016 moreover the ph change in the electrodes could lead to foulant formation faradaic processes on the electrode surface could lead to basic cathodes and acidic anodes during the adsorption steps due to reduction of oxygen and water oxidation of carbon and other faradaic reactions related to the functional groups on the electrode surface dykstra et al 2017 yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a the increase in ph at cathodes could accelerate precipitation of multi valent cations by forming hydroxides with low solubility products especially heavy metal ions the acidic condition at anodes could reduce the surface charge of dissolved organics that promotes aggregation of organics due to lower inter repulsion force jiang et al 2017 ang and elimelech 2007 both inorganic scaling and organic fouling would reduce active adsorption capacity and increase migration resistance for ions leading to lower salt removal and higher energy consumption lado et al 2015 mossad and zou 2013 wang et al 2015 2018 zhang et al 2013 lado et al 2015 reported that the cdi cell adsorption capacity dropped by 30 after 35 cycles and caso4 was found accumulated with an amount of 10 8 mg caso4 per gram of electrode over 6 operation cycles using feed containing 3 mm caso4 in another study approximately 9 reduction in salt removal was observed in cdi process treating biological treated effluent with 7 0 ppm toc compared to controlling synthetic nacl solution wang et al 2015 concurrently higher energy consumptions were reported in organic fouled cdi cells the energy consumption of a lab scale cdi unit was increased by 56 8 and 26 3 with the addition of 50 ppm humic acid ha and sodium alginate in the feed respectively compared with feed containing only 75 ppm nacl chen et al 2018 in another cdi process study higher energy consumption was recorded from 3 25 kwh m3 to 4 52 kwh m3 when ha concentrations in the feed was increased from 3 ppm to 10 ppm mossad and zou 2013 fouling in cdi process could be worsened when treating real industrial brines due to the co existence of inorganic and organic compounds the interaction between inorganic and organic compounds could intensify the extent of fouling compared with individual inorganic scaling or organic fouling guo et al 2014 for instance divalent ions like ca2 could interact specifically with the carboxylic groups in nature organic matters nom to form metal humic complexes li and elimelech 2004 wang et al 2016 ha deposition onto iem of a membrane cdi mcdi module showed significant increase from 40 3 to 175 7 μg cm2 in the presence of ca2 ions chen et al 2018 hence multiple fouling mitigation strategies may need to be engaged simultaneously in cdi process treating industrial brines in addition extra caution would be required for using cdi process to treat industrial brines containing heavy metal ions due to the slow desorption and the partially irreversible chemical adsorption of heavy metal ions desorption of heavy metal ions could be 20 slower than na due to their high valence lado et al 2014 heavy metals can form valent bonds with electrode surface through complexation chelation and ion exchange amuda et al 2007 inyang et al 2016 kołodyńska et al 2017 they can also induce redox reactions to the electrodes as noted with arsenic ions and chromium ions kumar et al 2014 xu et al 2018 the chemical interactions between heavy metals and electrode surface lead to partially irreversible adsorption of heavy metals which eventually causes accumulation of heavy metals in electrodes desorption efficiencies of 62 and 24 were reported for cu2 and pb2 respectively from a lab scale cdi test li et al 2018 their complex deposition in cdi electrodes were also observed li et al 2018 huang et al 2016 thus pretreatment techniques section 5 1 such as chemical softening is recommended for industrial brines containing noticeable concentrations of heavy metals to avoid chemical deterioration of electrodes and excessive chemical cleaning silica in water and wastewater is typically uncharged under the commonly applied operating conditions which has rendered it to be ineffectively removed by electro membrane systems such as edr and cdi processes allison 1995 bernardes et al 2016 therefore cdi operation is not limited by silica fouling compared to pressure based membrane processes like ro and fo mi and elimelech 2013 semiat et al 2003 similar to any membrane based processes fouling is inevitable in cdi cdi process is believed to experience less severe fouling compared with nf and ro due to the non pressure driven nature of the process almarzooqi et al 2014 choi et al 2019 suss et al 2015 however the complex characteristics and high concentrations of foulants in industrial brines elevate its fouling potential to a more noticeable level compared with common brackish water and domestic wastewater therefore effective fouling mitigation strategies in the cdi process would need to be established for the process to be feasibly applied to concentrate industrial brines cell architectures operational strategies and fouling control could impact the fouling severity in cdi process treating industrial brines this paper reviews their impacts on fouling mitigation in section 3 4 and 5 respectively 3 cell architecture of cdi 3 1 classic cdi classic cdi membrane cdi mcdi and flow electrode cdi fcdi are the current prevailing cell architectures classic cdi is the most conventional cell architecture in which pairs of electrodes are separated by non conductive spacers it is easy to set up and is widely reported in literature and applied in industry andres and yoshihara 2016 hou et al 2014 jung et al 2007 seo et al 2010 xu et al 2008 however classic cdi would not be feasible for industrial brine treatment compared with mcdi and fcdi architectures because it might encounter drawbacks from insufficient salt removal low energy efficiency and severe fouling the classic cdi is a static electrode architecture and thus the total adsorption capacity from one adsorption step is limited by the adsorption capacity of the electrode materials and the allocated electrode mass adding to this the charge efficiency of the classic cdi is lower than that of the mcdi and decreases with increasing feed tds concentrations charge efficiency is defined as the ratio between the amount of adsorbed ion by electrodes and the charge transferred between electrodes for adsorption zhao et al 2009 it is normally used to quantify energy efficiency of cdi ideally one charge transferred between electrodes results in one monovalent salt molecule removal in adsorption step leading to a unity of charge efficiency in actual applications charge efficiency is always smaller than unity due to non ideal electric compensation mechanisms suss et al 2015 one of the major compensation mechanisms is co ion expulsion porada et al 2013 suss et al 2015 co ions coexist with counter ions in edl region when electrode is neutral charge transfer between electrodes is thus partially converted into the expulsion of co ions out of edls rather than the adsorption of counter ions into edls in this way charge efficiency is lowered from unity in the classic cdi co ions expelled from edls ultimately end up in spacer channels which reduces the overall salt removal and thus the charge efficiency biesheuvel et al 2011 porada et al 2013 zhao et al 2009 a charge efficiency of 0 6 was reported using a classic cdi setup with 1 0 v adsorption voltage and 20 mm nacl solution as the feed biesheuvel et al 2011 charge efficiency in the classic cdi could be further lowered by increasing the tds concentration in the feed due to higher initial co ion concentration in edls which could lead to more expulsion of co ions in the adsorption step it has been demonstrated zhao et al 2012a that when feed tds concentration was increased from 1000 ppm to 11 600 ppm the charge efficiency of the classic cdi unit decreased from 0 8 to 0 6 the significant drop in charge efficiency at high ionic concentrations is one of the reasons that application of classic cdi is limited to treatment of low tds feed 4000 ppm laxman et al 2015 lee et al 2006 another obstacle limiting the classic cdi for industrial brine treatment is the high fouling propensity it is well known that porous carbon is intrinsically a good adsorbent for organics due to its porous structure surface chemical functional groups and active sites in forms of edges dislocations and discontinuities bansal and goyal 2005 therefore classic cdi is prone to organic fouling as its porous carbon electrodes are exposed to organics in the feed directly mossad and zou 2013 wang et al 2015 as mentioned in section 2 2 2 it has been demonstrated that low level of organic concentration 10 ppm could lead to obvious fouling of the electrodes in a classic cdi cell this resulted in slower and less salt removal within 2 h of operation wang et al 2015 2018 hence classic cdi architecture may not be feasible for concentrating industrial brine due to its low energy efficiency high sensitivity to tds concentrations and susceptibility to fouling 3 2 membrane cdi mcdi the concept of membrane cdi mcdi was proposed by lee et al in 2006 and is currently a widely applied design for many different applications due to its higher salt removal and charge efficiency more versatile operating conditions and better fouling resistance compared with classic cdi biesheuvel et al 2011 lee et al 2006 li and zou 2011 porada et al 2013 zhao et al 2012a mcdi incorporates ion exchange membranes iem onto the electrode surface facing flow channel iems are semi permeable to ions carrying either positive or negative charges namely anion exchange membrane aem is only permeable to anions while cation exchange membrane cem only allows cations to pass through the adverse impact of co ion expulsion could be minimized with an aem placed before the anode and a cem placed before the cathode in mcdi the expelled co ions during adsorption steps would be entrapped within the macropores of electrodes instead of ending up in the flow channel due to the rejection by iems these entrapped co ions could further attract more counter ions into electrodes to achieve charge equilibrium which results in an increase in total salt removal biesheuvel et al 2011 demonstrated through lab scale experiments that the mcdi could achieve 20 more salt removal compared with the classic cdi when treating 1200 ppm of nacl solution another lab scale experiment demonstrated nearly 30 increase in salt removal capacity of the mcdi compared with the classic cdi when treating 400 ppm nacl laxman et al 2015 the charge efficiency of the mcdi is higher and more stable than that of the classic cdi with increasing feed concentration it was demonstrated that the charge efficiency of the mcdi was more than 4 times of the classic cdi when treating 400 ppm of nacl solution laxman et al 2015 another direct comparison between classic cdi and mcdi showed that the charge efficiency of mcdi remained around 0 8 while that of classic cdi dropped from 0 8 to 0 6 with feed concentration increasing from 1000 ppm to 10 000 ppm zhao et al 2012a the reason is that the entrapped co ions in adsorption step of mcdi no matter how high their concentrations are could attract extra counter ions to achieve charge equilibrium in the macropores of electrodes hence increasing feed concentration in mcdi would not reduce the charge efficiency as much as it would in classic cdi another advantage of the mcdi over the classic cdi is that mcdi could enhance the desalination performance under different operational strategies such as reversed voltage desorption rvd constant current adsorption cca and constant current desorption ccd rvd cleans up counter ions from electrodes more effectively in the mcdi than the classic cdi the ideal constant effluent concentrations of cca and ccd can only be achieved with iems in the mcdi the impact of cell architecture on different operational strategies is discussed in section 4 1 fouling could occur less extensively in mcdi kim et al 2010 chen et al 2018 mcdi effluent was reported to have lower ph fluctuation compared with that of classic cdi yu et al 2018 due to reduced faradaic processes the lower ph fluctuation could reduce the scaling risk under strong basic conditions furthermore the incorporation of iems provides moderate physical protection for electrodes from organic fouling as majority of the fouling layer was observed on the iem surfaces chen et al 2018 sem images of the electrodes of the mcdi and the classic cdi showed that less organic deposition was observed on electrodes from the mcdi setup compared with that from the classic cdi setup chen et al 2018 it is noteworthy that small molecular weight organics such as ha and alginate chen et al 2018 and multivalent ions kim et al 2018 are still able to penetrate through iems they could eventually deposit in the electrode pores and cause fouling to the electrodes of the mcdi which might require periodical chemical cleaning nonetheless mcdi shows lower fouling propensity compared with classic cdi due to the physical protection of electrodes by iems and less ph fluctuation the mcdi could achieve higher adsorption capacity enhanced energy efficiency more flexible operational modes and enhanced fouling resistance compared with the classic cdi which are essential for concentration of industrial brines however the static electrode design of the mcdi architecture has limited its total adsorption capacity in a single adsorption step and may not be sufficient for treating the high tds 10 000 ppm in industrial brines further research on optimization of the mcdi architecture with different operational strategies section 4 would be useful under such circumstances in addition comprehensive evaluation on the fouling severity and mechanism of mcdi could aid in developing fouling mitigation strategies the robustness and long term application of the mcdi for treating high fouling potential feed would still need to be demonstrated even though the mcdi is currently industrial scale ready atlantis technologies 2012 biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 suss et al 2015 3 3 flow electrode cdi fcdi classic cdi and mcdi are cyclical processes that require electrode regeneration once their electrodes are saturated their non continuous operation requires complicated control design and would lead to loss of product water during the step switch the concept of flow electrode cdi fcdi was proposed in 2013 to overcome this drawback jeon et al 2013 the conventional static electrodes are replaced by slurry based electrode which can be pumped through the electrode compartments in the fcdi cell the electrode compartment and flow channel are separated by iems desorption or regeneration of electrodes are conducted in a side stream system outside the fcdi cell in this way continuous desalination can be achieved as regenerated electrodes are constantly available in the desalination cell water recovery of fcdi could be increased due to the separation of desorption and adsorption processes desorption steps in static electrode cdis sacrifice part of the feed stream as concentrated stream to accommodate the desorbed ions however feed stream in the fcdi only undergoes continuous adsorption process as the desorption process is independent of the adsorption process in this way feed loss could be minimized in the fcdi water recoveries of up to 90 gendel et al 2014 rommerskirchen et al 2015 were reported using different regeneration schemes in the fcdi process another merit of fcdi is its dynamic total adsorption capacity the electrode density in the electrode compartment and the electrode contact area with the feed channel in the fcdi cell could be adjusted to facilitate desirable removal for high tds feed jeon et al 2013 ma et al 2018 yang et al 2017a common practices include the addition of more electrode particles in the electrode slurry yang et al 2017a widening and deepening the electrode flow path and adding more electrode flow paths in the electrode compartment jeon et al 2013 as such the fcdi could provide sufficient and dynamic salt adsorption sites yang et al 2017a to remove the high salt content in industrial brines close to complete salt removal was reported when the carbon content in the electrode was raised from 6 89 wt to 11 1 wt yang et al 2017a salt removal of 95 42 in treating a feed containing 35 000 ppm nacl was achieved by increasing the contact area over 20 times between the electrode compartment and the feed channel jeon et al 2013 to date the fcdi is still at lab scale stage which requires further development in terms of optimization on energy consumption for high tds feed 2000 ppm fang et al 2018 he et al 2018 ma et al 2018 long term continuous regeneration step he et al 2018 yang et al 2017a and assessment on its feasibility for large scale operation 125 ml min lee et al 2018 yang et al 2016 2017b mechanism severity and reversibility of fouling in the fcdi process have not been extensively studied therefore further research and development for the fcdi is required before it is pilot or full scale ready for implementation summary of the three cdi cell architectures and their feasibility of treating industrial brines is shown in table 3 4 operational strategies of cdi 4 1 adsorption and desorption modes operation modes for adsorption step in cdi process include constant current adsorption cca and constant voltage adsorption cva operation modes for desorption step on the other hand include zero voltage desorption zvd reverse current desorption rcd and reverse voltage desorption rvd han et al 2015 zhao et al 2012a 2012b the most conventional sequence to operate cdi process is cva zvd under cva the effluent salt concentration reaches a minimum in the beginning when salt removal is the fastest and slowly increases back to feed value as the removal rate slows down with increasing counter edl voltage porada et al 2013 zhao et al 2012a during zvd counter ions are desorbed from electrodes spontaneously under mutual repulsion until the salt concentration in macropores approaches that of bulk solution biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 porada et al 2013 desorption is the fastest at the beginning of zvd as concentration of counter ions in edls is at its maximum a short peak of salt concentration can thus be observed zhao et al 2012a desorption slows down as edls approach charge neutrality concentration of the concentrated stream slowly decays back to the feed value given sufficient desorption time effluent salt concentration profile with time under operational cycles of cva and zvd is shown in fig 3 a rvd has been demonstrated with faster desorption rate and more effective desorption than zvd for high tds concentrations in addition to spontaneous mutual repulsion desorption under rvd is partially driven by the reversed electric field as well which could accelerate the desorption rate biesheuvel et al 2011 porada et al 2013 desorption step and cycle time could thus be shortened moreover desorption is more effective under rvd than zvd desorption of counter ions is terminated when electrode is charge neutral under zvd while it continues until electrodes are fully depleted of counter ions under rvd as a result rvd could achieve more effective clean up of counter ions from electrodes so that electrodes could adsorb more counter ions during the next adsorption step porada et al 2013 a 20 increase in salt removal during the subsequent adsorption step was demonstrated by switching from zvd to rvd biesheuvel et al 2011 it is noteworthy that the clean up effect of counter ions under rvd is more significant in the mcdi than in the classic cdi co ions in the bulk solution are adsorbed into electrodes in the classic cdi when reversed voltage is applied for the desorption step these co ions would cause co ion expulsion in the next adsorption step and reduce salt removal and charge efficiency however the adsorption of co ions from the bulk solution is rejected by iems and thus co ion expulsion during the subsequent adsorption step is minimized in the mcdi besides the improvement on the adsorption capacity another merit for rvd operation might be the relaxation of fouling periodic reversal of polarity is applied in the edr process to reduce fouling severity the polarity reversal could stop further contaminant accumulation allison 1995 and even break up freshly precipitated scale before any irreversible damage could occur grebenyuk and grebenyuk 2002 valero and arbós 2010 similar relaxation of fouling could be achieved by rvd in the cdi process the reversed polarity in the cdi desorption step could serve the same purpose as periodic polarity reversal in the edr process to mitigate the impact of fouling however the effectiveness of rvd in mitigating fouling of cdi might be less significant compared with the reversed polarity in edr due to less flushing in cdi compartments of both concentrated and diluted streams in edr are continuously flushed with inlets which enhances the foulants removal this flushing effect is weakened for the electrodes in cdi processes as the tortuous water pathways inside the electrodes reduce the flow velocity significantly the flushing effect could even be negligible in mcdi as the electrodes are isolated from the feed stream by the iems little information is available on the effectiveness of rvd in fouling mitigation as majority of the cdi fouling study under rvd focused only on the fouling mechanism chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 rather than its anti fouling performance therefore there is a need to further investigate the anti fouling performance operated under zvd and rvd modes in summary rvd has the advantage over conventional zvd in handling industrial brines with high tds and high fouling potential however it requires external energy input further research on the cost effectiveness of rvd in salt removal and fouling relaxation would be needed to evaluate the practical feasibility of applying rvd for industrial brine treatment the major benefit of applying cca saleem et al 2016 zhao et al 2013c or rcd zhao et al 2012a 2013c is constant and tunable effluent concentration during cca the constant applied current is ideally translated to constant ionic current resulting in constant salt removal rate from the bulk solution and thus constant salt concentration in the effluent fig 3 b saleem et al 2016 zhao et al 2012a the voltage required to maintain the constant current would steadily increase due to the increasing counter edl voltage and lower electrolyte concentration zhao et al 2012a when the voltage reaches certain pre set thresholds such as 1 2 v 1 4 v and 1 6 v kang et al 2014 jande and kim 2013 zhao et al 2013c cca stops and desorption step takes place constant concentration at cca mode can only be achieved with iems incorporated in the cdi cell architecture practically the ionic current is carried by counter ions adsorption flux and co ion expulsion flux with the rejection of iems the co ion expulsion flux is minimized in mcdi thus the constant ionic current translates to constant counter ion adsorption flux solely in classic cdi without iems constant ionic current cannot fully translate into constant counter ion adsorption flux since both counter ions and co ions carry the ionic current as a result the effluent concentration could not level off to the desired constant low plateau quickly under constant current operation porada et al 2013 the constant and tunable effluent concentration from cca is advantageous for high tds removal from industrial brines due to the ease in quality control similar to cca rcd could produce ideal constant concentration for the concentrate stream only with the presence of iems it could also provide better clean up effect of electrodes during the desorption step and could relax the adsorbed fouling however the relaxation mechanisms leading to fouling mitigation in rcd would need further investigations hence adsorption and desorption modes could affect the performance of the cdi process the clean up effect from reversed polarity operations rvd rcd could lead to higher adsorption capacity for the next adsorption cycle which is in favor of the high tds removal for industrial brines reversed polarity operations could relieve the fouling formation in cdi as well which is beneficial in treating industrial brines with high fouling potential however effective fouling mitigation effect from reversed polarity operation has yet to be demonstrated comprehensively main benefit of constant current operations cca rcd is the constant effluent concentration which simplify the operational control especially when multi stage operation for high tds applications is involved section 4 2 it is noteworthy that rvd and rcd are not recommended for the classic cdi operation as optimum rvd and rcd could only be achieved with the presence of iems a summary of key features of the abovementioned operational modes is provided in table 4 4 2 long electrode multi stage cdi and brine recirculation the use of longer electrode in the cdi cell could provide more fresh electrode mass for the adsorption step this in turn could contribute to higher salt removal when static electrode architectures such as the classic cdi and the mcdi are applied for treating high tds feed though electrode mass could be increased by increasing electrode thickness the ion accessibility to the micropores embedded deeper in electrodes would be lower in thicker electrodes oren 2008 porada et al 2012 comparatively lengthening the electrode would be a more effective design to promote better contact between ions in the feed stream and adsorption sites in the electrodes along the flow path this method is used in the cdi cell from the atlantis technologies usa a 100 times 1 10 m longer than conventional electrode length was used that increased the feed tds limit to over 100 000 ppm atlantis technologies 2012 this tds limit is at least 25 times more than what the conventional cdi process could accommodate and would be useful for zld applications however extension of electrode length would require re engineering of the cdi modules namely spacer housing and power supply which might involve higher capital cost multi stage operation is another strategy for dealing with high tds applications without the need of re engineering the modules for static electrode architectures it refers to the process when feed stream passes through multiple cdi stages each stage removes a portion of salt from the feed until the target effluent tds concentration is attained this strategy allows the cdi to remove high tds from the feed as long as sufficient stages are provided another advantage of multi stage operation is high water recovery though the feed loss as concentrate stream at each single stage is inevitable it can be partially compensated in multi stage operation by returning the concentrate from sequential stages to the upstream stages the return mode enables concentrate streams to be diluted again by upstream stages and eventually produced as diluted product water in this way the volume of concentrate streams from multi stages is minimized and the overall water recovery increases long electrodes and multi stage operation would increase the electrode mass for adsorption as a result they could reduce the energy penalty from extra ion adsorption per adsorption site zhao et al 2012b 2013b however to our knowledge little information is available on the energy optimization of cdi at high tds concentrations 4000 ppm for these two strategies further researches on energy optimization of using these two strategies are needed to improve the cost effectiveness of the cdi process for high tds applications moreover the concentration of foulants in the final brine from these two strategies would rise with increased water recovery this would impose higher fouling risk in the later sections i e further downstream of the long electrode or in later stages of the multi stage cdi process further researches on the fouling potential of the two strategies are also needed for establishing feasible operating protocols brine recirculation could be applied to promote production of highly concentrated cdi brine for zld process brine recirculation in the cdi refers to the process that brine stream from previous desorption step is partially recirculated as brine streams for subsequent desorption steps concentration of the recirculated brine stream after multiple desorption steps could be significantly higher than that through single pass desorption continuous brine recirculation has been demonstrated for the mcdi hassanvand et al 2017 during this mode of operation the concentration ratio between recirculated brine and feed reached 2 while water recovery was increased over 40 desorption with higher brine concentration was demonstrated to be more energy efficient for the cdi it was reported garcía quismondo et al 2016 the overall energy efficiency increased from 66 to 79 82 when brine concentrations in the desorption step were increased from 0 05 m to 3 5 m using nacl solutions higher brine concentration has lower electrolyte resistance the lower electrolyte resistance allows higher desorption current density which is in favor of current efficiency in the desorption step garcía quismondo et al 2016 brine recirculation could potentially enhance the cost effectiveness of cdi process in generating highly concentrated brine for zld purpose at the current state brine recirculation has only been demonstrated at laboratory scale further efforts in operation optimization and scaling up are required moreover brine recirculation might increase the fouling potential of the recirculating brine as the concentration of foulants could build up as well the impact on the fouling propensity from brine recirculation under long term operation would need to be further evaluated 5 fouling control 5 1 pretreatment pretreatment refers to processes that remove fouling precursors prior to the cdi process this minimises fouling potential of the waste stream it has been reported that pretreatment method comprised of biological activated carbon bac and ultrafiltration uf can significantly prolong continuous operation of cdi in treating reverse osmosis concentrate roc generated from domestic wastewater reclamation process lee et al 2009b the operation time of the cdi process was doubled as the toc concentration was reduced by 39 9 from 24 6 ppm similar finding was reported by yu et al 2014 about 10 25 toc concentration reduction in the domestic roc stream from original toc concentration of 22 3 ppm using bac was able to extend the operational time by more than 14 times extensive pretreatment prior to the cdi process would be required for industrial brines due to their high toc concentration other pretreatment techniques may also be applied effectively to remove fouling precursor namely conventional chemical softening electro coagulation ec and nanofiltration nf biro and vončina 2016 semblante et al 2018 however the effectiveness of these pretreatment methods on industrial brine prior to cdi process would need to be extensively evaluated due to the presence of diverse types and nature of fouling precursors in the brine 5 2 antiscaling by antiscalants and monovalent ions antiscalant is a type of chemical agent that inhibits inorganic scale formation by altering one or more aspects of the crystallization process antony et al 2011 hasson et al 2011 it was originally designed for scale inhibition for boilers and is widely used in membrane processes like nf ro fritzmann et al 2007 and edr hanrahan et al 2016 myint et al 2013 it is important to note that antiscalant could pose two contradicting effects on cdi performance i e inhibition of inorganic scaling and fouling caused by antiscalant dosing antiscalant in the cdi process could reduce inorganic scaling severity however it could also cause fouling by itself such phenomena had been observed in the edr process it has been highlighted that antiscalants like polyacrylates and sodium hexametaphosphate could cause severe fouling on the iem surface of the edr allison 1995 the sodium hexametaphosphate fouling was apparent that rendered the edr performance to decline after 1 h of operation pretreatments of lime softening and media filtration were applied prior to the edr process to remove the sodium hexametaphosphate the operation duration was successfully extended to two months with sodium hexametaphosphate effectively removed by the pretreatments allison 1995 industrial brines may contain active antiscalant residue if antiscalant is used during the production of industrial brine from upstream processes such as nf and ro fritzmann et al 2007 there is significant merit to evaluate the impact of residual antiscalant in industrial brines to cdi process additional antiscalant dosing might be required in the cdi process if residual antiscalants in brines are not sufficient for effective control of inorganic scaling on the other hand pre removal of residual antiscalant prior to the cdi process might be needed if the residual antiscalants could cause significant fouling in summary impact of residual antiscalant selection of suitable antiscalant and optimized antiscalant in the cdi process would need to be determined for effective inorganic scaling control 5 3 antifouling modification of cdi materials antifouling modification of iem or electrode in the cdi cell have been studied to enhance fouling resistance enhancement of fouling resistance of iems is important as their surfaces are directly in contact with fouling precursors in the feed stream two major mechanisms of organic fouling to iems are identified as i electrostatic interaction between organic substance and membrane fixed charge and ii affinity interaction between the organic and membrane matrix mikhaylin and bazinet 2016 tanaka et al 2012 wang et al 2017 hence modification on the surface charge density and hydrophilic hydrophobic balance of iem surfaces could enhance the anti fouling performance mikhaylin and bazinet 2016 it was demonstrated that increasing negative charge density and hydrophilicity on surface of aem neosepta amx contributed to the improvement of antifouling performance to sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate sdbs mulyati et al 2012 the water contact angle was reduced by 5 and the zeta potential was reduced by 11 mv as a result the time for sdbs fouling to occur was extended by more than 4 times mulyati et al 2012 similar anti fouling modifications were also demonstrated by other studies tanaka et al 2011 vaselbehagh et al 2014 however most of these anti fouling modifications on iems were examined for edr rather than cdi applications an understanding on the effectiveness of these anti fouling modification for the cdi process is important as it could facilitate mitigation of fouling problem further research on effectiveness durability and cost of anti fouling modifications on iems in the cdi process would need to be investigated for the treatment of industrial brines anti fouling property for electrodes of the cdi is important as well since electrodes could still be fouled by small molecular weight organics section 3 2 several anti fouling modifications on cdi electrodes have been reported it has been demonstrated zhang et al 2018b that a porous carbon electrode modified by zwitterionic polymers was able to maintain its original adsorption capacity even after 100 cycles of operation with 100 ppm of bsa while the adsorption capacity of unmodified electrodes was reduced by half results from field emission sem showed no significant bsa deposition on the modified electrode compared with the unmodified bsa fouled electrode another modification using tio2 reduced graphene oxide rgo evaluated by zhang and his co workers zhang and jia 2015 exhibited photocatalytic ability of removing ha under visible light the photocatalytic oxidation of ha due to the incorporation of tio2 rgo could relieve organic fouling by nearly 40 in 4 h though it was reported that antifouling modification could improve the fouling resistance of electrodes the antifouling performance in treating actual industrial brines under long term operation would need to be further investigated due to the complexity and high concentration of foulants 5 4 chemical cleaning periodic chemical cleaning is commonly used to complement the fouling control regime in desalination processes including the cdi process it could aid fouling removal and could recover the desalination performance common chemical agents used for cleaning are hcl citric acid naoh edta etc garcia vasquez et al 2016 guo et al 2015 peng et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 acidic cleaning mainly removes hydroxide and carbonate scaling while alkaline cleaning targets organic fouling mossad and zou 2013 wang et al 2018 the fundamental study on inorganic scaling and organic fouling of the cdi performed by mossad et al 2013 showed acid cleaning provided 83 9 of total ferric scalant removal while alkaline cleaning accounted for 84 of total organic foulant removal in another report removal of organic fouling in the cdi caused by protein and humic acid during domestic wastewater treatment was also shown to be 10 times more effective with alkaline cleaning 0 01 m of naoh compared with acid cleaning 0 01 m hcl wang et al 2015 a similar conclusion was drawn when 2 citric acid used for clean in place cip in the cdi process was found ineffective in removing organic fouling yu et al 2014 as most wastewater contains multivalent ions and organic foulants both acidic and alkaline cleanings would be required to achieve optimum cleaning effects for instance cleaning strategy using citric acid and naoh was successful in recovering tds removal efficiency in the cdi module zhang et al 2013 calcium magnesium and ferric scalants were initially removed by 0 01m citric acid followed by 0 01m naoh solution to remove the organic foulants tds removal efficiency regained the original level after the two step cleaning zhang et al 2013 acid and alkaline cleaning are less pronounced for gypsum scaling removal due to the ph insensitivity of gypsum solubility cleaning methods for gypsum scale removal such as deionized water flush asraf snir et al 2016 mi and elimelech 2010 and edta cikes et al 1990 peng et al 2015 rinse have been demonstrated in edr md fo and ro applications occurrence of gypsum scaling was reported for a lab scale cdi system treating synthetic caso4 solutions up to 600 ppm lado et al 2015 however the abovementioned control methods for gypsum scaling are yet to be demonstrated in the cdi process gypsum scaling would be a significant concern for the cdi process especially in the treatment of industrial brine containing high concentrations of ca2 and so4 2 hence understanding the mechanism and control of gypsum scaling in cdi applications would be essential to promote a feasible cdi process for industrial brine treatment the complexity of industrial brine characteristics may require multi level fouling mitigation strategies covering pretreatment antifouling modification on cdi materials use of antiscalant and chemical cleaning optimization of these multi level fouling mitigation strategies could enhance the cost effectiveness of the cdi process for its long term industrial brine treatment this would require further research to establish the integrated fouling mitigation protocol for the cdi process 6 conclusion high tds concentration and high fouling potential are the two major challenges in applying the cdi process to concentrate industrial brines for zld purpose cell architecture operational strategies and fouling controls for the cdi process are reviewed to address these challenges and to establish optimization strategies a summary of the findings from this review is shown in fig 4 in general cell architectures could affect salt removal charge efficiency and fouling resistance of the cdi process salt removal and charge efficiency are higher in the mcdi compared with the classic cdi due to the incorporation of iems continuous desalination high feed tds up to seawater level and high water recovery up to 90 have been demonstrated for the fcdi further research with large scale and long term operation would be needed to access the feasibility of using these cell architectures for industrial brine treatment operational strategies including rvd multi stage operation and brine recirculation are potential means to enhance the feasibility of using the cdi process in zld systems rvd not only enhances the salt removal but also has potential to mitigate fouling multi stage operation could increase salt removal and water recovery for static electrode architectures brine recirculation is able to promote the production of highly concentrated brine from the cdi process and increase the overall water recovery on the other hand increased water recovery and higher brine concentration from these operational strategies may increase energy consumption and the risk of fouling in the cdi process further research on integration and optimization of these operational strategies is needed for developing effective operational protocols for the cdi process to concentrate industrial brines the risk of fouling brought by industrial brine could be minimized through fouling control methods as well i e pretreatment addition of antiscalant antifouling modification and chemical cleaning removal of foulants by pretreatment is able to reduce the fouling severity and prolong intervals between chemical cleanings pretreatment could be a cost effective way to prevent persistent fouling such as heavy metal scaling which is difficult to be removed by chemical cleaning addition of antiscalant and antifouling modification could increase the fouling resistance so that the cdi could treat feed with challenging organic concentrations more research with real wastewater and long term operation would be needed to further evaluate the cost effectiveness of antiscalant and antifouling modification in the cdi process chemical cleaning is effective in removal of foulants using chemical agents such as hcl citric acid naoh and edta which could serve as the last strategy to recover the performance of cdi from fouling it could be more effective and efficient to apply integrated fouling control methods than individual method when cdi process is applied for treatment of industrial brines with high fouling potential declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

17731,chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons cahs have been frequently detected in aquifers in recent years owing to the bioaccumulation and toxicity of cahs it is essential to explore high efficiency technologies for their complete dechlorination in groundwater at present the most widely used abiotic and biotic remediation technologies are based on zero valent iron zvi and functional anaerobic bacteria fab respectively however the main obstacles to the full potential of both technologies in the field include their lowered efficiencies and increased economic costs due to the co existence of a variety of natural electron acceptors in the environment such as dissolved oxygen do nitrate no3 sulfate so4 2 ferric iron fe iii bicarbonate hco3 and even water which compete for electrons with the target contaminants therefore a clear understanding of the mechanisms governing electron competition and electron selectivity is significant for the accurate evaluation of the effectiveness of both technologies under natural hydrochemical conditions we collected data from both abiotic and biotic cah remediation systems summarized the dechlorination and undesired reactions in groundwater discussed the characterization methods and general principles of electron competition and described strategies to improve electron selectivity in both systems furthermore we reviewed the emerging zvi fab coupled system which integrates abiotic and biotic processes to enhance dechlorination performance and electron utilization efficiency lastly we propose future research needs to quantitatively understand the electron competition in abiotic biotic and coupled systems in more detail and to promote improved electron selectivity in groundwater remediation graphical abstract image 1 keywords zero valent iron functional anaerobic bacteria groundwater remediation chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons electron competition electron selectivity 1 introduction chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons cahs such as dichloroethane dca trichloroethane tca perchloroethene pce and trichloroethylene tce have been commonly used as degreasing agents and in industrial cleaning solutions rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 su et al 2013 and have frequently been detected in groundwater due to accidental spills and former improper disposal practices dong et al 2018 approximately 42 of the superfund sites in the united states suffered from groundwater tce contamination huang et al 2019 cahs can pose serious health risks to the public and ecosystems due to their bioaccumulation and toxicity niño de guzmán et al 2018 shih et al 2019 zhou et al 2016 therefore it is essential to explore high efficiency technologies for the complete dechlorination of cahs in groundwater xie et al 2017 for nearly half a century continuous efforts have been directed towards enhancing the reductive dechlorination of cahs via abiotic and biotic reactions one of the most widely employed materials for abiotic treatments is zero valent iron zvi li et al 2019 lin et al 2018 planer friedrich et al 2018 wei et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 owing to its strong reduction ability e0 0 44 v and nontoxic iron oxides products zhao et al 2016 in addition bioremediation through natural attenuation or engineered system is recognized as another promising method for in situ underground remediation lien et al 2016 during the bioremediation the functional anaerobic bacteria fab living in the underground aquifers can accept electron donors such as hydrogen h2 or organic substrates and reduce cahs through anaerobic reduction majone et al 2015 mayer blackwell et al 2017 more recently the neoteric approach of zvi coupled with anaerobic bioremediation zvi fab coupled system has been extensively studied h2 is used as a link between abiotic and biotic systems fig 1 which connects the h2 donor zvi and the h2 acceptor hydrogen autotrophic microorganisms partially possessing dechlorination function dong et al 2019 rosenthal et al 2004 xiu et al 2010b this strategy can enhance the utilization of zvi save the dosage of zvi and effectively alleviate the problem of gas clogging which is of great significance in improving the efficiency of the in situ remediation of cahs rosenthal et al 2004 wang et al 2016 xiu et al 2010b compared with laboratory batch experiments the application of these technologies in field scales is more challenging largely due the complexity of reactions in groundwater johnson et al 2013 kocur et al 2015 the complexity is mainly caused by the intrinsic competition for electron donors driven by a variety of natural reductant demands nrds i e co existing electron acceptors such as dissolved oxygen do nitrate no3 sulfate so4 2 ferric iron fe iii bicarbonate hco3 and even water shi et al 2015 yin et al 2012b with the electrons distributed simultaneously towards different electron acceptors the electron selectivity towards the target contaminants would be negatively affected therefore a better understanding of these observations is necessary to evaluate the long term performance and economic benefit of these technologies under natural environmental conditions previously many investigations have qualitatively evaluated the impact of electron competition on the performance of zvi or fab systems lai et al 2019 lu et al 2017 paul et al 2016 however until very recently only a limited amount of quantitative data describing electron selectivity was available although the competitive effects of the co existing electron acceptors were generally accepted it has not been elucidated how the types and quantities of them affect the extent of competition cheng et al 2019 liu et al 2007 some strategies such as the sulfidation of zvi and the biostimulation have been proposed to enhance electron selectivity in abiotic and biotic systems respectively he et al 2018 lately the emerging zvi fab coupled system has also been considered as an improvement of the single system in terms of reducing the electron competition you et al 2017 in recent decades heightened attention has been paid to in situ groundwater dechlorination technologies and numerous relevant critical reviews have been published encompassing the working mechanisms and the factors influencing the removal kinetics of these technologies dong et al 2019 fu et al 2014 sun et al 2016 thomas and bruton 2015 to our knowledge however there has been no overarching review that evaluates electron selectivity which has big implications for characterizing and promoting the dechlorination efficiency under field conditions thus our review provides a comprehensive summary of the research on electron competition and electron selectivity in abiotic biotic and coupled remediation systems with a focus on their characterization methods governing mechanisms and enhancement strategies besides future research directions that will promote a better understanding of the electron competition from nrds during in situ remediation processes are suggested it is hoped that the present review will guide in evaluating and improving the effectiveness of in situ groundwater remediation technologies 2 zvi system 2 1 dechlorination and undesired reactions in zvi based remediation system enhanced abiotic dechlorination through constructing permeable reactive barriers prbs or direct injection of fine zvi particles into groundwater is an effective in situ remediation strategy prbs are usually used to capture the contamination plume and protect the vulnerable targets while direct injection is more prone to be applied near the contamination source zone with high pollution loads zvis of different particle sizes are favored by different technologies for example conventional granular zvi is typically applied in prb systems while nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi and microscale scale zero valent iron mzvi are preferentially adopted for injections although several experiments have shown that zvi in situ remediation was successful in remediating groundwater pollution its potential has not yet been fully realized in zvi based processes the main pathway by which zvi degrades contaminants is direct electron transfer more specifically the former releases two or three electrons and is converted into fe ii or fe iii while the latter receives these electrons and gets reduced liu et al 2013 however undesired reactions between zvi and nrds occur simultaneously and divert the direction of the electron transfer table 1 fig 2 resulting in electron waste and additional chemical consumption to achieve high degradation efficiency of target contaminants excess zvi material is used to compensate for the waste of electrons which inevitably increases the economic cost accordingly quantifying the degree of electron utilization provides a foundation for improving economic efficiency and minimizing the zvi dose required by this approach 2 2 methods for the characterization of electron competition and electron selectivity in early studies researchers focused only on the reaction kinetics e g dechlorination rate and dechlorination efficiency in single solute systems to evaluate the efficacy of remediation systems chen et al 2001 liu and lowry 2006 without considering the potential effects from co existing electron acceptors as the research progressed people gradually became aware of the issue and began to determine the effect of co existing electron acceptors on the removal of target substances qualitatively by comparing the reaction rate constants k and or the half lives of target substances in the presence and absence of co existing electron acceptors farrell et al 2000 liu et al 2007 2013 yin et al 2012b to evaluate the effectiveness of the technique more accurately and comprehensively it is necessary to characterize the effect of co existing electron acceptors on the remediation performance quantitatively to this end the concepts described in the following subsections have been proposed 2 2 1 particle efficiency pe the particle efficiency pe is defined as the ratio of the amount of zvi participating in the reduction of target contaminants to the total amount of zvi initially added into the system liu et al 2005 and can be calculated as follows 1 p e m 0 m f n m n 0 100 where m0 represents the moles of target contaminants before the reaction mf represents the final moles of residual target contaminant at a given time m represents the number of electrons released by 1 mol of fe0 n0 represents the moles of fe0 initially added to the system and n represents the number of electrons needed for the reduction of 1 mol of target contaminant into final product for mixed products the value of n can be obtained as follows 2 n i n i p i where ni represents the coefficient of each reaction and pi represents the fraction of each product at a given reaction time intuitively the pe can reflect the ratio of total iron consumption liu et al 2005 proved that the pe of iron particles with different properties fe b and reactive nanoscale iron particles rnip ranged between 52 and 92 under iron limited conditions primarily because different oxide shell compositions result in different amounts of accessible fe0 2 2 2 specific removal capacity src the specific removal capacity src is defined as the ratio of the amount of removed target contaminant to the amount of consumed fe0 and is calculated as follows fan et al 2019 3 s r c n t n f e 0 n f e 0 100 where n fe0 is the molar quantity of fe0 before reaction and nfe0 and nt are the molar quantities of fe0 and target contaminant degraded in the system after the reaction respectively fan et al 2019 found that the src varied from 20 7 to 46 under different zvi systems zvi fe2 zvi h2o2 s zvi and zvi weak magnetic field wmf which is mainly attributed to the difference in the amounts of fe0 available in the iron particles 2 2 3 electron efficiency ee to characterize the partitioning of electron donors between the target contaminant and the nrds the new concept of electron efficiency ee has been proposed fan et al 2019 liu et al 2013 ee can be expressed as 4 e e n e n t 100 where ne is the number of electrons scavenged for target contaminant reduction and nt is the number of consumed electrons at a given reaction time the value of ne is determined by the concentration and relative proportion of the final reduced product of the target contaminant the value of nt can be obtained by analyzing the exact total amount of consumed iron or quantitatively identifying all the final products based on this concept schöftner et al 2015 obtained ee values as low as 3 1 1 4 in the tce reduction with nzvi independent of the tested conditions berge and ramsburg 2010 estimated the ee for tce dechlorination to be between 0 9 and 48 with different tce contents such low ee values indicate that a large number of electrons released by zvi in groundwaters are not involved in the degradation of target contaminants in practice zvis is used at multiple points that cover both the high pollution load area near the pollution source and the low pollution load area downstream from the source zone and the resulting different ee values could provide us useful information to determine whether this technology is economically feasible for specific conditions xin et al 2020 calculated the ee of mzvi under high pollution load and low pollution load conditions respectively in the system where water reduction as the sole side reaction under the high pollution load conditions the ee values were 55 02 63 70 while more electrons were used for water reduction under the low pollution load conditions yielding an ee of only 6 03 10 75 these results give us implications that a higher ee value usually corresponds to a higher pollution load and achieving a reasonable zvi target pollutant ratio is crucial to increasing the ee particularly for locations downstream of the source zone that have relatively lower pollution loads in summary all the three parameters pe src and ee discussed above could be used to represent the utilization efficiency of applied reactive materials for target contaminants however their distinct implications should be concerned both pe and src reflect the zvi utilization efficiency without providing information about the electron flow towards different electron acceptors compared with pe src more accurately represents the utilization efficiency of consumed zvi rather than the total applied zvi if the zvi is fully consumed then pe is equal to src to quantitatively characterize the partitioning of electron donors between the target contaminant and the nrd the determination of ee has been a better option 2 3 general principles of electron competition between cahs and co existing electron acceptors the three quantitative parameters described above might be reported with different values in different studies to provide a theoretical basis for comparison interpretation of the general principles how the electron competition between cahs and co existing electron acceptors occurs is a prerequisite in abiotic systems the ability of the electron acceptors to compete for reducing electrons depends on their thermodynamic properties particularly their oxidative strength which is determined by the standard electrode potential sep in other words the higher is the electrode potential the stronger is the ability of the electron acceptor to compete for electrons for example because the sep of para chloronitrobenzene p cnb para chloroaniline p can 0 5 1 5 v is much higher than that of no3 no2 0 01 v the ability of co existing no3 to compete with p cnb for electrons was much lower in the zvi system le et al 2011 however this order of priority is not absolute and the competitiveness should also be understood from the kinetic perspective by considering the effects of the electron acceptor concentrations and external environmental conditions for example when tce and no3 coexist in a zvi system no3 reacts more readily with zvi which is attributed not only to the higher electrode potential of no3 but also to their ability to compete for adsorption sites on the zvi surface wherein the water soluble no3 is easier to be adsorbed on hydrophilic zvi surface than greasy tce in the zvi system with co existing no3 the target contaminant nitrobenzene nb remained as the prior electron acceptor which is attributed to the strong attraction of nitro groups to electrons razo flores et al 1999 yin et al 2012b nevertheless information on how the thermodynamic and kinetic properties may collaboratively affect the electron competitiveness of different electron acceptors is very scarce in addition from the technical application point of view how to evaluate the electron flow in natural systems with complex hydrochemical characteristics has become the future research hotspot 2 4 effects of different co existing electron acceptors on electron selectivity groundwater components such do no3 and h2o all compete for electrons with cahs dechlorination altering the electron selectivity of zvis to different extents and through variable pathways therefore we have summarized the effects of these co existing electron acceptors on electron selectivity respectively further below 2 4 1 do do as a potent active oxidant and electron acceptor in shallow aquifers has significant effects on zvi passivation electron distribution and effective contaminant degradation shimizu et al 2012 when iron is immersed in an aqueous solution its oxidation corrosion mechanism can be described by eq 5 below only when the o2 remaining in water is exhausted by iron corrosion eqs 5 and 6 can anaerobic iron oxidation occur eq 7 5 2fe 2h2o o2 2fe2 4oh 6 4fe2 o2 4h 4fe3 2h2o 7 fe 2h2o fe2 h2 2oh it has been proved that the presence of do can inhibit the degradation of pollutants that are reduced by electrons released by iron potential mechanisms for the negative effects of do on the effective degradation of target contaminants include the 1 competition for electrons and 2 the formation of a passivating oxide layer containing low conductivity maghemite γ fe2o3 with barrier effects on reaction sites reinsch et al 2010 xie and cwiertny 2010 yin et al 2012b for example nb removal was observed to be reduced by 17 1 in a do containing zvi system owing to electron competition and oxide layer formation yin et al 2012b although do is generally considered to have inhibition effects it has also been shown to promote the removal of pollutants qin et al 2016 2017 wang et al 2010 the major possible reason for the promotion is that increasing the do concentration enhances iron corrosion and results in more passivation products which facilitate the target contaminant removal by adsorption and co precipitation for example qin et al 2017 found that the introduction of do significantly enhanced the conversion of fe0 to iron hydr oxides accompanied by increased adsorption and subsequent reduction of se vi on the surface of zvi particles however as the enhanced removal by adsorption and co precipitation due to surface passivation is only a short term effect the trade off between the beneficial side and negative side of surface passivation should be well evaluated in future research 2 4 2 no3 in recent years processes such as intensive agriculture e g excessive use of fertilizers and animal manure and urbanization have led to the contamination of the vadose zone groundwater system with nitrogen resulting in increasing no3 level in groundwater xin et al 2019 owing to its strong oxidizing properties no3 is highly reactive with zvi reinsch et al 2010 xie and cwiertny 2012 and has a significant influence on the electron selectivity of zvi the destructive effect of no3 on the degradation of target contaminants with zvi has been frequently reported as a strong reactant it exhibits the competitive advantage over the target contaminant for reaction sites and electrons farrell et al 2000 kaifas et al 2014 however under certain circumstances no3 could also accelerate the iron corrosion and cause a higher release of electrons shi et al 2015 it has been shown that a higher degradation efficiency of target contaminants with zvi can be obtained at low no3 concentrations because the corrosion enhancement role of nitrate surpassed its electron competing role liu et al 2007 yin et al 2012b however as the nitrate concentration increases above a certain level its electron competing role dominates inhibiting cahs removal for example farrell et al 2000 found that in an anaerobic system where tce and no3 coexisted approximately 20 of the no3 was removed in the first three days of the reaction and the dechlorination products of tce were not detected in the effluent which demonstrated that no3 is more competitive than tce for electrons in addition no3 affects the passivation of the oxide film on the iron surface a high concentration of no3 may stabilize the original passivation film e g hematite lu et al 2017 ritter et al 2003 or form a new passivating iron oxide layer e g feooh or a nonporous maghemite mishra and farrell 2005 schlicker et al 2000 on the surface of zvi by increasing the ph and redox potential of the system which hinders the electron transfer 2 4 3 h2o the reaction of fe0 with h2o which generates h2 and iron oxide eq 8 qin et al 2018 is among the most fundamental processes that compete for electrons in aqueous solutions containing zvi 8 3fe0 4h2o fe3o4 4h2 according to the above reaction a large amount of h2 is produced and ferrous metals are corroded which will result in a series of negative effects above all the reduction of h2o consumes the electrons released from zvi that would otherwise participate in the degradation of target contaminants this competition is the major factor that limits the ee of or selectivity for the contaminant reduction by zvi fan et al 2016b liu et al 2013 xin et al 2018 utilized a column filled with a mixture of sand mzvi 5 wfe wsand to simulate the in situ reactive zone and reached an ee range of 41 63 50 60 and 25 40 toward tce degradation in milli q water fresh groundwater and saline groundwater respectively schöftner et al 2015 performed a batch experiment with nzvi 2 5 g l 1 and tce 35 mg l 1 in the absence of any other oxide the results showed that only 3 1 1 4 of the electrons were used for tce dehalogenation leaving a much higher fraction of electrons distributed to h2o it can be seen that the competition of h2o for electrons is significant to be noticed if the reaction between water and zvi leads to the accumulation of excessive gaseous h2 in the pore space the groundwater flow will be obstructed restraining the contact between zvi and contamination plume and triggering system failure ruhl and jekel 2014 tang et al 2017 lastly the negative effect on electron transfer due to the increased passivation products on the fe0 surface caused by zvi h2o interaction should not be overlooked 2 5 strategies for improving electron selectivity given the limitations of low ee systems a variety of promising strategies have been proposed to enhance the selectivity of zvi 2 5 1 sulfidation the sulfidation of zvi i e s zvi which involves a modification of zvi particles by reducing sulfur compounds li et al 2017 qin et al 2018 xu et al 2016 has been shown to be effective in enhancing the electron selectivity of zvi toward target contaminants over h2o in anaerobic environments gu et al 2017 he et al 2018 li et al 2016 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 firstly reported that sulfidation can selectively increase the electron transfer to tce and inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction of zvi with h2o the potential mechanisms involved in the sulfidation of zvi can be divided into two types 1 the fes layer on s zvi is more hydrophobic than the hydro oxide layer on unmodified zvi therefore compared with water or water soluble ions hydrophobic organic contaminants such as tce are more easily enriched on the surface of s zvi cao et al 2017a han et al 2019 park et al 2006 which facilitates the transfer of electrons to the adjacent organic pollutants for instance fan et al 2016a suggested that when the molar ratio of s to fe was above 0 3 the reaction of s zvi with h2o was mostly eliminated while the reaction with tce maintained high activity 2 sulfur in s zvi is a potent deactivator of hydrogen recombination reactions han and yan 2016 kim et al 2011a in an anaerobic water environment the fundamental step of hydrogen recombination on the zvi surface represents the process of electron transfer to protons resulting in the adsorption of hydrogen atoms on the iron surface to recombine and produce molecular hydrogen that bubbles off the iron surface han and yan 2016 therefore the sulfur in s zvi would significantly improve the hydrodechlorination of cahs by inhibiting the competing electron transfer process of hydrogen recombination nevertheless the underlying mechanism of sulfur s disruptive effect on hydrogen recombination needs further exploration in addition it should be noted that the different sulfidation methods may affect the sulfur distribution and concentration in the produced s zvi han and yan 2016 kim et al 2011a 2014 and possibly result in improved ee to variable extents for example xu et al 2019 synthesized two s zvis with s fe ratios of 5 4 0 5 mol and 0 8 0 1 mol respectively by one step method and two step method compared with bare zvi the ee increased from 2 9 0 4 to 72 1 1 6 and 56 0 0 8 respectively which was attributed to that different sulfidation methods lead to different surface chemistry 2 5 2 other methods in addition to sulfidation other strategies to improve the electron selectivity of zvi have been proposed such as the application of wmf fan et al 2019 the addition of a secondary metal he et al 2018 and fe2 dosing fan et al 2019 qin et al 2017 recent studies have shown that the application of wmf can inhibit the production of h2 and increase the utilization of electrons by the target contaminants kim et al 2011b found that the degradation efficiency of 4 chlorophenol at an initial concentration of 100 mg l 1 increased from 22 5 without wmf to 51 under wmf and the production of h2 decreased by 59 29 accordingly he et al 2018 proved that bimetallic reductants prepared by the deposition of a second transition metal on the iron surface are effective in improving electron selectivity in the degradation of excess tce they increased the ee from 2 with bare zvi to 100 and 72 with fe pd and fe ni respectively qin et al 2017 demonstrated that the application of 1 0 mm fe2 increased the electron selectivity of zvi towards se vi from 3 2 3 6 to 6 2 6 8 and enhanced the se vi removal capacity by 100 180 although the limited quantitative data reflect the potential of these measures to improve electron selectivity the mechanisms by which these strategies to improve electron selectivity have not been comprehensively examined therefore more experimental evidence and in depth research are needed to further confirm their feasibility and reveal the mechanisms underlying their effects in addition the disadvantage such as a quick passivation for the bi metallic system should be considered because its catalytic effect soon disappears as passivation occurs han et al 2018 he et al 2010 yan et al 2010 3 functional anaerobic bacteria fab system 3 1 dechlorination and undesired reactions in fab based remediation system in an anaerobic groundwater environment microbial reductive dechlorination processes can convert cahs into final products with low chlorine content nijenhuis and kuntze 2016 xie et al 2017 zanaroli et al 2015 the target contaminants serve as electron acceptors in the process of energy metabolism chen et al 2018 electron donors are required to participate in the reaction and molecular h2 is recognized as a good candidate to meet this demand however h2 is a relatively inexpensive electron donor that is universally available for microbial reduction of oxidized compounds so4 2 no3 fe iii and hco3 can coexist with cahs and bacteria that reduce them can compete with the cah reducing bacteria for example dechloromonas and desulfitobacterium sp strain y 51 are well known for respiring chlorinated compounds but they also can respire no3 and so4 2 lai et al 2019 the iron reducing bacteria which initiated fe iii reduction process was evidenced as capable of stimulating dechlorination chen et al 2016 therefore to qualitatively and quantitatively understand all the desired and undesired microbial processes is essential for effective biotic dechlorination application 3 2 methods for the characterization of electron competition and electron selectivity 3 2 1 electron recovery the electron recovery er was calculated as the ratio of the total electrons consumed by electron acceptor degradation to the total electrons donated from the electron donors chen et al 2018 9 e r n a n d where nd and na represent the electron equivalents provided by the electron donor and those consumed by the electron acceptor reduction respectively specific parameters are summarized in table 2 nd can be calculated via multiplying the concentration of the consumed electron donor mm by the number of electrons released from the complete oxidation of electron donors per mole na can be calculated via multiplying the concentration of products mm by the number of electrons consumed in the generation of the product per mole in a microbial system with multiple electron acceptors including cah as the target contaminant taking tce as an example the er can be expressed as eq 10 10 e r e r t c e e r o t h e r s 11 e r t c e 2 d c e 4 v c 6 e t h e n e n d 100 where ertce and erothers denote the percentage of utilization of electron equivalents by tce and other competitive undesired reactions respectively ertce was estimated as the quotient of the theoretical electron equivalents required for the formation of tce reduction products and nd eq 11 however under most cases the value of er does not equal 100 aulenta et al 2007 azizian et al 2010 for instance in a study by aulenta et al 2007 when lactate h2 acetate and butyrate were used as electron donors the er was 76 66 and 62 respectively some of the missing equivalents were suspected to be channeled to the synthesis of biomass which is neglected in the balance construction aulenta et al 2007 berggren et al 2013 therefore the parameters ertce and erothers are adequate to reflect the electron distribution among different electron acceptors but to maintain the integrity of electron utilization calculations the electron equivalents used for biosynthesis must be inclusively considered 3 2 2 electron balance analysis the analysis of the electron balance addresses the missing electrons in the er calculation when microorganisms use electron donors for metabolism a portion of their electrons are initially transferred to the electron acceptors and the remaining electrons fs 0 are used for biomass synthesis rittmann and mccarty 2001 fig 3 the sum of the er and fs 0 is 100 the fs 0 is a function of the mass unit y rittmann and mccarty 2001 12 f s 0 y n e e e q m o l c e l l s 8 g c o d e e q d o n o r m c g c e l l s m o l c e l l s where ne is the number of electron equivalents in an empirical mole of cells mc is the empirical formula weight of cells and the donor mass is expressed as chemical oxygen demand cod the electron balance analysis can not only reflect the electron distribution in a microbial system comprehensively wen et al 2017 but also can help to calculate the relative abundance of each microorganism group using the cell volumes lee et al 2009 parameswaran et al 2009 ziv el et al 2012 while various studies have already used this method to identify key microorganisms the sparse applications in biotic dechlorination systems have provided limited information to estimate the electron distribution and microbial community structure based on electron balances in the fab system 3 3 general principles of electron competition between cahs and co existing electron acceptors in comparison with the zvi system where zvi is the only shared electron donor for various oxides in the fab system the choice of electron acceptors for electron donors may be specific or diverse h2 and or short chain fatty acids due to the physiological characteristics of the mediating microorganism therefore the electron flow characteristics discussed above are attributed to more complex governing electron competition principles a number of studies have shown that respiratory processes in microbial systems such as methanogenesis and dehalogenation can be maintained by various electron donors of which h2 is recognized as a key electron donor for accelerating reductive dechlorination processes heimann et al 2010 maymo gatell et al 1995 while organic electron donors play a major role in stimulating h2 production through fermentation fennell et al 1997 the competition for h2 between dehalogenators and other functional anaerobes is ubiquitous previous studies chapelle et al 1996 chapelle and lovley 1992 lu et al 2001 luijten et al 2004 recorded the competition among various h2 consuming microbes systematically in natural groundwater systems and found that the optimal hydrogen concentration for different terminal electron accepting processes teaps was different table 3 when hydrogen consuming microorganism such as dehalogenators or sulfate reducing bacteria cannot obtain the minimum gibbs free energy needed to maintain the critical cell activity the consumption of h2 will cease at this time the concentration of h2 in the environment is defined as the h2 threshold karadagli et al 2019 therefore the ability of electron acceptors to compete for electrons is affected by the concentration of h2 in mixed bacteria when the h2 concentration is within the h2 threshold range of a certain teap this teap would display strong electron competitiveness heimann et al 2005 yang and mccarty 1998 for instance yang and mccarty 1998 examined the competition between dehalogenators and other microorganisms and found that the dehalogenators had a higher affinity for electrons than methanogens and homoacetogens when the h2 level was maintained between 2 and 11 nm in addition because most of the degradation of cahs is completed in steps the hydrogen thresholds of different degradation stages may be different indicating that the electron competition from other teaps is different in different stages of dechlorination he et al 2002 lu et al 2001 yang and mccarty 1998 in addition to direct h2 replenishment multiple organic compounds have been applied as the main precursors for fermentative h2 production in fab systems heimann et al 2007 maymo gatell et al 1995 fast fermenting substrates such as formate lactate and alcohols methanol and ethanol and slow fermenting substrates such as propionate butyrate and benzoate have been used as indirect electron donors in experiments for biodechlorination paul et al 2013 azizian et al 2010 fennell et al 1997 mayer blackwell et al 2017 the fermentation rate of an organic matrix directly affects the h2 concentration in the system and the subsequent electron competition between teaps for example heimann et al 2007 used the fast fermenting lactate and the slow fermenting propionate respectively as h2 releasing substrates for mixed dehalococcoides containing cultures to degrade tce the results showed that the lactate fed fab system created high h2 concentrations and thereby a strong methanogenesis reaction accompanied the dechlorination reaction conversely slow h2 release rates resulting from the fermentation of propionate made it possible to avoid competition caused by excessive methane production no3 so4 2 fe3 and hco3 can co exist with cahs and bacteria that reduce them can compete with dechlorination bacteria lai et al 2019 table 4 therefore the concentration of these electron acceptors yan et al 2006 and functional bacterial community structure cheng et al 2019 are closely related to their ability to compete for electrons for instance when 100 mg l 1 and 1000 mg l 1 hco3 was added to the system yan et al 2006 observed the most and least extensive dechlorination respectively el mamouni et al 2002 reported an insignificant effect of 10 mm so4 2 on the tce dechlorination by indigenous microorganisms whereas higher so4 2 concentrations 15 and 20 mm slowed down the dechlorination the microbial community structure is critical to the distribution of electrons within the system the competition between teaps for electrons can also be regarded as the competition for electron donors between dechlorination bacteria and other functional anaerobes thus environmental conditions that favor the growth of dehalogenators over their competitors might enhance the ability of anaerobic reductive dehalogenation to compete for electrons smatlak et al 1996 yang and mccarty 2000 ziv el et al 2012 for instance yang and mccarty 2000 proved that the utilization efficiency of h2 in dechlorination increased from 10 to 67 by inhibiting the processes of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis 3 4 effects of different co existing electron acceptors on electron selectivity after grasping the potential mechanism of electron competition in the fab system the influence of different co existing electron acceptors on electron selectivity are deeply analyzed in the following subsections 3 4 1 so4 2 so4 2 is ubiquitous in groundwater and is frequently reported as a soluble anion co existing with cahs at wide ranging concentrations 0 2 30 mm miao et al 2012 pérez de mora et al 2014 zanaroli et al 2015 exploring the role of sulfate in the dechlorination of cahs is important primarily owing to the similarity of the h2 thresholds between the reductive dechlorination and so4 2 reduction table 3 discoveries on the impacts of so4 2 on the dechlorination over the past decade include evidence of no inhibition heimann et al 2005 lai et al 2019 xu et al 2015 variable degrees of inhibition in different reaction stage allard et al 1992 townsend and suflita 1997 and inhibition even at sufficient h2 concentrations aulenta et al 2008 pantazidou et al 2012 the variable extent to which the so4 2 inhibit the electron transfer is primarily attributed to its different ability to compete for h2 under different so4 2 concentrations hoelen and reinhard 2004 demonstrated that the reductive dechlorination of pce to ethylene could proceed in the presence of so4 2 100 mg l 1 pantazidou et al 2012 suggested that the so4 2 concentration of 250 300 mg l 1 is the maximum concentration range that does not lead to negative effects on the dechlorination completeness in addition so4 2 and its reduction products have been proved to negatively impact the electron transfer toward target contaminants by inhibiting the growth of bacteria and the enzyme synthesis involved in dechlorination due to their toxicity berggren et al 2013 mao et al 2017b therefore so4 2 especially at high concentrations can inhibit the degradation of cahs by competing for electron donors and producing biotoxicity 3 4 2 no3 the h2 thresholds for no3 reduction is lower than that for reductive dechlorination table 3 therefore some researchers have speculated that no3 reducing bacteria can outcompete dechlorination bacteria for electron equivalents under h2 limited conditions nelson et al 2002 laboratory research shows that in no3 and cahs mixtures the dechlorination products can only be found until the no3 reduction is complete cao et al 2017b cheng et al 2019 xu et al 2018 furthermore denitrification intermediates such as no2 no and n2o are toxic due to their reactivity with ferritin and have previously been reported to inhibit reductive dehalogenation nelson et al 2002 for example nelson et al 2002 observed that n2o was inhibitory for pce dechlorination at the concentration of 13 μm li et al 2014 reported that the toxicity of denitrification intermediates was responsible for the observed inhibition of p cnb biodegradation where no2 accumulation 2 1 mg l 1 was observed with the higher initial no3 concentration 50 mg l 1 3 4 3 fe iii iron bearing minerals are plentiful in nature and fe iii compounds are present widely in aquifers and lake sediments the phenomenon of fe iii reduction has been discovered in engineering applications where excess electron donors were introduced to participate in biodechlorination and in sites where natural attenuation of chlorinated ethenes occurred paul et al 2013 2016 based on the h2 threshold values reported table 3 fe iii reduction and dechlorination have remarkable overlaps löffler et al 1999 paul et al 2016 and the preference of one process over the other is closely related to the fe iii speciation and concentrations of all substrates and products paul et al 2013 wei and finneran 2011 from dechlorination experiments with a column system azizian et al 2010 found that 50 of the electron equivalent was used for the reduction of fe iii while only 8 was used for the reduction of cahs 3 4 4 hco3 hco3 is another electron acceptor frequently detected in groundwater usually at concentrations ranging between 0 7 and 10 mm delgado et al 2012 in addition hco3 is usually added to groundwater or reactors in the form of nahco3 or khco3 to buffer the protons produced by the biological reaction schaefer et al 2010 and regulate the ph delgado et al 2012 2014 hco3 also acts as an electron acceptor for microorganisms that normally co exist with dechlorination bacteria in underground aquifers and laboratory cultured consortia aulenta et al 2005 carr and hughes 1988 because the h2 threshold of methanogenesis is higher than the dechlorination reaction when the h2 concentration is higher the methanogenesis has a higher electron competitive advantage for instance at neutral ph hydrogenotrophic methanogens generate ch4 by using h2 as an electron donor and hco3 as an electron acceptor eq 13 cord ruwisch et al 1988 ziv el et al 2012 13 hco3 4h2 h ch4 3h2o carr and hughes 1988 monitored the dechlorination and methanogenesis simultaneously at high h2 partial pressures ca 0 8 atm however they found the dechlorination reaction could be almost negligible because only 0 4 of the added electron donors were consumed by dechlorination bacteria and the rest were mainly expended for methane production homoacetogen which consumes h2 and hco3 to form acetate eq 14 cord ruwisch et al 1988 delgado et al 2012 is another microorganism that co exists with dechlorination bacteria yang and mccarty 1998 2000 14 2hco3 4h2 h ch3coo 4h2o aulenta et al 2005 used methanol to release h2 donors for the long term dechlorination of pce in mixed anaerobic cultures and found that only less than 25 of electrons released from methanol decomposition could be diverted to pce and the remaining electrons were taken by hco3 which therefore is a negative variable for h2 driven biodechlorination due to its significant role as an electron acceptor to stimulate a competing h2 consuming reactions 3 5 strategies for improving electron selectivity 3 5 1 biostimulation in situ reductive dechlorination processes are typically enhanced by providing an exogenous electron donor that can be used preferentially by dechlorination bacteria rather than by other functional bacteria azizian et al 2010 chen et al 2012 based on the difference in the h2 threshold of each teaps and the difference in the rate of h2 production by fermentation of different organic substrates we can artificially add organic substrates to the environment to create an optimal h2 concentration that is conducive to the competition of dechlorination bacteria for electron donors heimann et al 2007 aulenta et al 2005 fennell et al 1997 for example the h2 threshold of methanogenesis is much higher than that of dechlorination so adding slowly fermented organic substrates such as butyrate and propionate to create sustainable low h2 concentrations would favor the competition for h2 by dechlorinators fennell et al 1997 however owing to the similar h2 threshold the use of slowly fermented organic substrates cannot alleviate the competition of dechlorinators with sulfate reducing microorganisms for electron donors lu et al 2001 in addition it is necessary to strictly screen and control the dosage and types of organic carbon sources in practical engineering to prevent negative consequences including explosions due to excessive gas production bioclogging in aquifers and secondary pollution caused by substrate degradation aulenta et al 2007 3 5 2 bioaugmentation if native communities in contaminated sites lack sufficient populations of pollution degraders microorganisms with the expected functions can be added exogenously through a process called bioaugmentation cosgrove et al 2010 microorganisms with population dominance have a strong ability to compete for electrons ueno et al 2006 numerous studies have been conducted to improve the dechlorination performance by injecting dechlorinating microbial consortium in contaminated sites lendvay et al 2003 major et al 2002 at the bachman site lendvay et al 2003 found that 92 of the chlorinated ethenes were successfully degraded to ethane after 43 days of inoculation of exogenous dechlorination bacteria however the feasibility of this technology is limited by the nature of the site and the structure of the indigenous microorganism community bento et al 2005 4 integrated zvi fab remediation system 4 1 coupling mechanisms involved in zvi fab system in previous research the removal rate and efficiency of pollutants were enhanced by the joint application of zvi and fab huang et al 2017 kirschling et al 2010 zhao et al 2018 zhong et al 2017 the fundamental degradation mechanisms of the investigated contaminants by the zvi fab coupled system can be synoptically summarized as follows 1 as a reductant zvi can directly participate in the chemical reduction of contaminants and degrade them into non toxic or less toxic products 2 the corrosion of zvi can reduce the oxidation reduction potential orp and neutralize the ph which can create an appropriate environment for the fab to maintain their degradation ability 3 the h2 released by the reaction of zvi with water is an effective electron donor necessary for the reduction of contaminants by hydrogenotrophic bacteria wang et al 2016 xiu et al 2010b 4 microorganisms can degrade the intermediates produced in the chemical reduction stage of zvi thoroughly xu et al 2014 5 passivators on the surface of zvi and viscous polysaccharides on the microorganisms can be used as sorbents or coagulants for contaminant removal in the past two decades a series of studies have been carried out to combine the zvi with dechlorination microorganisms for the remediation of cah contaminated plumes xie et al 2017 lampron et al 1998 were the first to indicate that abiotic and biotic dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes can be combined to improve the remediation efficiency subsequent studies lee et al 2001 rosenthal et al 2004 wang and tseng 2009 demonstrated the feasibility and reaction mechanism of combined degradation of tce by composite systems despite the collaborative pathways discussed above to promote dechlorination in the coupled system the mutually inhibitory interactions between zvi and fab could not be completely ignored under high concentrations zvi can destroy cell structure and cause cell surface stress reactions to cause toxicity to microorganisms previous studies have shown that the zvi toxicity to dechlorination microorganisms could be observed when the concentration of nzvi was higher than 0 1 g l 1 xiu et al 2010a found that zvi could inhibit the expression of the reductive dehalogenase genes tcea and vcra it is therefore evident that more comprehensive and focused research is needed to elucidate to what extent the relative concentrations of zvi vs fab should be kept to reach an optimal coupling effect furthermore applications with differently sized zvis and at variable parameters would result in distinct reactive lifetime of zvis subsequently changing the h2 production yields and sustainability this would affect the meaningful interactions between zvi and fab and is yet to be explored in depth 4 2 electron distribution in the integrated zvi fab remediation system 4 2 1 electron distribution between abiotic and biotic processes the reductive attenuation of chlorinated ethenes in anaerobic environments can be accomplished through biotic and abiotic processes including reductive dechlorination β elimination α elimination and hydrogenation liang et al 2007 roberts et al 1996 while abiotic and biotic transformations may proceed at different rates in the field they should be quantified and distinguished to identify rate limiting steps with microbial mediated reductive dichlorination it is generally difficult to achieve the complete degradation of chlorinated ethenes using a single microorganism because it involves a sequential synergistic degradation by a variety of microorganisms so the products of reductive dechlorination process are diverse for example the pce degradation products observed in microbial systems include tce dce vc and ethane ellis et al 2000 muchitsch et al 2011 conversely abiotic reduction based on zvi has been shown to achieve complete dechlorination to ethane ethene or acetylene elsner et al 2008 kaifas et al 2014 acetylene and ethane which are formed via dichloroelimination are exact biodechlorination indicators arnold and roberts 2000 but are hard to track owing to their volatility and biodegradability mao et al 2017a vanstone et al 2008 in addition although dce and vc accumulation occurs during the biotic dechlorination process they can be further reduced by abiotic agents such as fe0 fe2 etc in groundwater so their concentrations cannot be used to calculate the electron flux involved in biological degradation therefore it is not feasible to distinguish biotic or abiotic processes based on products and more advanced evaluation technique is required compound specific isotope analysis csia could potentially provide supportive evidence for accurately distinguishing abiotic and biotic pollutant degradation pathways audí miró et al 2015 leitner et al 2017 rodríguez fernández et al 2015 the basic principle of this technology is that chlorinated ethenes with light carbon isotopes 12c can break chemical bonds faster than chlorinated ethenes with heavy carbon isotopes 13c owing to their lower activation energy fischer et al 2016 elsner and imfeld 2016 in a previous study during transformation the remaining and unreacted cahs containing heavy isotopes enriched continuously which resulted in isotope fractionation the ratio of heavy to light isotopes e g 13c 12c is called the isotope ratio or isotope signature and can be expressed using the delta notation δsample according to eq 15 fischer et al 2016 coplen 2011 15 δ s a m p l e r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d 1 where rsample is the isotope ratio of the sample and rstandard is an international standard for the isotope ratio the isotope fractionation ε indicates the extent to which the isotope ratio e g 13c 12c of the average of products is smaller negative values or larger positive values than that of its precursors centler et al 2013 elsner and imfeld 2016 liang et al 2007 and wilkin et al 2018 found different isotopic fractionation patterns during abiotic and biotic processes and considered ε as an indicator of the type of degradation however numerous studies reported the ranges of ε for two pathways overlap which indicates that ε obtained only by measuring the respective c isotope fractionations is not precise in differentiating between abiotic and biotic dichlorination audí miró et al 2013 this discrimination can be achieved by dual element isotope analysis technology e g c and cl csia badin et al 2014 2016 doğan subaşı et al 2017 this method is based on the change of the dual element isotope slope δ13c δ37cl which reflects the effects of both elements on the isotope palau et al 2014 2016 different slopes may result from different transition mechanisms involving different bonds and elements elsner 2010 abe et al 2009 reported a slope c cl of 12 5 for microbial mediated cis dce dechlorination which is significantly different from the slope of 3 1 calculated by audí miró et al 2013 in a study of cis dec reduction with the participation of zvi 4 2 2 electron competition between chlorinated hydrocarbons and co existing electron acceptors in the composite system the inhibition of co existing electron acceptors on dechlorination is reduced through four main mechanisms 1 the production of h2 due to the competition of h2o for electrons can be utilized continuously by the microorganism as a secondary electron donor in the coupled system 2 oxygen can be consumed by facultative bacteria in a mixed culture through respiration reducing the competition of oxygen for electrons released by fe0 yin et al 2012a 3 as the majority of the do is consumed only residual traces of o2 could react with iron corrosion products producing lower amounts of non reactive ferric oxides thus the electron transport inhibition of iron oxides is diminished fig 4 deng et al 2016 yin et al 2012a 4 the biotoxicity of co existing electron acceptors and their products is reduced for example the toxic effects of sulfide the bio reductive product of sulfates on microorganisms are alleviated by co precipitation with fe2 to form fes kohn et al 2005 yoon et al 2011 fig 4 however currently not much has been published so far on the electron competition in the coupled system with only cases of competition from do and h2o available gaps in understanding the effects of more co existing electron acceptors and synergistic electron competition from both systems remain in addition although it has been recognized that the electron selectivity can be potentially enhanced in the coupled system compared with in single system the challenge is to optimize the dechlorination efficiency and electron selectivity simultaneously based on site specific engineering designs 5 conclusions and future research needs we reviewed and summarized the literatures on electron competition and electron selectivity in abiotic biotic and coupled systems for dechlorinating cahs in groundwater from the review we can draw the following conclusions 1 in the zvi system no3 o2 and h2o are the dominant electron competitors with cahs electron utilization efficiency and selectivity has been quantitatively described with pe src and ee the competitiveness of these co existing electron acceptors should be evaluated from both the thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives at present the widely developed measures for enhancing the electron selectivity of the zvi system include the sulfidation of iron the application of a wmf and the dosing of fe2 2 in the fab system mainly no3 so4 2 fe iii and hco3 are involved in the electron competition with cahs both the type and amount of electron acceptors and electron donors affect electron selectivity which can be quantitatively characterized by electron recovery and electron balance analyses in practical applications of the fab system artificial addition of exogenous functional microorganisms and slow fermenting exogenous organic substrates are effective measures to enhance electron selectivity 3 the recently developed zvi fab coupled system enhances the dechlorination performance in this system electron selectivity is improved by increasing the utilization efficiency of excess h2 alleviating the competition of o2 inhibiting zvi passivation to facilitate electron transfer and decreasing the biotoxicity although much information about electron selectivity and electron competition has been summarized it remains incompletely understood and various restrictions are still present to fill these knowledge gaps more relevant investigations are needed in future research 1 even though there are available data that can be used to provide insights into the electron competition in abiotic and biotic dechlorination systems quantitative research on electron selectivity is still in its infancy more data quantifying the electron equivalents or ee should be collected to establish a more exhaustive database the integration of these data into a mathematical model will contribute to a more powerful model to predict the in situ remediation dynamics 2 previous studies on the effects of the co existing electron acceptors on dechlorination performance or ee were mostly based on batch scale experiments that only considered one co existing electron acceptor however in real systems multiple electron acceptors co exist which may dramatically complicate the electron competition mechanisms involved therefore it is necessary to quantitatively investigate the electron distribution among multiple electron acceptors under natural hydrogeochemical conditions 3 compared with the single abiotic or biotic systems the composition of electron donors and electron acceptors in the zvi fab composite system is more complicated the available literature only addresses the differentiation of biotic abiotic degradation processes quantitatively furthermore there are diversified electron donors including zvi hydrogen and small organic matter molecules as well as different electron acceptors including no3 so4 2 do h2o fe iii and hco3 a complete explanation of the electron flow in a composite system requires a combination of multiple analytical techniques such as stable isotope probing product identification and mass balance analysis 4 measures to improve electron selectivity remain to be developed and the mechanisms involved must be further elucidated for example the application of sulfated zvi can effectively prevent the corrosion of zvi by h2o but whether this method is equally effective in reducing electron competition from other electron acceptors is not yet understood in addition the feasibility of this enhancement technology under real conditions should also be considered measures to enhance electron selectivity in fab systems such as bioaugmentation and biostimulation can also effectively enhance degradation performance however in engineering applications a series of practical problems remain to be considered for example bioclogging problems caused by exogenous electron donors or exogenous microorganisms increased economic costs and the adaptability and viability of exogenous microorganisms declaration of competing

17731,chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons cahs have been frequently detected in aquifers in recent years owing to the bioaccumulation and toxicity of cahs it is essential to explore high efficiency technologies for their complete dechlorination in groundwater at present the most widely used abiotic and biotic remediation technologies are based on zero valent iron zvi and functional anaerobic bacteria fab respectively however the main obstacles to the full potential of both technologies in the field include their lowered efficiencies and increased economic costs due to the co existence of a variety of natural electron acceptors in the environment such as dissolved oxygen do nitrate no3 sulfate so4 2 ferric iron fe iii bicarbonate hco3 and even water which compete for electrons with the target contaminants therefore a clear understanding of the mechanisms governing electron competition and electron selectivity is significant for the accurate evaluation of the effectiveness of both technologies under natural hydrochemical conditions we collected data from both abiotic and biotic cah remediation systems summarized the dechlorination and undesired reactions in groundwater discussed the characterization methods and general principles of electron competition and described strategies to improve electron selectivity in both systems furthermore we reviewed the emerging zvi fab coupled system which integrates abiotic and biotic processes to enhance dechlorination performance and electron utilization efficiency lastly we propose future research needs to quantitatively understand the electron competition in abiotic biotic and coupled systems in more detail and to promote improved electron selectivity in groundwater remediation graphical abstract image 1 keywords zero valent iron functional anaerobic bacteria groundwater remediation chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons electron competition electron selectivity 1 introduction chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons cahs such as dichloroethane dca trichloroethane tca perchloroethene pce and trichloroethylene tce have been commonly used as degreasing agents and in industrial cleaning solutions rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 su et al 2013 and have frequently been detected in groundwater due to accidental spills and former improper disposal practices dong et al 2018 approximately 42 of the superfund sites in the united states suffered from groundwater tce contamination huang et al 2019 cahs can pose serious health risks to the public and ecosystems due to their bioaccumulation and toxicity niño de guzmán et al 2018 shih et al 2019 zhou et al 2016 therefore it is essential to explore high efficiency technologies for the complete dechlorination of cahs in groundwater xie et al 2017 for nearly half a century continuous efforts have been directed towards enhancing the reductive dechlorination of cahs via abiotic and biotic reactions one of the most widely employed materials for abiotic treatments is zero valent iron zvi li et al 2019 lin et al 2018 planer friedrich et al 2018 wei et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 owing to its strong reduction ability e0 0 44 v and nontoxic iron oxides products zhao et al 2016 in addition bioremediation through natural attenuation or engineered system is recognized as another promising method for in situ underground remediation lien et al 2016 during the bioremediation the functional anaerobic bacteria fab living in the underground aquifers can accept electron donors such as hydrogen h2 or organic substrates and reduce cahs through anaerobic reduction majone et al 2015 mayer blackwell et al 2017 more recently the neoteric approach of zvi coupled with anaerobic bioremediation zvi fab coupled system has been extensively studied h2 is used as a link between abiotic and biotic systems fig 1 which connects the h2 donor zvi and the h2 acceptor hydrogen autotrophic microorganisms partially possessing dechlorination function dong et al 2019 rosenthal et al 2004 xiu et al 2010b this strategy can enhance the utilization of zvi save the dosage of zvi and effectively alleviate the problem of gas clogging which is of great significance in improving the efficiency of the in situ remediation of cahs rosenthal et al 2004 wang et al 2016 xiu et al 2010b compared with laboratory batch experiments the application of these technologies in field scales is more challenging largely due the complexity of reactions in groundwater johnson et al 2013 kocur et al 2015 the complexity is mainly caused by the intrinsic competition for electron donors driven by a variety of natural reductant demands nrds i e co existing electron acceptors such as dissolved oxygen do nitrate no3 sulfate so4 2 ferric iron fe iii bicarbonate hco3 and even water shi et al 2015 yin et al 2012b with the electrons distributed simultaneously towards different electron acceptors the electron selectivity towards the target contaminants would be negatively affected therefore a better understanding of these observations is necessary to evaluate the long term performance and economic benefit of these technologies under natural environmental conditions previously many investigations have qualitatively evaluated the impact of electron competition on the performance of zvi or fab systems lai et al 2019 lu et al 2017 paul et al 2016 however until very recently only a limited amount of quantitative data describing electron selectivity was available although the competitive effects of the co existing electron acceptors were generally accepted it has not been elucidated how the types and quantities of them affect the extent of competition cheng et al 2019 liu et al 2007 some strategies such as the sulfidation of zvi and the biostimulation have been proposed to enhance electron selectivity in abiotic and biotic systems respectively he et al 2018 lately the emerging zvi fab coupled system has also been considered as an improvement of the single system in terms of reducing the electron competition you et al 2017 in recent decades heightened attention has been paid to in situ groundwater dechlorination technologies and numerous relevant critical reviews have been published encompassing the working mechanisms and the factors influencing the removal kinetics of these technologies dong et al 2019 fu et al 2014 sun et al 2016 thomas and bruton 2015 to our knowledge however there has been no overarching review that evaluates electron selectivity which has big implications for characterizing and promoting the dechlorination efficiency under field conditions thus our review provides a comprehensive summary of the research on electron competition and electron selectivity in abiotic biotic and coupled remediation systems with a focus on their characterization methods governing mechanisms and enhancement strategies besides future research directions that will promote a better understanding of the electron competition from nrds during in situ remediation processes are suggested it is hoped that the present review will guide in evaluating and improving the effectiveness of in situ groundwater remediation technologies 2 zvi system 2 1 dechlorination and undesired reactions in zvi based remediation system enhanced abiotic dechlorination through constructing permeable reactive barriers prbs or direct injection of fine zvi particles into groundwater is an effective in situ remediation strategy prbs are usually used to capture the contamination plume and protect the vulnerable targets while direct injection is more prone to be applied near the contamination source zone with high pollution loads zvis of different particle sizes are favored by different technologies for example conventional granular zvi is typically applied in prb systems while nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi and microscale scale zero valent iron mzvi are preferentially adopted for injections although several experiments have shown that zvi in situ remediation was successful in remediating groundwater pollution its potential has not yet been fully realized in zvi based processes the main pathway by which zvi degrades contaminants is direct electron transfer more specifically the former releases two or three electrons and is converted into fe ii or fe iii while the latter receives these electrons and gets reduced liu et al 2013 however undesired reactions between zvi and nrds occur simultaneously and divert the direction of the electron transfer table 1 fig 2 resulting in electron waste and additional chemical consumption to achieve high degradation efficiency of target contaminants excess zvi material is used to compensate for the waste of electrons which inevitably increases the economic cost accordingly quantifying the degree of electron utilization provides a foundation for improving economic efficiency and minimizing the zvi dose required by this approach 2 2 methods for the characterization of electron competition and electron selectivity in early studies researchers focused only on the reaction kinetics e g dechlorination rate and dechlorination efficiency in single solute systems to evaluate the efficacy of remediation systems chen et al 2001 liu and lowry 2006 without considering the potential effects from co existing electron acceptors as the research progressed people gradually became aware of the issue and began to determine the effect of co existing electron acceptors on the removal of target substances qualitatively by comparing the reaction rate constants k and or the half lives of target substances in the presence and absence of co existing electron acceptors farrell et al 2000 liu et al 2007 2013 yin et al 2012b to evaluate the effectiveness of the technique more accurately and comprehensively it is necessary to characterize the effect of co existing electron acceptors on the remediation performance quantitatively to this end the concepts described in the following subsections have been proposed 2 2 1 particle efficiency pe the particle efficiency pe is defined as the ratio of the amount of zvi participating in the reduction of target contaminants to the total amount of zvi initially added into the system liu et al 2005 and can be calculated as follows 1 p e m 0 m f n m n 0 100 where m0 represents the moles of target contaminants before the reaction mf represents the final moles of residual target contaminant at a given time m represents the number of electrons released by 1 mol of fe0 n0 represents the moles of fe0 initially added to the system and n represents the number of electrons needed for the reduction of 1 mol of target contaminant into final product for mixed products the value of n can be obtained as follows 2 n i n i p i where ni represents the coefficient of each reaction and pi represents the fraction of each product at a given reaction time intuitively the pe can reflect the ratio of total iron consumption liu et al 2005 proved that the pe of iron particles with different properties fe b and reactive nanoscale iron particles rnip ranged between 52 and 92 under iron limited conditions primarily because different oxide shell compositions result in different amounts of accessible fe0 2 2 2 specific removal capacity src the specific removal capacity src is defined as the ratio of the amount of removed target contaminant to the amount of consumed fe0 and is calculated as follows fan et al 2019 3 s r c n t n f e 0 n f e 0 100 where n fe0 is the molar quantity of fe0 before reaction and nfe0 and nt are the molar quantities of fe0 and target contaminant degraded in the system after the reaction respectively fan et al 2019 found that the src varied from 20 7 to 46 under different zvi systems zvi fe2 zvi h2o2 s zvi and zvi weak magnetic field wmf which is mainly attributed to the difference in the amounts of fe0 available in the iron particles 2 2 3 electron efficiency ee to characterize the partitioning of electron donors between the target contaminant and the nrds the new concept of electron efficiency ee has been proposed fan et al 2019 liu et al 2013 ee can be expressed as 4 e e n e n t 100 where ne is the number of electrons scavenged for target contaminant reduction and nt is the number of consumed electrons at a given reaction time the value of ne is determined by the concentration and relative proportion of the final reduced product of the target contaminant the value of nt can be obtained by analyzing the exact total amount of consumed iron or quantitatively identifying all the final products based on this concept schöftner et al 2015 obtained ee values as low as 3 1 1 4 in the tce reduction with nzvi independent of the tested conditions berge and ramsburg 2010 estimated the ee for tce dechlorination to be between 0 9 and 48 with different tce contents such low ee values indicate that a large number of electrons released by zvi in groundwaters are not involved in the degradation of target contaminants in practice zvis is used at multiple points that cover both the high pollution load area near the pollution source and the low pollution load area downstream from the source zone and the resulting different ee values could provide us useful information to determine whether this technology is economically feasible for specific conditions xin et al 2020 calculated the ee of mzvi under high pollution load and low pollution load conditions respectively in the system where water reduction as the sole side reaction under the high pollution load conditions the ee values were 55 02 63 70 while more electrons were used for water reduction under the low pollution load conditions yielding an ee of only 6 03 10 75 these results give us implications that a higher ee value usually corresponds to a higher pollution load and achieving a reasonable zvi target pollutant ratio is crucial to increasing the ee particularly for locations downstream of the source zone that have relatively lower pollution loads in summary all the three parameters pe src and ee discussed above could be used to represent the utilization efficiency of applied reactive materials for target contaminants however their distinct implications should be concerned both pe and src reflect the zvi utilization efficiency without providing information about the electron flow towards different electron acceptors compared with pe src more accurately represents the utilization efficiency of consumed zvi rather than the total applied zvi if the zvi is fully consumed then pe is equal to src to quantitatively characterize the partitioning of electron donors between the target contaminant and the nrd the determination of ee has been a better option 2 3 general principles of electron competition between cahs and co existing electron acceptors the three quantitative parameters described above might be reported with different values in different studies to provide a theoretical basis for comparison interpretation of the general principles how the electron competition between cahs and co existing electron acceptors occurs is a prerequisite in abiotic systems the ability of the electron acceptors to compete for reducing electrons depends on their thermodynamic properties particularly their oxidative strength which is determined by the standard electrode potential sep in other words the higher is the electrode potential the stronger is the ability of the electron acceptor to compete for electrons for example because the sep of para chloronitrobenzene p cnb para chloroaniline p can 0 5 1 5 v is much higher than that of no3 no2 0 01 v the ability of co existing no3 to compete with p cnb for electrons was much lower in the zvi system le et al 2011 however this order of priority is not absolute and the competitiveness should also be understood from the kinetic perspective by considering the effects of the electron acceptor concentrations and external environmental conditions for example when tce and no3 coexist in a zvi system no3 reacts more readily with zvi which is attributed not only to the higher electrode potential of no3 but also to their ability to compete for adsorption sites on the zvi surface wherein the water soluble no3 is easier to be adsorbed on hydrophilic zvi surface than greasy tce in the zvi system with co existing no3 the target contaminant nitrobenzene nb remained as the prior electron acceptor which is attributed to the strong attraction of nitro groups to electrons razo flores et al 1999 yin et al 2012b nevertheless information on how the thermodynamic and kinetic properties may collaboratively affect the electron competitiveness of different electron acceptors is very scarce in addition from the technical application point of view how to evaluate the electron flow in natural systems with complex hydrochemical characteristics has become the future research hotspot 2 4 effects of different co existing electron acceptors on electron selectivity groundwater components such do no3 and h2o all compete for electrons with cahs dechlorination altering the electron selectivity of zvis to different extents and through variable pathways therefore we have summarized the effects of these co existing electron acceptors on electron selectivity respectively further below 2 4 1 do do as a potent active oxidant and electron acceptor in shallow aquifers has significant effects on zvi passivation electron distribution and effective contaminant degradation shimizu et al 2012 when iron is immersed in an aqueous solution its oxidation corrosion mechanism can be described by eq 5 below only when the o2 remaining in water is exhausted by iron corrosion eqs 5 and 6 can anaerobic iron oxidation occur eq 7 5 2fe 2h2o o2 2fe2 4oh 6 4fe2 o2 4h 4fe3 2h2o 7 fe 2h2o fe2 h2 2oh it has been proved that the presence of do can inhibit the degradation of pollutants that are reduced by electrons released by iron potential mechanisms for the negative effects of do on the effective degradation of target contaminants include the 1 competition for electrons and 2 the formation of a passivating oxide layer containing low conductivity maghemite γ fe2o3 with barrier effects on reaction sites reinsch et al 2010 xie and cwiertny 2010 yin et al 2012b for example nb removal was observed to be reduced by 17 1 in a do containing zvi system owing to electron competition and oxide layer formation yin et al 2012b although do is generally considered to have inhibition effects it has also been shown to promote the removal of pollutants qin et al 2016 2017 wang et al 2010 the major possible reason for the promotion is that increasing the do concentration enhances iron corrosion and results in more passivation products which facilitate the target contaminant removal by adsorption and co precipitation for example qin et al 2017 found that the introduction of do significantly enhanced the conversion of fe0 to iron hydr oxides accompanied by increased adsorption and subsequent reduction of se vi on the surface of zvi particles however as the enhanced removal by adsorption and co precipitation due to surface passivation is only a short term effect the trade off between the beneficial side and negative side of surface passivation should be well evaluated in future research 2 4 2 no3 in recent years processes such as intensive agriculture e g excessive use of fertilizers and animal manure and urbanization have led to the contamination of the vadose zone groundwater system with nitrogen resulting in increasing no3 level in groundwater xin et al 2019 owing to its strong oxidizing properties no3 is highly reactive with zvi reinsch et al 2010 xie and cwiertny 2012 and has a significant influence on the electron selectivity of zvi the destructive effect of no3 on the degradation of target contaminants with zvi has been frequently reported as a strong reactant it exhibits the competitive advantage over the target contaminant for reaction sites and electrons farrell et al 2000 kaifas et al 2014 however under certain circumstances no3 could also accelerate the iron corrosion and cause a higher release of electrons shi et al 2015 it has been shown that a higher degradation efficiency of target contaminants with zvi can be obtained at low no3 concentrations because the corrosion enhancement role of nitrate surpassed its electron competing role liu et al 2007 yin et al 2012b however as the nitrate concentration increases above a certain level its electron competing role dominates inhibiting cahs removal for example farrell et al 2000 found that in an anaerobic system where tce and no3 coexisted approximately 20 of the no3 was removed in the first three days of the reaction and the dechlorination products of tce were not detected in the effluent which demonstrated that no3 is more competitive than tce for electrons in addition no3 affects the passivation of the oxide film on the iron surface a high concentration of no3 may stabilize the original passivation film e g hematite lu et al 2017 ritter et al 2003 or form a new passivating iron oxide layer e g feooh or a nonporous maghemite mishra and farrell 2005 schlicker et al 2000 on the surface of zvi by increasing the ph and redox potential of the system which hinders the electron transfer 2 4 3 h2o the reaction of fe0 with h2o which generates h2 and iron oxide eq 8 qin et al 2018 is among the most fundamental processes that compete for electrons in aqueous solutions containing zvi 8 3fe0 4h2o fe3o4 4h2 according to the above reaction a large amount of h2 is produced and ferrous metals are corroded which will result in a series of negative effects above all the reduction of h2o consumes the electrons released from zvi that would otherwise participate in the degradation of target contaminants this competition is the major factor that limits the ee of or selectivity for the contaminant reduction by zvi fan et al 2016b liu et al 2013 xin et al 2018 utilized a column filled with a mixture of sand mzvi 5 wfe wsand to simulate the in situ reactive zone and reached an ee range of 41 63 50 60 and 25 40 toward tce degradation in milli q water fresh groundwater and saline groundwater respectively schöftner et al 2015 performed a batch experiment with nzvi 2 5 g l 1 and tce 35 mg l 1 in the absence of any other oxide the results showed that only 3 1 1 4 of the electrons were used for tce dehalogenation leaving a much higher fraction of electrons distributed to h2o it can be seen that the competition of h2o for electrons is significant to be noticed if the reaction between water and zvi leads to the accumulation of excessive gaseous h2 in the pore space the groundwater flow will be obstructed restraining the contact between zvi and contamination plume and triggering system failure ruhl and jekel 2014 tang et al 2017 lastly the negative effect on electron transfer due to the increased passivation products on the fe0 surface caused by zvi h2o interaction should not be overlooked 2 5 strategies for improving electron selectivity given the limitations of low ee systems a variety of promising strategies have been proposed to enhance the selectivity of zvi 2 5 1 sulfidation the sulfidation of zvi i e s zvi which involves a modification of zvi particles by reducing sulfur compounds li et al 2017 qin et al 2018 xu et al 2016 has been shown to be effective in enhancing the electron selectivity of zvi toward target contaminants over h2o in anaerobic environments gu et al 2017 he et al 2018 li et al 2016 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 firstly reported that sulfidation can selectively increase the electron transfer to tce and inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction of zvi with h2o the potential mechanisms involved in the sulfidation of zvi can be divided into two types 1 the fes layer on s zvi is more hydrophobic than the hydro oxide layer on unmodified zvi therefore compared with water or water soluble ions hydrophobic organic contaminants such as tce are more easily enriched on the surface of s zvi cao et al 2017a han et al 2019 park et al 2006 which facilitates the transfer of electrons to the adjacent organic pollutants for instance fan et al 2016a suggested that when the molar ratio of s to fe was above 0 3 the reaction of s zvi with h2o was mostly eliminated while the reaction with tce maintained high activity 2 sulfur in s zvi is a potent deactivator of hydrogen recombination reactions han and yan 2016 kim et al 2011a in an anaerobic water environment the fundamental step of hydrogen recombination on the zvi surface represents the process of electron transfer to protons resulting in the adsorption of hydrogen atoms on the iron surface to recombine and produce molecular hydrogen that bubbles off the iron surface han and yan 2016 therefore the sulfur in s zvi would significantly improve the hydrodechlorination of cahs by inhibiting the competing electron transfer process of hydrogen recombination nevertheless the underlying mechanism of sulfur s disruptive effect on hydrogen recombination needs further exploration in addition it should be noted that the different sulfidation methods may affect the sulfur distribution and concentration in the produced s zvi han and yan 2016 kim et al 2011a 2014 and possibly result in improved ee to variable extents for example xu et al 2019 synthesized two s zvis with s fe ratios of 5 4 0 5 mol and 0 8 0 1 mol respectively by one step method and two step method compared with bare zvi the ee increased from 2 9 0 4 to 72 1 1 6 and 56 0 0 8 respectively which was attributed to that different sulfidation methods lead to different surface chemistry 2 5 2 other methods in addition to sulfidation other strategies to improve the electron selectivity of zvi have been proposed such as the application of wmf fan et al 2019 the addition of a secondary metal he et al 2018 and fe2 dosing fan et al 2019 qin et al 2017 recent studies have shown that the application of wmf can inhibit the production of h2 and increase the utilization of electrons by the target contaminants kim et al 2011b found that the degradation efficiency of 4 chlorophenol at an initial concentration of 100 mg l 1 increased from 22 5 without wmf to 51 under wmf and the production of h2 decreased by 59 29 accordingly he et al 2018 proved that bimetallic reductants prepared by the deposition of a second transition metal on the iron surface are effective in improving electron selectivity in the degradation of excess tce they increased the ee from 2 with bare zvi to 100 and 72 with fe pd and fe ni respectively qin et al 2017 demonstrated that the application of 1 0 mm fe2 increased the electron selectivity of zvi towards se vi from 3 2 3 6 to 6 2 6 8 and enhanced the se vi removal capacity by 100 180 although the limited quantitative data reflect the potential of these measures to improve electron selectivity the mechanisms by which these strategies to improve electron selectivity have not been comprehensively examined therefore more experimental evidence and in depth research are needed to further confirm their feasibility and reveal the mechanisms underlying their effects in addition the disadvantage such as a quick passivation for the bi metallic system should be considered because its catalytic effect soon disappears as passivation occurs han et al 2018 he et al 2010 yan et al 2010 3 functional anaerobic bacteria fab system 3 1 dechlorination and undesired reactions in fab based remediation system in an anaerobic groundwater environment microbial reductive dechlorination processes can convert cahs into final products with low chlorine content nijenhuis and kuntze 2016 xie et al 2017 zanaroli et al 2015 the target contaminants serve as electron acceptors in the process of energy metabolism chen et al 2018 electron donors are required to participate in the reaction and molecular h2 is recognized as a good candidate to meet this demand however h2 is a relatively inexpensive electron donor that is universally available for microbial reduction of oxidized compounds so4 2 no3 fe iii and hco3 can coexist with cahs and bacteria that reduce them can compete with the cah reducing bacteria for example dechloromonas and desulfitobacterium sp strain y 51 are well known for respiring chlorinated compounds but they also can respire no3 and so4 2 lai et al 2019 the iron reducing bacteria which initiated fe iii reduction process was evidenced as capable of stimulating dechlorination chen et al 2016 therefore to qualitatively and quantitatively understand all the desired and undesired microbial processes is essential for effective biotic dechlorination application 3 2 methods for the characterization of electron competition and electron selectivity 3 2 1 electron recovery the electron recovery er was calculated as the ratio of the total electrons consumed by electron acceptor degradation to the total electrons donated from the electron donors chen et al 2018 9 e r n a n d where nd and na represent the electron equivalents provided by the electron donor and those consumed by the electron acceptor reduction respectively specific parameters are summarized in table 2 nd can be calculated via multiplying the concentration of the consumed electron donor mm by the number of electrons released from the complete oxidation of electron donors per mole na can be calculated via multiplying the concentration of products mm by the number of electrons consumed in the generation of the product per mole in a microbial system with multiple electron acceptors including cah as the target contaminant taking tce as an example the er can be expressed as eq 10 10 e r e r t c e e r o t h e r s 11 e r t c e 2 d c e 4 v c 6 e t h e n e n d 100 where ertce and erothers denote the percentage of utilization of electron equivalents by tce and other competitive undesired reactions respectively ertce was estimated as the quotient of the theoretical electron equivalents required for the formation of tce reduction products and nd eq 11 however under most cases the value of er does not equal 100 aulenta et al 2007 azizian et al 2010 for instance in a study by aulenta et al 2007 when lactate h2 acetate and butyrate were used as electron donors the er was 76 66 and 62 respectively some of the missing equivalents were suspected to be channeled to the synthesis of biomass which is neglected in the balance construction aulenta et al 2007 berggren et al 2013 therefore the parameters ertce and erothers are adequate to reflect the electron distribution among different electron acceptors but to maintain the integrity of electron utilization calculations the electron equivalents used for biosynthesis must be inclusively considered 3 2 2 electron balance analysis the analysis of the electron balance addresses the missing electrons in the er calculation when microorganisms use electron donors for metabolism a portion of their electrons are initially transferred to the electron acceptors and the remaining electrons fs 0 are used for biomass synthesis rittmann and mccarty 2001 fig 3 the sum of the er and fs 0 is 100 the fs 0 is a function of the mass unit y rittmann and mccarty 2001 12 f s 0 y n e e e q m o l c e l l s 8 g c o d e e q d o n o r m c g c e l l s m o l c e l l s where ne is the number of electron equivalents in an empirical mole of cells mc is the empirical formula weight of cells and the donor mass is expressed as chemical oxygen demand cod the electron balance analysis can not only reflect the electron distribution in a microbial system comprehensively wen et al 2017 but also can help to calculate the relative abundance of each microorganism group using the cell volumes lee et al 2009 parameswaran et al 2009 ziv el et al 2012 while various studies have already used this method to identify key microorganisms the sparse applications in biotic dechlorination systems have provided limited information to estimate the electron distribution and microbial community structure based on electron balances in the fab system 3 3 general principles of electron competition between cahs and co existing electron acceptors in comparison with the zvi system where zvi is the only shared electron donor for various oxides in the fab system the choice of electron acceptors for electron donors may be specific or diverse h2 and or short chain fatty acids due to the physiological characteristics of the mediating microorganism therefore the electron flow characteristics discussed above are attributed to more complex governing electron competition principles a number of studies have shown that respiratory processes in microbial systems such as methanogenesis and dehalogenation can be maintained by various electron donors of which h2 is recognized as a key electron donor for accelerating reductive dechlorination processes heimann et al 2010 maymo gatell et al 1995 while organic electron donors play a major role in stimulating h2 production through fermentation fennell et al 1997 the competition for h2 between dehalogenators and other functional anaerobes is ubiquitous previous studies chapelle et al 1996 chapelle and lovley 1992 lu et al 2001 luijten et al 2004 recorded the competition among various h2 consuming microbes systematically in natural groundwater systems and found that the optimal hydrogen concentration for different terminal electron accepting processes teaps was different table 3 when hydrogen consuming microorganism such as dehalogenators or sulfate reducing bacteria cannot obtain the minimum gibbs free energy needed to maintain the critical cell activity the consumption of h2 will cease at this time the concentration of h2 in the environment is defined as the h2 threshold karadagli et al 2019 therefore the ability of electron acceptors to compete for electrons is affected by the concentration of h2 in mixed bacteria when the h2 concentration is within the h2 threshold range of a certain teap this teap would display strong electron competitiveness heimann et al 2005 yang and mccarty 1998 for instance yang and mccarty 1998 examined the competition between dehalogenators and other microorganisms and found that the dehalogenators had a higher affinity for electrons than methanogens and homoacetogens when the h2 level was maintained between 2 and 11 nm in addition because most of the degradation of cahs is completed in steps the hydrogen thresholds of different degradation stages may be different indicating that the electron competition from other teaps is different in different stages of dechlorination he et al 2002 lu et al 2001 yang and mccarty 1998 in addition to direct h2 replenishment multiple organic compounds have been applied as the main precursors for fermentative h2 production in fab systems heimann et al 2007 maymo gatell et al 1995 fast fermenting substrates such as formate lactate and alcohols methanol and ethanol and slow fermenting substrates such as propionate butyrate and benzoate have been used as indirect electron donors in experiments for biodechlorination paul et al 2013 azizian et al 2010 fennell et al 1997 mayer blackwell et al 2017 the fermentation rate of an organic matrix directly affects the h2 concentration in the system and the subsequent electron competition between teaps for example heimann et al 2007 used the fast fermenting lactate and the slow fermenting propionate respectively as h2 releasing substrates for mixed dehalococcoides containing cultures to degrade tce the results showed that the lactate fed fab system created high h2 concentrations and thereby a strong methanogenesis reaction accompanied the dechlorination reaction conversely slow h2 release rates resulting from the fermentation of propionate made it possible to avoid competition caused by excessive methane production no3 so4 2 fe3 and hco3 can co exist with cahs and bacteria that reduce them can compete with dechlorination bacteria lai et al 2019 table 4 therefore the concentration of these electron acceptors yan et al 2006 and functional bacterial community structure cheng et al 2019 are closely related to their ability to compete for electrons for instance when 100 mg l 1 and 1000 mg l 1 hco3 was added to the system yan et al 2006 observed the most and least extensive dechlorination respectively el mamouni et al 2002 reported an insignificant effect of 10 mm so4 2 on the tce dechlorination by indigenous microorganisms whereas higher so4 2 concentrations 15 and 20 mm slowed down the dechlorination the microbial community structure is critical to the distribution of electrons within the system the competition between teaps for electrons can also be regarded as the competition for electron donors between dechlorination bacteria and other functional anaerobes thus environmental conditions that favor the growth of dehalogenators over their competitors might enhance the ability of anaerobic reductive dehalogenation to compete for electrons smatlak et al 1996 yang and mccarty 2000 ziv el et al 2012 for instance yang and mccarty 2000 proved that the utilization efficiency of h2 in dechlorination increased from 10 to 67 by inhibiting the processes of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis 3 4 effects of different co existing electron acceptors on electron selectivity after grasping the potential mechanism of electron competition in the fab system the influence of different co existing electron acceptors on electron selectivity are deeply analyzed in the following subsections 3 4 1 so4 2 so4 2 is ubiquitous in groundwater and is frequently reported as a soluble anion co existing with cahs at wide ranging concentrations 0 2 30 mm miao et al 2012 pérez de mora et al 2014 zanaroli et al 2015 exploring the role of sulfate in the dechlorination of cahs is important primarily owing to the similarity of the h2 thresholds between the reductive dechlorination and so4 2 reduction table 3 discoveries on the impacts of so4 2 on the dechlorination over the past decade include evidence of no inhibition heimann et al 2005 lai et al 2019 xu et al 2015 variable degrees of inhibition in different reaction stage allard et al 1992 townsend and suflita 1997 and inhibition even at sufficient h2 concentrations aulenta et al 2008 pantazidou et al 2012 the variable extent to which the so4 2 inhibit the electron transfer is primarily attributed to its different ability to compete for h2 under different so4 2 concentrations hoelen and reinhard 2004 demonstrated that the reductive dechlorination of pce to ethylene could proceed in the presence of so4 2 100 mg l 1 pantazidou et al 2012 suggested that the so4 2 concentration of 250 300 mg l 1 is the maximum concentration range that does not lead to negative effects on the dechlorination completeness in addition so4 2 and its reduction products have been proved to negatively impact the electron transfer toward target contaminants by inhibiting the growth of bacteria and the enzyme synthesis involved in dechlorination due to their toxicity berggren et al 2013 mao et al 2017b therefore so4 2 especially at high concentrations can inhibit the degradation of cahs by competing for electron donors and producing biotoxicity 3 4 2 no3 the h2 thresholds for no3 reduction is lower than that for reductive dechlorination table 3 therefore some researchers have speculated that no3 reducing bacteria can outcompete dechlorination bacteria for electron equivalents under h2 limited conditions nelson et al 2002 laboratory research shows that in no3 and cahs mixtures the dechlorination products can only be found until the no3 reduction is complete cao et al 2017b cheng et al 2019 xu et al 2018 furthermore denitrification intermediates such as no2 no and n2o are toxic due to their reactivity with ferritin and have previously been reported to inhibit reductive dehalogenation nelson et al 2002 for example nelson et al 2002 observed that n2o was inhibitory for pce dechlorination at the concentration of 13 μm li et al 2014 reported that the toxicity of denitrification intermediates was responsible for the observed inhibition of p cnb biodegradation where no2 accumulation 2 1 mg l 1 was observed with the higher initial no3 concentration 50 mg l 1 3 4 3 fe iii iron bearing minerals are plentiful in nature and fe iii compounds are present widely in aquifers and lake sediments the phenomenon of fe iii reduction has been discovered in engineering applications where excess electron donors were introduced to participate in biodechlorination and in sites where natural attenuation of chlorinated ethenes occurred paul et al 2013 2016 based on the h2 threshold values reported table 3 fe iii reduction and dechlorination have remarkable overlaps löffler et al 1999 paul et al 2016 and the preference of one process over the other is closely related to the fe iii speciation and concentrations of all substrates and products paul et al 2013 wei and finneran 2011 from dechlorination experiments with a column system azizian et al 2010 found that 50 of the electron equivalent was used for the reduction of fe iii while only 8 was used for the reduction of cahs 3 4 4 hco3 hco3 is another electron acceptor frequently detected in groundwater usually at concentrations ranging between 0 7 and 10 mm delgado et al 2012 in addition hco3 is usually added to groundwater or reactors in the form of nahco3 or khco3 to buffer the protons produced by the biological reaction schaefer et al 2010 and regulate the ph delgado et al 2012 2014 hco3 also acts as an electron acceptor for microorganisms that normally co exist with dechlorination bacteria in underground aquifers and laboratory cultured consortia aulenta et al 2005 carr and hughes 1988 because the h2 threshold of methanogenesis is higher than the dechlorination reaction when the h2 concentration is higher the methanogenesis has a higher electron competitive advantage for instance at neutral ph hydrogenotrophic methanogens generate ch4 by using h2 as an electron donor and hco3 as an electron acceptor eq 13 cord ruwisch et al 1988 ziv el et al 2012 13 hco3 4h2 h ch4 3h2o carr and hughes 1988 monitored the dechlorination and methanogenesis simultaneously at high h2 partial pressures ca 0 8 atm however they found the dechlorination reaction could be almost negligible because only 0 4 of the added electron donors were consumed by dechlorination bacteria and the rest were mainly expended for methane production homoacetogen which consumes h2 and hco3 to form acetate eq 14 cord ruwisch et al 1988 delgado et al 2012 is another microorganism that co exists with dechlorination bacteria yang and mccarty 1998 2000 14 2hco3 4h2 h ch3coo 4h2o aulenta et al 2005 used methanol to release h2 donors for the long term dechlorination of pce in mixed anaerobic cultures and found that only less than 25 of electrons released from methanol decomposition could be diverted to pce and the remaining electrons were taken by hco3 which therefore is a negative variable for h2 driven biodechlorination due to its significant role as an electron acceptor to stimulate a competing h2 consuming reactions 3 5 strategies for improving electron selectivity 3 5 1 biostimulation in situ reductive dechlorination processes are typically enhanced by providing an exogenous electron donor that can be used preferentially by dechlorination bacteria rather than by other functional bacteria azizian et al 2010 chen et al 2012 based on the difference in the h2 threshold of each teaps and the difference in the rate of h2 production by fermentation of different organic substrates we can artificially add organic substrates to the environment to create an optimal h2 concentration that is conducive to the competition of dechlorination bacteria for electron donors heimann et al 2007 aulenta et al 2005 fennell et al 1997 for example the h2 threshold of methanogenesis is much higher than that of dechlorination so adding slowly fermented organic substrates such as butyrate and propionate to create sustainable low h2 concentrations would favor the competition for h2 by dechlorinators fennell et al 1997 however owing to the similar h2 threshold the use of slowly fermented organic substrates cannot alleviate the competition of dechlorinators with sulfate reducing microorganisms for electron donors lu et al 2001 in addition it is necessary to strictly screen and control the dosage and types of organic carbon sources in practical engineering to prevent negative consequences including explosions due to excessive gas production bioclogging in aquifers and secondary pollution caused by substrate degradation aulenta et al 2007 3 5 2 bioaugmentation if native communities in contaminated sites lack sufficient populations of pollution degraders microorganisms with the expected functions can be added exogenously through a process called bioaugmentation cosgrove et al 2010 microorganisms with population dominance have a strong ability to compete for electrons ueno et al 2006 numerous studies have been conducted to improve the dechlorination performance by injecting dechlorinating microbial consortium in contaminated sites lendvay et al 2003 major et al 2002 at the bachman site lendvay et al 2003 found that 92 of the chlorinated ethenes were successfully degraded to ethane after 43 days of inoculation of exogenous dechlorination bacteria however the feasibility of this technology is limited by the nature of the site and the structure of the indigenous microorganism community bento et al 2005 4 integrated zvi fab remediation system 4 1 coupling mechanisms involved in zvi fab system in previous research the removal rate and efficiency of pollutants were enhanced by the joint application of zvi and fab huang et al 2017 kirschling et al 2010 zhao et al 2018 zhong et al 2017 the fundamental degradation mechanisms of the investigated contaminants by the zvi fab coupled system can be synoptically summarized as follows 1 as a reductant zvi can directly participate in the chemical reduction of contaminants and degrade them into non toxic or less toxic products 2 the corrosion of zvi can reduce the oxidation reduction potential orp and neutralize the ph which can create an appropriate environment for the fab to maintain their degradation ability 3 the h2 released by the reaction of zvi with water is an effective electron donor necessary for the reduction of contaminants by hydrogenotrophic bacteria wang et al 2016 xiu et al 2010b 4 microorganisms can degrade the intermediates produced in the chemical reduction stage of zvi thoroughly xu et al 2014 5 passivators on the surface of zvi and viscous polysaccharides on the microorganisms can be used as sorbents or coagulants for contaminant removal in the past two decades a series of studies have been carried out to combine the zvi with dechlorination microorganisms for the remediation of cah contaminated plumes xie et al 2017 lampron et al 1998 were the first to indicate that abiotic and biotic dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes can be combined to improve the remediation efficiency subsequent studies lee et al 2001 rosenthal et al 2004 wang and tseng 2009 demonstrated the feasibility and reaction mechanism of combined degradation of tce by composite systems despite the collaborative pathways discussed above to promote dechlorination in the coupled system the mutually inhibitory interactions between zvi and fab could not be completely ignored under high concentrations zvi can destroy cell structure and cause cell surface stress reactions to cause toxicity to microorganisms previous studies have shown that the zvi toxicity to dechlorination microorganisms could be observed when the concentration of nzvi was higher than 0 1 g l 1 xiu et al 2010a found that zvi could inhibit the expression of the reductive dehalogenase genes tcea and vcra it is therefore evident that more comprehensive and focused research is needed to elucidate to what extent the relative concentrations of zvi vs fab should be kept to reach an optimal coupling effect furthermore applications with differently sized zvis and at variable parameters would result in distinct reactive lifetime of zvis subsequently changing the h2 production yields and sustainability this would affect the meaningful interactions between zvi and fab and is yet to be explored in depth 4 2 electron distribution in the integrated zvi fab remediation system 4 2 1 electron distribution between abiotic and biotic processes the reductive attenuation of chlorinated ethenes in anaerobic environments can be accomplished through biotic and abiotic processes including reductive dechlorination β elimination α elimination and hydrogenation liang et al 2007 roberts et al 1996 while abiotic and biotic transformations may proceed at different rates in the field they should be quantified and distinguished to identify rate limiting steps with microbial mediated reductive dichlorination it is generally difficult to achieve the complete degradation of chlorinated ethenes using a single microorganism because it involves a sequential synergistic degradation by a variety of microorganisms so the products of reductive dechlorination process are diverse for example the pce degradation products observed in microbial systems include tce dce vc and ethane ellis et al 2000 muchitsch et al 2011 conversely abiotic reduction based on zvi has been shown to achieve complete dechlorination to ethane ethene or acetylene elsner et al 2008 kaifas et al 2014 acetylene and ethane which are formed via dichloroelimination are exact biodechlorination indicators arnold and roberts 2000 but are hard to track owing to their volatility and biodegradability mao et al 2017a vanstone et al 2008 in addition although dce and vc accumulation occurs during the biotic dechlorination process they can be further reduced by abiotic agents such as fe0 fe2 etc in groundwater so their concentrations cannot be used to calculate the electron flux involved in biological degradation therefore it is not feasible to distinguish biotic or abiotic processes based on products and more advanced evaluation technique is required compound specific isotope analysis csia could potentially provide supportive evidence for accurately distinguishing abiotic and biotic pollutant degradation pathways audí miró et al 2015 leitner et al 2017 rodríguez fernández et al 2015 the basic principle of this technology is that chlorinated ethenes with light carbon isotopes 12c can break chemical bonds faster than chlorinated ethenes with heavy carbon isotopes 13c owing to their lower activation energy fischer et al 2016 elsner and imfeld 2016 in a previous study during transformation the remaining and unreacted cahs containing heavy isotopes enriched continuously which resulted in isotope fractionation the ratio of heavy to light isotopes e g 13c 12c is called the isotope ratio or isotope signature and can be expressed using the delta notation δsample according to eq 15 fischer et al 2016 coplen 2011 15 δ s a m p l e r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d 1 where rsample is the isotope ratio of the sample and rstandard is an international standard for the isotope ratio the isotope fractionation ε indicates the extent to which the isotope ratio e g 13c 12c of the average of products is smaller negative values or larger positive values than that of its precursors centler et al 2013 elsner and imfeld 2016 liang et al 2007 and wilkin et al 2018 found different isotopic fractionation patterns during abiotic and biotic processes and considered ε as an indicator of the type of degradation however numerous studies reported the ranges of ε for two pathways overlap which indicates that ε obtained only by measuring the respective c isotope fractionations is not precise in differentiating between abiotic and biotic dichlorination audí miró et al 2013 this discrimination can be achieved by dual element isotope analysis technology e g c and cl csia badin et al 2014 2016 doğan subaşı et al 2017 this method is based on the change of the dual element isotope slope δ13c δ37cl which reflects the effects of both elements on the isotope palau et al 2014 2016 different slopes may result from different transition mechanisms involving different bonds and elements elsner 2010 abe et al 2009 reported a slope c cl of 12 5 for microbial mediated cis dce dechlorination which is significantly different from the slope of 3 1 calculated by audí miró et al 2013 in a study of cis dec reduction with the participation of zvi 4 2 2 electron competition between chlorinated hydrocarbons and co existing electron acceptors in the composite system the inhibition of co existing electron acceptors on dechlorination is reduced through four main mechanisms 1 the production of h2 due to the competition of h2o for electrons can be utilized continuously by the microorganism as a secondary electron donor in the coupled system 2 oxygen can be consumed by facultative bacteria in a mixed culture through respiration reducing the competition of oxygen for electrons released by fe0 yin et al 2012a 3 as the majority of the do is consumed only residual traces of o2 could react with iron corrosion products producing lower amounts of non reactive ferric oxides thus the electron transport inhibition of iron oxides is diminished fig 4 deng et al 2016 yin et al 2012a 4 the biotoxicity of co existing electron acceptors and their products is reduced for example the toxic effects of sulfide the bio reductive product of sulfates on microorganisms are alleviated by co precipitation with fe2 to form fes kohn et al 2005 yoon et al 2011 fig 4 however currently not much has been published so far on the electron competition in the coupled system with only cases of competition from do and h2o available gaps in understanding the effects of more co existing electron acceptors and synergistic electron competition from both systems remain in addition although it has been recognized that the electron selectivity can be potentially enhanced in the coupled system compared with in single system the challenge is to optimize the dechlorination efficiency and electron selectivity simultaneously based on site specific engineering designs 5 conclusions and future research needs we reviewed and summarized the literatures on electron competition and electron selectivity in abiotic biotic and coupled systems for dechlorinating cahs in groundwater from the review we can draw the following conclusions 1 in the zvi system no3 o2 and h2o are the dominant electron competitors with cahs electron utilization efficiency and selectivity has been quantitatively described with pe src and ee the competitiveness of these co existing electron acceptors should be evaluated from both the thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives at present the widely developed measures for enhancing the electron selectivity of the zvi system include the sulfidation of iron the application of a wmf and the dosing of fe2 2 in the fab system mainly no3 so4 2 fe iii and hco3 are involved in the electron competition with cahs both the type and amount of electron acceptors and electron donors affect electron selectivity which can be quantitatively characterized by electron recovery and electron balance analyses in practical applications of the fab system artificial addition of exogenous functional microorganisms and slow fermenting exogenous organic substrates are effective measures to enhance electron selectivity 3 the recently developed zvi fab coupled system enhances the dechlorination performance in this system electron selectivity is improved by increasing the utilization efficiency of excess h2 alleviating the competition of o2 inhibiting zvi passivation to facilitate electron transfer and decreasing the biotoxicity although much information about electron selectivity and electron competition has been summarized it remains incompletely understood and various restrictions are still present to fill these knowledge gaps more relevant investigations are needed in future research 1 even though there are available data that can be used to provide insights into the electron competition in abiotic and biotic dechlorination systems quantitative research on electron selectivity is still in its infancy more data quantifying the electron equivalents or ee should be collected to establish a more exhaustive database the integration of these data into a mathematical model will contribute to a more powerful model to predict the in situ remediation dynamics 2 previous studies on the effects of the co existing electron acceptors on dechlorination performance or ee were mostly based on batch scale experiments that only considered one co existing electron acceptor however in real systems multiple electron acceptors co exist which may dramatically complicate the electron competition mechanisms involved therefore it is necessary to quantitatively investigate the electron distribution among multiple electron acceptors under natural hydrogeochemical conditions 3 compared with the single abiotic or biotic systems the composition of electron donors and electron acceptors in the zvi fab composite system is more complicated the available literature only addresses the differentiation of biotic abiotic degradation processes quantitatively furthermore there are diversified electron donors including zvi hydrogen and small organic matter molecules as well as different electron acceptors including no3 so4 2 do h2o fe iii and hco3 a complete explanation of the electron flow in a composite system requires a combination of multiple analytical techniques such as stable isotope probing product identification and mass balance analysis 4 measures to improve electron selectivity remain to be developed and the mechanisms involved must be further elucidated for example the application of sulfated zvi can effectively prevent the corrosion of zvi by h2o but whether this method is equally effective in reducing electron competition from other electron acceptors is not yet understood in addition the feasibility of this enhancement technology under real conditions should also be considered measures to enhance electron selectivity in fab systems such as bioaugmentation and biostimulation can also effectively enhance degradation performance however in engineering applications a series of practical problems remain to be considered for example bioclogging problems caused by exogenous electron donors or exogenous microorganisms increased economic costs and the adaptability and viability of exogenous microorganisms declaration of competing

17732,understanding the influences of cations on membrane fouling was important to improve the performance of membrane filtration system however opposite conclusions were made in different studies meanwhile although the influences of cation concentration have been studied extensively few attentions have been paid to the cation valence to clarify it the effects of typical cations on membrane fouling and cleaning as well as the related mechanisms were investigated systemically in this study k and ca2 were chosen as the representative cations and humic acid ha was chosen as the membrane foulants the results demonstrated ca2 promoted the formation of reversible fouling meanwhile higher removal efficiency of ha could also be achieved with the assistance of filtration cake containing ha ca2 however k led to the formation of more recalcitrant irreversible fouling by comparing the concentration of cations in feed and permeate analyzing the influence of cations on size of ha flocs and the detailed sem afm and tem observation it could be found that different mechanisms dominated the interaction between cations and ha the bridging effect induced by ca2 attributed to the extension of ha molecules while the electrostatic shielding effect induced by k led to the compression of them moreover the different characteristics of hydrated ca2 and k also contributed to the different structures of foulant layers formed by ha ca2 and ha k given the abundance of k and ca2 in natural water results of this study can provide valuable advice for practical membrane filtration process graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane fouling cations electrostatic shielding hydration 1 introduction compared with traditional treatment methods such as adsorption coagulation oxidation and biodegradation membrane technology with high removal efficiency of emerging pollutants has been drawn more and more attention as the new type of advanced water treatment process dharupaneedi et al 2019 during long term operation regular membrane cleaning is necessary to restore membrane flux shan et al 2016 for irreversible fouling that cannot be removed by physical cleaning methods the conventional chemical cleaning method is still used most widely porcelli and judd 2010 however it exhibits several limitations in practical membrane cleaning process in terms of the risk of membrane surface damage and the serious waste of cleaning agents in order to solve these problems a new type of h2o2 mno2 membrane cleaning system was developed in our previous study he et al 2019a by the free radicals generated from catalytic decomposition of h2o2 and the turbulence caused by the generated abundant oxygen the new membrane cleaning system could wash the irreversible membrane fouling caused by humic acid ha with much higher cleaning efficiency than the conventional chemical cleaning method ha was the main type of membrane foulants for drinking water treatment ma et al 2019 in the environment ha molecules can capture a considerable amount of pollutants thereby reducing the degradation and neutralization of pollutants and the aggregates of ha also provide a large number of binding sites for metals fertilizers etc wang et al 2013 although the transportation behavior of has may follow some established trends of organic matters their physical and chemical properties are changed fundamentally in the presence of cations recent studies have well explored effects of ions on membrane fouling and the thermodynamic mechanism was proposed you et al 2020 on the one hand the stability among ha molecules was contributed to the electrostatic repulsion caused by amounts of negatively charged groups in ha molecules tang et al 2011 the conformation and size of ha molecules can be changed considerably with the addition of cations by the electrostatic interaction between negatively charged groups and cations thus affecting the fouling of ultrafiltration membrane by ha shao et al 2011 in this case membrane fouling should be caused by foulant adhesion and foulant layer formation cake and or gel layer teng et al 2019 on the other hand ha is amphiphilic with hydrophobic aromatic structure and carboxyl groups constituting the hydrophilic part which can form relatively weak aggregates the hydration layer of cations may also play a role in their transportation through membrane pores borisover and graber 2004 up to now studies about the effects of cationic electrostatic interaction on membrane filtration have been carried out verliefde et al 2008 however opposite conclusions were made in different studies corbatón báguena proposed that due to the combination of ions with ha the particle size of foulants will be increased which is prone to deposition and blockage on the membrane surface and pores causing further membrane fouling corbatón báguena et al 2015 while miao found that the membrane fouling could be mitigated significantly at higher ca2 or mg2 concentrations miao et al it is also noteworthy that most of previous studies are focused on the influences of ion concentration on the aggregation and ion binding of ha hakim et al 2019 kloster et al 2013 wang et al 2013 however few attentions have been paid to the valence of inorganic ions which may also affect the solubility structure and colloidal state of ha and control the density of foulant layer formed on the surface of the membrane meanwhile the studies about ha usually use feed with high concentration of background electrolytes in the range of 1 5 m which is reasonable for industrial wastewater treatment buchs et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 however it is not suitable for drinking water treatment where ion concentration is generally low therefore it is still necessary to clearly clarify the influences of cations on membrane fouling caused by ha and the following cleaning process of the fouled membrane given the fact that k and ca2 account for about 51 71 of the total cations in natural water huang et al 2009 in this study they were selected to investigate mechanisms about influences of cations on the filtration process of ha by pes membrane the changes in membrane flux and the structural characteristics of the foulants layer the effects of electrostatic interaction and hydration forces on membrane fouling and membrane cleaning by h2o2 mno2 system were analyzed in depth the results not only provide the micro scaled analysis about the influences of hydrated cations on membrane fouling by ha but also provide suggestions for practical water treatment process to prevent and control membrane fouling 2 material and methods 2 1 material and experimental setup the polyethersulfone flat membrane pes molecular weight cut off 30 kda diameter 80 mm was purchased from mosu science equipment co ltd shanghai chemicals including humic acid ha h2o2 mno2 kcl cacl2 and other chemical reagents were all analytical reagents purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china and directly used in the experiments without further purification ha solution with an initial concentration of 6 2 mg c l was prepared by dissolving solid ha in milli q water at ph 9 adjusted by sodium hydroxide kcl and cacl2 were added to the prepared ha solution to make ha k and ha ca2 solutions with ion concentration of 10 mm in the filtration experiment the trans membrane pressure tmp was remained at 0 1 mpa permeate was collected and weighted online by a digital balance the permeation flux could be calculated based on the collected permeate volume filtration time and membrane area firstly the permeation flux of clean membrane was measured with deionized water di water which was 70 l m 2 h 1 under 0 1 mpa then the prepared ha ha k and ha ca2 solutions were used to challenge the membrane without recycling and the fouling experiment was performed for about 6 0 h the filtration experiment was completed when the permeation flux of the fouled membrane decreased to about 65 of the clean one for membrane cleaning similar procedures to our previous study were utilized he et al 2019b generally the fouled membrane was firstly rinsed by deionized water thoroughly for 10 min to remove the reversible fouling and the membrane flux at this moment was measured to calculate the irreversible membrane fouling resistance r i r r then it was immersed in 90 ml h2o2 solution 0 5 wt containing 25 mg mno2 particles for further chemical cleaning which lasted for 5 min finally the membrane was taken out from the h2o2 solution and washed with di water again to remove any remaining chemicals from the surface and permeation flux of the washed membrane was measured again with di water at least three parallel experiments were conducted under each experimental condition the recovery efficiency of membrane flux was defined as 1 e j a j 0 100 where j a was the membrane flux l m 2 h 1 after cleaning in h2o2 mno2 system j 0 was the membrane flux l m 2 h 1 of clean membrane filtration efficiency of ha could be described as follows 2 f e c l e a n f o u l e d w a s h e d c 0 c c l e a n f o u l e d w a s h e d c 0 where f e c l e a n f e f o u l e d f e w a s h e

n c f o u l e d c w a s h e d was the toc of permeate for the corresponded membrane mg l the detailed information for the process of the filtration experiments was shown in table 1 2 2 analytic methods total organic carbon values were measured by a toc analyzer apg basisgerät analytik jena ag moreover icp oes analysis periknelmer 8300010403 was also conducted to measure the concentration of cations in feed and permeate scanning electron microscope sem quanta 200feg fei and atomic force microscopy afm bioscope resolution 030118 bruker were used to characterize the membrane surface before and after cleaning all tested samples were dried for 24 h before analysis to observe the morphological and structural changes of ha in the presence of k and ca2 ha particles were observed by transmission electron microscopy tem jem1400010101 the particle size distribution of ha flocs in water with the existence of different cations were also tested by the marvin laser particle size analyzer mastersizer2000 to determine the changes in mean particle size of ha flocs caused by cations in order to evaluate the membrane resistance caused by fouling layer adsorption and concentration polarization resistances the total membrane resistance could be calculated by equation 3 3 r m r f r m r r e v r i r r δ p μ j where δ p is the transmembrane pressure tmp pa μ is the dynamic viscosity coefficient of feed solution j is the membrane flux l m 2 h 1 r m is the resistance of the clean membrane 1 m r f is the total fouling resistance 1 m including reversible fouling resistance r r e v 1 m and irreversible fouling resistance r i r r 1 m 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of k and ca2 on membrane cleaning efficiency as shown in fig 1 a the pes membranes were contaminated by the feed of ha ha ca2 and ha k respectively until permeate flux decreased to 66 68 of the clean membranes after rinsing the fouled membrane by di water to remove the reversible fouling the permeate flux was recovered to 74 79 and 71 for ha ha ca2 ha k respectively the higher flux recovery efficiency for the case of ha ca2 than that of ha alone indicated that the addition of ca2 might increase the aggregation of ha molecules through bridging mechanism leading to the increase of total fouling resistance and reversible membrane resistance lin et al 2015 on the contrary the flux recovery efficiency for the case of ha k was lower than that of ha alone indicating that the addition of k ions might reduce the reversible membrane fouling after 5 min of membrane cleaning in the h2o2 mno2 system the final flux recovery efficiency for the cases of ha ca2 and ha alone were comparable with each other at the value of 97 and prominently higher than that of ha k which was only 89 the results implied that the addition of k significantly increased the irreversible membrane fouling and part of which was even recalcitrant to chemical cleaning the corresponded membrane resistance was shown in fig 1b compared with loading the membrane by ha alone the existence of both ca2 and k increased the r f moreover the addition of ca2 reduced irreversible fouling resistance and increased the reversible fouling resistance however the effects of k were opposite to that of ca2 the results were consistent with fig 1a 3 2 effects of k and ca2 on filtration efficiency of ha fig 2 demonstrated the effects of ca2 and k on the filtration efficiency of ha it showed that at the beginning of the filtration experiment the existence of both ca2 and k inhibited the filtration efficiency of ha by the clean membrane it could be attributed to the electrostatic shielding effect caused by ca2 and k which reduced the extension degree and size of ha flocs resulting in the decline of filtration efficiency of ha murphy et al 1994 electrostatic shielding effect was caused by electrostatic force under neutral condition the negative charge of deprotonated carboxyl groups and phenolic hydroxyl groups on ha surface tended to increase electrostatic repulsion between has leading to a larger size of ha the presence of k played a role in charge neutralization which significantly decreased electronegativity of the negatively charged functional groups between has resulting in the reduction of the extension degree and size of ha flocs for ca2 besides the electrostatic shielding effect the filtration cake contributing to ha removal was also started to setup at the beginning of filtration experiment owing to the complexation between ca2 and ha molecules li and elimelech 2004a compared to k ca2 could neutralize negative charge more effectively and therefore have a greater effect on reducing repulsion li and elimelech 2004b since the cake layer hadn t yet formed at the beginning of filtration the electrostatic shielding effect of ca2 might inhibit the filtration efficiency of ha at that stage for k the electrostatic shielding effect on ha molecules was dominant for the interaction between k and ha molecules thus the filtration efficiency of ha for the case of ha k was reduced more prominently seidel and elimelech 2002 yuan and zydney 1999 at the end of filtration the filtration efficiency of ha by fouled membranes demonstrated different trend compared with the clean membranes it could be seen that for fouled membranes higher filtration efficiency of ha could be achieved for the case of ha ca2 than that of ha alone owing to the mentioned complexation between ca2 and ha to form filtration cake through the bridging effect of ca2 hakim et al 2019 the contribution of filtration cake on ha removal was related to the characteristics of it which could be analyzed by sem and afm images discussed in the following section however the addition of k always led to the lower filtration efficiency of ha for both clean and fouled membranes indicating that electrostatic shielding effect always played the dominant role and the univalent k ions could not exhibited effective bridging effect on ha as the bivalent ca2 ions did nguyen and chen 2007 for the membranes being washed by h2o2 mno2 system f e w a s h e d were recovered to values comparable with those of the clean membranes for both ha ca2 and ha alone however for ha k the filtration efficiency of ha by the washed membrane was similar to that of fouled membrane while was higher than that of the clean membrane it might be because the foulants containing k exhibited stronger adhesion to the membrane surface however the lamellar foulants formed with the existence of ca2 had weaker adhesion and was relatively easy to be removed wang et al 2014 moreover as mentioned above the electrostatic shielding effect of k could reduce the size of the ha flocs when the ha molecules with reduced size passed through the membrane part of them could still be adsorbed inside of the membrane holes tian et al 2010 leading to the formation of irreversible membrane fouling which was even hard to be removed by the h2o2 mno2 system moreover the electrostatic interactions could control the formation and structure of the hydration layer surrounding the ions and ca2 could coordinate more water molecules around it than k teychené et al 2019 it has also been proved that the hydration layer formed by the hydration of ca2 could coat on the surface of ha molecules miao et al 2017 more insight into the nature of ion hydration can be gained by considering the average time that water molecules remain bound to ions for k the residence times of water molecules in the primary hydration shells is about 10 9 s divalent cations are always more strongly solvated than monovalent cations for ca2 lifetime of the bound water is about 10 8 10 6s which is about hundreds times longer than that of k israelachvili 2015 furthermore owing to the binding between water molecules and cations ion water complex is formed with fixed stoichiometry the hydration number of k is 3 while ca2 has a hydration number of 6 leading to greater hydration repulsion induced by ca2 in the ha foulants israelachvili 2015 as shown in fig 3 when ha surfaces coated with hydrated ions are getting close to each other dehydration will be occurred for hydrated ions it has been known that divalent cation demonstrated stronger hydration than monovalent cation thio et al 2012 so the dehydration of ca2 will be less prominent than that of k for interactions among ha molecules considering the fact that hydration repulsion and the steric hindrance effect induced by hydrated ions can compensate with the van der waals force butt et al 2005 kilpatrick et al 2013 valle delgado et al 2011 it can be deduced that the foulant layer containing ca2 will demonstrate looser and more porous structure which can be verified by the results of afm and tem images discussed in the following sections furthermore the proposed loose and porous filtration cake of ha ca2 may have higher capacity for ha removal and be easier to be removed compared with that of ha k which was consistent with the experimental results shown in figs 1 and 2 to illustrate the electrostatic shielding effect of k collins developed the concept of water affinities matching oppositely charged ions in free solution form inner sphere ion pairs spontaneously only when they have equal water affinities collins 2004 according to collins explanation soft ions which have large radius and are prone to deformation prefer to stick with each other closely and hard ions which have small radius and high charge density follow the same pattern gong 2013 it has been proved that carboxylate in has was the hardest among a series of anionic headgroups vlachy et al 2009 and k was harder than ca2 so k would demonstrated closer contact with carboxylate groups in has than ca2 although it is not enough to describe dehydration of k completely and accurately with this simple model the concept is helpful to understand electrostatic shielding of k for ha the dehydration of k could also be explained by its distance from the oxygen atoms in the water molecule by conducting the neutron and x ray diffraction of k in water it showed that the k oxygen distance was longer than the water oxygen oxygen distance indicative of weak hydration and strong dehydration for k while the ca2 oxygen distance was much shorter than the water oxygen oxygen distance indicative of stronger hydration for ca2 collins 2004 thus it could be deduced that the ability of k to reduce the expansion of ha molecules is stronger than that of ca2 conclusively k demonstrates closer contact with carboxylate groups in ha molecule than ca2 leading to a denser foulant layer formed by ha k than that of ha ca2 besides the mentioned mechanisms hydrophobic interaction may also affect membrane fouling yin et al 2020 while the detailed mechanisms for the influences of ions on membrane fouling by changing the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of ha are still unclear and mostly qualitative further researches are still needed 3 3 microscopic analyses of membrane structure 3 3 1 sem images for membrane surface the surface morphologies of clean membrane fig 4 a and b fouled membrane after rinsing by di water fig 4c and d and membrane washed by h2o2 mno2 system fig 4e and f were further investigated by sem although di water could reduce reversible fouling on the membrane it could be observed that considerable foulants were still deposited on its surface fig 4c and d moreover compared with ha k the filtration cake formed by ha ca2 appeared to be more compacted and covered the whole area of the membrane surface when the fouled membrane was washed by h2o2 mno2 system for 5 min it could be clearly seen that the surface of membrane contaminated by ha ca2 was recovered with almost no irreversible residues fig 4e however the residual irreversible fouling of ha k on the surface of membrane could still be observed distinctly even after the chemical washing by h2o2 mno2 system fig 4f 3 3 2 high resolution afm observation for the surface structures further afm measurement was utilized to observe the topography and roughness changes of pes membrane compared with the clean membrane fig 5 a and b the distribution of irreversible foulants on the surface of fouled membranes were non uniform and lumpy fig 5c and d leading to a significant increase of the surface roughness after being washed by h2o2 mno2 system the membrane contaminated by ha ca2 was basically recovered to be smooth fig 5e while amounts of gelatinic spots representing residual irreversible foulants could still be observed clearly on the surface of membrane contaminated by ha k fig 5f which was similar to the results obtained by sem as parameters to quantitatively describe the surface roughness of the membrane root mean square surface roughness rq and mean surface roughness ra were also calculated and listed in table 2 the results showed that rq ra increased from 7 1 5 4 nm to 491 402 nm when the membrane was contaminated and significantly recovered to 66 8 38 6 nm after being washed by the h2o2 mno2 system a similar trend was also observed in ha k contaminated membranes the corresponding afm section analysis in the supporting data also clearly revealed the effectiveness of membrane cleaning 3 4 interaction between cations and ha 3 4 1 analysis of ca2 and k in feed and permeate concentrations of ca2 and k in feed and permeate were measured by icp oes to further explore the interaction between ha and cations with the results shown in fig 6 it could be seen that at the early stage of filtration it was reasonable that almost no cations were removed by the clean ultrafiltration membrane when the membrane was fouled by ha k or ha ca2 for the case of ha k almost all k could still penetrate through the fouled membrane with filtration cake on the surface however for the case of ha ca2 about 15 of ca2 could be collected by the fouled membrane it could be deduced that the complexation between ca2 and ha promoted the collection of ca2 on the filtration cake and more ca2 accumulation further promoted the growth of filtration cake through bridging effect which could be confirmed by the sem images the elemental composition of the membrane surface was also analyzed by the sem eds method as shown in fig 7 there was almost no signal of k on the membrane surface fouled by ha k however the peak of ca2 8 4 was distinct for the case of ha ca2 the sem eds results were consistent with that of icp oes analysis demonstrating that the retention of ca2 by the membrane was significantly higher than that of k 3 4 2 influences of ca2 and k on the size of ha flocs fig 8 demonstrated the size distributions of particles within the feeds containing ha alone ha k and ha ca2 respectively for ha alone the mean size of ha flocs was about 39 μm for the case of the ha k the particle size distribution exhibited double peaks with the mean size of ha flocs being reduced to 11 μm for the case of ha ca2 part of the ha flocs was compressed compared with the condition of ha alone while more ha flocs were expanded resulting in the enhancement of mean particle size to 200 μm the results revealed that both k and ca2 ions could compress the size of negatively charged ha molecules through the electrostatic shielding effect leading to the reduction of molecule extension and size of ha flocs however the bridging effect of ca2 ions on ha was much stronger than the electrostatic effect resulting in the formation of larger ha flocs 3 4 3 tem analysis of surface morphology of ha ha k and ha ca2 flocs tem images for ha ha k and ha ca2 flocs were shown in fig 9 fig 9a and b showed that the flocs formed by ha molecules alone were loose and the edges were not clear under tem imaging with the existence of ca2 as shown in fig 9c and d the structure of flocs was more fragmented and edges of the flocs could be recognized clearly the results revealed that the bridging effect of ca2 could promote the aggregation of ha molecules however as shown in fig 9e and f the existence of k led to the prominent compression and cleavage of flocs owing to the strong electrostatic shielding effect induced by k to reduce the negative charge of ha molecules 4 conclusion in this study the influences of typical cations ca2 and k on the membrane fouling and cleaning process as well as the related mechanisms was studied systemically compared with the membrane fouled by ha alone the combined effects of electrostatic shielding and bridging induced by ca2 led to the formation of more reversible foulants and higher filtration efficiency of ha by the fouled membrane however for k only electrostatic shielding effect dominated the interactions between k and ha resulting in more recalcitrant irreversible foulants and lower filtration efficiency of ha by the fouled membrane moreover the different characteristics of hydrated ca2 and k also contributed to the different structures of foulant layers formed by ha ca2 and ha k considering the fact that ca2 and k are the dominant cations in natural water results of this study can provide valuable advice for practical membrane filtration process attentions should be paid to the condition of high concentration of k in feed because it will cause more serious irreversible fouling and shorten the lifetime of membrane while ca2 in feed may attribute to the pollutant removal and alleviating the formation of irreversible fouling declaration of competing interest the authors

fouling and cleaning as well as the related mechanisms were investigated systemically in this study k and ca2 were chosen as the representative cations and humic acid ha was chosen as the membrane foulants the results demonstrated ca2 promoted the formation of reversible fouling meanwhile higher removal efficiency of ha could also be achieved with the assistance of filtration cake containing ha ca2 however k led to the formation of more recalcitrant irreversible fouling by comparing the concentration of cations in feed and permeate analyzing the influence of cations on size of ha flocs and the detailed sem afm and tem observation it could be found that different mechanisms dominated the interaction between cations and ha the bridging effect induced by ca2 attributed to the extension of ha molecules while the electrostatic shielding effect induced by k led to the compression of them moreover the different characteristics of hydrated ca2 and k also contributed to the different structures of foulant layers formed by ha ca2 and ha k given the abundance of k and ca2 in natural water results of this study can provide valuable advice for practical membrane filtration process graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane fouling cations electrostatic shielding hydration 1 introduction compared with traditional treatment methods such as adsorption coagulation oxidation and biodegradation membrane technology with high removal efficiency of emerging pollutants has been drawn more and more attention as the new type of advanced water treatment process dharupaneedi et al 2019 during long term operation regular membrane cleaning is necessary to restore membrane flux shan et al 2016 for irreversible fouling that cannot be removed by physical cleaning methods the conventional chemical cleaning method is still used most widely porcelli and judd 2010 however it exhibits several limitations in practical membrane cleaning process in terms of the risk of membrane surface damage and the serious waste of cleaning agents in order to solve these problems a new type of h2o2 mno2 membrane cleaning system was developed in our previous study he et al 2019a by the free radicals generated from catalytic decomposition of h2o2 and the turbulence caused by the generated abundant oxygen the new membrane cleaning system could wash the irreversible membrane fouling caused by humic acid ha with much higher cleaning efficiency than the conventional chemical cleaning method ha was the main type of membrane foulants for drinking water treatment ma et al 2019 in the environment ha molecules can capture a considerable amount of pollutants thereby reducing the degradation and neutralization of pollutants and the aggregates of ha also provide a large number of binding sites for metals fertilizers etc wang et al 2013 although the transportation behavior of has may follow some established trends of organic matters their physical and chemical properties are changed fundamentally in the presence of cations recent studies have well explored effects of ions on membrane fouling and the thermodynamic mechanism was proposed you et al 2020 on the one hand the stability among ha molecules was contributed to the electrostatic repulsion caused by amounts of negatively charged groups in ha molecules tang et al 2011 the conformation and size of ha molecules can be changed considerably with the addition of cations by the electrostatic interaction between negatively charged groups and cations thus affecting the fouling of ultrafiltration membrane by ha shao et al 2011 in this case membrane fouling should be caused by foulant adhesion and foulant layer formation cake and or gel layer teng et al 2019 on the other hand ha is amphiphilic with hydrophobic aromatic structure and carboxyl groups constituting the hydrophilic part which can form relatively weak aggregates the hydration layer of cations may also play a role in their transportation through membrane pores borisover and graber 2004 up to now studies about the effects of cationic electrostatic interaction on membrane filtration have been carried out verliefde et al 2008 however opposite conclusions were made in different studies corbatón báguena proposed that due to the combination of ions with ha the particle size of foulants will be increased which is prone to deposition and blockage on the membrane surface and pores causing further membrane fouling corbatón báguena et al 2015 while miao found that the membrane fouling could be mitigated significantly at higher ca2 or mg2 concentrations miao et al it is also noteworthy that most of previous studies are focused on the influences of ion concentration on the aggregation and ion binding of ha hakim et al 2019 kloster et al 2013 wang et al 2013 however few attentions have been paid to the valence of inorganic ions which may also affect the solubility structure and colloidal state of ha and control the density of foulant layer formed on the surface of the membrane meanwhile the studies about ha usually use feed with high concentration of background electrolytes in the range of 1 5 m which is reasonable for industrial wastewater treatment buchs et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 however it is not suitable for drinking water treatment where ion concentration is generally low therefore it is still necessary to clearly clarify the influences of cations on membrane fouling caused by ha and the following cleaning process of the fouled membrane given the fact that k and ca2 account for about 51 71 of the total cations in natural water huang et al 2009 in this study they were selected to investigate mechanisms about influences of cations on the filtration process of ha by pes membrane the changes in membrane flux and the structural characteristics of the foulants layer the effects of electrostatic interaction and hydration forces on membrane fouling and membrane cleaning by h2o2 mno2 system were analyzed in depth the results not only provide the micro scaled analysis about the influences of hydrated cations on membrane fouling by ha but also provide suggestions for practical water treatment process to prevent and control membrane fouling 2 material and methods 2 1 material and experimental setup the polyethersulfone flat membrane pes molecular weight cut off 30 kda diameter 80 mm was purchased from mosu science equipment co ltd shanghai chemicals including humic acid ha h2o2 mno2 kcl cacl2 and other chemical reagents were all analytical reagents purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china and directly used in the experiments without further purification ha solution with an initial concentration of 6 2 mg c l was prepared by dissolving solid ha in milli q water at ph 9 adjusted by sodium hydroxide kcl and cacl2 were added to the prepared ha solution to make ha k and ha ca2 solutions with ion concentration of 10 mm in the filtration experiment the trans membrane pressure tmp was remained at 0 1 mpa permeate was collected and weighted online by a digital balance the permeation flux could be calculated based on the collected permeate volume filtration time and membrane area firstly the permeation flux of clean membrane was measured with deionized water di water which was 70 l m 2 h 1 under 0 1 mpa then the prepared ha ha k and ha ca2 solutions were used to challenge the membrane without recycling and the fouling experiment was performed for about 6 0 h the filtration experiment was completed when the permeation flux of the fouled membrane decreased to about 65 of the clean one for membrane cleaning similar procedures to our previous study were utilized he et al 2019b generally the fouled membrane was firstly rinsed by deionized water thoroughly for 10 min to remove the reversible fouling and the membrane flux at this moment was measured to calculate the irreversible membrane fouling resistance r i r r then it was immersed in 90 ml h2o2 solution 0 5 wt containing 25 mg mno2 particles for further chemical cleaning which lasted for 5 min finally the membrane was taken out from the h2o2 solution and washed with di water again to remove any remaining chemicals from the surface and permeation flux of the washed membrane was measured again with di water at least three parallel experiments were conducted under each experimental condition the recovery efficiency of membrane flux was defined as 1 e j a j 0 100 where j a was the membrane flux l m 2 h 1 after cleaning in h2o2 mno2 system j 0 was the membrane flux l m 2 h 1 of clean membrane filtration efficiency of ha could be described as follows 2 f e c l e a n f o u l e d w a s h e d c 0 c c l e a n f o u l e d w a s h e d c 0 where f e c l e a n f e f o u l e d f e w a s h e

n c f o u l e d c w a s h e d was the toc of permeate for the corresponded membrane mg l the detailed information for the process of the filtration experiments was shown in table 1 2 2 analytic methods total organic carbon values were measured by a toc analyzer apg basisgerät analytik jena ag moreover icp oes analysis periknelmer 8300010403 was also conducted to measure the concentration of cations in feed and permeate scanning electron microscope sem quanta 200feg fei and atomic force microscopy afm bioscope resolution 030118 bruker were used to characterize the membrane surface before and after cleaning all tested samples were dried for 24 h before analysis to observe the morphological and structural changes of ha in the presence of k and ca2 ha particles were observed by transmission electron microscopy tem jem1400010101 the particle size distribution of ha flocs in water with the existence of different cations were also tested by the marvin laser particle size analyzer mastersizer2000 to determine the changes in mean particle size of ha flocs caused by cations in order to evaluate the membrane resistance caused by fouling layer adsorption and concentration polarization resistances the total membrane resistance could be calculated by equation 3 3 r m r f r m r r e v r i r r δ p μ j where δ p is the transmembrane pressure tmp pa μ is the dynamic viscosity coefficient of feed solution j is the membrane flux l m 2 h 1 r m is the resistance of the clean membrane 1 m r f is the total fouling resistance 1 m including reversible fouling resistance r r e v 1 m and irreversible fouling resistance r i r r 1 m 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of k and ca2 on membrane cleaning efficiency as shown in fig 1 a the pes membranes were contaminated by the feed of ha ha ca2 and ha k respectively until permeate flux decreased to 66 68 of the clean membranes after rinsing the fouled membrane by di water to remove the reversible fouling the permeate flux was recovered to 74 79 and 71 for ha ha ca2 ha k respectively the higher flux recovery efficiency for the case of ha ca2 than that of ha alone indicated that the addition of ca2 might increase the aggregation of ha molecules through bridging mechanism leading to the increase of total fouling resistance and reversible membrane resistance lin et al 2015 on the contrary the flux recovery efficiency for the case of ha k was lower than that of ha alone indicating that the addition of k ions might reduce the reversible membrane fouling after 5 min of membrane cleaning in the h2o2 mno2 system the final flux recovery efficiency for the cases of ha ca2 and ha alone were comparable with each other at the value of 97 and prominently higher than that of ha k which was only 89 the results implied that the addition of k significantly increased the irreversible membrane fouling and part of which was even recalcitrant to chemical cleaning the corresponded membrane resistance was shown in fig 1b compared with loading the membrane by ha alone the existence of both ca2 and k increased the r f moreover the addition of ca2 reduced irreversible fouling resistance and increased the reversible fouling resistance however the effects of k were opposite to that of ca2 the results were consistent with fig 1a 3 2 effects of k and ca2 on filtration efficiency of ha fig 2 demonstrated the effects of ca2 and k on the filtration efficiency of ha it showed that at the beginning of the filtration experiment the existence of both ca2 and k inhibited the filtration efficiency of ha by the clean membrane it could be attributed to the electrostatic shielding effect caused by ca2 and k which reduced the extension degree and size of ha flocs resulting in the decline of filtration efficiency of ha murphy et al 1994 electrostatic shielding effect was caused by electrostatic force under neutral condition the negative charge of deprotonated carboxyl groups and phenolic hydroxyl groups on ha surface tended to increase electrostatic repulsion between has leading to a larger size of ha the presence of k played a role in charge neutralization which significantly decreased electronegativity of the negatively charged functional groups between has resulting in the reduction of the extension degree and size of ha flocs for ca2 besides the electrostatic shielding effect the filtration cake contributing to ha removal was also started to setup at the beginning of filtration experiment owing to the complexation between ca2 and ha molecules li and elimelech 2004a compared to k ca2 could neutralize negative charge more effectively and therefore have a greater effect on reducing repulsion li and elimelech 2004b since the cake layer hadn t yet formed at the beginning of filtration the electrostatic shielding effect of ca2 might inhibit the filtration efficiency of ha at that stage for k the electrostatic shielding effect on ha molecules was dominant for the interaction between k and ha molecules thus the filtration efficiency of ha for the case of ha k was reduced more prominently seidel and elimelech 2002 yuan and zydney 1999 at the end of filtration the filtration efficiency of ha by fouled membranes demonstrated different trend compared with the clean membranes it could be seen that for fouled membranes higher filtration efficiency of ha could be achieved for the case of ha ca2 than that of ha alone owing to the mentioned complexation between ca2 and ha to form filtration cake through the bridging effect of ca2 hakim et al 2019 the contribution of filtration cake on ha removal was related to the characteristics of it which could be analyzed by sem and afm images discussed in the following section however the addition of k always led to the lower filtration efficiency of ha for both clean and fouled membranes indicating that electrostatic shielding effect always played the dominant role and the univalent k ions could not exhibited effective bridging effect on ha as the bivalent ca2 ions did nguyen and chen 2007 for the membranes being washed by h2o2 mno2 system f e w a s h e d were recovered to values comparable with those of the clean membranes for both ha ca2 and ha alone however for ha k the filtration efficiency of ha by the washed membrane was similar to that of fouled membrane while was higher than that of the clean membrane it might be because the foulants containing k exhibited stronger adhesion to the membrane surface however the lamellar foulants formed with the existence of ca2 had weaker adhesion and was relatively easy to be removed wang et al 2014 moreover as mentioned above the electrostatic shielding effect of k could reduce the size of the ha flocs when the ha molecules with reduced size passed through the membrane part of them could still be adsorbed inside of the membrane holes tian et al 2010 leading to the formation of irreversible membrane fouling which was even hard to be removed by the h2o2 mno2 system moreover the electrostatic interactions could control the formation and structure of the hydration layer surrounding the ions and ca2 could coordinate more water molecules around it than k teychené et al 2019 it has also been proved that the hydration layer formed by the hydration of ca2 could coat on the surface of ha molecules miao et al 2017 more insight into the nature of ion hydration can be gained by considering the average time that water molecules remain bound to ions for k the residence times of water molecules in the primary hydration shells is about 10 9 s divalent cations are always more strongly solvated than monovalent cations for ca2 lifetime of the bound water is about 10 8 10 6s which is about hundreds times longer than that of k israelachvili 2015 furthermore owing to the binding between water molecules and cations ion water complex is formed with fixed stoichiometry the hydration number of k is 3 while ca2 has a hydration number of 6 leading to greater hydration repulsion induced by ca2 in the ha foulants israelachvili 2015 as shown in fig 3 when ha surfaces coated with hydrated ions are getting close to each other dehydration will be occurred for hydrated ions it has been known that divalent cation demonstrated stronger hydration than monovalent cation thio et al 2012 so the dehydration of ca2 will be less prominent than that of k for interactions among ha molecules considering the fact that hydration repulsion and the steric hindrance effect induced by hydrated ions can compensate with the van der waals force butt et al 2005 kilpatrick et al 2013 valle delgado et al 2011 it can be deduced that the foulant layer containing ca2 will demonstrate looser and more porous structure which can be verified by the results of afm and tem images discussed in the following sections furthermore the proposed loose and porous filtration cake of ha ca2 may have higher capacity for ha removal and be easier to be removed compared with that of ha k which was consistent with the experimental results shown in figs 1 and 2 to illustrate the electrostatic shielding effect of k collins developed the concept of water affinities matching oppositely charged ions in free solution form inner sphere ion pairs spontaneously only when they have equal water affinities collins 2004 according to collins explanation soft ions which have large radius and are prone to deformation prefer to stick with each other closely and hard ions which have small radius and high charge density follow the same pattern gong 2013 it has been proved that carboxylate in has was the hardest among a series of anionic headgroups vlachy et al 2009 and k was harder than ca2 so k would demonstrated closer contact with carboxylate groups in has than ca2 although it is not enough to describe dehydration of k completely and accurately with this simple model the concept is helpful to understand electrostatic shielding of k for ha the dehydration of k could also be explained by its distance from the oxygen atoms in the water molecule by conducting the neutron and x ray diffraction of k in water it showed that the k oxygen distance was longer than the water oxygen oxygen distance indicative of weak hydration and strong dehydration for k while the ca2 oxygen distance was much shorter than the water oxygen oxygen distance indicative of stronger hydration for ca2 collins 2004 thus it could be deduced that the ability of k to reduce the expansion of ha molecules is stronger than that of ca2 conclusively k demonstrates closer contact with carboxylate groups in ha molecule than ca2 leading to a denser foulant layer formed by ha k than that of ha ca2 besides the mentioned mechanisms hydrophobic interaction may also affect membrane fouling yin et al 2020 while the detailed mechanisms for the influences of ions on membrane fouling by changing the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of ha are still unclear and mostly qualitative further researches are still needed 3 3 microscopic analyses of membrane structure 3 3 1 sem images for membrane surface the surface morphologies of clean membrane fig 4 a and b fouled membrane after rinsing by di water fig 4c and d and membrane washed by h2o2 mno2 system fig 4e and f were further investigated by sem although di water could reduce reversible fouling on the membrane it could be observed that considerable foulants were still deposited on its surface fig 4c and d moreover compared with ha k the filtration cake formed by ha ca2 appeared to be more compacted and covered the whole area of the membrane surface when the fouled membrane was washed by h2o2 mno2 system for 5 min it could be clearly seen that the surface of membrane contaminated by ha ca2 was recovered with almost no irreversible residues fig 4e however the residual irreversible fouling of ha k on the surface of membrane could still be observed distinctly even after the chemical washing by h2o2 mno2 system fig 4f 3 3 2 high resolution afm observation for the surface structures further afm measurement was utilized to observe the topography and roughness changes of pes membrane compared with the clean membrane fig 5 a and b the distribution of irreversible foulants on the surface of fouled membranes were non uniform and lumpy fig 5c and d leading to a significant increase of the surface roughness after being washed by h2o2 mno2 system the membrane contaminated by ha ca2 was basically recovered to be smooth fig 5e while amounts of gelatinic spots representing residual irreversible foulants could still be observed clearly on the surface of membrane contaminated by ha k fig 5f which was similar to the results obtained by sem as parameters to quantitatively describe the surface roughness of the membrane root mean square surface roughness rq and mean surface roughness ra were also calculated and listed in table 2 the results showed that rq ra increased from 7 1 5 4 nm to 491 402 nm when the membrane was contaminated and significantly recovered to 66 8 38 6 nm after being washed by the h2o2 mno2 system a similar trend was also observed in ha k contaminated membranes the corresponding afm section analysis in the supporting data also clearly revealed the effectiveness of membrane cleaning 3 4 interaction between cations and ha 3 4 1 analysis of ca2 and k in feed and permeate concentrations of ca2 and k in feed and permeate were measured by icp oes to further explore the interaction between ha and cations with the results shown in fig 6 it could be seen that at the early stage of filtration it was reasonable that almost no cations were removed by the clean ultrafiltration membrane when the membrane was fouled by ha k or ha ca2 for the case of ha k almost all k could still penetrate through the fouled membrane with filtration cake on the surface however for the case of ha ca2 about 15 of ca2 could be collected by the fouled membrane it could be deduced that the complexation between ca2 and ha promoted the collection of ca2 on the filtration cake and more ca2 accumulation further promoted the growth of filtration cake through bridging effect which could be confirmed by the sem images the elemental composition of the membrane surface was also analyzed by the sem eds method as shown in fig 7 there was almost no signal of k on the membrane surface fouled by ha k however the peak of ca2 8 4 was distinct for the case of ha ca2 the sem eds results were consistent with that of icp oes analysis demonstrating that the retention of ca2 by the membrane was significantly higher than that of k 3 4 2 influences of ca2 and k on the size of ha flocs fig 8 demonstrated the size distributions of particles within the feeds containing ha alone ha k and ha ca2 respectively for ha alone the mean size of ha flocs was about 39 μm for the case of the ha k the particle size distribution exhibited double peaks with the mean size of ha flocs being reduced to 11 μm for the case of ha ca2 part of the ha flocs was compressed compared with the condition of ha alone while more ha flocs were expanded resulting in the enhancement of mean particle size to 200 μm the results revealed that both k and ca2 ions could compress the size of negatively charged ha molecules through the electrostatic shielding effect leading to the reduction of molecule extension and size of ha flocs however the bridging effect of ca2 ions on ha was much stronger than the electrostatic effect resulting in the formation of larger ha flocs 3 4 3 tem analysis of surface morphology of ha ha k and ha ca2 flocs tem images for ha ha k and ha ca2 flocs were shown in fig 9 fig 9a and b showed that the flocs formed by ha molecules alone were loose and the edges were not clear under tem imaging with the existence of ca2 as shown in fig 9c and d the structure of flocs was more fragmented and edges of the flocs could be recognized clearly the results revealed that the bridging effect of ca2 could promote the aggregation of ha molecules however as shown in fig 9e and f the existence of k led to the prominent compression and cleavage of flocs owing to the strong electrostatic shielding effect induced by k to reduce the negative charge of ha molecules 4 conclusion in this study the influences of typical cations ca2 and k on the membrane fouling and cleaning process as well as the related mechanisms was studied systemically compared with the membrane fouled by ha alone the combined effects of electrostatic shielding and bridging induced by ca2 led to the formation of more reversible foulants and higher filtration efficiency of ha by the fouled membrane however for k only electrostatic shielding effect dominated the interactions between k and ha resulting in more recalcitrant irreversible foulants and lower filtration efficiency of ha by the fouled membrane moreover the different characteristics of hydrated ca2 and k also contributed to the different structures of foulant layers formed by ha ca2 and ha k considering the fact that ca2 and k are the dominant cations in natural water results of this study can provide valuable advice for practical membrane filtration process attentions should be paid to the condition of high concentration of k in feed because it will cause more serious irreversible fouling and shorten the lifetime of membrane while ca2 in feed may attribute to the pollutant removal and alleviating the formation of irreversible fouling declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this work was supported

sources currently there is a lack of knowledge on the rates of gross n transformations in soils of the icw bed leading to losses of reactive n to the environment in addition the kinetics of these processes need to be studied thoroughly for the sustainable use of icw for removal of excessive n in the treatment of waste waters gross n transformation processes were quantified at two soil depths 0

containing large quantities of organic pollutants ca mean annual c n p and s contents of 240 60 5 and 73 mg l 1 soil was removed from these depths in december 2014 and incubated anaerobically in the laboratory with either 15n labeled ammonium nh4 or nitrate no3 differentially labeled with 14nh4 15no3 and 15nh4 14no3 in parallel setups enriched to 50 atm 15n results showed that at both soil depths no3 production rates were small which may have resulted in lower no3 reduction by either denitrification or dissimilatory no3 reduction to ammonium dnra however despite being low the dnra rates were greater than denitrification rates direct transformation of organic n to no3 without mineralization to nh4 was a prevalent pathway of no3 production accounting for 28 33 of the total no3 production relative contribution of this process to the total n mineralization was negligible at depth 1 0 01 but dominant at depth 2 99 7 total no3 production to total immobilization of nh4 and no3 was very small 0 50 suggesting that icw soils are not a source of no3 despite a large potential of n immobilization existed at both the layers relative n immobilization to the total n conversion was higher at depth 2 ca 2 2 than at depth 1 ca 1 5 the nh4 desorption rate at 30 45 cm was high however immobilization in the recalcitrant and labile organic n pools was higher mineralization and immobilization of nh4 processes showed that recalcitrant organic n was the predominant source in icw soils whereas the labile organic n was comparatively small source apportionment of n2o production showed that the majority of the n2o produced through denitrification ca 92 5 followed by heterotrophic nitrification ca 5 5 co denitrification ca 1 90 and nitrification 0 20 these results revealed that application of a detailed 15n tracing method can provide insights on the underlying processes of ecosystem based abundances of reactive n a key finding of this study was that both investigated icw layers were characterised by large n immobilization which restricts production of no3 and further gaseous n losses keywords gross n transformation constructed wetland recalcitrant organic n labile organic n 15n

of physical chemical and biological processes that relate to species of n less is known about the pathways of the n transformation products in icws langergraber 2009 increasing anthropogenic loading of nr to ground and surface waters raises a number of concerns pertaining to water quality burgin et al 2013 in such systems n removal efficiencies of through flowing water when treating wastewater have ranged from high removals of over 90 søvik and mørkved 2008 to removals as low as 11 kuschk et al 2003 the n removal efficiency of icw varies mainly with icw types e g surface flow subsurface flow horizontal or vertical vegetation types hydraulic loads residence time of pollutants and temperature because these regulate the concentration and forms of n nh4 n or no3 n redox conditions oxygen

the environmental benefits of icws requires an understanding of their impacts on the groundwater quality under the wetlands in situ transformation of n and fate of the transformation products within

control n transformations and flows was different at the two depths table 2 as the ponded water in the icw cell was rich in organic contaminants the soil at the bottom of the cell was also contaminated with different reactive forms of c and n these reactive c and n compounds flow vertically upward to the atmosphere e g ebullition of co2 ch4 n2o and nh3 and downward to the underlying

also be produced by nitrification as well stevens et al 1997 rütting et al 2010 stange et al 2013a b zhang et al 2011 yet one of the assumptions of the source partitioning methods was the absence of hybrid reactions such as co denitrification zhang et al 2015 as co denitrification is considered as a potential source of n2o production it should be included in the analysis of n2o sources jansen willems et al 2016 recently developed 15n tracing approaches based on the excel solver method rütting et al 2010 are able to identify and confirm four different pathways which can simultaneously take place in soils and produce n2o nitrification denitrification co denitrification and heterotrophic nitrification or oxidation of organic n müller et al 2006 this mathematical model n2o source partitioning model associated with the 15n tracing approach müller et al 2006 was used to quantify the relative contributions of four different n2o production pathways 2 7 statistical analysis statistical analyses of the modeled data were carried out using sigmaplot version 13 software systat software inc san jose ca usa the gross rates from the two depths were compared by determining the lsd least significant difference according to the method described by müller et al 2011 at a significance level of 0 05 the number of actual experimental repetitions was used as the sample size n 3 net n transformation rates were also analysed using anova and fishers least significant difference post hoc test was also carried out 3 results 3 1 model output and observed soil data the model output represented the data very well with r2 above 0 84 for depth 1 fig 3 and 0 96 for depth 2 fig 4 the only larger discrepancy occurred for the 15n excess of the nh4 in depth 2 when nh4 had been labeled fig 4 however from previous evaluations we know that these discrepancies do not have a major impact on the resulting gross n transformation rates we have to bear in mind that the ntrace approach takes into account all observed data in the data set and finds the overall best fit the dilution of the applied 15n nh4 at depth 1 indicates a production of nh4 from unlabeled sources most likely organic n while at depth 2 first an enrichment and a subsequent slight dilution was observed nitrate reduction by immobilization and dnra was observed predominantly at depth 1 the increase of 15n nh4 at depth 2 fig 4 in the first 72 h indicates that 15n has been released from the soil most likely related to 15nh4 that had been immediately adsorbed on exchange sites directly after 15n application from 72 h onwards the slight dilution of the 15nh4 shows that nh4 has been produced in the system again probably via mineralization of organic n fig 4 these details could not be captured by the current ntrace analysis because it would have required a two step analysis taking into account the two time periods before and after 72 h thus in the further analyses we should bear this in mind a difference in behavior between depth 1 and 2 was also seen in the net no3 production whereas at depth 1 a slight decline in no3 concentrations was observed the no3 concentrations at depth 2 remained steady over the course of the experiment the more or less unchanged 15no3 enrichment when no3 has been 15n labeled shows that no3 production via nh4 or organic n oxidation was small at the two depths 3 2 gross n transformations in soils of icw bed gross and net n transformation rates of different n cycling processes are presented in table 3 and table 4 respectively gross n transformation rates in soils of icw bed differed significantly between the two depths table 3 mineralization of recalcitrant organic n to nh4 m nrec was dominant only at depth 1 0 15 cm but was negligible at depth 2 30 45 cm table 3 similar to the m nrec mineralization of labile organic n m nlab was significantly higher in the upper layer of the icw bed depth 1 compared to depth 2 table 3 conversely immobilization of nh4 to recalcitrant organic n i nh4nrec was a dominant process 5 57 and 13 11 μg n g 1 soil d 1 at depth 1 and 2 respectively p 0 05 unlike the i nh4nrec immobilization of nh4 to labile organic n n nh4nlab was the dominant process at depth 1 being statistically higher than in depth 2 table 3 oxidation of recalcitrant organic n to no3 was small at both depths but differed statistically between the two depths being higher at depth 2 the no3 immobilization i no3 occurred at both depths but it was far greater at depth 1 than depth 2 table 3 whereas at depth 2 the rate was very small the o nh4 rate was small and statistically alike at both soil depths p 0 05 the d no3 rate was a significant pathway at depth 1 only being much greater than in depth 2 the a nh4 rate was comparatively small yet they differed significantly between depths being higher at depth 1 than depth 2 release of adsorbed nh4 r nh4ads was a dominant process ca 5 96 μg n g 1 soil d 1 at depth 2 and significantly higher than at depth 1 3 3 net n transformations in soils of icw bed the model was able to estimate eleven gross n transformation processes of which five major processes were presented in table 4 total mineralization m tot was a dominant pathway for nh4 production in icw soils but it was prevalent at the depth 1 and significantly higher than in depth 2 where it was found to be negligible table 4 conversely total ammonium immobilization i nh4 was found to be a dominant process in both soil depths without any significant differences p 0 05 between them when compared with the total nh4 production with the total nh4 immobilization there was a net nh4 immobilization which was higher at depth 2 than depth 1 total nitrification rate n tot appeared to be small in comparison to other processes both inorganic and organic no3 production pathways were evaluated the n tot was significantly higher in depth 2 compared to the upper soil layer nitrate immobilization i no3 was the predominant no3 consumption pathway and was significantly higher in depth 1 compared to depth 2 table 4 the dominating n transformation rate in icw soils was the total immobilization rate i tot which was relatively high in both depths without being significantly different however the i tot was similar at both depths table 4 3 4 ratios between different gross and net n transformation rates ammonium production from the labile organic n m nlab m tot was less than 50 at both soil depths table 5 depth 2 exhibited a greater m nlab m tot ratio than depth 1 p 0 01 at depth 1 immobilization of nh4 to labile and non labile n pools nh 4 n lab i nh4 was almost equal ca 49 to labile nh4 while at depth 2 this was negligible compared to the depth 1 the ratio of the nh4 oxidation to no3 over the total no3 production n aut n tot was greater than 50 at both soil depths where depth 2 had a significantly higher ratio than at depth 1 p 0 01 conversely the ratio between dnra and the total no3 consumption d no3 c no3 was higher at depth 1 than at depth 2 p 0 01 immobilization of nh4 over total mineral n immobilization i nh4 i tot was far greater at depth 2 than depth 1 however at both depths this process was dominating the ratio between total n oxidation via oxidation of organic n and oxidation of nh4 n tot and total immobilization i tot was small at both depths but was significantly higher at depth 2 than depth 1 3 5 relative contribution of n2o production pathways along with identification and measurement of gross n transformation processes four n2o emission pathways i e n2o from nitrification denitrification co denitrification and from oxidation of organic n called heterophic nitrification were quantified the results showed that the majority of the n2o was produced through denitrification ca 92 5 followed by heterotrophic nitrification ca 5 5 the n2o emissions from co denitrification and nitrification were very low ca 1 90 and 0 20 respectively heterotrophic nitrification was prevalent at the beginning whereas co denitrification at the end of the incubation fig 5 4 discussions 4 1 gross and net n transformation rates in soils of icw bed the tracing analysis revealed that the relative contribution of recalcitrant organic n to nh4 was more than double of the contribution from labile organic n however organic n mineralization reduced with depth being very small in 30 45 cm depth 2 the depth 2 may have been more reduced than depth 1 because plant root in depth 1 translocate do through the aerencymatous tissue and diffuse in the root rhizosphere the vertical do profile fig 1 showed a decreasing trend of the do from the ponded water to the groundwater beneath the icw previous investigations showed that the cw used in this study received large quantities of organic n which is consumed by plants converted to reactive and inert forms of n fixed in soils and leached with the percolating water jahangir et al 2019 the higher mineralization rate of recalcitrant organic n in soils of the icw bed indicates that the greater part of labile organic n is mineralized and consequently available for consumption by plants and or immobilized before they leach in the soil on the contrary immobilization of nh4 takes place at both soils depths where immobilization to recalcitrant organic n is higher at the deeper layer of soil release of 15nh4 at depth 1 may have caused an increase at this layer while immobilization to recalcitrant organic n caused a corresponding decrease in 15nh4 at depth 2 fig 2 however immobilization of no3 is an important pathway only at depth 1 because biologically this depth is more active than depth 2 as the root biomass of hydrophytes and accumulation of organic matter was much higher at this depth the principal energy source or food for microbes is organic matter organic matter accumulation was much higher at this depth than at depth 2 the rooting systems of the hydrophytes were limited mainly to this depth the hydrophytes are reported to supply oxygen to the root rhizosphere through the aerencymatous tissue and stimulate aerobic microbes total n immobilization per day was 15 68 and 13 13 μg g 1 d 1 at depth 1 and depth 2 respectively table 4 net immobilization was 5 10 and 13 12 μg g 1 d 1 at depth 1 and depth 2 this observation is in agreement with bedard haughn et al 2006 where in ephemeral wetlands immobilization was a dominant pathway for n loss oxidation of organic n and nh4 to no3 is comparatively lower than organic n mineralization at both soil depths a lower rate of no3 production in such systems is not surprising because of the prevailing anaerobic soil environment inhibiting oxidation leading to nh4 predominance nevertheless it can be postulated that immobilization of nh4 and no3 in icw soils is greater than mineralization suggesting that organic n is continuously recycled with the mineralization immobilization turnover mit keeping the systems rich in nh4 o luanaigh et al 2010 equally the total nh4 immobilization was higher than the total nh4 production by mineralization leading to a net immobilization table 3 particularly at depth 2 based on the gross n transformation dynamics at both layers a net n immobilization occurred which was even stronger at depth 2 compared to depth 1 thus at both layers a large potential for n removal existed where the relative n immobilization potential to the total n removal was greater at depth 2 ratio 2 2 than depth 1 ratio 1 5 in addition immobilization of nh4 occurs at depth 2 predominantly in the form of recalcitrant nh4 while it was both recalcitrant and labile at depth 1 the occurrence of such form of nh4 at depth 2 signifies that any leakage or preferential flow of water from icw systems could pose a risk to the underlying groundwater quality this result is in line with the study by bedard haughn et al 2006 who found greater net nh4 production than no3 in uncultivated ephemeral wetlands malo et al 2005 noted that no3 does not tend to accumulate within these systems due to o2 limitation and no3 consumption by denitrification and dnra jahangir et al 2017 this can be attributed to the limited oxygen availability in soils because on one hand icw soils are underlain by standing water throughout the year and on the other hand organic carbon rich soils consume oxygen and thus make the soil more anaerobic however higher rates of organic n oxidation directly to no3 without mineralization to nh4 indicates that this pathway may take place only when mineralization of organic n in soil is limited and when the environment is not suitable for ammonification alternatively oxidation of organic n directly to no3 can take place in an environment where nh4 is the dominant form for plant uptake and no3 being the main n source for microbial metabolism liu et al 2020 another important n transformation process in icw soils is dnra which turned out to be significant only at depth 1 like mineralization dnra enriches the soil with nh4 the n loss by n2o was 0 047 and 0 013 μg g 1 d 1 at depth 1 and depth 2 and by n2 0 0004 and 0 0002 μg g 1 d 1 at depth 1 and depth 2 respectively the mass balance estimation showed that total biochemical consumption of the applied n was 66 and 55 at depth 1 and depth 2 ammonium adsorption at either soil depth was similar because the clay content of the soil and nature of the clay is similar maintaining their exchange sites and adsorption capacities to be similar net immobilization of nh4 to recalcitrant and labile organic n warrants adoption of appropriate management strategy to reduce delivery of these forms of organic n to the underlying water through any preferential flow path e g root channel infiltration etc however they can be oxidized when the icw dries out or while delivered to the surface water 4 2 ratios between different gross and net n transformation rates the ratio of labile organic n mineralization to the total mineralization indicates that the majority of the organic n in icw soils is less labile in particular at depth 1 this corresponds to the gross mineralization rate of recalcitrant organic n which was much higher than mineralization of the labile n occurrence of less labile organic n in icw soils might have happened due to its mineralization while it is moving to the icw cells and also in the icw standing water before it deposits in soils despite of low abundance of labile organic n and corresponding higher mineralization of recalcitrant organic n the immobilization of nh4 to labile and recalcitrant organic n nh4 nlab inh4 was similar suggesting a balance of nh4 in the system which is produced from recalcitrant organic n equally nh4 immobilization to labile n pools over the total n labile plus recalcitrant pools were negligible at depth 2 indicating that labile n pool in depth 2 is small oxidation of recalcitrant organic n directly to no3 circumventing mineralization of organic n to nh4 became in the focus as a no3 production pathway with the development of advanced 15n tracing techniques using double or triple labeling approaches müller et al 2007 müller and clough 2014 chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2011 2013 2015 2018 however this pathway has appeared to be a significant process accounting for 28 at depth 2 33 at depth 1 over the total n oxidation to no3 the ratio between the total no3 production by nh4 oxidation and or by organic n oxidation to the total immobilization is very small which indicates that icw soils had very high potential to loose no3 stockdale et al 2002 described this as ntot itot a key indicator of potential no3 loss in grassland and arable soils the higher ntot itot ratio also indicates that immobilization rate suppresses denitrification rates due to a reduced no3 availability in such environments this finding is in agreement with jahangir et al 2017 who reported that denitrification rate in nh4 rich groundwater is small and is dominated by dnra 4 3 pathway specific n2o production in soils in a previous study without any treatment application jahangir et at 2019 found higher dissolved n2o in shallow groundwater beneath the icw than the groundwater disconnected to the icw the traditional n2o source model stevens et al 1997 that included nitrification and denitrification was unable to provide a mechanistic explanation of n2o enrichment in soils relative contributions of n2o production pathways in this paper were quantified based on the solver method described by rütting et al 2010 associated with the dynamics of nh4 no3 and no2 in soil in relationship with the ntrace basic output a mechanistic explanation of the n2o pathways is based on the underlying n dynamics generally denitrification and nitrification are considered to be the main pathways for n2o production in arable soils barnard et al 2005 van groenigen et al 2005 co denitrification is also responsible for small quantities of n2o production in some specific environments e g near to saturation clough et al 2017 and ph 6 0 selbie et al 2015 soil ph in our study was 6 7 table 2 which favors the occurrence of co denitrification being an organic waste bearing system co denitrification in such conditions can occur at the interface between an aerobic zone overlying an anaerobic zone root rhizome when no2 meets fe2 sørensen and torling 1991 alternatively hybrid n2o by co denitrification can be produced via biologically mediated nitrosation containing one n atom derived from the nucleophile nh2oh or nh4 and one n atom derived from the nitrosyl compound spott et al 2011 using a 15n tracer approach rex et al 2011 found evidence for fungal dominated 15no3 depletion leading to n2o production via co denitrification which can also occur in the icw soils in addition to the conventional n2o production pathways oxidation of organic n has appeared to be a significant pathway of n2o production denitrification was the dominant process among the four different pathways which is expected in such an anaerobic environment this finding is in agreement with russow et al 2000 who showed that organic soil produces n2o predominantly from denitrification bedard haughn et al 2006 found in uncultivated wetlands that denitrification was responsible for more than 75 of the n2o emissions contribution of nitrification to n2o production in such an environment with prevailing high organic c and n and anaerobic soil conditions was negligible this corresponds to the observed low nh4 oxidation rate table 4 this result is in contrast to stevens et al 1997 who stated that the soils previously treated with ammonium nitrate produce n2o deriving 30 from denitrification and 70 from nitrification this can be attributed to the soil environment and higher c and n content next to denitrification oxidation of organic n was the next most important n2o production pathway it can be attributed to specific microbial groups performing oxidation steps of organic n to no2 and then reduction to gaseous n which can operate simultaneously possibly in different soil habitats müller et al 2006 concluded that soils which are not disturbed for a long period can harbour microbial consortia of different groups similar to our finding past research emmerling et al 2002 rütting et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 reported that in addition to nitrification and denitrification oxidation of organic no2 can produce n2o zhang et al 2015 however in icw soils this pathway has not been described so far but only for arable and forest soils zhu et al 2011 stange et al 2013a b co denitrification also contributed a small fraction of n2o in comparison to denitrification and oxidation of organic n occurrence of low co denitrification can be attributed to the high anaerobiocity of the environment because co denitrification requires microaerophilic soil conditions zhou et al 2001 which are not likely to exist here as the soils are underlain by water for the entire year while they are rich in organic c that consumes oxygen 5 conclusions along with the removal capacity the n cycling processes and resulting reactive forms within icw soils need to be understood to comprehensively evaluate their health economic and environmental impacts as a high n rich system gross n transformations in icw bed soils will provide insights into the delivery pathways of the n transformation products mineralization and immobilization of nh4 processes showed that recalcitrant organic n was predominant in cw soils whereas the labile organic n was comparatively small at both soil bed depths no3 reduction via denitrification or dnra was very small because its production was very low however when compared with the two no3 reduction processes dnra appeared to have been the dominant pathway nitrification rate in icw soils was very low indicating that icw is not a good source of no3 heterotrophic nitrification oxidation of organic n to no3 was evident in icw soils and found to be responsible for 28 33 of the total nitrification the ratio between the total nitrification and total immobilization being very small implies that no3 production and reduction processes are not an obvious issue in icws whilst nh4 is prevalent form in terms of production recycling and release even though nh4 desorption rate was greater than the absorption particularly at depth two the immobilization was the dominant n cycle process which was higher than the total nh4 production by mineralization resulting in a net immobilization source partitioning of n2o suing the four pool model showed that denitrification was the dominant process accounting for 93 of the total n2o produced by all the pathways these results can be considered to

17733,integrated constructed wetlands icw area technology for the attenuation of contaminants such as organic carbon c nitrogen n phosphorous p and sulphur s in water coming from point or diffuse sources currently there is a lack of knowledge on the rates of gross n transformations in soils of the icw bed leading to losses of reactive n to the environment in addition the kinetics of these processes need to be studied thoroughly for the sustainable use of icw for removal of excessive n in the treatment of waste waters gross n transformation processes were quantified at two soil depths 0

containing large quantities of organic pollutants ca mean annual c n p and s contents of 240 60 5 and 73 mg l 1 soil was removed from these depths in december 2014 and incubated anaerobically in the laboratory with either 15n labeled ammonium nh4 or nitrate no3 differentially labeled with 14nh4 15no3 and 15nh4 14no3 in parallel setups enriched to 50 atm 15n results showed that at both soil depths no3 production rates were small which may have resulted in lower no3 reduction by either denitrification or dissimilatory no3 reduction to ammonium dnra however despite being low the dnra rates were greater than denitrification rates direct transformation of organic n to no3 without mineralization to nh4 was a prevalent pathway of no3 production accounting for 28 33 of the total no3 production relative contribution of this process to the total n mineralization was negligible at depth 1 0 01 but dominant at depth 2 99 7 total no3 production to total immobilization of nh4 and no3 was very small 0 50 suggesting that icw soils are not a source of no3 despite a large potential of n immobilization existed at both the layers relative n immobilization to the total n conversion was higher at depth 2 ca 2 2 than at depth 1 ca 1 5 the nh4 desorption rate at 30 45 cm was high however immobilization in the recalcitrant and labile organic n pools was higher mineralization and immobilization of nh4 processes showed that recalcitrant organic n was the predominant source in icw soils whereas the labile organic n was comparatively small source apportionment of n2o production showed that the

a detailed 15n tracing method can provide insights on the underlying processes of ecosystem based abundances of reactive n a key finding of this study was that both investigated icw layers were

call here cells which are located down hydraulic gradient from each other these wetlands also contribute other ecosystem services such as enhancing biodiversity and use considerably less energy to treat water than other engineering wastewater treatment solutions the icws treating wastewater can have high temporally variable nutrient loads and provide much more controlled conditions than natural wetlands vyzamal and kröpfelova 2015 the icws receive substantial quantities of organic c and n harington et al 2007 jahangir et al 2019 being biogeochemically highly active icws facilitate a number of physical chemical and biological processes that relate to species of n less is known about the pathways of the n transformation products in icws langergraber 2009 increasing anthropogenic loading of nr to ground and surface waters raises a number of concerns pertaining to water quality burgin et al 2013 in such systems n removal efficiencies of through flowing water when treating wastewater have ranged from high removals of over 90 søvik and mørkved 2008 to removals as low as 11 kuschk et al 2003 the n removal efficiency of icw varies mainly with icw types e g surface flow subsurface flow horizontal or vertical vegetation types hydraulic loads residence time of pollutants and temperature because these regulate the concentration and forms of n nh4 n or no3 n redox conditions oxygen concentration concentration and nature of organic carbon and ph within the icw system for example a lower n removal has been observed in wetlands receiving large concentrations of nh4 n than in those receiving n in the form of no3 n andersson et al 2005 vegetation controls the availability and quality of c regulates oxygen diffusion to icw bed soils microbial diversity and abundance and n assimilation the redox conditions or oxygen concentration and soil organic carbon soc content control the occurrences and rate of the processes like nitrification denitrification dnra and anammox however the conventional estimation of n removal n input into the icws minus n delivery from the icws to surface water does not consider n dilution or conversion to other reactive inert forms the fate of the n added to the icws is not yet well understood jahangir et al 2017 the n removal through these systems therefore means conversion of reactive forms of n to its inert form which is di nitrogen

vascular plants and indirectly transported via groundwater flow riya et al 2010 constructed wetlands significantly contribute to atmospheric n2o emissions either directly to the atmosphere from the surface of the wetland ipcc 2013 søvik et al 2006 ström et al 2007 elberling et al 2011 or indirectly via dissolved n2o in the effluent or groundwater upon discharge to surface waters evaluation of the environmental benefits of icws requires an understanding of their impacts on the groundwater quality under the wetlands in situ transformation of n and fate of the transformation products within

rhizomes o luanaigh et al 2010 nitrification followed by denitrification is believed to be the major pathway for nh4 removal in wetlands vymazal 2007 conversely dissimilatory nitrate reduction to nh4

transformations in soils of cw bed while n rich waste waters travel from its source to the receiving water bodies are required the kinetics of these pathways processes needs to be studied thoroughly

water from the icw cells to groundwater was 74 mm per year 2 2 collection of soil and waste water samples bulk soil samples were collected from several spots in an icw cell receiving large quantities of organic pollutants including c and n at two depths 0 15 and 30 45 cm below the surface of icw bed representing top and subsoils these two depths vary with the hydrochemical conditions which control n transformations production of reactive n and their transport to the environment both upward and downward the vertical distribution of redox potential c and n contents and soil permeability that control n transformations and flows was different at the two depths table 2 as the ponded water in the icw cell was rich in organic contaminants the soil at the bottom of the cell was also contaminated with different reactive forms of c and n these reactive c and n compounds flow vertically upward to the atmosphere e g ebullition of co2 ch4 n2o and nh3 and downward to the underlying

added to a tray to maintain the soil under submerged conditions to mimic wetland conditions and stored in a cold room at 4 c for 7 days to allow for reaching a new microbial equilibrium and avoiding a

also be produced by nitrification as well stevens et al 1997 rütting et al 2010 stange et al 2013a b zhang et al 2011 yet one of the assumptions of the source partitioning methods was the absence of hybrid reactions such as co denitrification zhang et al 2015 as co denitrification is considered as a potential source of n2o production it should be included in the analysis of n2o sources jansen willems et al 2016 recently developed 15n tracing approaches based on the excel solver method rütting et al 2010 are able to identify and confirm four different pathways which can simultaneously take place in soils and produce n2o nitrification denitrification co denitrification and heterotrophic nitrification or oxidation of organic n müller et al 2006 this mathematical model n2o source partitioning model associated with the 15n tracing approach müller et al 2006 was used to quantify the relative contributions of four different n2o production pathways 2 7 statistical analysis statistical analyses of the modeled data were carried out using sigmaplot version 13 software systat software inc san jose ca usa the gross rates from the two depths were compared by determining the lsd least significant difference according to the method described by müller et al 2011 at a significance level of 0 05 the number of actual experimental repetitions was used as the sample size n 3 net n transformation rates were also analysed using anova and fishers least significant difference post hoc test was also carried out 3 results 3 1 model output and observed soil data the model output represented the data very well with r2 above 0 84 for depth 1 fig 3 and 0 96 for depth 2 fig 4 the only larger discrepancy occurred for the 15n excess of the nh4 in depth 2 when nh4 had been labeled fig 4 however from previous evaluations we know that these discrepancies do not have a major impact on the resulting gross n transformation rates we have to bear in mind that the ntrace approach takes into account all observed data in the data set and finds the overall best fit the dilution of the applied 15n nh4 at depth 1 indicates a production of nh4 from unlabeled sources most likely organic n while at depth 2 first an enrichment and a subsequent slight dilution was observed nitrate reduction by immobilization and dnra was observed predominantly at depth 1 the increase of 15n nh4 at depth 2 fig 4 in the first 72 h indicates that 15n has been released from the soil most likely related to 15nh4 that had been immediately adsorbed on exchange sites directly after 15n application from 72 h onwards the slight dilution of the 15nh4 shows that nh4 has been produced in the system again probably via mineralization of organic n fig 4 these details could not be captured by the current ntrace analysis because it would have required a two step analysis taking into account the two time periods before and after 72 h thus in the further analyses we should bear this in mind a difference in behavior between depth 1 and 2 was also seen in the net no3 production whereas at depth 1 a slight decline in no3 concentrations was observed the no3 concentrations at depth 2 remained steady over the course of the experiment the more or less unchanged 15no3 enrichment when no3 has been 15n labeled shows that no3 production via nh4 or organic n oxidation was small at the two depths 3 2 gross n transformations in soils of icw bed gross and net n transformation rates of different n cycling processes are presented in table 3 and table 4 respectively gross n transformation rates in soils of icw bed differed significantly between the two depths table 3 mineralization of recalcitrant organic n to nh4 m nrec was dominant only at depth 1 0 15 cm but was negligible at depth 2 30 45 cm table 3 similar to the m nrec mineralization of labile organic n m nlab was significantly higher in the upper layer of the icw bed depth 1 compared to depth 2 table 3 conversely immobilization of nh4 to recalcitrant organic n i nh4nrec was a dominant process 5 57 and 13 11 μg n g 1 soil d 1 at depth 1 and 2 respectively p 0 05 unlike the i nh4nrec immobilization of nh4 to labile organic n n nh4nlab was the dominant process at depth 1 being statistically higher than in depth 2 table 3 oxidation of recalcitrant organic n to no3 was small at both depths but differed statistically between the two depths being higher at depth 2 the no3 immobilization i no3 occurred at both depths but it was far greater at depth 1 than depth 2 table 3 whereas at depth 2 the rate was very small the o nh4 rate was small and statistically alike at both soil depths p 0 05 the d no3 rate was a significant pathway at depth 1 only being much greater than in depth 2 the a nh4 rate was comparatively small yet they differed significantly between depths being higher at depth 1 than depth 2 release of adsorbed nh4 r nh4ads was a dominant process ca 5 96 μg n g 1 soil d 1 at depth 2 and significantly higher than at depth 1 3 3 net n transformations in soils of icw bed the model was able to estimate eleven gross n transformation processes of which five major processes were presented in table 4 total mineralization m tot was a dominant pathway for nh4 production in icw soils but it was prevalent at the depth 1 and significantly higher than in depth 2 where it was found to be negligible table 4 conversely total ammonium immobilization i nh4 was found to be a dominant process in both soil depths without any significant differences p 0 05 between them when compared with the total nh4 production with the total nh4 immobilization there was a net nh4 immobilization which was higher at depth 2 than depth 1 total nitrification rate n tot appeared to be small in comparison to other processes both inorganic and organic no3 production pathways were evaluated the n tot was significantly higher in depth 2 compared to the upper soil layer nitrate immobilization i no3 was the predominant no3 consumption pathway and was significantly higher in depth 1 compared to depth 2 table 4 the dominating n transformation rate in icw soils was the total immobilization rate i tot which was relatively high in both depths without being significantly different however the i tot was similar at both depths table 4 3 4 ratios between different gross and net n transformation rates ammonium production from the labile organic n m nlab m tot was less than 50 at both soil depths table 5 depth 2 exhibited a greater m nlab m tot ratio than depth 1 p 0 01 at depth 1 immobilization of nh4 to labile and non labile n pools nh 4 n lab i nh4 was almost equal ca 49 to labile nh4 while at depth 2 this was negligible compared to the depth 1 the ratio of the nh4 oxidation to no3 over the total no3 production n aut n tot was greater than 50 at both soil depths where depth 2 had a significantly higher ratio than at depth 1 p 0 01 conversely the ratio between dnra and the total no3 consumption d no3 c no3 was higher at depth 1 than at depth 2 p 0 01 immobilization of nh4 over total mineral n immobilization i nh4 i tot was far greater at depth 2 than depth 1 however at both depths this process was dominating the ratio between total n oxidation via oxidation of organic n and oxidation of nh4 n tot and total immobilization i tot was small at both depths but was significantly higher at depth 2 than depth 1 3 5 relative contribution of n2o production pathways along with identification and measurement of gross n transformation processes four n2o emission pathways i e n2o from nitrification denitrification co denitrification and from oxidation of organic n called heterophic nitrification were quantified the results showed that the majority of the n2o was produced through denitrification ca 92 5 followed by heterotrophic nitrification ca 5 5 the n2o emissions from co denitrification and nitrification were very low ca 1 90 and 0 20 respectively heterotrophic nitrification was prevalent at the beginning whereas co denitrification at the end of the incubation fig 5 4 discussions 4 1 gross and net n transformation rates in soils of icw bed the tracing analysis revealed that the relative contribution of recalcitrant organic n to nh4 was more than double of the contribution from labile organic n however organic n mineralization reduced with depth being very small in 30 45 cm depth 2 the depth 2 may have been more reduced than depth 1 because plant root in depth 1 translocate do through the aerencymatous tissue and diffuse in the root rhizosphere the vertical do profile fig 1 showed a decreasing trend of the do from the ponded water to the groundwater beneath the icw previous investigations showed that the cw used in this study received large quantities of organic n which is consumed by plants converted to reactive and inert forms of n fixed in soils and leached with the percolating water jahangir et al 2019 the higher mineralization rate of recalcitrant organic n in soils of the icw bed indicates that the greater part of labile organic n is mineralized and consequently available for consumption by plants and or immobilized before they leach in the soil on the contrary immobilization of nh4 takes place at both soils depths where immobilization to recalcitrant organic n is higher at the deeper layer of soil release of 15nh4 at depth 1 may have caused an increase at this layer while immobilization to recalcitrant organic n caused a corresponding decrease in 15nh4 at depth 2 fig 2 however immobilization of no3 is an important pathway only at depth 1 because biologically this depth is more active than depth 2 as the root biomass of hydrophytes and accumulation of organic matter was much higher at this depth the principal energy source or food for microbes is organic matter organic matter accumulation was much higher at this depth than at depth 2 the rooting systems of the hydrophytes were limited mainly to this depth the hydrophytes are reported to supply oxygen to the root rhizosphere through the aerencymatous tissue and stimulate aerobic microbes total n immobilization per day was 15 68 and 13 13 μg g 1 d 1 at depth 1 and depth 2 respectively table 4 net immobilization was 5 10 and 13 12 μg g 1 d 1 at depth 1 and depth 2 this observation is in agreement with bedard haughn et al 2006 where in ephemeral wetlands immobilization was a dominant pathway for n loss oxidation of organic n and nh4 to no3 is comparatively lower than organic n mineralization at both soil depths a lower rate of no3 production in such systems is not surprising because of the prevailing anaerobic soil environment inhibiting oxidation leading to nh4 predominance nevertheless it can be postulated that immobilization of nh4 and no3 in icw soils is greater than mineralization suggesting that organic n is continuously recycled with the mineralization immobilization turnover mit keeping the systems rich in nh4 o luanaigh et al 2010 equally the total nh4 immobilization was higher than the total nh4 production by mineralization leading to a net immobilization table 3 particularly at depth 2 based on the gross n transformation dynamics at both layers a net n immobilization occurred which was even stronger at depth 2 compared to depth 1 thus at both layers a large potential for n removal existed where the relative n immobilization potential to the total n removal was greater at depth 2 ratio 2 2 than depth 1 ratio 1 5 in addition immobilization of nh4 occurs at depth 2 predominantly in the form of recalcitrant nh4 while it was both recalcitrant and labile at depth 1 the occurrence of such form of nh4 at depth 2 signifies that any leakage or preferential flow of water from icw systems could pose a risk to the underlying groundwater quality this result is in line with the study by bedard haughn et al 2006 who found greater net nh4 production than no3 in uncultivated ephemeral wetlands malo et al 2005 noted that no3 does not tend to accumulate within these systems due to o2 limitation and no3 consumption by denitrification and dnra jahangir et al 2017 this can be attributed to the limited oxygen availability in soils because on one hand icw soils are underlain by standing water throughout the year and on the other hand organic carbon rich soils consume oxygen and thus make the soil more anaerobic however higher rates of organic n oxidation directly to no3 without mineralization to nh4 indicates that this pathway may take place only when mineralization of organic n in soil is limited and when the environment is not suitable for ammonification alternatively oxidation of organic n directly to no3 can take place in an environment where nh4 is the dominant form for plant uptake and no3 being the main n source for microbial metabolism liu et al 2020 another important n transformation process in icw soils is dnra which turned out to be significant only at depth 1 like mineralization dnra enriches the soil with nh4 the n loss by n2o was 0 047 and 0 013 μg g 1 d 1 at depth 1 and depth 2 and by n2 0 0004 and 0 0002 μg g 1 d 1 at depth 1 and depth 2 respectively the mass balance estimation showed that total biochemical consumption of the applied n was 66 and 55 at depth 1 and depth 2 ammonium adsorption at either soil depth was similar because the clay content of the soil and nature of the clay is similar maintaining their exchange sites and adsorption capacities to be similar net immobilization of nh4 to recalcitrant and labile organic n warrants adoption of appropriate management strategy to reduce delivery of these forms of organic n to the underlying water through any preferential flow path e g root channel infiltration etc however they can be oxidized when the icw dries out or while delivered to the surface water 4 2 ratios between different gross and net n transformation rates the ratio of labile organic n mineralization to the total mineralization indicates that the majority of the organic n in icw soils is less labile in particular at depth 1 this corresponds to the gross mineralization rate of recalcitrant organic n which was much higher than mineralization of the labile n occurrence of less labile organic n in icw soils might have happened due to its mineralization while it is moving to the icw cells and also in the icw standing water before it deposits in soils despite of low abundance of labile organic n and corresponding higher mineralization of recalcitrant organic n the immobilization of nh4 to labile and recalcitrant organic n nh4 nlab inh4 was similar suggesting a balance of nh4 in the system which is produced from recalcitrant organic n equally nh4 immobilization to labile n pools over the total n labile plus recalcitrant pools were negligible at depth 2 indicating that labile n pool in depth 2 is small oxidation of recalcitrant organic n directly to no3 circumventing mineralization of organic n to nh4 became in the focus as a no3 production pathway with the development of advanced 15n tracing techniques using double or triple labeling approaches müller et al 2007 müller and clough 2014 chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2011 2013 2015 2018 however this pathway has appeared to be a significant process accounting for 28 at depth 2 33 at depth 1 over the total n oxidation to no3 the ratio between the total no3 production by nh4 oxidation and or by organic n oxidation to the total immobilization is very small which indicates that icw soils had very high potential to loose no3 stockdale et al 2002 described this as ntot itot a key indicator of potential no3 loss in grassland and arable soils the higher ntot itot ratio also indicates that immobilization rate suppresses denitrification rates due to a reduced no3 availability in such environments this finding is in agreement with jahangir et al 2017 who reported that denitrification rate in nh4 rich groundwater is small and is dominated by dnra 4 3 pathway specific n2o production in soils in a previous study without any treatment application jahangir et at 2019 found higher dissolved n2o in shallow groundwater beneath the icw than the groundwater disconnected to the icw the traditional n2o source model stevens et al 1997 that included nitrification and denitrification was unable to provide a mechanistic explanation of n2o enrichment in soils relative contributions of n2o production pathways in this paper were quantified based on the solver method described by rütting et al 2010 associated with the dynamics of nh4 no3 and no2 in soil in relationship with the ntrace basic output a mechanistic explanation of the n2o pathways is based on the underlying n dynamics generally denitrification and nitrification are considered to be the main pathways for n2o production in arable soils barnard et al 2005 van groenigen et al 2005 co denitrification is also responsible for small quantities of n2o production in some specific environments e g near to saturation clough et al 2017 and ph 6 0 selbie et al 2015 soil ph in our study was 6 7 table 2 which favors the occurrence of co denitrification being an organic waste bearing system co denitrification in such conditions can occur at the interface between an aerobic zone overlying an anaerobic zone root rhizome when no2 meets fe2 sørensen and torling 1991 alternatively hybrid n2o by co denitrification can be produced via biologically mediated nitrosation containing one n atom derived from the nucleophile nh2oh or nh4 and one n atom derived from the nitrosyl compound spott et al 2011 using a 15n tracer approach rex et al 2011 found evidence for fungal dominated 15no3 depletion leading to n2o production via co denitrification which can also occur in the icw soils in addition to the conventional n2o production pathways oxidation of organic n has appeared to be a significant pathway of n2o production denitrification was the dominant process among the four different pathways which is expected in such an anaerobic environment this finding is in agreement with russow et al 2000 who showed that organic soil produces n2o predominantly from denitrification bedard haughn et al 2006 found in uncultivated wetlands that denitrification was responsible for more than 75 of the n2o emissions contribution of nitrification to n2o production in such an environment with prevailing high organic c and n and anaerobic soil conditions was negligible this corresponds to the observed low nh4 oxidation rate table 4 this result is in contrast to stevens et al 1997 who stated that the soils previously treated with ammonium nitrate produce n2o deriving 30 from denitrification and 70 from nitrification this can be attributed to the soil environment and higher c and n content next to denitrification oxidation of organic n was the next most important n2o production pathway it can be attributed to specific microbial groups performing oxidation steps of organic n to no2 and then reduction to gaseous n which can operate simultaneously possibly in different soil habitats müller et al 2006 concluded that soils which are not disturbed for a long period can harbour microbial consortia of different groups similar to our finding past research emmerling et al 2002 rütting et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 reported that in addition to nitrification and denitrification oxidation of organic no2 can produce n2o zhang et al 2015 however in icw soils this pathway has not been described so far but only for arable and forest soils zhu et al 2011 stange et al 2013a b co denitrification also contributed a small fraction of n2o in comparison to denitrification and oxidation of organic n occurrence of low co denitrification can be attributed to the high anaerobiocity of the environment because co denitrification requires microaerophilic soil conditions zhou et al 2001 which are not likely to exist here as the soils are underlain by water for the entire year while they are rich in organic c that consumes oxygen 5 conclusions along with the removal capacity the n cycling processes and resulting reactive forms within icw soils need to be understood to comprehensively evaluate their health economic and environmental impacts as a high n rich system gross n transformations in icw bed soils will provide insights into the delivery pathways of the n transformation products mineralization and immobilization of nh4 processes showed that recalcitrant organic n was predominant in cw soils whereas the labile organic n was comparatively small at both soil bed depths no3 reduction via denitrification or dnra was very small because its production was very low however when compared with the two no3 reduction processes dnra appeared to have been the dominant pathway nitrification rate in icw soils was very low indicating that icw is not a good source of no3 heterotrophic nitrification oxidation of organic n to no3 was evident in icw soils and found to be responsible for 28 33 of the total nitrification the ratio between the total nitrification and total immobilization being very small implies that no3 production and reduction processes are not an obvious issue in icws whilst nh4 is prevalent form in terms of production recycling and release even though nh4 desorption rate was greater than the absorption particularly at depth two the immobilization was the dominant n cycle process which was higher than the total nh4 production by mineralization resulting in a net immobilization source partitioning of n2o suing the four pool model showed that denitrification was the dominant process accounting for 93 of the total n2o produced by all the pathways these results can be considered to alter n biogeochemistry by improving the design and management of icws author agreement mmrj and kgr designed the study mmrj of and rc performed the study mmrj and cm preformed the ntrace and data

17734,iron corrosion in drinking water distribution systems causes water discoloration water quality deterioration hydraulic loss and even pipe failures which are usually influenced by pipe scale structure water hydraulics water chemistry and other factors this work evaluated the effects of chloride sulfate and dissolved inorganic carbon dic on iron release from a 90 year old cast iron pipe section at water ph 8 0 under stagnant conditions experimental results showed that the addition of 150 mg l sulfate to water significantly increased the mean total iron concentrations to 1 13 2 68 mg l relative to 0 54 0 79 mg l for the baseline water with only 10 mg c l dic similar results were observed under conditions when chloride was added and when sulfate and chloride were added together in contrast the mean total iron concentrations were significantly reduced by 53 80 in waters with higher dic of 50 mg c l as compared to similar waters with lower dic of 10 mg c l the larson ratio could be a good indicator for iron release depending on the circumstances iron release was predicted by molecular radial diffusion modelling that accounted for water quality scale characteristics hydraulics and other condition related information the results provided insightful information for water systems that have cast iron pipes and galvanized iron pipes and that might encounter changes in water treatment and water sources more studies are needed to better understand the cast iron corrosion mechanisms under the examined water chemistries graphical abstract image 1 keywords iron corrosion water discoloration chloride sulfate dissolved inorganic carbon molecular diffusion model 1 introduction corrosion control of water distribution system materials including premise plumbing is of high priority for water utilities in the united states u s to maintain acceptable chemical and microbial drinking water quality epa 1991a a recent survey showed that 31 of water mains are comprised of old cast iron pipes or galvanized iron pipes folkman 2018 it is difficult to estimate the number of galvanized iron pipes in service lines and premise plumbing systems because of the efforts to remove galvanized iron materials due to its strong association with discoloration water complaints and unpredictable nature regarding corrosion tang et al 2018 however many water utilities still have aged cast and galvanized iron pipes in their water systems that can be heavily tuberculated with complicated layered scale structures developed over decades sarin et al 2004a gerke et al 2008 little et al 2014 although not a direct public health risk like leaded materials corrosion of iron based materials is of concern as the tubercles or scales on the iron pipe surface exert a disinfectant demand

2004a 2014 imran et al 2005a iron release refers to the movement of soluble or particulate iron from the corroded iron pipe wall to the bulk drinking water iron can cause variations in water color ranging from yellow to dark red and imparts a metallic taste and smell to the water epa 1991b in order to minimize aesthetic issues related to iron in drinking water the u s environmental protection agency epa has set a secondary maximum contaminant level for a total iron of 0 3 mg l epa 1991b that applies to iron in the source water previous studies have explored the relationship between iron release from iron pipe scale and pipe age pipe scale structure water quality flow conditions and other factors mcneill and edwards 2001 deberry et al 1982 blengino et al 1995 benjamin et al 1996 sarin et al 2001 2003 2004a 2004b zhang and edwards 2007 tang et al 2018 the structure and properties of iron corrosion by product scales or tubercles are critical to understanding iron release sarin et al 2001 2003 2004a iron pipe scales start from the pipe wall and grow radially inwards toward the center of a corroded site the scales vary by water distribution systems and iron pipe samples but share somewhat similar structures sontheimer et al 1981 herro and port 1993 herro 1998 sarin et al 2001 2003 ray et al 2010 typical iron scales have four distinct layered structures 1 a corroded floor which is located on the corroded pipe metal surface 2 a porous core layer that is closest to the corroded floor dominated by reduced ferrous iron fe ii minerals such as fe oh 2 green rusts and feco3 3 a middle hard shell like layer that covers the inner layer dominated by magnetite fe3o4 and goethite α feooh minerals and 4 a relatively loosely held top surface layer dominated by ferric fe iii oxy hydroxides minerals such as fe oh 3 and lepidocrocite γ feooh sarin et al 2004a herro and port 1993 the formation of fe iii minerals increases as the distance from the iron metal increases whereas fe ii minerals tend to form close to iron metal surface reflecting a redox gradient the siderite conceptual model sontheimer et al 1981 and kuch corrosion model kuch 1988 described the major pathways of iron release into the bulk water under different conditions which were later expanded by sarin et al 2001 2004a generally iron release from iron pipe scale is controlled by oxidation reduction corrosion of iron metal and developed fe ii and iii minerals dissolution of fe ii and iii scale minerals velocity induced erosion and scouring and other mechanisms benson et al 2012 the porosity of scale layers is one factor determining the diffusion processes between scale layers benjamin et al 1996 as a result the porous inner layer promotes the migration of fe ii and other ions within the middle hard shell layer which isolates the porous core layer from the bulk water and minimize corrosion and iron release into the bulk water sarin et al 2003 benson et al 2012 therefore the thickness and properties of the hard shell layer play an important role in controlling iron release into the bulk water which is highly influenced by water chemistry water chemistry e g oxidants ph alkalinity chloride sulfate corrosion inhibitors affects the water scale interface interactions and reactions scale microstructure and iron release by changing water redox and corrosivity baylis 1926 larson and skold 1958 deberry et al 1982 sarin et al 2003 2004b lytle et al 2005a imran et al 2005a zhang and edwards 2007 yang et al 2014 tang et al 2018 the presence of important oxidants such as dissolved oxygen do and free chlorine increases the oxidation of iron metal to fe ii and then to fe iii ions which would hydrolyze to form denser and less permeable fe iii minerals within scales resulting in an overall decrease of iron release relative to when there were no water oxidants lytle et al 2004b sarin et al 2003 zhang and edwards 2007 the decrease of iron release due to the presence of oxidants in water could also be enhanced with flowing water conditions resulting from increasing transport of oxidants to the surface of the iron pipe scale sarin et al 2004b increase of water ph decreased iron release particularly alkaline environments promoted fe ii oxidation rates and formation of the denser fe iii oxy hydroxides minerals within the scale which resisted the diffusion of iron into the bulk water in contrast lower ph led to the formation of more porous fe ii layer baylis 1926 cornell and schwertmann 2003 benson et al 2012 similarly higher alkalinity could maintain a more robust scale structure that was resistant to iron release by providing a higher buffering capacity that prevented ph changes sarin et al 2004a corrosion inhibitors such as orthophosphate reduced iron release and the exact mechanisms were uncertain mcneill and edwards 2000 2001 benson et al 2012 lytle et al 2005a but sarin et al 2003 indicated that phosphate inhibitors helped to form an insoluble and less permeable phosphate scale layer that resisted iron release into the bulk water other important water parameters chloride and sulfate were shown to have mixed results on iron release mcneill and edwards 2001 lytle et al 2005a benson et al 2012 tang et al 2013 and the presence of sulfate could change the composition of iron scale when sulfate reducing bacteria were present reducing sulfate to sulfide based precipitates lytle et al 2005b burlingame et al 2006 even though larson and skold 1957 1958 showed that chloride and sulfate increased the water corrosivity to iron and bicarbonate protected iron pipe as indicated by the larson ratio equation 1 more research is still needed to explore the impact of bicarbonate chloride and sulfate on iron release from iron pipe scale along with

pieper et al 2017 an improved understanding of iron scale drinking water interactions may lead to adoption of more comprehensive drinking water practices that improve distribution system water quality protect human health and predict distribution system responses to source water or treatment changes the objective of this work was to examine the impact of changes in chloride sulfate and dissolved inorganic carbon dic on iron release from a 90 year old cast iron pipe section under stagnant conditions specifically 1 the impact of the water quality parameters on iron release ph changes and do depletion was examined 2 the relationship between the larson ratio and iron release was investigated and 3 the actual iron release from stagnation studies and the predicted iron release from a molecule diffusion model were compared 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus a 15 6 cm long 90 year old cast iron pipe section 10 2 cm inside diameter id was removed from the city of cincinnati ohio drinking water distribution system supporting information fig s1 the inner pipe wall diameter measured approximately 1 3 cm less than its original specifications indicating corrosion related tuberculation the pipe was positioned vertically and each end of the pipe was fitted with two airtight clear acrylic plexiglass plates that were bolted to rings that supported the pipe section and prevented air i e oxygen from interacting with the pipe interior the bottom plate was fitted with an inlet port connected to a 6 4 mm id plastic tube used to pump water from a 4 liter water reservoir into the pipe the top plate also had a water outlet port as well as three additional sampling ports from which water could be sampled and other water quality could be measured in situ 2 2 testing water conditions and analyses four liters of test water for the nine different test conditions assigned as a i was prepared from laboratory double distilled water which referred to the water generated by slowly boiling the condensed water vapor from a prior slow boiling table 1 the nine testing water conditions were comprised of water ph 8 0 dic of 10 or 50 mg c l or 42 or 210 mg l alkalinity as caco3 chloride of 0 or 150 mg l and sulfate of 0 or 150 mg l table 1 si 1 with exception of ph the range of test water conditions encompassed values in the original drinking water from the community where the cast iron pipe was harvested lytle et al 2005a the ph was approximately 0 5 1 0 ph unit lower than the original source however the pipe section has been conditioned at ph 8 0 for years prior to this study in total twenty two water condition changes were made to the iron pipe apparatus to represent water treatment and source water changes in chloride sulfate and dic parameters in practice the 4 liter test water was completely mixed with a magnetic stir plate after appropriate amounts of chemicals were added to achieve desired water quality after the 4 liter fresh water preparation a 200 ml water sample was collected to record the initial temperature ph do dic and metal measurements next 1 5 liters of test water was pumped through the inlet port into the pipe section at a rate of 50 ml min excess water flowed out the top outlet to waste and the remaining 2 5 liter water was used to fill the pipe section the water was then allowed to stagnate 24 h during the week and 48 h over the weekend following each stagnation period water samples were drawn by syringe through one of the top sampling ports the syringe was inserted in the center of the pipe so that the tip was approximately 4 cm from the bottom plexiglass plate the samples were analyzed for water ph water temperature and do levels upon collection si 1 meanwhile collected water samples were also appropriately preserved for metal analyses total iron and fe ii were measured using a spectrophotometric method per ferrorver method method 8008 and per 1 10 phenanthroline method 8146 on the hach model 2700 loveland co respectively apha awwa wef 1995 the difference between the total iron and fe ii represented the fe iii species the detection limit of the hach spectrophotometric method for total iron was 0 03 mg l and for fe ii was 0 008 mg l in order to confirm the hach spectrophotometric results metals including total iron in the majority of water samples were also analyzed with a thermo jarrel ash franklin ma 61e purged inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes per standard method 200 7 apha awwa wef 1995 ultrapure 16n nitric acid ultrex j t baker chemical company phillipsburg nj was used to preserve samples at 0 15 v v for metals analysis the detection limit of icp aes for total iron was 0 001 mg l for data quality assurance and quality control standards blanks and spikes of known concentrations accounted for 10 of the measured samples 2 3 stagnation studies and molecular diffusion model representative water conditions a d were selected to examine the relationship between total iron release and do depletion during up to 72 h of stagnation time using the same pipe apparatus the total iron levels were measured using the spectrophotometric method and do levels were measured as indicated above in order to validate the results of the experiment and have more confidence in the data obtained a radial molecular diffusion model was employed kuch and wagner 1983 the model was originally developed to describe lead release from lead pipe walls and it was adapted to model the release of iron from cast iron pipe scale this model assumed that iron concentration was constant along the pipe and the transfer of iron from cast iron pipe was controlled by diffusion across a thin layer adjacent to the pipe wall equations 2 4

normally distributed data shapiro wilk test p 0 05 t test or one way anova was used to compare the mean iron concentrations among different water conditions for non parametric or non normally distributed data shapiro wilk test p 0 05 rank tests including mann whitney test kruskal wallis and spearman s rank correlation were used to compare the median iron concentrations among iron data groups and the associations between different parameters for validation purposes a linear regression was conducted between measured iron levels from stagnation studies and modeled iron levels from the molecular diffusion model 3 results nine water conditions representing different combinations of chloride sulfate and dic concentrations were evaluated for 801 days at an initial water ph 8 0 and temperature of 23 1 2 c table 1 fig s4 twenty two water condition changes were made to the 90 year old cast iron pipe section apparatus over the study period alternating conditions allowed for the evaluation of the impact of rapid water quality change on iron release water ph change and do depletion over 24 hr stagnation periods although water samples were collected after 48 hr and 72 hr stagnation periods they were not statistically different from 24 hr samples therefore were not discussed 3 1 total iron and fe ii release out of the total 328 collected water samples 176 water samples were measured for total iron levels by both spectrophotometric and icp aes methods for the 176 water samples the total iron release throughout the 801 day study ranged from below detection limit level bdl 0 03 mg l up to 4 1 mg l by spectrophotometric method and from bdl 0 001 mg l up to 3 95 mg l by icp aes method the average and median levels were 0 90 mg l and 0 84 mg l by spectrophotometric method and 0 62 mg l and 0 57 mg l by icp aes method and the total iron by both methods was in good agreement when both analyses were on the same sample spearman s rho 0 79 p 0 001 fig s2 since iron results by the spectrophotometric method were available for all collected water samples as compared to only 54 by icp aes the iron results by the spectrophotometric method were reported below as the speciation of iron released into water indicates redox reaction phases the total fe ii in 326 out of 328 collected water samples was measured and ranged from 0 008 to 0 30 mg l with an average and median of 0 07 mg l and 0 06 mg l respectively figs s3 a the ratio between fe ii and total iron ranged from 0 to 0 52 with a median of 0 06 figs s3 b this finding indicates that fe iii was the prevalent iron form in the collected water samples this information was consistent with established knowledge that at alkaline ph of 8 0 oxidation of fe ii to fe iii is very fast when sufficient do is present in water kester et al 1975 millero 1985 li et al 2016 as all samples were taken from the center of the vertical cast iron pipe section better sampling and preservation methods might be necessary to identify the fe ii and fe iii species in water both near and far away from the pipe wall the iron species profile across the pipe radius could be critical in understanding the mechanisms associated with iron release under each water quality 3 2 the effect of chloride and sulfate to examine the effect of sulfate conditions a and b were alternated repeatedly for the first 134 days the cast iron pipe section was first filled with baseline water condition a containing 10 mg l dic for 49 days table 1 fig 1 the total iron concentration or iron indicated later remained relatively constant with an average of 0 79 0 19 mg l for the first 49 days between days 50 112 150 mg l sulfate was added to the pipe section condition b and the average iron was 1 13 0 06 mg l resulting in an immediate 0 34 mg l increase in iron levels with a statistically significant difference mann whitney test p 0 001 water conditions a and b were executed again during days 113 134 a similar trend was observed when adding sulfate to condition b during days 127 134 the average iron increased to 1 07 mg l compared to 0 62 0 22 mg l for condition a during days 113 126 t test p 0 001 additionally the increase in average iron due to the addition of sulfate during the second alternation almost doubled during days 50 112 this indicated that sulfate could have a lasting effect on scale structure that impacted the scales ability to increase the diffusion of iron into the bulk water the impact of chloride and sulfate was examined by alternating conditions a e multiple times table 1 fig 1 the baseline condition a was resumed between days 135 147 resulting in an average iron concentration of 0 65 0 11 mg l similar to that of the previous two time periods in which condition a was tested kruskal wallis test p 0 40 on day 148 condition c water containing 100 mg l chloride was added to the pipe section until day 162 this experiment resulted in an immediate and significant increase in the average iron concentration by 1 23 mg l relative to the baseline t test p 0 001 on day 162 condition d water containing 100 mg l chloride and 150 mg l sulfate was tested for 21 days until day 182 and the average iron was 2 11 0 36 mg l then condition b without chloride was resumed on day 183 until day 216 resulting in a further increase in the average iron concentration to 2 68 0 34 mg l the average iron concentration for condition b was significantly higher than that found in conditions c or d t test p 0 034 but condition c was statistically similar to condition d mann whitney test p 0 69 this change indicates that the addition of both chloride and sulfate to the test water did not severely alter the iron release comparative to the addition of chloride alone in order to validate the above observations the alternations between conditions a d was executed again between days 217 266 but in a slightly different order specifically the cast iron apparatus was resumed with the baseline of condition a on day 217 then followed by condition b on day 231 condition d on day 245 and condition c on day 259 the average iron levels for conditions a b d and c were 0 54 0 12 mg l 1 41 0 17 mg l 1 68 0 14 mg l and 1 83 0 10 mg l respectively similar results were obtained with the addition of both chloride and sulfate the iron release in condition d increased significantly as compared to the baseline condition a t test p 0 001 which was not worse than condition c with chloride only t test p 0 13 however condition c was significantly worse than when water was added with sulfate only in condition b mann whitney test p 0 017 another group of alternation among conditions b e was followed between days 267 441 on day 267 condition e with 10 mg l chloride was introduced to the apparatus for 36 days and the average iron concentration was 0 59 0 12 mg l similar to previous periods with condition a that did not have chloride kruskal wallis test p 0 33 then the same apparatus was tested with condition c on day 303 condition d on day 322 and condition b on day 403 the average iron levels for conditions c d and b were 1 53 0 39 mg l 1 53 0 19 and 1 13 0 22 mg l respectively the iron release from conditions b d was significantly higher relative to e without any chloride or sulfate p 0 002 in this case iron release in condition d with both chloride and sulfate was not worse than condition c with chloride only or condition b with sulfate only kruskal wallis test p 0 073 3 3 effect of increasing dic concentration the baseline condition a was resumed on day 442 for 13 days with an average iron of 0 58 0 02 mg l and the remainder of conditions f i were run using 50 mg c l dic as opposed to 10 mg c l between days 455 608 table 1 fig 1 condition f with only 50 mg c l dic was studied between days 454 498 and it significantly reduced the average iron concentration by 57 to 0 25 0 08 mg l relative to condition a t test p 0 001 adding 150 mg l of sulfate to condition g resulted in an average iron of 0 37 0 09 mg l between days 499 539 the additions of 100 mg l of chloride and 150 mg l of sulfate to condition h resulted in an average iron of 0 43 0 21 mg l between days 540 548 adding 150 mg l of chloride and 150 mg l of sulfate in condition i resulted in an average iron of 0 51 0 21 mg l between days 549 608 these additions resulted in an insignificant increase of iron release for conditions g i that contained sulfate and or chloride in them relative to f that contained only dic kruskal wallis test p 0 073 however the average iron release for waters with higher dic of 50 mg c l in g and h was significantly lower than waters with lower dic of 10 mg c l b and d that were run previously g vs b h vs d p 0 001 these findings indicate the beneficial impact of dic resisting iron release from the iron scale repeating condition d on days 609 801 resulted in a significant increase in average iron to 0 63 0 06 mg l mann whitney test p 0 001 the change in average iron might be caused by the decrease of dic which could have outweighed the benefit due to the decrease of chloride 3 4 larson ratio do depletion and ph changes it was apparent that chloride sulfate and dic impacted iron release in different ways iron release was divided into eight groups according to the larson ratio ranging from 0 to 7 13 table 1 observations to examine if adding dic had a lasting effect in resisting iron release the relationship between iron release and the laron ratio consisted of three phases these phases were 1 when dic 10 mg c l during elapsed time 1 454 days fig 2 a 2 when dic 10 and 50 mg c l during elapsed time 1 608 days fig 2b and 3 when dic 10 and 50 mg c l during elapsed time 1 801 days fig 2c the larson ratio moderately predicted iron release levels when water conditions contained low levels of dic that is a measurement of 10 mg c l spearman s rho 0 61 p 0 001 fig 2a when waters were switched to higher levels of dic of 50 mg c l there was a slightly stronger association between iron release and the larson ratio spearman s rho 0 68 p 0 001 fig 2b this observation supported the idea that changes in the larson ratio could be qualitative indicator of iron release however when water conditions switched from higher dic of 50 mg c l to lower dic of 10 mg c l the overall association between iron release and the larson ratio greatly decreased spearman s rho 0 32 p 0 001 fig 2c we speculate that the dic had a long lasting effect on promoting the scale stability and resisting iron release as the larson ratio does not account for the structure of the pipe scale or the effect of previous water chemistries the larson ratio could be limited in predicting iron release depending on the order of water treatment changes the changes in other important water parameters such as ph and do were consistent to the observations by li et al 2016 table 1 figs s5 and s6 in general the ph increased and the do depleted over time the initial and final average ph ranged from 7 39 8 36 and 8 28 9 39 respectively the ph increase was 0 94 0 38 unit which could have been a result of the pipe metal or scale corroding and producing hydroxide ions sarin et al 2004b in contrast the initial do was 6 69 9 37 mg l and decreased by 5 25 1 55 mg l after 24 h of stagnation due to the oxidation of fe ii and pipe scale and iron corrosion 3 5 stagnation studies and molecular diffusion model representative water conditions a d were used for stagnation studies that were carried out for up to 72 h of stagnation periods fig 3 a d the iron release for the baseline condition a had a relatively linear upward trend over time specifically the iron release was 0 58 mg l after 24 h and it increased to 1 14 mg l after 48 h it kept increasing to 1 86 mg l after 72 h of stagnation in contrast with the addition of chloride or sulfate the iron release for conditions b d had a relatively more rapid increase and reached a steady state after 24 h of stagnation after 16 19 h of stagnation the iron release for conditions b c and d was 1 39 mg l 0 53 mg l and 1 45 mg l respectively after 24 h of stagnation the iron release for b c and d at the steady state measured 1 6 mg l 2 0 mg l and 2 0 mg l respectively the increase in iron release suggested the addition of chloride and sulfate enhanced the kinetics of iron release from the scale into water to validate the measured iron levels the molecular diffusion model was adapted and the iron levels obtained from the model suggested a favorable agreement with the experimental results with a r2 of 0 89 0 97 linear regression p 0 001 calculation s1 fig 3e table s1 the mass transfer coefficients βα indicate the additional resistance layer of iron pipe scale was different measuring 2 04 10 5 cm

of chloride sulfate and dic levels in the water additionally the changes in iron release were rapid and instantaneous in response to the changes in chloride sulfate and dic levels the rapid response without a lingering impact suggested that the likelihood of damage to the iron pipe scale integrity was low it consistently showed that upon the addition of chloride and or sulfate the total iron concentration immediately elevated relative to iron levels in waters containing only dic particularly for waters with lower dic in contrast waters with higher dic 50 mg c l vs 10 mg c l reduced iron release even when high concentrations of chloride and sulfate were present countering their negative impact the detrimental effect of chloride on iron release was found in other studies lytle et al 2005a peng et al 2013 pieper et al 2018 hu et al 2018 and could be explained by the conceptual iron release model developed by sarin et al 2004b in short chloride may promote local ph drops and the formation of electrolytic cells encouraging the dissolution of fe ii both changes gradually help form a porous scale that assists with the diffusion of dissolved fe ii into water liu et al 2013 showed that increasing chloride levels favored the formation of loose and porous microcrystalline lepidocrocite on the iron scale surface meantime the fe ii ions formed within the inner porous scale attract negatively charged ions such as chloride and sulfate which results in further corrosion additionally chloride slows down the oxygenation rate of fe ii to fe iii such that fe ii can diffuse further distances through the pipe scale before its oxidation to fe iii tamura et al 1976 this finding also explains the correlation between higher levels of dic or bicarbonate assists in reducing iron release the increasing levels of dic could provide increasing buffering capacity resist ph ranges within the tubercle and limit the mobility of fe ii chloride and sulfate anions and impact fe ii solubility though other studies showed that sulfate increased total iron release liu et al 2013 peng et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 hu et al 2018 the impact of sulfate on iron release was inconsistent in this study iron release in water containing sulfate alone could increase or decrease in waters with chloride and sulfate depending on the circumstances and the associated mechanisms remained unresolved it was speculated that sulfate ions in water possibly impacted the iron scale structure iron solubility or bacterial community in scale increasing sulfate was shown to favor the formation of hard shell goethite liu et al 2013 and was also associated with sulfur oxidizing bacteria sulfate reducing bacteria and iron reducing bacteria present in scale influencing iron release into water lytle et al 2005b yang et al 2014 the larson ratio has long been used to indicate the severity of iron corrosion the water samples with a larger larson ratio of 1 2 indicating high corrosivity of iron had statistically higher iron levels relative to those with larson ratio of 0 8 mann whitney test p 0 001 though a higher larson ratio can successfully predict a higher iron release the association between the larson ratios and iron concentrations was dependent on the circumstances in this case the water treatment changes fig 2 it might be necessary to incorporate other water parameters not considered in this work that are important to iron scale build up and release into the larson ratio for better prediction for example imran et al 2005b incorporated water temperature and hydraulic residence time or water age parameters into the equation to give better results 4 2 molecular diffusion model the molecular radial diffusion model reasonably predicted the release of total iron under stagnation periods based on the regression results despite complexities and uncertainties regarding the true nature of iron i e soluble versus particulate iron and ferrous versus ferric iron it was noteworthy that the mass transfer coefficients reflecting the resistance layer composed of iron scale solids were calculated based on measured iron levels during stagnation studies due to the lack of information on scale characteristics calculation s1 as water conditions b d reached equilibrium after 24 h of stagnation based on the βα values the calculated thickness of the resistance layer for 24 h of stagnation time was 1 76 cm 30 28 cm 6 65 cm and 21 52 cm for a b c and d water conditions respectively these calculated βα values for resistance layers were considerably high relative to the effective cast iron diameter of 8 9 cm although the model provides quantitative experimental data it failed to capture the iron mass transfer from the resistance layer mechanistically it might be necessary to re evaluate the assumption about molecular diffusion being the controlling mechanism for iron release instead the iron pipe scale porosity structure composition thickness and other properties were likely to play a critical role in controlling the iron release and therefore should be incorporated in the model including more information about water hydraulics involvement in predicting iron release from real water distribution systems is another consideration one study showed that the mass transfer coefficient for chlorine dissipation in drinking water systems was a function of water flow pipe length and pipe diameter for galvanized iron pipe and unlined cast iron pipe mutoti et al 2007 the reported coefficients continuously increased from 1 2 10 5 6 7 10 4 cm s as water velocity increased from 1 00 10 4 9 19 10 1 m s for galvanized iron pipe and from 5 79 10 6 3 62 10 4 cm s as water velocity increased from 7 00 10 5 2 29 10 2 m s for unlined cast iron pipe therefore a better understanding of iron diffusion processes pipe scale characteristics and water hydraulics is necessary for more accurate model prediction 4 3 implications and limitations the results from this study provide useful information for water utilities who may be considering making changes or are experiencing changes in their water treatment e g switch to chloride or sulfate based coagulants and or water sources e g switch from ground water to surface water the control of iron release addition of buffering capacity or reduction of chloride or sulfate may help stabilize the water quality in the distribution system however in order to mitigate contaminants in each water system the control of lead copper and other unique contaminants needs to be assessed and prioritized based on the water quality and corrosion control needs this study gives some insight into iron release and corrosion but there are still many limitations first the water conditions were tested at ph 8 0 which was considered likely to exacerbate iron corrosion relative to other phs masters and edwards 2015 tang et al 2018 additionally the examined waters sometimes contained higher levels of chloride 100 150 mg l and sulfate 150 mg l comparative to what is generally found in water distribution systems cincinnati tap water had an average chloride of 34 mg l and sulfate of 65 mg l in previous work lytle et al 2005a the 2 3 times higher chloride and sulfate concentrations examined in this study had the potential to be more aggressive toward iron release than cincinnati tap water second it would be unlikely to have 24 72 h of stagnation time in water mains under normal operating conditions and similar stagnation time is more likely in residential distribution lines often highly dependent on water demand and uses third all nine water conditions were examined using the cast iron pipe section consecutively and the uptake of dic by the pipe was not monitored additionally inner pipe surface analyses to identify changes in pipe scale properties including mineralogy elemental make up and structural integrity could not be performed because the pipe section remains in use for other investigations therefore the associated mechanisms for elucidating the impact of each individual parameter demand further study future examination of iron species in collected water samples and pipe scale samples could give insight into the issue future experiments could also feature a pipe loop that models variable flows present in real distribution systems and contain typical levels of constituents there could also be pipes made from various materials so that differences in materials can be studied 5 conclusions iron corrosion and iron release are relevant problems in all water distribution systems the results show that bicarbonate helps reduce iron release while chloride and sulfate are linked to increased iron release the extent to which these components affect iron release is not completely understood the results discussed in this paper provide insight for water utilities considering making changes to the treatment of source water in water distribution systems operating with cast iron or aged galvanized iron pipe materials the larson ratio could be an effective predictor of iron release although it should be used with caution while the molecular diffusion

17734,iron corrosion in drinking water distribution systems causes water discoloration water quality deterioration hydraulic loss and even pipe failures which are usually influenced by pipe scale structure water hydraulics water chemistry and other factors this work evaluated the effects of chloride sulfate and dissolved inorganic carbon dic on iron release from a 90 year old cast iron pipe section at water ph 8 0 under stagnant conditions experimental results showed that the addition of 150 mg l sulfate to water significantly increased the mean total iron concentrations to 1 13 2 68 mg l relative to 0 54 0 79 mg l for the baseline water with only 10 mg c l dic similar results were observed under conditions when chloride was added and when sulfate and chloride were added together in contrast the mean total iron concentrations were significantly reduced by 53 80 in waters with higher dic of 50 mg c l as compared to similar waters with lower dic of 10 mg c l the larson ratio could be a good indicator for iron release depending on the circumstances iron release was predicted by molecular radial diffusion modelling that accounted for water quality scale characteristics hydraulics and other condition related information the results provided insightful information for water systems that have cast iron pipes and galvanized iron pipes and that might encounter changes in water treatment and water sources more studies are needed to better understand the cast iron corrosion mechanisms under the examined water chemistries graphical abstract image 1 keywords iron corrosion water discoloration chloride sulfate dissolved inorganic carbon molecular diffusion model 1 introduction corrosion control of water distribution system materials including premise plumbing is of high priority for water utilities in the united states u s to maintain acceptable chemical and microbial drinking water quality epa 1991a a recent survey showed that 31 of water mains are comprised of old cast iron pipes or galvanized iron pipes folkman 2018 it is difficult to estimate the number of galvanized iron pipes in service lines and premise plumbing systems because of the efforts to remove galvanized iron materials due to its strong association with discoloration water complaints and unpredictable nature regarding corrosion tang et al 2018 however many water utilities still have aged cast and galvanized iron pipes in their water systems that can be heavily tuberculated with complicated layered scale structures developed over decades sarin et al 2004a gerke et al 2008 little et al 2014 although not a direct public health risk like leaded materials corrosion of iron based materials is of concern as the tubercles or scales on the iron pipe surface exert a disinfectant demand harbor biofilm create head loss build up accumulate trace contaminants and produce discolored water due to iron release mcneill and edwards 2001 lechevallier et al 1993 benjamin et al 1996 lytle et al 2004a 2014 imran et al 2005a iron release refers to the movement of soluble or particulate iron from the corroded iron pipe wall to the bulk drinking water iron can cause variations in water color ranging from yellow to dark red and imparts a metallic taste and smell to the water epa 1991b in order to minimize aesthetic issues related to iron in drinking water the u s environmental protection agency epa has set a secondary maximum contaminant level for a total iron of 0 3 mg l epa 1991b that applies to iron in the source water previous studies have explored the relationship between iron release from iron pipe scale and pipe age pipe scale structure water quality flow conditions and other factors mcneill and edwards 2001 deberry et al 1982 blengino et al 1995 benjamin et al 1996 sarin et al 2001 2003 2004a 2004b zhang and edwards 2007 tang et al 2018 the structure and properties of iron corrosion by product scales or tubercles are critical to understanding iron release sarin et al 2001 2003 2004a iron pipe scales start from the pipe wall and grow radially inwards toward the center of a corroded site the scales vary by water distribution systems and iron pipe samples but share somewhat similar structures sontheimer et al 1981 herro and port 1993 herro 1998 sarin et al 2001 2003 ray et al 2010 typical iron scales have four distinct layered structures 1 a corroded floor which is located on the corroded pipe metal surface 2 a porous core layer that is closest to the corroded floor dominated by reduced ferrous iron fe ii minerals such as fe oh 2 green rusts and feco3 3 a middle hard shell like layer that covers the inner layer dominated by magnetite fe3o4 and goethite α feooh minerals and 4 a relatively loosely held top surface layer dominated by ferric fe iii oxy hydroxides minerals such as fe oh 3 and lepidocrocite γ feooh sarin et al 2004a herro and port 1993 the formation of fe iii minerals increases as the distance from the iron metal increases whereas fe ii minerals tend to form close to iron metal surface reflecting a redox gradient the siderite conceptual model sontheimer et al 1981 and kuch corrosion model kuch 1988 described the major pathways of iron release into the bulk water under different conditions which were later expanded by sarin et al 2001 2004a generally iron release from iron pipe scale is controlled by oxidation reduction corrosion of iron metal and developed fe ii and iii minerals dissolution of fe ii and iii scale minerals velocity induced erosion and scouring and other mechanisms benson et al 2012 the porosity of scale layers is one factor determining the diffusion processes between scale layers benjamin et al 1996 as a result the porous inner layer promotes the migration of fe ii and other ions within the middle hard shell layer which isolates the porous core layer from the bulk water and minimize corrosion and iron release into the bulk water sarin et al 2003 benson et al 2012 therefore the thickness and properties of the hard shell layer play an important role in controlling iron release into the bulk water which is highly influenced by water chemistry water chemistry e g oxidants ph alkalinity chloride sulfate corrosion inhibitors affects the water scale interface interactions and reactions scale microstructure and iron release by changing water redox and corrosivity baylis 1926 larson and skold 1958 deberry et al 1982 sarin et al 2003 2004b lytle et al 2005a imran et al 2005a zhang and edwards 2007 yang et al 2014 tang et al 2018 the presence of important oxidants such as dissolved oxygen do and free chlorine increases the oxidation of iron metal to fe ii and then to fe iii ions which would hydrolyze to form denser and less permeable fe iii minerals within scales resulting in an overall decrease of iron release relative to when there were no water oxidants lytle et al 2004b sarin et al 2003 zhang and edwards 2007 the decrease of iron release due to the presence of oxidants in water could also be enhanced with flowing water conditions resulting from increasing transport of oxidants to the surface of the iron pipe scale sarin et al 2004b increase of water ph decreased iron release particularly alkaline environments promoted fe ii oxidation rates and formation of the denser fe iii oxy hydroxides minerals within the scale which resisted the diffusion of iron into the bulk water in contrast lower ph led to the formation of more porous fe ii layer baylis 1926 cornell and schwertmann 2003 benson et al 2012 similarly higher alkalinity could maintain a more robust scale structure that was resistant to iron release by providing a higher buffering capacity that prevented ph changes sarin et al 2004a corrosion inhibitors such as orthophosphate reduced iron release and the exact mechanisms were uncertain mcneill and edwards 2000 2001 benson et al 2012 lytle et al 2005a but sarin et al 2003 indicated that phosphate inhibitors helped to form an insoluble and less permeable phosphate scale layer that resisted iron release into the bulk water other important water parameters chloride and sulfate were shown to have mixed results on iron release mcneill and edwards 2001 lytle et al 2005a benson et al 2012 tang et al 2013 and the presence of sulfate could change the composition of iron scale when sulfate reducing bacteria were present reducing sulfate to sulfide based precipitates lytle et al 2005b burlingame et al 2006 even though larson and skold 1957 1958 showed that chloride and sulfate increased the water corrosivity to iron and bicarbonate protected iron pipe as indicated by the larson ratio equation 1 more research is still needed to explore the impact of bicarbonate chloride and sulfate on iron release from iron pipe scale along with

pieper et al 2017 an improved understanding of iron scale drinking water interactions may lead to adoption of more comprehensive drinking water practices that improve distribution system water quality protect human health and predict distribution system responses to source water or treatment changes the objective of this work was to examine the impact of changes in chloride sulfate and dissolved inorganic carbon dic on iron release from a 90 year old cast iron pipe section under stagnant conditions specifically 1 the impact of the water quality parameters on iron release ph changes and do depletion was examined 2 the relationship between the larson ratio and iron release was investigated and 3 the actual iron release from stagnation studies and the predicted iron release from a molecule diffusion model were compared 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus a 15 6 cm long 90 year old cast iron pipe section 10 2 cm inside diameter id was removed from the city of cincinnati ohio drinking water distribution system supporting information fig s1 the inner pipe wall diameter measured approximately 1 3 cm less than its original specifications indicating corrosion related tuberculation the pipe was positioned vertically and each end of the pipe was fitted with two airtight clear acrylic plexiglass plates that were bolted to rings that supported the pipe section and prevented air i e oxygen from interacting with the pipe interior the bottom plate was fitted with an inlet port connected to a 6 4 mm id plastic tube used to pump water from a 4 liter water reservoir into the pipe the top plate also had a water outlet port as well as three additional sampling ports from which water could be sampled and other water quality could be measured in situ 2 2 testing water conditions and analyses four liters of test water for the nine different test conditions assigned as a i was prepared from laboratory double distilled water which referred to the water generated by slowly boiling the condensed water vapor from a prior slow boiling table 1 the nine testing water conditions were comprised of water ph 8 0 dic of 10 or 50 mg c l or 42 or 210 mg l alkalinity as caco3 chloride of 0 or 150 mg l and sulfate of 0 or 150 mg l table 1 si 1 with exception of ph the range of test water conditions encompassed values in the original drinking water from the community where the cast iron pipe was harvested lytle et al 2005a the ph was approximately 0 5 1 0 ph unit lower than the original source however the pipe section has been conditioned at ph 8 0 for years prior to this study in total twenty two water condition changes were made to the iron pipe apparatus to represent water treatment and source water changes in chloride sulfate and dic parameters in practice the 4 liter test water was completely mixed with a magnetic stir plate after appropriate amounts of chemicals were added to achieve desired water quality after the 4 liter fresh water preparation a 200 ml water sample was collected to record the initial temperature ph do dic and metal measurements next 1 5 liters of test water was pumped through the inlet port into the pipe section at a rate of 50 ml min excess water flowed out the top outlet to waste and the remaining 2 5 liter water was used to fill the pipe section the water was then allowed to stagnate 24 h during the week and 48 h over the weekend following each stagnation period water samples were drawn by syringe through one of the top sampling ports the syringe was inserted in the center of the pipe so that the tip was approximately 4 cm from the bottom plexiglass plate the samples were analyzed for water ph water temperature and do levels upon collection si 1 meanwhile collected water samples were also appropriately preserved for metal analyses total iron and fe ii were measured using a spectrophotometric method per ferrorver method method 8008 and per 1 10 phenanthroline method 8146 on the hach model 2700 loveland co respectively apha awwa wef 1995 the difference between the total iron and fe ii represented the fe iii species the detection limit of the hach spectrophotometric method for total iron was 0 03 mg l and for fe ii was 0 008 mg l in order to confirm the hach spectrophotometric results metals including total iron in the majority of water samples were also analyzed with a thermo jarrel ash franklin ma 61e purged inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes per standard method 200 7 apha awwa wef 1995 ultrapure 16n nitric acid ultrex j t baker chemical company phillipsburg nj was used to preserve samples at 0 15 v v for metals analysis the detection limit of icp aes for total iron was 0 001 mg l for data quality assurance and quality control standards blanks and spikes of known concentrations accounted for 10 of the measured samples 2 3 stagnation studies and molecular diffusion model representative water conditions a d were selected to examine the relationship between total iron release and do depletion during up to 72 h of stagnation time using the same pipe apparatus the total iron levels were measured using the spectrophotometric method and do levels were measured as indicated above in order to validate the results of the experiment and have more confidence in the data obtained a radial molecular diffusion model was employed kuch and wagner 1983 the model was originally developed to describe lead release from lead pipe walls and it was adapted to model the release of iron from cast iron pipe scale this model assumed that iron concentration was constant along the pipe and the transfer of iron from cast iron pipe was controlled by diffusion across a thin layer adjacent to the pipe wall equations 2 4

normally distributed data shapiro wilk test p 0 05 t test or one way anova was used to compare the mean iron concentrations among different water conditions for non parametric or non normally distributed data shapiro wilk test p 0 05 rank tests including mann whitney test kruskal wallis and spearman s rank correlation were used to compare the median iron concentrations among iron data groups and the associations between different parameters for validation purposes a linear regression was conducted between measured iron levels from stagnation studies and modeled iron levels from the molecular diffusion model 3 results nine water conditions representing different combinations of chloride sulfate and dic concentrations were evaluated for 801 days at an initial water ph 8 0 and temperature of 23 1 2 c table 1 fig s4 twenty two water condition changes were made to the 90 year old cast iron pipe section apparatus over the study period alternating conditions allowed for the evaluation of the impact of rapid water quality change on iron release water ph change and do depletion over 24 hr stagnation periods although water samples were collected after 48 hr and 72 hr stagnation periods they were not statistically different from 24 hr samples therefore were not discussed 3 1 total iron and fe ii release out of the total 328 collected water samples 176 water samples were measured for total iron levels by both spectrophotometric and icp aes methods for the 176 water samples the total iron release throughout the 801 day study ranged from below detection limit level bdl 0 03 mg l up to 4 1 mg l by spectrophotometric method and from bdl 0 001 mg l up to 3 95 mg l by icp aes method the average and median levels were 0 90 mg l and 0 84 mg l by spectrophotometric method and 0 62 mg l and 0 57 mg l by icp aes method and the total iron by both methods was in good agreement when both analyses were on the same sample spearman s rho 0 79 p 0 001 fig s2 since iron results by the spectrophotometric method were available for all collected water samples as compared to only 54 by icp aes the iron results by the spectrophotometric method were reported below as the speciation of iron released into water indicates redox reaction phases the total fe ii in 326 out of 328 collected water samples was measured and ranged from 0 008 to 0 30 mg l with an average and median of 0 07 mg l and 0 06 mg l respectively figs s3 a the ratio between fe ii and total iron ranged from 0 to 0 52 with a median of 0 06 figs s3 b this finding indicates that fe iii was the prevalent iron form in the collected water samples this information was consistent with established knowledge that at alkaline ph of 8 0 oxidation of fe ii to fe iii is very fast when sufficient do is present in water kester et al 1975 millero 1985 li et al 2016 as all samples were taken from the center of the vertical cast iron pipe section better sampling and preservation methods might be necessary to identify the fe ii and fe iii species in water both near and far away from the pipe wall the iron species profile across the pipe radius could be critical in understanding the mechanisms associated with iron release under each water quality 3 2 the effect of chloride and sulfate to examine the effect of sulfate conditions a and b were alternated repeatedly for the first 134 days the cast iron pipe section was first filled with baseline water condition a containing 10 mg l dic for 49 days table 1 fig 1 the total iron concentration or iron indicated later remained relatively constant with an average of 0 79 0 19 mg l for the first 49 days between days 50 112 150 mg l sulfate was added to the pipe section condition b and the average iron was 1 13 0 06 mg l resulting in an immediate 0 34 mg l increase in iron levels with a statistically significant difference mann whitney test p 0 001 water conditions a and b were executed again during days 113 134 a similar trend was observed when adding sulfate to condition b during days 127 134 the average iron increased to 1 07 mg l compared to 0 62 0 22 mg l for condition a during days 113 126 t test p 0 001 additionally the increase in average iron due to the addition of sulfate during the second alternation almost doubled during days 50 112 this indicated that sulfate could have a lasting effect on scale structure that impacted the scales ability to increase the diffusion of iron into the bulk water the impact of chloride and sulfate was examined by alternating conditions a e multiple times table 1 fig 1 the baseline condition a was resumed between days 135 147 resulting in an average iron concentration of 0 65 0 11 mg l similar to that of the previous two time periods in which condition a was tested kruskal wallis test p 0 40 on day 148 condition c water containing 100 mg l chloride was added to the pipe section until day 162 this experiment resulted in an immediate and significant increase in the average iron concentration by 1 23 mg l relative to the baseline t test p 0 001 on day 162 condition d water containing 100 mg l chloride and 150 mg l sulfate was tested for 21 days until day 182 and the average iron was 2 11 0 36 mg l then condition b without chloride was resumed on day 183 until day 216 resulting in a further increase in the average iron concentration to 2 68 0 34 mg l the average iron concentration for condition b was significantly higher than that found in conditions c or d t test p 0 034 but condition c was statistically similar to condition d mann whitney test p 0 69 this change indicates that the addition of both chloride and sulfate to the test water did not severely alter the iron release comparative to the addition of chloride alone in order to validate the above observations the alternations between conditions a d was executed again between days 217 266 but in a slightly different order specifically the cast iron apparatus was resumed with the baseline of condition a on day 217 then followed by condition b on day 231 condition d on day 245 and condition c on day 259 the average iron levels for conditions a b d and c were 0 54 0 12 mg l 1 41 0 17 mg l 1 68 0 14 mg l and 1 83 0 10 mg l respectively similar results were obtained with the addition of both chloride and sulfate the iron release in condition d increased significantly as compared to the baseline condition a t test p 0 001 which was not worse than condition c with chloride only t test p 0 13 however condition c was significantly worse than when water was added with sulfate only in condition b mann whitney test p 0 017 another group of alternation among conditions b e was followed between days 267 441 on day 267 condition e with 10 mg l chloride was introduced to the apparatus for 36 days and the average iron concentration was 0 59 0 12 mg l similar to previous periods with condition a that did not have chloride kruskal wallis test p 0 33 then the same apparatus was tested with condition c on day 303 condition d on day 322 and condition b on day 403 the average iron levels for conditions c d and b were 1 53 0 39 mg l 1 53 0 19 and 1 13 0 22 mg l respectively the iron release from conditions b d was significantly higher relative to e without any chloride or sulfate p 0 002 in this case iron release in condition d with both chloride and sulfate was not worse than condition c with chloride only or condition b with sulfate only kruskal wallis test p 0 073 3 3 effect of increasing dic concentration the baseline condition a was resumed on day 442 for 13 days with an average iron of 0 58 0 02 mg l and the remainder of conditions f i were run using 50 mg c l dic as opposed to 10 mg c l between days 455 608 table 1 fig 1 condition f with only 50 mg c l dic was studied between days 454 498 and it significantly reduced the average iron concentration by 57 to 0 25 0 08 mg l relative to condition a t test p 0 001 adding 150 mg l of sulfate to condition g resulted in an average iron of 0 37 0 09 mg l between days 499 539 the additions of 100 mg l of chloride and 150 mg l of sulfate to condition h resulted in an average iron of 0 43 0 21 mg l between days 540 548 adding 150 mg l of chloride and 150 mg l of sulfate in condition i resulted in an average iron of 0 51 0 21 mg l between days 549 608 these additions resulted in an insignificant increase of iron release for conditions g i that contained sulfate and or chloride in them relative to f that contained only dic kruskal wallis test p 0 073 however the average iron release for waters with higher dic of 50 mg c l in g and h was significantly lower than waters with lower dic of 10 mg c l b and d that were run previously g vs b h vs d p 0 001 these findings indicate the beneficial impact of dic resisting iron release from the iron scale repeating condition d on days 609 801 resulted in a significant increase in average iron to 0 63 0 06 mg l mann whitney test p 0 001 the change in average iron might be caused by the decrease of dic which could have outweighed the benefit due to the decrease of chloride 3 4 larson ratio do depletion and ph changes it was apparent that chloride sulfate and dic impacted iron release in different ways iron release was divided into eight groups according to the larson ratio ranging from 0 to 7 13 table 1 observations to examine if adding dic had a lasting effect in resisting iron release the relationship between iron release and the laron ratio consisted of three phases these phases were 1 when dic 10 mg c l during elapsed time 1 454 days fig 2 a 2 when dic 10 and 50 mg c l during elapsed time 1 608 days fig 2b and 3 when dic 10 and 50 mg c l during elapsed time 1 801 days fig 2c the larson ratio moderately predicted iron release levels when water conditions contained low levels of dic that is a measurement of 10 mg c l spearman s rho 0 61 p 0 001 fig 2a when waters were switched to higher levels of dic of 50 mg c l there was a slightly stronger association between iron release and the larson ratio spearman s rho 0 68 p 0 001 fig 2b this observation supported the idea that changes in the larson ratio could be qualitative indicator of iron release however when water conditions switched from higher dic of 50 mg c l to lower dic of 10 mg c l the overall association between iron release and the larson ratio greatly decreased spearman s rho 0 32 p 0 001 fig 2c we speculate that the dic had a long lasting effect on promoting the scale stability and resisting iron release as the larson ratio does not account for the structure of the pipe scale or the effect of previous water chemistries the larson ratio could be limited in predicting iron release depending on the order of water treatment changes the changes in other important water parameters such as ph and do were consistent to the observations by li et al 2016 table 1 figs s5 and s6 in general the ph increased and the do depleted over time the initial and final average ph ranged from 7 39 8 36 and 8 28 9 39 respectively the ph increase was 0 94 0 38 unit which could have been a result of the pipe metal or scale corroding and producing hydroxide ions sarin et al 2004b in contrast the initial do was 6 69 9 37 mg l and decreased by 5 25 1 55 mg l after 24 h of stagnation due to the oxidation of fe ii and pipe scale and iron corrosion 3 5 stagnation studies and molecular diffusion model representative water conditions a d were used for stagnation studies that were carried out for up to 72 h of stagnation periods fig 3 a d the iron release for the baseline condition a had a relatively linear upward trend over time specifically the iron release was 0 58 mg l after 24 h and it increased to 1 14 mg l after 48 h it kept increasing to 1 86 mg l after 72 h of stagnation in contrast with the addition of chloride or sulfate the iron release for conditions b d had a relatively more rapid increase and reached a steady state after 24 h of stagnation after 16 19 h of stagnation the iron release for conditions b c and d was 1 39 mg l 0 53 mg l and 1 45 mg l respectively after 24 h of stagnation the iron release for b c and d at the steady state measured 1 6 mg l 2 0 mg l and 2 0 mg l respectively the increase in iron release suggested the addition of chloride and sulfate enhanced the kinetics of iron release from the scale into water to validate the measured iron levels the molecular diffusion model was adapted and the iron levels obtained from the model suggested a favorable agreement with the experimental results with a r2 of 0 89 0 97 linear regression p 0 001 calculation s1 fig 3e table s1 the mass transfer coefficients βα indicate the additional resistance layer of iron pipe scale was different measuring 2 04 10 5 cm s 3 51 10 4 cm s 7 69 10 5 cm s and 2 49 10 4 cm s for a b c and d respectively 4 discussion 4 1 impact of chloride sulfate and dic the release of iron from the cast iron pipe apparatus was a function of chloride sulfate and dic levels in the water additionally the changes in iron release were rapid and instantaneous in response to the changes in chloride sulfate and dic levels the rapid response without a lingering impact suggested that the likelihood of damage to the iron pipe scale integrity was low it consistently showed that upon the addition of chloride and or sulfate the total iron concentration immediately elevated relative to iron levels in waters containing only dic particularly for waters with lower dic in contrast waters with higher dic 50 mg c l vs 10 mg c l reduced iron release even when high concentrations of chloride and sulfate were present countering their negative impact the detrimental effect of chloride on iron release was found in other studies lytle et al 2005a peng et al 2013 pieper et al 2018 hu et al 2018 and could be explained by the conceptual iron release model developed by sarin et al 2004b in short chloride may promote local ph drops and the formation of electrolytic cells encouraging the dissolution of fe ii both changes gradually help form a porous scale that assists with the diffusion of dissolved fe ii into water liu et al 2013 showed that increasing chloride levels favored the formation of loose and porous microcrystalline lepidocrocite on the iron scale surface meantime the fe ii ions formed within the inner porous scale attract negatively charged ions such as chloride and sulfate which results in further corrosion additionally chloride slows down the oxygenation rate of fe ii to fe iii such that fe ii can diffuse further distances through the pipe scale before its oxidation to fe iii tamura et al 1976 this finding also explains the correlation between higher levels of dic or bicarbonate assists in reducing iron release the increasing levels of dic could provide increasing buffering capacity resist ph ranges within the tubercle and limit the mobility of fe ii chloride and sulfate anions and impact fe ii solubility though other studies showed that sulfate increased total iron release liu et al 2013 peng et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 hu et al 2018 the impact of sulfate on iron release was inconsistent in this study iron release in water containing sulfate alone could increase or decrease in waters with chloride and sulfate depending on the circumstances and the associated mechanisms remained unresolved it was speculated that sulfate ions in water possibly impacted the iron scale structure iron solubility or bacterial community in scale increasing sulfate was shown to favor the formation of hard shell goethite liu et al 2013 and was also associated with sulfur oxidizing bacteria sulfate reducing bacteria and iron reducing bacteria present in scale influencing iron release into water lytle et al 2005b yang et al 2014 the larson ratio has long been used to indicate the severity of iron corrosion the water samples with a larger larson ratio of 1 2 indicating high corrosivity of iron had statistically higher iron levels relative to those with larson ratio of 0 8 mann whitney test p 0 001 though a higher larson ratio can successfully predict a higher iron release the association between the larson ratios and iron concentrations was dependent on the circumstances in this case the water treatment changes fig 2 it might be necessary to incorporate other water parameters not considered in this work that are important to iron scale build up and release into the larson ratio for better prediction for example imran et al 2005b incorporated water temperature and hydraulic residence time or water age parameters into the equation to give better results 4 2 molecular diffusion model the molecular radial diffusion model reasonably predicted the release of total iron under stagnation periods based on the regression results despite complexities and uncertainties regarding the true nature of iron i e soluble versus particulate iron and ferrous versus ferric iron it was noteworthy that the mass transfer coefficients reflecting the resistance layer composed of iron scale solids were calculated based on measured iron levels during stagnation studies due to the lack of information on scale characteristics calculation s1 as water conditions b d reached equilibrium after 24 h of stagnation based on the βα values the calculated thickness of the resistance layer for 24 h of stagnation time was 1 76 cm 30 28 cm 6 65 cm and 21 52 cm for a b c and d water conditions respectively these calculated βα values for resistance layers were considerably high relative to the effective cast iron diameter of 8 9 cm although the model provides quantitative experimental data it failed to capture the iron mass transfer from the resistance layer mechanistically it might be necessary to re evaluate the assumption about molecular diffusion being the controlling mechanism for iron release instead the iron pipe scale porosity structure composition thickness and other properties were likely to play a critical role in controlling the iron release and therefore should be incorporated in the model including more information about water hydraulics involvement in predicting iron release from real water distribution systems is another consideration one study showed that the mass transfer coefficient for chlorine dissipation in drinking water systems was a function of water flow pipe length and pipe diameter for galvanized iron pipe and unlined cast iron pipe mutoti et al 2007 the reported coefficients continuously increased from 1 2 10 5 6 7 10 4 cm s as water velocity increased from 1 00 10 4 9 19 10 1 m s for galvanized iron pipe and from 5 79 10 6 3 62 10 4 cm s as water velocity increased from 7 00 10 5 2 29 10 2 m s for unlined cast iron pipe therefore a better understanding of iron diffusion processes pipe scale characteristics and water hydraulics is necessary for more accurate model prediction 4 3 implications and limitations the results from this study provide useful information for water utilities who may be considering making changes or are experiencing changes in their water treatment e g switch to chloride or sulfate based coagulants and or water sources e g switch from ground water to surface water the control of iron release addition of buffering capacity or reduction of chloride or sulfate may help stabilize the water quality in the distribution system however in order to mitigate contaminants in each water system the control of lead copper and other unique contaminants needs to be assessed and prioritized based on the water quality and corrosion control needs this study gives some insight into iron release and corrosion but there are still many limitations first the water conditions were tested at ph 8 0 which was considered likely to exacerbate iron corrosion relative to other phs masters and edwards 2015 tang et al 2018 additionally the examined waters sometimes contained higher levels of chloride 100 150 mg l and sulfate 150 mg l comparative to what is generally found in water distribution systems cincinnati tap water had an average chloride of 34 mg l and sulfate of 65 mg l in previous work lytle et al 2005a the 2 3 times higher chloride and sulfate concentrations examined in this study had the potential to be more aggressive toward iron release than cincinnati tap water second it would be unlikely to have 24 72 h of stagnation time in water mains under normal operating conditions and similar stagnation time is more likely in residential distribution lines often highly dependent on water demand and uses third all nine water conditions were examined using the cast iron pipe section consecutively and the uptake of dic by the pipe was not monitored additionally inner pipe surface analyses to identify changes in pipe scale properties including mineralogy elemental make up and structural integrity could not be performed because the pipe section remains in use for other investigations therefore the associated mechanisms for elucidating the impact of each individual parameter demand further study future examination of iron species in collected water samples and pipe scale samples could give insight into the issue future experiments could also feature a pipe loop that models variable flows present in real distribution systems and contain typical levels of constituents there could also be pipes made from various materials so that differences in materials can be studied 5 conclusions iron corrosion and iron release are relevant problems in all water distribution systems the results show that bicarbonate helps reduce iron release while chloride and sulfate are linked to increased iron release the extent to which these components affect iron release is not completely understood the results discussed in this paper provide insight for water utilities considering making changes to the treatment of source water in water distribution systems operating with cast iron or aged galvanized iron pipe materials the larson ratio could be an effective predictor of iron release although it should be used with caution while the molecular diffusion model had the potential to be used for predicting iron release more research is needed to understand iron release and its associated mechanisms entirely notice the u s environmental protection agency
