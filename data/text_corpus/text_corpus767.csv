3835,a science communication problem exists when scientifically supported policy relevant fact is disputed because it conflicts with political perspectives or other culturally relevant influences this study evaluates whether such a problem exists on water topics where it could obstruct productive discourse as new water policies are introduced to identify water topics on which partisan individuals reject water science we developed and applied a rasch modeled scale of ordinary water science knowledge owsk and an associated assessment of beliefs our sample consisting of 806 florida and georgia residents indicated personal beliefs that aligned with their perceptions of scientists beliefs so long as the information did not activate partisan positioning partisan positions were easily activated however with some politically right leaning individuals indicating personal water beliefs contrary to their perceptions of scientists beliefs i e a water science communication problem this divergence occurred in response to statements on the effects of climate change on water availability and on the adequacy of water supply to meet demand 20 years in the future these topics have relevance far beyond the study area suggesting a water science communication problem may exist at broader regional and national scales keywords belief partisanship polarization division floridan aquifer 1 introduction water policy is a normative topic and as such is suitable for public debate decisions on water allocation and quality standards benefit from public discourse and even some measure of conflict so long as it serves to balance communities ecological economic and social needs fielding and hornsey 2016 van zomeren et al 2008 yet this benefit can be undermined when the subject of debate includes scientific facts on which there is broad scientific consensus established facts should be neutral tools referenced in the service of policy decisions but partisan interpretation can turn scientific facts into points of contention that overwhelm normative discourse this is what kahan calls the science communication problem the failure of valid scientific evidence to quiet disputes over policy relevant facts 2017a p 36 topics that demonstrate the science communication problem include fracking gun possession and most notably climate change where disputes regarding the existence of global warming and its anthropogenic origins have detracted from consideration of adequate societal responses kahan 2015b 2017a nisbet 2016 water topics can also exhibit the science communication problem but it has been assumed that where clean affordable water flows predictably from the faucet the public does not give water much consideration for instance handwerk 2012 tobin 2017 if this presumption is accurate water may be largely free of the science communication problem at least among those who live in relatively water rich regions however there are at least three reasons this could change first climate change is altering the geographic and temporal availability and predictability of water supplies hoegh guldberg et al 2018 adding to the ongoing stresses of population change and economic expansion second as water supplies are stressed or as unexpected crises ensue environmental inequalities and injustices may be exposed butler et al 2016 prompting reconsideration of existing water policies third subpopulations of stakeholders such as agricultural and environmental interests exhibit partisanship on water topics hundemer and monroe 2020 paolisso and maloney 2000 and can influence public perspective the above social and natural pressures alone and in combination will likely necessitate new prioritization decisions for limited water supplies and thus heighten the public s awareness of water challenges how the water supply is managed is a high stakes decision particularly for those with large economic or ideological interests in water outcomes dunlap and brulle 2020 therefore multiple actors with competing motivations may assert to the public their perspective on water challenges and what should be done to address them individual residents most of whom have limited scientific background are then faced with a decision who to believe do they accept the words of scientists or do they base their personal water beliefs on alternative narratives as more communities approach potentially contentious water futures one objective of policy makers and communicators should be to limit the science communication problem so that whatever water debate ensues is focused on the advantages and disadvantages of normative concerns which can be a basis for productive discourse rather than the veracity of scientific facts as the us climate change debate has demonstrated once the science communication problem is established it can be difficult to reverse mccright and dunlap 2011 wong parodi and feygina 2020 before a potential escalation of water issues proactive investments should be made in the proverbial ounce of prevention to stave off a pound of cure by taking steps to prevent a water science communication problem an initial step toward this objective is determining whether a water science communication problem already exists on regionally and nationally relevant topics which is the objective of this study specifically we aim to determine what the public knows about water and if individuals reject their scientific knowledge in favor of partisan beliefs equipped with this information water communicators can better design interventions to prevent the potentially debilitating effect of a water science communication problem 1 1 cultural conception of water risk if a water science communication problem emerges in regions where water issues have thus far been publicly obscure the likelihood that an individual possesses beliefs that contradict their scientific knowledge may be correlated with their position along the political spectrum this pattern has been observed on other topics that exhibit the science communication problem kahan 2017a in these cases one political ideology asserts scientific knowledge as evidence to support their policy preferences while the opposing political ideology rejects the science effectively saying that policy action is not needed campbell and kay 2014 the denial of valid scientific evidence by those possessing ideologies incompatible with the stated or implied solution is what campbell and kay 2014 call solution aversion the science is rejected as a means to invalidate the implied need for policy action while one group is averse to the environmental conditions reflected by scientific evidence the other group is averse to the interventions that could result if the scientific evidence were accepted as true conceptions of which environmental conditions are problems and which solutions are problematic are influenced by culture culture has been defined in many ways including common values beliefs attitudes and behaviors kroeber and kluckhohn 1952 strauss and quinn 1998 by these broad definitions the united states has two dominant political cultures the political left which may be identified as liberal or democrat and the political right identified as conservative or republican as occurs with other types of culture american political cultures have become conventionalized over time creating consistencies within the political left and political right in the way information is processed interpreted and used douglas and wildavsky 1982 higgins and bargh 1987 oliveira 2007 trompenaars 1994 differences in information processing across political ideologies is associated with their alternative visions for how the world should be the political left idealizes a society that promotes equality and helps even the most vulnerable members succeed douglas and wildavsky 1982 kahan and braman 2006 in accordance with this perspective the left tends to prioritize social welfare and ecosystem protection among other values douglas and wildavsky 1982 kahan and braman 2006 the worldview of the political right idealizes a society that promotes tradition and in which government is minimized and individuals succeed on their own douglas and wildavsky 1982 gauchat 2012 kahan and braman 2006 in line with this vision conservatives prioritize freedom from regulation and protection of established industries among other values douglas and wildavsky 1982 kahan and braman 2006 these two worldviews and policy preferences have been strongly associated with divisiveness on climate and other environmental topics studies find that because environmental issues put at risk things that liberals deeply value specifically social welfare and ecosystems the political left tends to support action that abates the threat however the solutions often target things of great value to conservatives such as freedom from regulation generating strong opposition from the political right day et al 2014 kidwell et al 2013 wolsko 2017 wolsko et al 2016 similar value tradeoffs weave throughout water challenges potentially dividing individuals of opposing political orientations on future water policy based on their cultural value priorities right leaning individuals who may oppose increased water regulation could demonstrate solution aversion by rejecting the validity of scientific evidence that indicates water quality or quantity have declined alternatively left leaning individuals who may believe water regulation is too weak could reject the validity of scientific evidence that indicates water conditions have improved if either of these scenarios were observed it would signify a water science communication problem notably the water science communication problem can spread within a political culture even if most individuals are not personally solution averse for the average person it is a difficult and time consuming task to weigh the merits of policy options kahan 2017a in place of this investment many simply adopt the positions of those they trust and people typically trust those who are similar to them such as those who share their political identities oliveira 2007 if partisan influencers are solution averse others may unwittingly adopt science incongruent positions 1 2 public knowledge of water science before we proceed with our assessment of a potential water science communication problem it is necessary to establish what people know about water science only then will we be able to determine whether beliefs that run contrary to scientific fact reflect a rejection of science a lack of topical awareness or both likewise measurement of water science knowledge enables us to determine if a person s science conforming beliefs reflect an acceptance of science or simply a fortuitous alignment of belief with scientific reality these are critical differences because an intervention designed to instill new scientific knowledge among individuals motivated to align their beliefs with water science would necessarily be quite different than an intervention designed to change the predispositions of individuals who reject scientific evidence prior studies though limited find low levels of water science knowledge among americans robelia and murphy 2012 national surveys conducted in 1998 and 1999 found 24 percent of americans could correctly identify the most common source of surface water pollution neetf 1999 and 41 percent could correctly select the definition of a watershed neetf 1998 other studies report low to moderate levels of self reported familiarity with terminology related to water resources hubbard 2020 and water policy lamm et al 2015 though these findings are narrow in scope they suggest an american public that lacks the scientific knowledge to accurately inform water beliefs kunda 1990 there should be no expectation that science knowledge is the sole determinant of water beliefs bucchi 2008 but to the extent that the public is motivated to ground their water beliefs in scientific evidence kunda 1990 many are unlikely to possess the requisite knowledge to do so our emphasis on water science knowledge may suggest that addressing water knowledge deficits is our primary goal while scientific knowledge is a critical component in the assessment of a potential water science communication problem and a water science literate public is more able to democratically engage dewey 1916 fischer 2000 scientific knowledge on its own is not necessarily a cure all for water challenges when discussing culturally contentious scientific issues the assumption is often incorrectly made that if people had more information they would make the right decisions there are two issues with this line of thinking first there are no objectively right decisions lackey 2007 nisbet 2016 water degradation is only a problem if people s values cause them to perceive it as such for example while degraded water may have negative implications for wildlife or human health it may have a positive impact on a community s economy if the degradation is a result of industrial or agricultural production science can help quantify the tradeoffs but is unable to determine the right policy decision the second issue is the assumption that water decisions are made primarily on the basis of scientific fact a wealth of literature illustrates that scientific knowledge is just one often minor factor in decision making owens 2000 sturgis and allum 2004 in addition to their scientific knowledge people make decisions based on their values douglas and wildavsky 1982 haidt 2012 kahan and braman 2006 guidance from opinion leaders chong and druckman 2007 kahan 2017a and communication frames chong and druckman 2007 entman 1993 mccombs and reynolds 2008 moreover scientific literacy does not reliably correlate with trust in science studies have identified a weak positive correlation between scientific literacy and generalized trust in science but not between scientific literacy and attitudes on specific science controversies allum et al 2008 gauchat 2012 while the notion of scientific knowledge as a cure all is unsupported so too is the idea that scientific knowledge is an insignificant determinant of behavior and belief owens 2000 water science knowledge can make people aware of environmental conditions that threaten the things they value and can enable them to engage in the discourse on threats and tradeoffs dewey 1916 fischer 2000 additionally without water science knowledge people may be more easily misled by false claims that cause them to adopt positions contrary to their interests sharon and baram tsabari 2020 critically a measure of the public s scientific knowledge informs communicators about the appropriate level at which to discuss water challenges so that the public can participate nickerson 1999 in short while scientific knowledge is not a cure all lack of scientific knowledge can be a crucial barrier owens 2000 sturgis and allum 2004 and if water science is actively rejected these problems may be compounded 1 3 knowledge versus belief to accurately assess a potential water science communication problem it is also imperative that a clear distinction is made between scientific knowledge and belief concepts often confounded both in scientific discourse and research kahan 2015a demonstrated this error with the dilemma faced by a survey respondent who understands the scientific consensus on evolution but chooses not to believe it how is such a person to respond to the true false question humans evolved from an earlier species of animal 2015a if the respondent replies with scientific knowledge the answer will be true if the respondent replies with personal belief the answer will be false water science knowledge could be vulnerable to this type of mismeasurement as well particularly on subtopics that associate water with more polarized issues such as the sectors responsible for water contamination and potential changes in water availability resulting from climate change as defined for the purpose of this paper scientific knowledge is an individual s understanding of what scientists think is true belief in contrast is what an individual personally accepts as true schwitzgebel 2019 beliefs may reflect an individual s understanding of science or they may reflect another socially relevant construct such as a religious tenet or partisan position which of these foundations provides the basis or bases for one s beliefs depends on the individual s motivations assuming they are motivated to invest in the topic at all petty and cacioppo 1986 an individual may be motivated by a desire to arrive at an accurate conclusion or alternatively by a desire to arrive at a specific directional conclusion kunda 1990 the decision to adopt a position that matches one s political party line regardless of accuracy is an example of directional decision making decisions motivated by accuracy goals and directional goals can yield similar belief outcomes for example a fully informed democrat who is motivated to adopt beliefs reflective of scientific consensus would conclude that climate change is largely anthropogenic in origin just as they would if they were motivated to adopt beliefs in line with party position in this circumstance both scientific consensus and party position yield the same belief similarly a fully informed republican would arrive at the belief that genetically modified foods are no risker to human health than foods from conventional breeding snell et al 2012 regardless of whether they are motivated by political positioning directional or scientific consensus accuracy yet there are many other instances in which partisan positioning conflicts with perceived scientific consensus in those cases if a person s beliefs are dominated by partisan directional goals they will reject science and the science communication problem emerges importantly even those individuals motivated by accuracy may not align their beliefs with scientists if they do not trust scientists to provide objective information since the 1970 s conservatives trust in organized science has progressively declined a trend not observed among the public at large gauchat 2012 in part the reduction in trust may be due to the increased role of science in regulatory activity to which conservatives are adverse and the political power scientific institutions have gained in this role gauchat 2012 gross et al 2011 jasanoff 1990 conservatives have challenged the legitimacy of this conferred power citing a perceived lack of neutrality among the organizations producing and funding scientific research barnes 1977 bloor 1976 gieryn 1999 jasanoff 1990 latour and woolgar 1979 on climate change these challenges and science denial have been promoted by corporations conservative foundations conservative think tanks contrarian scientists and conservative media among others dunlap and brulle 2020 we refer to climate change here and throughout the paper because it is the most studied case of science denial but the public may develop opinions on climate science quite differently than they do on water science with climate change the science debate cannot be avoided by anyone who moderately engages news media therefore partisans know and can easily adopt the culturally expected positions of their political ideology moreover on climate change political positions have become powerful symbols of group membership and self identity fielding and hornsey 2016 making it psychologically difficult for individuals to stray from political alignment on water topics however we currently lack the empirical evidence to determine whether a partisan public experiences conflict between political positioning and science unlike climate change water is not among the top issues of national political concern pew research center 2020 though water can be divisive locally and regionally most people engage with politics primarily at the national level and define their political identities by national issues hopkins 2018 since water is not widely discussed on the national stage individuals may not associate water topics with partisan stances potentially making it easier to accept perceived scientific consensus however if partisans possess ample consistency of underlying beliefs or the political savvy to anticipate party positions on novel topics a water science communication problem could be primed for activation when water issues emerge more prominently on the public stage although water is not a prominent national issue there is persistent risk that the public could broadly associate water issues and water policies with partisan politics at the time of this writing in 2021 the american west is experiencing a severe drought that has led to federal cuts in water allocations and the need for water management collaboration across us states and between the us and mexico flaccus 2021 naishadham 2021 these government directed water distribution decisions yield no winners and many losers which can prompt political backlash escalate political rhetoric and boost national media attention similarly president obama s waters of the united states rule us epa 2017 expanding wetland and stream protections and trump s navigable waters protection rule us epa 2018 rescinding these protections cast water policy as a political us vs them battle that with increased media attention could cause the public to view other water issues through a partisan lens these constant partisan threats increase the urgency for evaluating the public s susceptibility to the water science communication problem 2 regional context for this study of scientific knowledge belief and the science communication problem we concentrate on georgia and florida two states substantially dependent on the floridan aquifer system depicted in fig 1 hodges et al 2014 marella and berndt 2005 of particular importance to the quality and quantity of the system s waters are the geologically unconfined regions located in southwest georgia and north florida in these areas many rivers and springs are fed by the upper portion of the aquifer system as a result the effects of aquifer decline are seen above ground particularly when rainfall is low the tradeoffs between groundwater use and surface water availability have become increasingly apparent over the past 50 years as withdrawals substantially increased due to population growth tourism and agricultural production marella and berndt 2005 though recent data show some declining use trends lovelace et al 2020 the impact of water withdrawals continues to affect property values recreation and tourism as well as the availability of water for residential agricultural industrial and ecosystem use the aquifer system s vulnerability to contamination further threatens economics and ecosystems rath et al 2021 while well drained soil in the unconfined regions has supported agricultural investment it has also introduced large amounts of applied fertilizer as a result of agricultural intensification municipal fertilizer use and other nutrient contributors florida springs exceed the state s ecosystem protective numeric nutrient criteria fdep 2010 katz 2004 katz et al 2009 exceedances have also been recorded in florida s rivers and high nutrient concentrations have been observed in the rivers of georgia where there are fewer nutrient regulatory standards allums et al 2012 fdep 2010 2012 hallas and magley 2008 if new water policies are proposed to enhance protection of the floridan aquifer system through actions taken in the unconfined regions e g incentives to farmers to adopt new land management practices the policies would likely be funded at the state level accordingly their adoption would be affected by the scientific knowledge beliefs and attitudes of residents across the entirety of both florida and georgia what these individuals know and believe about water conditions in the unconfined regions could affect the future of the aquifer system overall this premise influenced the selection of water topics assessed throughout this research though we sampled individuals from throughout the two states the questions to which they responded emphasized water considerations of particular importance in the unconfined areas 3 research questions the extent to which a water science communication problem exists in georgia and florida was examined though two research questions rq1 what is the public s level of scientific knowledge on regional water topics rq2 on what water topics do people s water beliefs reflect their perception of what scientists think is true are there variations across political orientations 4 methods a survey was administered to a qualtrics recruited sample of 806 voting age residents of florida n 402 and georgia n 404 between 13 november 2020 and 8 december 2020 for florida and georgia populations of 21 5 and 10 6 million respectively us census bureau 2019 this sample provides 95 percent confidence that estimates from the survey sample are within 10 percentage points of the true population value dillman et al 2014 due to the manner in which survey participants were recruited a traditional response rate cannot be reported however of the 526 florida participants and 536 georgia participants who began the survey 402 76 and 404 75 completed it respectively sample selection was based on three requirements relatively even participation from the two states of interest relatively even participation across three age groups 18 34 35 55 and 56 and within the georgia sample a minimum of 20 percent participation from individuals residing in the less populous southern counties qualtrics recruits their survey participants from a variety of sources including website intercepts member referrals and targeted email lists then verifies their names addresses and birth dates when asked to take part in a specific survey potential participants receive generic invitations or are prompted from within a survey platform the invitations and prompts do not indicate the topic of the survey the survey consisted of demographic questions political orientation questions scales of perceived water quality and availability risk a knowledge assessment and a belief assessment with the demographic questions at the beginning of survey participants were asked how much risk they personally believe water quality and availability pose to human health economic prosperity ecosystems and quality of life measured separately on five point scales from none 0 to much risk 4 at the end of the survey political orientation was measured with the following three questions the results of which were combined into a single index that identified individuals as politically left leaning right leaning or moderate 1 which of the following best describes your views very liberal liberal moderate independent conservative very conservative other i don t know 2 how often do your positions on issues align with the positions of democrats always often occasionally rarely never i don t know 3 how often do your positions on issues align with the positions of republicans always often occasionally rarely never i don t know the index gave equal weight to question 1 and the combination of questions 2 and 3 therefore the assignment of political orientation equally reflected participants self applied political labels and their self identified issue alignments also at the end of the survey perceived differences were assessed between the political left and the political right in their perception of water risk participants were asked to score to the best of their knowledge how much of a problem republicans and democrats believe water quality and availability are in their states 0 not a problem 1 little problem 2 moderate problem 3 big problem 4 1 scientific knowledge assessment modeled after kahan s 2015a ordinary climate science intelligence ocsi instrument an ordinary water science knowledge owsk instrument was developed to measure recognition of water facts and scientific consensus to a level that would enable an ordinary resident of florida or georgia to competently participate in water discussions and make citizen level voting decisions on water topics this knowledge level includes familiarity with fundamental vocabulary understanding of basic water processes awareness of regional water challenges and recognition of major regional water policies development of the owsk began with stakeholder and expert consultation to determine what the public should know about regional water science and related topics experts were recruited from a usda funded project currently underway in the floridan aquifer region facets floridan aquifer collaborative engagement for sustainability in which regional water stakeholders and university scientists collaboratively examine alternative water scenarios and the associated tradeoffs for economics ecosystems and other societally valued outcomes though not all water interest groups were represented we aimed to include a broad range of water perspectives particularly those with unique sets of water science knowledge to begin the facets project s advisory committee was asked via a survey to identify those water topics they believe the public should know respondents included leaders in agriculture forestry and environmental organizations their responses n 7 served as preliminary input for focus groups on the same topics focus group participants n 32 included project representatives from agriculture environmental organizations community leaders economists and water scientists familiar with water challenges in the floridan aquifer regions using the collected information and literature as a guide preliminary owsk assessment questions and answers were developed to reflect scientific consensus the determination of scientific consensus was based on a literature review and confirmation from university scientists in accordance with test specifications preliminary owsk questions encompassed topics and a question difficulty range reflective of the above stated goals of an ordinary water science knowledge assessment question formats included multiple choice and multiple true false common misconceptions were included in answer options where applicable to reduce the potential for measurement error from the confoundment of scientific knowledge and belief questions were written to specifically elicit knowledge based responses kahan 2015a for example on water topics where respondents could possess beliefs that differ from their perception of scientific consensus questions began with a phrase such as according to water scientists questions were also written to prevent over inflation of the scores of individuals who generally perceive greater levels of environmental risk this was accomplished by balancing questions that such individuals would likely guess correctly based on their affective risk orientation with questions they would likely guess incorrectly due to the same affective bias kahan 2015a for instance on the question why are algae sometimes described by water scientists as harmful respondents with a high affective risk orientation may be predisposed to see all negative outcomes as true therefore they may be more likely than the average respondent to correctly guess algae can produce toxins that are dangerous to humans and animals to offset the influence of correct answers resulting from this predisposition we included the response option algae can increase oxygen to a level that is unsafe for fish which these individuals may be predisposed to incorrectly believe is true due to the risk implied our initial set of 53 questions with each option of multiple true false items counted as a separate question was initially administered to a qualtrics recruited sample of 285 voting age residents of florida n 133 and georgia n 152 the results were assessed using rasch modelling rasch 1960 and winsteps software linacre 2020c with the aim of reducing the preliminary question pool to a final owsk scale our sample size of 285 individuals is in accordance with crocker and algina s 1986 recommended minimum sample for rasch models of 200 participants which enables measurement with 95 percent confidence rasch modeling enabled the development of a standard measurement metric while ensuring items were sufficiently unidimensional correlation among items can be explained by a single latent factor regional water science knowledge and cover the latent construct continuum question difficulty spans a suitable range of citizen level water science knowledge the partial credit rasch model was used to reduce the impact of local dependence that could have been introduced through the use of multiple true false items fit discrepancies between items and the rasch model were measured using infit and outfit mean square residual summary statistics which range from 0 to infinity with 1 indicating ideal fit items were included in the final assessment only if item infit and outfit were between 0 7 and 1 3 which is considered a reasonable range for run of the mill testing testing that is not high stakes wright and linacre 2020 a principal component analysis of residuals indicated sufficient uni dimensionality with a first contrast eigenvalue of 1 85 2 0 which is the smallest eigenvalue that can be considered a dimension linacre 2020a uniform differential item functioning dif was used to determine if assessment items functioned in the same manner across gender race and political identification based on identity plots items that did not conform to the model expectation of item difficulty invariance were removed from the assessment rasch results guided the reduction of the question set to the final owsk instrument of 40 items with the sample of 285 individuals the owsk yielded a model item separation of 4 48 and reliability of 0 95 person model separation was 1 98 with a reliability of 0 80 scientific facts and methods questions from kahan s 2017b ordinary science intelligence osi 2 0 instrument which measures individuals capacity to interpret and use scientific evidence in everyday decisions were administered alongside the preliminary owsk to evaluate external validity responses to osi questions were found to be moderately positively correlated with person measures on the final 40 owsk items r 283 0 54 p 0 001 this correlation is not high enough to raise concerns that the owsk and osi measure the same thing yet is high enough to support our expectation that participants with more water science knowledge also have more general science knowledge 4 2 belief assessment in the belief portion of the assessment we aimed to discern the role that scientific knowledge plays in water belief specifically on which topics does the public accept what they perceive water scientists to believe likewise on which topics does the public reject what they perceive water scientists to believe in favor of other belief determinants participants indicated their personal beliefs and their perception of scientists beliefs on four water topics as an example item 1 below assesses participants beliefs about fertilizer as a water pollutant and item 2 assesses their understanding of what scientists think 1 which statement most accurately reflects your thoughts o i think fertilizer is a source of water pollution in my state o i think fertilizer is not a source of water pollution in my state o i don t know enough to answer 2 which statement is most accurate o most water scientists think fertilizer is a source of water pollution in my state o most water scientists think fertilizer is not a source of water pollution in my state o i don t know enough to answer this question format was utilized with the following four water topics presented in random order fertilizer is or is not a source of water pollution in my state septic systems are or are not a source of water pollution in my state climate change will or will not impact the availability of water in my state in 20 years there will or will not be enough surface and ground water to meet demand throughout my state our interest in this section was not participants ability to answer the question correctly but rather the consistency between participants perceptions of scientists beliefs and their personal beliefs by water topic and political orientation the percentage of respondents selecting as their personal belief the affirmative is are will or contradicting perspective is not are not will not was charted against the percentage of respondents selecting each perspective as their perception of scientists beliefs the resulting alignment or misalignment provided a visual indicator of the acceptance or rejection of scientists beliefs to illustrate that the differences observed across political orientations were not due to variations in water science knowledge across political groups similar charts were developed comparing the personal beliefs and perceived scientists beliefs of high owsk scorers above the mean and low owsk scorers below the mean in addition belief was regressed on owsk scores to identify topics where water science knowledge emerged or failed to emerge as a significant factor in water belief multinomial logistic regression was utilized because the outcome variables personal beliefs and perceived scientists beliefs are nominal while owsk is continuous because the significance of owsk could vary across water topics separate regression models were created for each personal or perceived belief results were split by political leaning to enable across groups assessment of the relationship between owsk and beliefs all statistical analyses for this portion of the assessment were conducted with spss version 26 ibm corp 2019 5 results as detailed in table 1 demographic characteristics were similar for florida and georgia using our index of political orientation 38 1 percent fl 40 8 ga 35 4 of the sample was identified as politically left oriented 30 0 percent fl 26 9 ga 33 2 as right oriented and 32 percent as politically neutral in accordance with our sampling criteria participants were almost evenly split across three age categories 18 34 35 55 and 56 both states had more female fl 57 7 ga 60 6 participants than male fl 41 3 ga 39 1 and a broad range of education levels were represented the sample consisted primarily of individuals identifying their race as white fl 75 4 ga 66 3 or black or african american fl 15 4 ga 24 3 for florida and georgia respectively 17 4 percent and 6 7 percent identified their ethnicity as hispanic or latinx state specific demographics are provided for sample transparency and to aid in the interpretation and use of owsk results however assessment of the water science communication problem is conducted for the sample as a whole not by state based on participants county of residence 85 2 percent fl 93 3 ga 77 2 resided in metropolitan areas and 14 8 percent n 119 in nonmetropolitan areas usda economic research service 2020 for comparison 91 3 percent of the overall combined population of florida and georgia resides in a metropolitan county per 2010 census data usda economic research service 2020 the percentage of participants residing in metropolitan areas was similar across political orientations with 86 6 percent of left leaning participants residing in metropolitan areas 13 3 percent non metropolitan and 83 9 percent of right leaning participants residing in metropolitan areas 16 1 percent non metropolitan the percentage of metropolitan and non metropolitan participants is provided to aid in interpretation of the results we have not directly compared the two groups due to the relatively small number of non metropolitan participants left leaning and right leaning participants alike believed that democrats perceive water as a bigger problem than do republicans specifically as depicted in table 2 the political left s mean scores of democrats perception of the scale of water problems was 0 55 points higher on a four point scale ranging from 0 to 3 than that of republicans the political right s mean scores of democrats perceptions of the scale of water problems was 0 60 points higher than that of republicans not only did participants perceive a partisan gap on water concern but they did so with relative accuracy the political left perceived levels of health economic ecosystem and quality of life risk from water on average 0 52 points higher t 547 5 2 p 0 001 than the political right notably neither group s water risk perceptions were particularly high 5 1 rq1 what is the public s level of scientific knowledge on regional water topics participants performance on the owsk assessment is detailed in table 3 with the percentage of correct responses displayed by state and for the sample overall interpretation of correct answer percentages should be made with recognition of the effect of guessing for example if participants selected from the answer options at random we would expect a 25 percent correct answer rate for those questions with four answer choices the questions in table 3 are ordered by difficulty from high to low this difficulty rating is mirrored in the left column of the item person map provided in fig 2 the item person map illustrates the relationship between question difficulty and participants owsk because measurement was conducted with a rasch model the difficulty of questions is measured on the same scale as the owsk of participants simplifying score interpretation in other words the measures on the left side of the figure apply to both the difficulty of questions and the water science knowledge of participants each represents four individuals each represents one to three individuals for any given individual their position on the item person map indicates their expected performance on each question for example an individual receiving a score at the mean would have approximately a 50 50 chance of accurately answering q21 a 50 percent chance of accurately answering the questions appearing below q21 and a greater than 50 percent chance of accurately answering the questions appearing above q21 preliminary testing of owsk assessment questions enabled us to select questions within an appropriate range of difficulty based on participants range of water science knowledge thereby increasing the accuracy of measurement as can be observed in fig 2 question difficulties approximate the same normal curve around the mean as participants owsks the owsk assessment of florida and georgia residents yielded a model item separation capacity to distinguish between high and low performers of 7 79 and reliability reproducibility of item measures of 0 98 person model separation confirmation of item difficulty hierarchy was 1 96 with a reliability reproducibility of person measures of 0 79 these measures indicate reliability and validity are appropriate for run of the mill testing linacre 2020b participants owsk measures had a weak positive correlation with right political orientation r 804 0 162 p 0 000 the owsk results indicate that florida and georgia participants the majority of whom reside in metropolitan counties have higher levels of scientific knowledge on water topics that they may have encountered in their daily lives and through local news these topics include urban environments water conservation climate change and algae for example 67 percent of participants correctly indicated that it is more difficult for rain to soak into the ground in urban environments than other land use types likewise at least 60 percent of respondents were able to correctly identify each of a series of potential steps that cities can take to reduce water use a majority of participants correctly identified each of a series of predicted climate change effects seventy one percent of participants correctly identified algae as an indicator of high nutrient levels and a majority correctly identified harms that can result from algal blooms perhaps the most fundamental indicator of the public s inability to understand regional water challenges was proper identification of underground water as the region s primary drinking water source an answer selected by only 54 percent of participants in georgia and 59 percent of participants in florida fifty four percent of the overall sample correctly selected the definition of an aquifer other topics on which participants possessed relatively low levels of water science knowledge included natural water processes nutrient pollution and current water policy all of which could be highly relevant to future water policy in the region for example the natural processes that affect aquifer water levels and water quality will likely influence determinations of which activities should be curtailed or promoted by water policy and where in the region such changes should occur e g the unconfined region yet it appears the public may not understand the scientific basis for such determinations only 44 percent of respondents correctly identified rainwater seeping through the soil as the primary way water levels increase in the floridan aquifer this is the same percentage that correctly indicated that easily infiltrated soils carry the risk of increased groundwater pollution nitrogen and phosphorous were correctly identified as the two primary nutrients of concern by only 30 and 35 percent of participants respectively and the key contributors of those nutrients fertilizers and septic tanks were correctly selected by 50 and 20 percent of participants respectively when asked the reasons why aquifer levels decline during droughts 54 percent of respondents correctly indicated that less rain falls on the land above the aquifer and only 40 percent correctly indicated that more water than usual is pumped from the aquifer on current water policy a minority of participants correctly identified elements of major policies in their states participants also had difficulty identifying the difficulties of water policy for instance when asked to identify one of the challenges faced by agencies trying to limit water pollution 41 percent correctly indicated it can be difficult to determine where the pollution came from furthermore 44 percent correctly identified reservoirs desalinization and aquifer storage and recovery collectively as ways to provide supplemental water calls for aquifer protection in the region are often framed as a means to protect natural springs yet only 48 percent of participants correctly identified a spring as an area where groundwater flows to the surface with this information we can consider whether the public s level of water science knowledge would enable them to competently participate in water discussion and make citizen level voting decisions on water topics given that the owsk assessment questions were based upon experts perceptions of what the public should know in order to make good citizen level water decisions the results suggest that public water science knowledge is not currently adequate to guide productive water decision making moreover to the extent that individuals are motivated to base their water beliefs on scientific consensus most lack the capacity to do so 5 2 rq2 on what water topics do people s water beliefs reflect their perception of what scientists think is true are there variations across political orientations unlike the owsk assessment where the objective was to measure the accuracy of participants water science knowledge the assessment of beliefs was not concerned with the factual correctness of respondents choices instead the objective was to determine if people held as their personal beliefs that which they perceived to be the beliefs of water scientists regardless of accuracy whereas many questions in owsk assessment began with according to water scientists to prompt participants to respond with their scientific knowledge in this section we explicitly asked participants what they personally think participants personal water beliefs and their perceptions of scientists beliefs are illustrated in fig 3 by topic and political orientation the gray points in each chart connected by dotted lines depict the percentage of individuals who believe the idea posed in the provided statement does or does not reflect what scientists believe the black points connected by solid lines represent the percentage of individuals who accept or reject the concept as part of their personal beliefs when responding to the questions upon which each chart is based participants had the option to select i don t know enough to answer therefore those individuals represented in the charts are only those who had enough confidence in their perspectives to assert a position if participants match their water beliefs to what they perceive scientists think the two lines in each chart should be roughly parallel we may also expect some space between the parallel lines with personal beliefs above perceived scientists beliefs indicating more confidence in one s own beliefs less selection of the i don t know option than in their understanding of the beliefs of scientists if however the two lines substantially diverge from parallel then participants beliefs reflect a deviation from what they perceive scientists to think these are the conditions that suggest a water communication problem the first two sets of charts in fig 3 those depicting perspectives on fertilizer and septic systems as water pollutants show relative alignment between personal beliefs and perceived scientists beliefs for the political left moderates and the political right in other words the full spectrum of political orientations personally accept as their own beliefs that which they perceive to be the beliefs of scientists the slope of the lines differs between the two sets of graphs due to differences in the public s knowledge of contamination from fertilizer versus contamination from septic systems as observed in the owsk assessment however on topics related to the impact of climate change on water availability and the adequacy of water supply to meet demand in 20 years the political right shows a misalignment of between their personal beliefs and perceived scientists beliefs though the largest percentage of respondents on the political right indicated that scientists believe climate change will affect water availability in the region and that in 20 years there will not be enough groundwater and surface water to meet regional demand there is substantial dismissal of this conception in their personal beliefs fig 4 illustrates the same comparisons as fig 3 but divides the sample by owsk level instead of political orientation the beliefs and perceptions of those with owsk measures above the mean are reflected in the high owsk charts while individuals measured below the owsk mean are reflected in the low owsk charts that line pairs do not substantially deviate from parallel across owsk levels suggests that the differences observed across political orientations fig 3 are not a result of differences in water science knowledge across groups we further evaluated these observations by regressing participants owsk measures against their personal beliefs and perceptions of scientists beliefs as displayed in table 4 which applies a significance threshold of p 0 05 owsk had a significant effect on participants perception of scientists beliefs for each of the four topics and this outcome was true regardless of political orientation however the effect of owsk on personal beliefs was not consistently significant across political identities while owsk had a significant effect on all four topics of personal belief held by the political left and moderates it had no significant effect on the political right s personal beliefs about septic systems as a source of water pollution x 2 2 n 242 2 62 p 0 27 the impact of climate change on water availability x 2 2 n 242 3 93 p 0 14 nor the ability of surface and groundwater supplies to meet demand in 20 years x 2 2 n 242 5 45 p 0 07 this suggests that the water beliefs of many on the political right were not substantially connected to their understanding of water science in these cases the influence of owsk may have been overridden by political inclinations that run contrary to perceived scientists beliefs though these results suggest that some on the political right may not rely on owsk as a determinant of some of their water beliefs there is evidence that this is not a one sided phenomenon the political left may behave in a similar manner even if doing so does not result in a water science communication problem to illustrate on the topic of water pollution from fertilizer owsk accounts for approximately 2 8 of the variance in personal beliefs of left leaning participants but 14 9 of the variance in personal beliefs of right leaning partisans nagelkerke pseudo r square statistics in other words the political right comes to believe that fertilizer is a pollutant by consulting their owsk while the political left comes to the same conclusion but relies more on factors other than scientific knowledge to do so since the political left perceives higher levels of water risk left leaning individuals can simply follow their environmental predispositions and fortuitously align with water science they need not rely on scientific knowledge to come to the conclusion that fertilizer is a pollutant right oriented individuals however must actively choose scientific knowledge to make the same determination as indicated by the nagelkerke pseudo r square statistics in table 4 in cases not exhibiting the science communication problem the political right tends to rely on owsk more than the political left as a note the literature does not provide strong guidance on interpretation of pseudo r square therefore although these statistics provide a measure of relative effect they should be used with caution 6 discussion in florida and georgia we have identified early signs of a potential water science communication problem the topics exhibiting divergence of participants personal beliefs from what they perceive scientists to believe are those with the clearest partisan triggers climate change is known to exhibit the science communication problem fielding and hornsey 2016 mccright and dunlap 2011 as well as solution aversion campbell and kay 2014 and we found similar results in this study when climate was invoked in conjunction with water availability the topic of water supply adequacy 20 years in the future also exhibited the problem suggesting a similar activation of partisan positioning baldwin and lammers 2016 one reason this may have occurred is that inadequacy of supply suggests a greater level of environmental risk than the political right may feel is warranted given their low perception of environmental risk relative to other risk types douglas and wildavsky 1982 haidt 2012 and their low perception of water risk relative to individuals on the political left though the political left perceived only a moderate level of water risk table 2 second inadequacy of supply suggests the need for governmental measures to regulate increasingly strained water supplies which clashes with the political right s preference for comparatively lower levels of governmental oversight of resources douglas and wildavsky 1982 haidt 2012 at present the observed deviation of personal beliefs from impressions of scientists beliefs may be of negligible consequence based on the owsk results and the moderate level of perceived water risk across the political spectrum table 2 it appears that water issues in the floridan aquifer region have not yet robustly entered public consciousness therefore tendencies toward water partisanship can largely go inactivated however as water issues become more intrusive in people s lives either in ways that are directly observed or through media coverage it is likely that the public will become increasingly engaged with water topics expanded engagement has the potential to activate new water partisanship along with an obstructive water science communication problem though this study was conducted in two states with specific water challenges the subtopics on which a potential water science communication problem was observed are not region specific on broader regional and national scales there is risk that water could take on the stifling characteristics of other issues if and when water discourse and water policy increase in prominence despite the risk there is reason for optimism because positions on water issues do not yet appear to be ingrained in national partisan identities in a manner comparable to the climate science communication problem thus the findings of this study should not be read as a foretelling of a politically divided water future but rather as early warning signs of the divided future that could develop if intervening measures are not taken through the use of communication framing that purposefully associates water security measures with the values and motivations of the political right it may be possible to alter the automatically triggered positions that at present cause the political right to deviate from their perceptions of scientists beliefs feinberg and willer 2013 wolsko et al 2016 lines of research that should be considered in the development of framing interventions include kahan et al 2011 theory of cultural cognition and haidt s 2012 moral foundations theory studies using these models have demonstrated for example that presenting environmental protection as an act of patriotism or as a means to protect the purity of natural resources can yield relative parity in policy support between the political left and the political right feinberg and willer 2013 wolsko et al 2016 other studies have found that the identity of the message communicator a republican spokesperson for example can increase framing effectiveness bolsen et al 2019 hartman and weber 2009 while these approaches have been used in past research primarily with the objective of reducing division on highly polarized topics the models could prove even more effective as a means to minimize the initial escalation of partisanship inoculation studies have demonstrated that through preemptive exposure to anticipated persuasive appeals individuals can guard themselves against polarizing messages banas and rains 2010 compton et al 2021 van der linden et al 2017 moreover inoculation interventions can have pass along effects in which resistance spreads beyond those who directly received preemptive exposure compton et al 2021 if framing interventions are utilized early to limit partisans association of water science with politically undesirable outcomes there may not be a need to address severe water partisanship as water issues become more pronounced productive interventions can also be designed to improve water science knowledge when partisan positioning did not interfere the public indicated personal beliefs aligned with what they perceived scientists to think this tendency was most apparent on the topic of fertilizer as a pollutant where the vast majority of respondents across political orientations accurately identified scientifically endorsed fact and indicated personal beliefs that aligned with that fact however the owsk assessment results indicate that the public does not possess the ability to discern scientific consensus on most water topics environmental issues are distinct from other social issues such as equal pay and zoning restrictions in that they are more directly rooted in science fischer 2000 therefore a base level of scientific understanding is often necessary for citizens to engage in deliberation about the environmental decisions that affect their lives such as how water resources are managed while participation is a democratic ideal the result of increased participation can be amplified conflict and confusion if attention is not also paid to trust and community building jasanoff 1996 one technique for fostering the simultaneous development of knowledge trust and community is the use of inclusive processes that involve stakeholders of all types in knowledge development and decision making fischer 2000 horlick jones 1998 in contrast to top down knowledge dissemination approaches inclusive processes also have the benefit of increasing scientists awareness and appreciation of the public s experiential knowledge the incorporation of which can improve the selection implementation and acceptance of water policy measures burgess et al 1998 jasanoff 1999 thompson and rayner 1998 participatory processes are not merely a way to demonstrate inclusiveness but a means to maximize knowledge among scientists and stakeholders alike returning to our earlier remarks on culture barth argues for knowledge as a major modality of culture 2015 p 66 in which groups of people possess distinct insights into topics such as water challenges thinking of culture as knowledge emphasizes openness and inclusion as a way to embrace others as knowledge producers barth 2015 studies of the public s mental models of regional water processes and issues may further aid in the development of owsk interventions conceptual content cognitive mapping 3cm is one approach for revealing how individuals think about complex processes including the items present and absent in their conceptions and the connections between those items kearney 2015 with this information specific water knowledge gaps and scientific misconceptions can be identified 3cm can also reveal differences between groups that could inhibit effective communication for example a 3cm analysis of environmentalists and agricultural producers mental models of the relationship between water and economy in the floridan aquifer region exposed areas of false conflict between the groups hundemer and monroe 2020 the analysis further suggested how increased exposure to specific topics could improve cross group understanding and cooperation toward shared goals as water science knowledge and belief interventions are developed additional consideration of the differences between rural and urban audiences may be warranted participants in this study 85 2 percent of whom resided in metropolitan counties performed best on owsk topics that have direct relevance to the metropolitan experience such as water movement in urban environments and residential water conservation we may therefore expect rural residents with different life experiences to exhibit higher than average scientific knowledge on topics such as agriculture and rural living residents of rural and urban areas may also be affected in different ways by changes in water quality water availability and water regulation which may influence their water beliefs the data from this study could be used as a starting point for examination due to geographic location limited economic resources and limited access to power socio economically vulnerable groups may experience more detrimental impacts from water challenges than the average individual and have more difficulty adequately responding to those challenges allen et al 2006 weisner et al 2020 wescoat et al 2007 limited political influence also makes it less likely that the concerns of these groups will be reflected in policy discourse therefore as interventions are developed particular care should be taken to incorporate the perspectives of those who may be acutely impacted but less heard finally as steps are taken to combat a potential water science communication problem and to increase the ability of the public to participate in water policy care should be taken to protect the perceived legitimacy of water science keohane et al 2014 lackey 2007 nisbet 2016 science will not be perceived as neutral ground to which all parties can refer if it is used to coax people toward a right outcome it has been suggested that climate science has been rejected in part because science rather than social values has been used to justify policy action campbell and kay 2014 by presenting climate action as the right scientific decision and not instead presenting climate policy as a value decision for which society must weigh competing economic ecological and altruistic costs and benefits communicators left little space for those who were solution averse to express their discontent beyond challenging the science itself campbell and kay 2014 on water topics communicators can help preserve scientific legitimacy and thereby reduce the potential for a water science communication problem by creating space for value debate and situating science as a tool for quantifying and predicting the implications of alternative courses of action 7 conclusions evaluation of the alignment between individuals personal water beliefs and their perceptions scientists beliefs indicated a possible water science communication problem in florida and georgia that may exist at broader regional and national scales sampled residents of florida and georgia were generally not well informed on regional water issues however they indicated personal beliefs that aligned with their perception of scientists beliefs on those topics that did not require them to counter inclinations associated with political orientation partisan inclinations appeared to be easily triggered and carried the potential to usurp the influence of scientific knowledge these findings suggest that water has the potential to become an increasingly partisan topic if intervening measures are not taken

3835,a science communication problem exists when scientifically supported policy relevant fact is disputed because it conflicts with political perspectives or other culturally relevant influences this study evaluates whether such a problem exists on water topics where it could obstruct productive discourse as new water policies are introduced to identify water topics on which partisan individuals reject water science we developed and applied a rasch modeled scale of ordinary water science knowledge owsk and an associated assessment of beliefs our sample consisting of 806 florida and georgia residents indicated personal beliefs that aligned with their perceptions of scientists beliefs so long as the information did not activate partisan positioning partisan positions were easily activated however with some politically right leaning individuals indicating personal water beliefs contrary to their perceptions of scientists beliefs i e a water science communication problem this divergence occurred in response to statements on the effects of climate change on water availability and on the adequacy of water supply to meet demand 20 years in the future these topics have relevance far beyond the study area suggesting a water science communication problem may exist at broader regional and national scales keywords belief partisanship polarization division floridan aquifer 1 introduction water policy is a normative topic and as such is suitable for public debate decisions on water allocation and quality standards benefit from public discourse and even some measure of conflict so long as it serves to balance communities ecological economic and social needs fielding and hornsey 2016 van zomeren et al 2008 yet this benefit can be undermined when the subject of debate includes scientific facts on which there is broad scientific consensus established facts should be neutral tools referenced in the service of policy decisions but partisan interpretation can turn scientific facts into points of contention that overwhelm normative discourse this is what kahan calls the science communication problem the failure of valid scientific evidence to quiet disputes over policy relevant facts 2017a p 36 topics that demonstrate the science communication problem include fracking gun possession and most notably climate change where disputes regarding the existence of global warming and its anthropogenic origins have detracted from consideration of adequate societal responses kahan 2015b 2017a nisbet 2016 water topics can also exhibit the science communication problem but it has been assumed that where clean affordable water flows predictably from the faucet the public does not give water much consideration for instance handwerk 2012 tobin 2017 if this presumption is accurate water may be largely free of the science communication problem at least among those who live in relatively water rich regions however there are at least three reasons this could change first climate change is altering the geographic and temporal availability and predictability of water supplies hoegh guldberg et al 2018 adding to the ongoing stresses of population change and economic expansion second as water supplies are stressed or as unexpected crises ensue environmental inequalities and injustices may be exposed butler et al 2016 prompting reconsideration of existing water policies third subpopulations of stakeholders such as agricultural and environmental interests exhibit partisanship on water topics hundemer and monroe 2020 paolisso and maloney 2000 and can influence public perspective the above social and natural pressures alone and in combination will likely necessitate new prioritization decisions for limited water supplies and thus heighten the public s awareness of water challenges how the water supply is managed is a high stakes decision particularly for those with large economic or ideological interests in water outcomes dunlap and brulle 2020 therefore multiple actors with competing motivations may assert to the public their perspective on water challenges and what should be done to address them individual residents most of whom have limited scientific background are then faced with a decision who to believe do they accept the words of scientists or do they base their personal water beliefs on alternative narratives as more communities approach potentially contentious water futures one objective of policy makers and communicators should be to limit the science communication problem so that whatever water debate ensues is focused on the advantages and disadvantages of normative concerns which can be a basis for productive discourse rather than the veracity of scientific facts as the us climate change debate has demonstrated once the science communication problem is established it can be difficult to reverse mccright and dunlap 2011 wong parodi and feygina 2020 before a potential escalation of water issues proactive investments should be made in the proverbial ounce of prevention to stave off a pound of cure by taking steps to prevent a water science communication problem an initial step toward this objective is determining whether a water science communication problem already exists on regionally and nationally relevant topics which is the objective of this study specifically we aim to determine what the public knows about water and if individuals reject their scientific knowledge in favor of partisan beliefs equipped with this information water communicators can better design interventions to prevent the potentially debilitating effect of a water science communication problem 1 1 cultural conception of water risk if a water science communication problem emerges in regions where water issues have thus far been publicly obscure the likelihood that an individual possesses beliefs that contradict their scientific knowledge may be correlated with their position along the political spectrum this pattern has been observed on other topics that exhibit the science communication problem kahan 2017a in these cases one political ideology asserts scientific knowledge as evidence to support their policy preferences while the opposing political ideology rejects the science effectively saying that policy action is not needed campbell and kay 2014 the denial of valid scientific evidence by those possessing ideologies incompatible with the stated or implied solution is what campbell and kay 2014 call solution aversion the science is rejected as a means to invalidate the implied need for policy action while one group is averse to the environmental conditions reflected by scientific evidence the other group is averse to the interventions that could result if the scientific evidence were accepted as true conceptions of which environmental conditions are problems and which solutions are problematic are influenced by culture culture has been defined in many ways including common values beliefs attitudes and behaviors kroeber and kluckhohn 1952 strauss and quinn 1998 by these broad definitions the united states has two dominant political cultures the political left which may be identified as liberal or democrat and the political right identified as conservative or republican as occurs with other types of culture american political cultures have become conventionalized over time creating consistencies within the political left and political right in the way information is processed interpreted and used douglas and wildavsky 1982 higgins and bargh 1987 oliveira 2007 trompenaars 1994 differences in information processing across political ideologies is associated with their alternative visions for how the world should be the political left idealizes a society that promotes equality and helps even the most vulnerable members succeed douglas and wildavsky 1982 kahan and braman 2006 in accordance with this perspective the left tends to prioritize social welfare and ecosystem protection among other values douglas and wildavsky 1982 kahan and braman 2006 the worldview of the political right idealizes a society that promotes tradition and in which government is minimized and individuals succeed on their own douglas and wildavsky 1982 gauchat 2012 kahan and braman 2006 in line with this vision conservatives prioritize freedom from regulation and protection of established industries among other values douglas and wildavsky 1982 kahan and braman 2006 these two worldviews and policy preferences have been strongly associated with divisiveness on climate and other environmental topics studies find that because environmental issues put at risk things that liberals deeply value specifically social welfare and ecosystems the political left tends to support action that abates the threat however the solutions often target things of great value to conservatives such as freedom from regulation generating strong opposition from the political right day et al 2014 kidwell et al 2013 wolsko 2017 wolsko et al 2016 similar value tradeoffs weave throughout water challenges potentially dividing individuals of opposing political orientations on future water policy based on their cultural value priorities right leaning individuals who may oppose increased water regulation could demonstrate solution aversion by rejecting the validity of scientific evidence that indicates water quality or quantity have declined alternatively left leaning individuals who may believe water regulation is too weak could reject the validity of scientific evidence that indicates water conditions have improved if either of these scenarios were observed it would signify a water science communication problem notably the water science communication problem can spread within a political culture even if most individuals are not personally solution averse for the average person it is a difficult and time consuming task to weigh the merits of policy options kahan 2017a in place of this investment many simply adopt the positions of those they trust and people typically trust those who are similar to them such as those who share their political identities oliveira 2007 if partisan influencers are solution averse others may unwittingly adopt science incongruent positions 1 2 public knowledge of water science before we proceed with our assessment of a potential water science communication problem it is necessary to establish what people know about water science only then will we be able to determine whether beliefs that run contrary to scientific fact reflect a rejection of science a lack of topical awareness or both likewise measurement of water science knowledge enables us to determine if a person s science conforming beliefs reflect an acceptance of science or simply a fortuitous alignment of belief with scientific reality these are critical differences because an intervention designed to instill new scientific knowledge among individuals motivated to align their beliefs with water science would necessarily be quite different than an intervention designed to change the predispositions of individuals who reject scientific evidence prior studies though limited find low levels of water science knowledge among americans robelia and murphy 2012 national surveys conducted in 1998 and 1999 found 24 percent of americans could correctly identify the most common source of surface water pollution neetf 1999 and 41 percent could correctly select the definition of a watershed neetf 1998 other studies report low to moderate levels of self reported familiarity with terminology related to water resources hubbard 2020 and water policy lamm et al 2015 though these findings are narrow in scope they suggest an american public that lacks the scientific knowledge to accurately inform water beliefs kunda 1990 there should be no expectation that science knowledge is the sole determinant of water beliefs bucchi 2008 but to the extent that the public is motivated to ground their water beliefs in scientific evidence kunda 1990 many are unlikely to possess the requisite knowledge to do so our emphasis on water science knowledge may suggest that addressing water knowledge deficits is our primary goal while scientific knowledge is a critical component in the assessment of a potential water science communication problem and a water science literate public is more able to democratically engage dewey 1916 fischer 2000 scientific knowledge on its own is not necessarily a cure all for water challenges when discussing culturally contentious scientific issues the assumption is often incorrectly made that if people had more information they would make the right decisions there are two issues with this line of thinking first there are no objectively right decisions lackey 2007 nisbet 2016 water degradation is only a problem if people s values cause them to perceive it as such for example while degraded water may have negative implications for wildlife or human health it may have a positive impact on a community s economy if the degradation is a result of industrial or agricultural production science can help quantify the tradeoffs but is unable to determine the right policy decision the second issue is the assumption that water decisions are made primarily on the basis of scientific fact a wealth of literature illustrates that scientific knowledge is just one often minor factor in decision making owens 2000 sturgis and allum 2004 in addition to their scientific knowledge people make decisions based on their values douglas and wildavsky 1982 haidt 2012 kahan and braman 2006 guidance from opinion leaders chong and druckman 2007 kahan 2017a and communication frames chong and druckman 2007 entman 1993 mccombs and reynolds 2008 moreover scientific literacy does not reliably correlate with trust in science studies have identified a weak positive correlation between scientific literacy and generalized trust in science but not between scientific literacy and attitudes on specific science controversies allum et al 2008 gauchat 2012 while the notion of scientific knowledge as a cure all is unsupported so too is the idea that scientific knowledge is an insignificant determinant of behavior and belief owens 2000 water science knowledge can make people aware of environmental conditions that threaten the things they value and can enable them to engage in the discourse on threats and tradeoffs dewey 1916 fischer 2000 additionally without water science knowledge people may be more easily misled by false claims that cause them to adopt positions contrary to their interests sharon and baram tsabari 2020 critically a measure of the public s scientific knowledge informs communicators about the appropriate level at which to discuss water challenges so that the public can participate nickerson 1999 in short while scientific knowledge is not a cure all lack of scientific knowledge can be a crucial barrier owens 2000 sturgis and allum 2004 and if water science is actively rejected these problems may be compounded 1 3 knowledge versus belief to accurately assess a potential water science communication problem it is also imperative that a clear distinction is made between scientific knowledge and belief concepts often confounded both in scientific discourse and research kahan 2015a demonstrated this error with the dilemma faced by a survey respondent who understands the scientific consensus on evolution but chooses not to believe it how is such a person to respond to the true false question humans evolved from an earlier species of animal 2015a if the respondent replies with scientific knowledge the answer will be true if the respondent replies with personal belief the answer will be false water science knowledge could be vulnerable to this type of mismeasurement as well particularly on subtopics that associate water with more polarized issues such as the sectors responsible for water contamination and potential changes in water availability resulting from climate change as defined for the purpose of this paper scientific knowledge is an individual s understanding of what scientists think is true belief in contrast is what an individual personally accepts as true schwitzgebel 2019 beliefs may reflect an individual s understanding of science or they may reflect another socially relevant construct such as a religious tenet or partisan position which of these foundations provides the basis or bases for one s beliefs depends on the individual s motivations assuming they are motivated to invest in the topic at all petty and cacioppo 1986 an individual may be motivated by a desire to arrive at an accurate conclusion or alternatively by a desire to arrive at a specific directional conclusion kunda 1990 the decision to adopt a position that matches one s political party line regardless of accuracy is an example of directional decision making decisions motivated by accuracy goals and directional goals can yield similar belief outcomes for example a fully informed democrat who is motivated to adopt beliefs reflective of scientific consensus would conclude that climate change is largely anthropogenic in origin just as they would if they were motivated to adopt beliefs in line with party position in this circumstance both scientific consensus and party position yield the same belief similarly a fully informed republican would arrive at the belief that genetically modified foods are no risker to human health than foods from conventional breeding snell et al 2012 regardless of whether they are motivated by political positioning directional or scientific consensus accuracy yet there are many other instances in which partisan positioning conflicts with perceived scientific consensus in those cases if a person s beliefs are dominated by partisan directional goals they will reject science and the science communication problem emerges importantly even those individuals motivated by accuracy may not align their beliefs with scientists if they do not trust scientists to provide objective information since the 1970 s conservatives trust in organized science has progressively declined a trend not observed among the public at large gauchat 2012 in part the reduction in trust may be due to the increased role of science in regulatory activity to which conservatives are adverse and the political power scientific institutions have gained in this role gauchat 2012 gross et al 2011 jasanoff 1990 conservatives have challenged the legitimacy of this conferred power citing a perceived lack of neutrality among the organizations producing and funding scientific research barnes 1977 bloor 1976 gieryn 1999 jasanoff 1990 latour and woolgar 1979 on climate change these challenges and science denial have been promoted by corporations conservative foundations conservative think tanks contrarian scientists and conservative media among others dunlap and brulle 2020 we refer to climate change here and throughout the paper because it is the most studied case of science denial but the public may develop opinions on climate science quite differently than they do on water science with climate change the science debate cannot be avoided by anyone who moderately engages news media therefore partisans know and can easily adopt the culturally expected positions of their political ideology moreover on climate change political positions have become powerful symbols of group membership and self identity fielding and hornsey 2016 making it psychologically difficult for individuals to stray from political alignment on water topics however we currently lack the empirical evidence to determine whether a partisan public experiences conflict between political positioning and science unlike climate change water is not among the top issues of national political concern pew research center 2020 though water can be divisive locally and regionally most people engage with politics primarily at the national level and define their political identities by national issues hopkins 2018 since water is not widely discussed on the national stage individuals may not associate water topics with partisan stances potentially making it easier to accept perceived scientific consensus however if partisans possess ample consistency of underlying beliefs or the political savvy to anticipate party positions on novel topics a water science communication problem could be primed for activation when water issues emerge more prominently on the public stage although water is not a prominent national issue there is persistent risk that the public could broadly associate water issues and water policies with partisan politics at the time of this writing in 2021 the american west is experiencing a severe drought that has led to federal cuts in water allocations and the need for water management collaboration across us states and between the us and mexico flaccus 2021 naishadham 2021 these government directed water distribution decisions yield no winners and many losers which can prompt political backlash escalate political rhetoric and boost national media attention similarly president obama s waters of the united states rule us epa 2017 expanding wetland and stream protections and trump s navigable waters protection rule us epa 2018 rescinding these protections cast water policy as a political us vs them battle that with increased media attention could cause the public to view other water issues through a partisan lens these constant partisan threats increase the urgency for evaluating the public s susceptibility to the water science communication problem 2 regional context for this study of scientific knowledge belief and the science communication problem we concentrate on georgia and florida two states substantially dependent on the floridan aquifer system depicted in fig 1 hodges et al 2014 marella and berndt 2005 of particular importance to the quality and quantity of the system s waters are the geologically unconfined regions located in southwest georgia and north florida in these areas many rivers and springs are fed by the upper portion of the aquifer system as a result the effects of aquifer decline are seen above ground particularly when rainfall is low the tradeoffs between groundwater use and surface water availability have become increasingly apparent over the past 50 years as withdrawals substantially increased due to population growth tourism and agricultural production marella and berndt 2005 though recent data show some declining use trends lovelace et al 2020 the impact of water withdrawals continues to affect property values recreation and tourism as well as the availability of water for residential agricultural industrial and ecosystem use the aquifer system s vulnerability to contamination further threatens economics and ecosystems rath et al 2021 while well drained soil in the unconfined regions has supported agricultural investment it has also introduced large amounts of applied fertilizer as a result of agricultural intensification municipal fertilizer use and other nutrient contributors florida springs exceed the state s ecosystem protective numeric nutrient criteria fdep 2010 katz 2004 katz et al 2009 exceedances have also been recorded in florida s rivers and high nutrient concentrations have been observed in the rivers of georgia where there are fewer nutrient regulatory standards allums et al 2012 fdep 2010 2012 hallas and magley 2008 if new water policies are proposed to enhance protection of the floridan aquifer system through actions taken in the unconfined regions e g incentives to farmers to adopt new land management practices the policies would likely be funded at the state level accordingly their adoption would be affected by the scientific knowledge beliefs and attitudes of residents across the entirety of both florida and georgia what these individuals know and believe about water conditions in the unconfined regions could affect the future of the aquifer system overall this premise influenced the selection of water topics assessed throughout this research though we sampled individuals from throughout the two states the questions to which they responded emphasized water considerations of particular importance in the unconfined areas 3 research questions the extent to which a water science communication problem exists in georgia and florida was examined though two research questions rq1 what is the public s level of scientific knowledge on regional water topics rq2 on what water topics do people s water beliefs reflect their perception of what scientists think is true are there variations across political orientations 4 methods a survey was administered to a qualtrics recruited sample of 806 voting age residents of florida n 402 and georgia n 404 between 13 november 2020 and 8 december 2020 for florida and georgia populations of 21 5 and 10 6 million respectively us census bureau 2019 this sample provides 95 percent confidence that estimates from the survey sample are within 10 percentage points of the true population value dillman et al 2014 due to the manner in which survey participants were recruited a traditional response rate cannot be reported however of the 526 florida participants and 536 georgia participants who began the survey 402 76 and 404 75 completed it respectively sample selection was based on three requirements relatively even participation from the two states of interest relatively even participation across three age groups 18 34 35 55 and 56 and within the georgia sample a minimum of 20 percent participation from individuals residing in the less populous southern counties qualtrics recruits their survey participants from a variety of sources including website intercepts member referrals and targeted email lists then verifies their names addresses and birth dates when asked to take part in a specific survey potential participants receive generic invitations or are prompted from within a survey platform the invitations and prompts do not indicate the topic of the survey the survey consisted of demographic questions political orientation questions scales of perceived water quality and availability risk a knowledge assessment and a belief assessment with the demographic questions at the beginning of survey participants were asked how much risk they personally believe water quality and availability pose to human health economic prosperity ecosystems and quality of life measured separately on five point scales from none 0 to much risk 4 at the end of the survey political orientation was measured with the following three questions the results of which were combined into a single index that identified individuals as politically left leaning right leaning or moderate 1 which of the following best describes your views very liberal liberal moderate independent conservative very conservative other i don t know 2 how often do your positions on issues align with the positions of democrats always often occasionally rarely never i don t know 3 how often do your positions on issues align with the positions of republicans always often occasionally rarely never i don t know the index gave equal weight to question 1 and the combination of questions 2 and 3 therefore the assignment of political orientation equally reflected participants self applied political labels and their self identified issue alignments also at the end of the survey perceived differences were assessed between the political left and the political right in their perception of water risk participants were asked to score to the best of their knowledge how much of a problem republicans and democrats believe water quality and availability are in their states 0 not a problem 1 little problem 2 moderate problem 3 big problem 4 1 scientific knowledge assessment modeled after kahan s 2015a ordinary climate science intelligence ocsi instrument an ordinary water science knowledge owsk instrument was developed to measure recognition of water facts and scientific consensus to a level that would enable an ordinary resident of florida or georgia to competently participate in water discussions and make citizen level voting decisions on water topics this knowledge level includes familiarity with fundamental vocabulary understanding of basic water processes awareness of regional water challenges and recognition of major regional water policies development of the owsk began with stakeholder and expert consultation to determine what the public should know about regional water science and related topics experts were recruited from a usda funded project currently underway in the floridan aquifer region facets floridan aquifer collaborative engagement for sustainability in which regional water stakeholders and university scientists collaboratively examine alternative water scenarios and the associated tradeoffs for economics ecosystems and other societally valued outcomes though not all water interest groups were represented we aimed to include a broad range of water perspectives particularly those with unique sets of water science knowledge to begin the facets project s advisory committee was asked via a survey to identify those water topics they believe the public should know respondents included leaders in agriculture forestry and environmental organizations their responses n 7 served as preliminary input for focus groups on the same topics focus group participants n 32 included project representatives from agriculture environmental organizations community leaders economists and water scientists familiar with water challenges in the floridan aquifer regions using the collected information and literature as a guide preliminary owsk assessment questions and answers were developed to reflect scientific consensus the determination of scientific consensus was based on a literature review and confirmation from university scientists in accordance with test specifications preliminary owsk questions encompassed topics and a question difficulty range reflective of the above stated goals of an ordinary water science knowledge assessment question formats included multiple choice and multiple true false common misconceptions were included in answer options where applicable to reduce the potential for measurement error from the confoundment of scientific knowledge and belief questions were written to specifically elicit knowledge based responses kahan 2015a for example on water topics where respondents could possess beliefs that differ from their perception of scientific consensus questions began with a phrase such as according to water scientists questions were also written to prevent over inflation of the scores of individuals who generally perceive greater levels of environmental risk this was accomplished by balancing questions that such individuals would likely guess correctly based on their affective risk orientation with questions they would likely guess incorrectly due to the same affective bias kahan 2015a for instance on the question why are algae sometimes described by water scientists as harmful respondents with a high affective risk orientation may be predisposed to see all negative outcomes as true therefore they may be more likely than the average respondent to correctly guess algae can produce toxins that are dangerous to humans and animals to offset the influence of correct answers resulting from this predisposition we included the response option algae can increase oxygen to a level that is unsafe for fish which these individuals may be predisposed to incorrectly believe is true due to the risk implied our initial set of 53 questions with each option of multiple true false items counted as a separate question was initially administered to a qualtrics recruited sample of 285 voting age residents of florida n 133 and georgia n 152 the results were assessed using rasch modelling rasch 1960 and winsteps software linacre 2020c with the aim of reducing the preliminary question pool to a final owsk scale our sample size of 285 individuals is in accordance with crocker and algina s 1986 recommended minimum sample for rasch models of 200 participants which enables measurement with 95 percent confidence rasch modeling enabled the development of a standard measurement metric while ensuring items were sufficiently unidimensional correlation among items can be explained by a single latent factor regional water science knowledge and cover the latent construct continuum question difficulty spans a suitable range of citizen level water science knowledge the partial credit rasch model was used to reduce the impact of local dependence that could have been introduced through the use of multiple true false items fit discrepancies between items and the rasch model were measured using infit and outfit mean square residual summary statistics which range from 0 to infinity with 1 indicating ideal fit items were included in the final assessment only if item infit and outfit were between 0 7 and 1 3 which is considered a reasonable range for run of the mill testing testing that is not high stakes wright and linacre 2020 a principal component analysis of residuals indicated sufficient uni dimensionality with a first contrast eigenvalue of 1 85 2 0 which is the smallest eigenvalue that can be considered a dimension linacre 2020a uniform differential item functioning dif was used to determine if assessment items functioned in the same manner across gender race and political identification based on identity plots items that did not conform to the model expectation of item difficulty invariance were removed from the assessment rasch results guided the reduction of the question set to the final owsk instrument of 40 items with the sample of 285 individuals the owsk yielded a model item separation of 4 48 and reliability of 0 95 person model separation was 1 98 with a reliability of 0 80 scientific facts and methods questions from kahan s 2017b ordinary science intelligence osi 2 0 instrument which measures individuals capacity to interpret and use scientific evidence in everyday decisions were administered alongside the preliminary owsk to evaluate external validity responses to osi questions were found to be moderately positively correlated with person measures on the final 40 owsk items r 283 0 54 p 0 001 this correlation is not high enough to raise concerns that the owsk and osi measure the same thing yet is high enough to support our expectation that participants with more water science knowledge also have more general science knowledge 4 2 belief assessment in the belief portion of the assessment we aimed to discern the role that scientific knowledge plays in water belief specifically on which topics does the public accept what they perceive water scientists to believe likewise on which topics does the public reject what they perceive water scientists to believe in favor of other belief determinants participants indicated their personal beliefs and their perception of scientists beliefs on four water topics as an example item 1 below assesses participants beliefs about fertilizer as a water pollutant and item 2 assesses their understanding of what scientists think 1 which statement most accurately reflects your thoughts o i think fertilizer is a source of water pollution in my state o i think fertilizer is not a source of water pollution in my state o i don t know enough to answer 2 which statement is most accurate o most water scientists think fertilizer is a source of water pollution in my state o most water scientists think fertilizer is not a source of water pollution in my state o i don t know enough to answer this question format was utilized with the following four water topics presented in random order fertilizer is or is not a source of water pollution in my state septic systems are or are not a source of water pollution in my state climate change will or will not impact the availability of water in my state in 20 years there will or will not be enough surface and ground water to meet demand throughout my state our interest in this section was not participants ability to answer the question correctly but rather the consistency between participants perceptions of scientists beliefs and their personal beliefs by water topic and political orientation the percentage of respondents selecting as their personal belief the affirmative is are will or contradicting perspective is not are not will not was charted against the percentage of respondents selecting each perspective as their perception of scientists beliefs the resulting alignment or misalignment provided a visual indicator of the acceptance or rejection of scientists beliefs to illustrate that the differences observed across political orientations were not due to variations in water science knowledge across political groups similar charts were developed comparing the personal beliefs and perceived scientists beliefs of high owsk scorers above the mean and low owsk scorers below the mean in addition belief was regressed on owsk scores to identify topics where water science knowledge emerged or failed to emerge as a significant factor in water belief multinomial logistic regression was utilized because the outcome variables personal beliefs and perceived scientists beliefs are nominal while owsk is continuous because the significance of owsk could vary across water topics separate regression models were created for each personal or perceived belief results were split by political leaning to enable across groups assessment of the relationship between owsk and beliefs all statistical analyses for this portion of the assessment were conducted with spss version 26 ibm corp 2019 5 results as detailed in table 1 demographic characteristics were similar for florida and georgia using our index of political orientation 38 1 percent fl 40 8 ga 35 4 of the sample was identified as politically left oriented 30 0 percent fl 26 9 ga 33 2 as right oriented and 32 percent as politically neutral in accordance with our sampling criteria participants were almost evenly split across three age categories 18 34 35 55 and 56 both states had more female fl 57 7 ga 60 6 participants than male fl 41 3 ga 39 1 and a broad range of education levels were represented the sample consisted primarily of individuals identifying their race as white fl 75 4 ga 66 3 or black or african american fl 15 4 ga 24 3 for florida and georgia respectively 17 4 percent and 6 7 percent identified their ethnicity as hispanic or latinx state specific demographics are provided for sample transparency and to aid in the interpretation and use of owsk results however assessment of the water science communication problem is conducted for the sample as a whole not by state based on participants county of residence 85 2 percent fl 93 3 ga 77 2 resided in metropolitan areas and 14 8 percent n 119 in nonmetropolitan areas usda economic research service 2020 for comparison 91 3 percent of the overall combined population of florida and georgia resides in a metropolitan county per 2010 census data usda economic research service 2020 the percentage of participants residing in metropolitan areas was similar across political orientations with 86 6 percent of left leaning participants residing in metropolitan areas 13 3 percent non metropolitan and 83 9 percent of right leaning participants residing in metropolitan areas 16 1 percent non metropolitan the percentage of metropolitan and non metropolitan participants is provided to aid in interpretation of the results we have not directly compared the two groups due to the relatively small number of non metropolitan participants left leaning and right leaning participants alike believed that democrats perceive water as a bigger problem than do republicans specifically as depicted in table 2 the political left s mean scores of democrats perception of the scale of water problems was 0 55 points higher on a four point scale ranging from 0 to 3 than that of republicans the political right s mean scores of democrats perceptions of the scale of water problems was 0 60 points higher than that of republicans not only did participants perceive a partisan gap on water concern but they did so with relative accuracy the political left perceived levels of health economic ecosystem and quality of life risk from water on average 0 52 points higher t 547 5 2 p 0 001 than the political right notably neither group s water risk perceptions were particularly high 5 1 rq1 what is the public s level of scientific knowledge on regional water topics participants performance on the owsk assessment is detailed in table 3 with the percentage of correct responses displayed by state and for the sample overall interpretation of correct answer percentages should be made with recognition of the effect of guessing for example if participants selected from the answer options at random we would expect a 25 percent correct answer rate for those questions with four answer choices the questions in table 3 are ordered by difficulty from high to low this difficulty rating is mirrored in the left column of the item person map provided in fig 2 the item person map illustrates the relationship between question difficulty and participants owsk because measurement was conducted with a rasch model the difficulty of questions is measured on the same scale as the owsk of participants simplifying score interpretation in other words the measures on the left side of the figure apply to both the difficulty of questions and the water science knowledge of participants each represents four individuals each represents one to three individuals for any given individual their position on the item person map indicates their expected performance on each question for example an individual receiving a score at the mean would have approximately a 50 50 chance of accurately answering q21 a 50 percent chance of accurately answering the questions appearing below q21 and a greater than 50 percent chance of accurately answering the questions appearing above q21 preliminary testing of owsk assessment questions enabled us to select questions within an appropriate range of difficulty based on participants range of water science knowledge thereby increasing the accuracy of measurement as can be observed in fig 2 question difficulties approximate the same normal curve around the mean as participants owsks the owsk assessment of florida and georgia residents yielded a model item separation capacity to distinguish between high and low performers of 7 79 and reliability reproducibility of item measures of 0 98 person model separation confirmation of item difficulty hierarchy was 1 96 with a reliability reproducibility of person measures of 0 79 these measures indicate reliability and validity are appropriate for run of the mill testing linacre 2020b participants owsk measures had a weak positive correlation with right political orientation r 804 0 162 p 0 000 the owsk results indicate that florida and georgia participants the majority of whom reside in metropolitan counties have higher levels of scientific knowledge on water topics that they may have encountered in their daily lives and through local news these topics include urban environments water conservation climate change and algae for example 67 percent of participants correctly indicated that it is more difficult for rain to soak into the ground in urban environments than other land use types likewise at least 60 percent of respondents were able to correctly identify each of a series of potential steps that cities can take to reduce water use a majority of participants correctly identified each of a series of predicted climate change effects seventy one percent of participants correctly identified algae as an indicator of high nutrient levels and a majority correctly identified harms that can result from algal blooms perhaps the most fundamental indicator of the public s inability to understand regional water challenges was proper identification of underground water as the region s primary drinking water source an answer selected by only 54 percent of participants in georgia and 59 percent of participants in florida fifty four percent of the overall sample correctly selected the definition of an aquifer other topics on which participants possessed relatively low levels of water science knowledge included natural water processes nutrient pollution and current water policy all of which could be highly relevant to future water policy in the region for example the natural processes that affect aquifer water levels and water quality will likely influence determinations of which activities should be curtailed or promoted by water policy and where in the region such changes should occur e g the unconfined region yet it appears the public may not understand the scientific basis for such determinations only 44 percent of respondents correctly identified rainwater seeping through the soil as the primary way water levels increase in the floridan aquifer this is the same percentage that correctly indicated that easily infiltrated soils carry the risk of increased groundwater pollution nitrogen and phosphorous were correctly identified as the two primary nutrients of concern by only 30 and 35 percent of participants respectively and the key contributors of those nutrients fertilizers and septic tanks were correctly selected by 50 and 20 percent of participants respectively when asked the reasons why aquifer levels decline during droughts 54 percent of respondents correctly indicated that less rain falls on the land above the aquifer and only 40 percent correctly indicated that more water than usual is pumped from the aquifer on current water policy a minority of participants correctly identified elements of major policies in their states participants also had difficulty identifying the difficulties of water policy for instance when asked to identify one of the challenges faced by agencies trying to limit water pollution 41 percent correctly indicated it can be difficult to determine where the pollution came from furthermore 44 percent correctly identified reservoirs desalinization and aquifer storage and recovery collectively as ways to provide supplemental water calls for aquifer protection in the region are often framed as a means to protect natural springs yet only 48 percent of participants correctly identified a spring as an area where groundwater flows to the surface with this information we can consider whether the public s level of water science knowledge would enable them to competently participate in water discussion and make citizen level voting decisions on water topics given that the owsk assessment questions were based upon experts perceptions of what the public should know in order to make good citizen level water decisions the results suggest that public water science knowledge is not currently adequate to guide productive water decision making moreover to the extent that individuals are motivated to base their water beliefs on scientific consensus most lack the capacity to do so 5 2 rq2 on what water topics do people s water beliefs reflect their perception of what scientists think is true are there variations across political orientations unlike the owsk assessment where the objective was to measure the accuracy of participants water science knowledge the assessment of beliefs was not concerned with the factual correctness of respondents choices instead the objective was to determine if people held as their personal beliefs that which they perceived to be the beliefs of water scientists regardless of accuracy whereas many questions in owsk assessment began with according to water scientists to prompt participants to respond with their scientific knowledge in this section we explicitly asked participants what they personally think participants personal water beliefs and their perceptions of scientists beliefs are illustrated in fig 3 by topic and political orientation the gray points in each chart connected by dotted lines depict the percentage of individuals who believe the idea posed in the provided statement does or does not reflect what scientists believe the black points connected by solid lines represent the percentage of individuals who accept or reject the concept as part of their personal beliefs when responding to the questions upon which each chart is based participants had the option to select i don t know enough to answer therefore those individuals represented in the charts are only those who had enough confidence in their perspectives to assert a position if participants match their water beliefs to what they perceive scientists think the two lines in each chart should be roughly parallel we may also expect some space between the parallel lines with personal beliefs above perceived scientists beliefs indicating more confidence in one s own beliefs less selection of the i don t know option than in their understanding of the beliefs of scientists if however the two lines substantially diverge from parallel then participants beliefs reflect a deviation from what they perceive scientists to think these are the conditions that suggest a water communication problem the first two sets of charts in fig 3 those depicting perspectives on fertilizer and septic systems as water pollutants show relative alignment between personal beliefs and perceived scientists beliefs for the political left moderates and the political right in other words the full spectrum of political orientations personally accept as their own beliefs that which they perceive to be the beliefs of scientists the slope of the lines differs between the two sets of graphs due to differences in the public s knowledge of contamination from fertilizer versus contamination from septic systems as observed in the owsk assessment however on topics related to the impact of climate change on water availability and the adequacy of water supply to meet demand in 20 years the political right shows a misalignment of between their personal beliefs and perceived scientists beliefs though the largest percentage of respondents on the political right indicated that scientists believe climate change will affect water availability in the region and that in 20 years there will not be enough groundwater and surface water to meet regional demand there is substantial dismissal of this conception in their personal beliefs fig 4 illustrates the same comparisons as fig 3 but divides the sample by owsk level instead of political orientation the beliefs and perceptions of those with owsk measures above the mean are reflected in the high owsk charts while individuals measured below the owsk mean are reflected in the low owsk charts that line pairs do not substantially deviate from parallel across owsk levels suggests that the differences observed across political orientations fig 3 are not a result of differences in water science knowledge across groups we further evaluated these observations by regressing participants owsk measures against their personal beliefs and perceptions of scientists beliefs as displayed in table 4 which applies a significance threshold of p 0 05 owsk had a significant effect on participants perception of scientists beliefs for each of the four topics and this outcome was true regardless of political orientation however the effect of owsk on personal beliefs was not consistently significant across political identities while owsk had a significant effect on all four topics of personal belief held by the political left and moderates it had no significant effect on the political right s personal beliefs about septic systems as a source of water pollution x 2 2 n 242 2 62 p 0 27 the impact of climate change on water availability x 2 2 n 242 3 93 p 0 14 nor the ability of surface and groundwater supplies to meet demand in 20 years x 2 2 n 242 5 45 p 0 07 this suggests that the water beliefs of many on the political right were not substantially connected to their understanding of water science in these cases the influence of owsk may have been overridden by political inclinations that run contrary to perceived scientists beliefs though these results suggest that some on the political right may not rely on owsk as a determinant of some of their water beliefs there is evidence that this is not a one sided phenomenon the political left may behave in a similar manner even if doing so does not result in a water science communication problem to illustrate on the topic of water pollution from fertilizer owsk accounts for approximately 2 8 of the variance in personal beliefs of left leaning participants but 14 9 of the variance in personal beliefs of right leaning partisans nagelkerke pseudo r square statistics in other words the political right comes to believe that fertilizer is a pollutant by consulting their owsk while the political left comes to the same conclusion but relies more on factors other than scientific knowledge to do so since the political left perceives higher levels of water risk left leaning individuals can simply follow their environmental predispositions and fortuitously align with water science they need not rely on scientific knowledge to come to the conclusion that fertilizer is a pollutant right oriented individuals however must actively choose scientific knowledge to make the same determination as indicated by the nagelkerke pseudo r square statistics in table 4 in cases not exhibiting the science communication problem the political right tends to rely on owsk more than the political left as a note the literature does not provide strong guidance on interpretation of pseudo r square therefore although these statistics provide a measure of relative effect they should be used with caution 6 discussion in florida and georgia we have identified early signs of a potential water science communication problem the topics exhibiting divergence of participants personal beliefs from what they perceive scientists to believe are those with the clearest partisan triggers climate change is known to exhibit the science communication problem fielding and hornsey 2016 mccright and dunlap 2011 as well as solution aversion campbell and kay 2014 and we found similar results in this study when climate was invoked in conjunction with water availability the topic of water supply adequacy 20 years in the future also exhibited the problem suggesting a similar activation of partisan positioning baldwin and lammers 2016 one reason this may have occurred is that inadequacy of supply suggests a greater level of environmental risk than the political right may feel is warranted given their low perception of environmental risk relative to other risk types douglas and wildavsky 1982 haidt 2012 and their low perception of water risk relative to individuals on the political left though the political left perceived only a moderate level of water risk table 2 second inadequacy of supply suggests the need for governmental measures to regulate increasingly strained water supplies which clashes with the political right s preference for comparatively lower levels of governmental oversight of resources douglas and wildavsky 1982 haidt 2012 at present the observed deviation of personal beliefs from impressions of scientists beliefs may be of negligible consequence based on the owsk results and the moderate level of perceived water risk across the political spectrum table 2 it appears that water issues in the floridan aquifer region have not yet robustly entered public consciousness therefore tendencies toward water partisanship can largely go inactivated however as water issues become more intrusive in people s lives either in ways that are directly observed or through media coverage it is likely that the public will become increasingly engaged with water topics expanded engagement has the potential to activate new water partisanship along with an obstructive water science communication problem though this study was conducted in two states with specific water challenges the subtopics on which a potential water science communication problem was observed are not region specific on broader regional and national scales there is risk that water could take on the stifling characteristics of other issues if and when water discourse and water policy increase in prominence despite the risk there is reason for optimism because positions on water issues do not yet appear to be ingrained in national partisan identities in a manner comparable to the climate science communication problem thus the findings of this study should not be read as a foretelling of a politically divided water future but rather as early warning signs of the divided future that could develop if intervening measures are not taken through the use of communication framing that purposefully associates water security measures with the values and motivations of the political right it may be possible to alter the automatically triggered positions that at present cause the political right to deviate from their perceptions of scientists beliefs feinberg and willer 2013 wolsko et al 2016 lines of research that should be considered in the development of framing interventions include kahan et al 2011 theory of cultural cognition and haidt s 2012 moral foundations theory studies using these models have demonstrated for example that presenting environmental protection as an act of patriotism or as a means to protect the purity of natural resources can yield relative parity in policy support between the political left and the political right feinberg and willer 2013 wolsko et al 2016 other studies have found that the identity of the message communicator a republican spokesperson for example can increase framing effectiveness bolsen et al 2019 hartman and weber 2009 while these approaches have been used in past research primarily with the objective of reducing division on highly polarized topics the models could prove even more effective as a means to minimize the initial escalation of partisanship inoculation studies have demonstrated that through preemptive exposure to anticipated persuasive appeals individuals can guard themselves against polarizing messages banas and rains 2010 compton et al 2021 van der linden et al 2017 moreover inoculation interventions can have pass along effects in which resistance spreads beyond those who directly received preemptive exposure compton et al 2021 if framing interventions are utilized early to limit partisans association of water science with politically undesirable outcomes there may not be a need to address severe water partisanship as water issues become more pronounced productive interventions can also be designed to improve water science knowledge when partisan positioning did not interfere the public indicated personal beliefs aligned with what they perceived scientists to think this tendency was most apparent on the topic of fertilizer as a pollutant where the vast majority of respondents across political orientations accurately identified scientifically endorsed fact and indicated personal beliefs that aligned with that fact however the owsk assessment results indicate that the public does not possess the ability to discern scientific consensus on most water topics environmental issues are distinct from other social issues such as equal pay and zoning restrictions in that they are more directly rooted in science fischer 2000 therefore a base level of scientific understanding is often necessary for citizens to engage in deliberation about the environmental decisions that affect their lives such as how water resources are managed while participation is a democratic ideal the result of increased participation can be amplified conflict and confusion if attention is not also paid to trust and community building jasanoff 1996 one technique for fostering the simultaneous development of knowledge trust and community is the use of inclusive processes that involve stakeholders of all types in knowledge development and decision making fischer 2000 horlick jones 1998 in contrast to top down knowledge dissemination approaches inclusive processes also have the benefit of increasing scientists awareness and appreciation of the public s experiential knowledge the incorporation of which can improve the selection implementation and acceptance of water policy measures burgess et al 1998 jasanoff 1999 thompson and rayner 1998 participatory processes are not merely a way to demonstrate inclusiveness but a means to maximize knowledge among scientists and stakeholders alike returning to our earlier remarks on culture barth argues for knowledge as a major modality of culture 2015 p 66 in which groups of people possess distinct insights into topics such as water challenges thinking of culture as knowledge emphasizes openness and inclusion as a way to embrace others as knowledge producers barth 2015 studies of the public s mental models of regional water processes and issues may further aid in the development of owsk interventions conceptual content cognitive mapping 3cm is one approach for revealing how individuals think about complex processes including the items present and absent in their conceptions and the connections between those items kearney 2015 with this information specific water knowledge gaps and scientific misconceptions can be identified 3cm can also reveal differences between groups that could inhibit effective communication for example a 3cm analysis of environmentalists and agricultural producers mental models of the relationship between water and economy in the floridan aquifer region exposed areas of false conflict between the groups hundemer and monroe 2020 the analysis further suggested how increased exposure to specific topics could improve cross group understanding and cooperation toward shared goals as water science knowledge and belief interventions are developed additional consideration of the differences between rural and urban audiences may be warranted participants in this study 85 2 percent of whom resided in metropolitan counties performed best on owsk topics that have direct relevance to the metropolitan experience such as water movement in urban environments and residential water conservation we may therefore expect rural residents with different life experiences to exhibit higher than average scientific knowledge on topics such as agriculture and rural living residents of rural and urban areas may also be affected in different ways by changes in water quality water availability and water regulation which may influence their water beliefs the data from this study could be used as a starting point for examination due to geographic location limited economic resources and limited access to power socio economically vulnerable groups may experience more detrimental impacts from water challenges than the average individual and have more difficulty adequately responding to those challenges allen et al 2006 weisner et al 2020 wescoat et al 2007 limited political influence also makes it less likely that the concerns of these groups will be reflected in policy discourse therefore as interventions are developed particular care should be taken to incorporate the perspectives of those who may be acutely impacted but less heard finally as steps are taken to combat a potential water science communication problem and to increase the ability of the public to participate in water policy care should be taken to protect the perceived legitimacy of water science keohane et al 2014 lackey 2007 nisbet 2016 science will not be perceived as neutral ground to which all parties can refer if it is used to coax people toward a right outcome it has been suggested that climate science has been rejected in part because science rather than social values has been used to justify policy action campbell and kay 2014 by presenting climate action as the right scientific decision and not instead presenting climate policy as a value decision for which society must weigh competing economic ecological and altruistic costs and benefits communicators left little space for those who were solution averse to express their discontent beyond challenging the science itself campbell and kay 2014 on water topics communicators can help preserve scientific legitimacy and thereby reduce the potential for a water science communication problem by creating space for value debate and situating science as a tool for quantifying and predicting the implications of alternative courses of action 7 conclusions evaluation of the alignment between individuals personal water beliefs and their perceptions scientists beliefs indicated a possible water science communication problem in florida and georgia that may exist at broader regional and national scales sampled residents of florida and georgia were generally not well informed on regional water issues however they indicated personal beliefs that aligned with their perception of scientists beliefs on those topics that did not require them to counter inclinations associated with political orientation partisan inclinations appeared to be easily triggered and carried the potential to usurp the influence of scientific knowledge these findings suggest that water has the potential to become an increasingly partisan topic if intervening measures are not taken

3836,in agricultural fields tile drains represent potential pathways for the migration of solutes such as nitrates in groundwater and surface water bodies tile drain flow is controlled by the temporal and spatial dynamics of the shallow groundwater table which results from complex interactions between climate topography and soil heterogeneity studies on the effect of topsoil heterogeneity on shallow water and drainage dynamics by fully 3d surface water and groundwater flow modeling are limited the objective of our study is to demonstrate the use of depth specific electrical conductivity ec estimates to improve hydrological simulations in a tile drained field the model was applied to a field site in denmark where times series of drainage discharge and water table elevations are available clay rich soil zones were identified in a tile drained field using depth specific electrical conductivity estimates generated by the inversion of apparent electrical conductivity data measured using an electromagnetic induction instrument one model that included the low permeability clayey zones in the soil layers down to a depth of 1 2 m was compared to a simpler model that assumed homogeneous soil layers both models simulate drainage discharge that compares well to the observations however including the clayey zones improves the simulation of hydraulic heads and water table fluctuations and generates flooded areas that are more representative of those observed during the wet seasons our results suggest that the simulation of water table fluctuations can be improved when the soil heterogeneity determined from depth specific ec estimates is included in integrated hydrological models a better representation of the subsurface flow dynamics will also improve subsequent simulations of the transport and fate of agrochemical substances leaching from fields such as nitrate which may deteriorate the quality of groundwater and surface water bodies 1 introduction the spatial variability of the structure and hydraulic properties of soils can have a great impact on water flow and solute transport however it is often poorly known and the uncertainty associated with the parameterization of soil structure and properties in hydrological models can be large this uncertainty then propagates to predictions of hydrological models to reduce uncertainty and improve simulations with process based hydrological models several authors have explicitly incorporated subsurface heterogeneity ali et al 2014 atchley and maxwell 2011 hansen et al 2019 in agricultural tile drained fields the water table geometry and consequently water discharge from tile drains are to a high extent controlled by the hydraulic properties of the soils and the deeper geological units akay et al 2008 bednorz et al 2016 de schepper et al 2017 kennedy et al 2012 hansen et al 2009 and by the configuration of the tile drain network de schepper et al 2015 for instance eastman et al 2010 compared subsurface drainage discharge for several agricultural sites and observed greater discharge for clay loam soils compared to sandy loam soils hansen et al 2013 simulated coupled groundwater surface water flow in tile drained areas and found that an insufficient representation of local subsurface heterogeneity is one of the limiting factors for adequately reproducing observed hydraulic heads and local scale drainage discharge dynamics haws et al 2005 used effective homogeneous soil properties to simulate flow and transport in tile drained macroporous agricultural fields and concluded that assuming soil homogeneity hindered the reproduction of observed tile drain water and solute discharge in addition to allowing a better representation of flow dynamics accounting for different flow route contributions by including tile drains and soil heterogeneity is also deemed essential for the accurate simulation of solute transport van der velde et al 2010 nitrate leaching bednorz et al 2016 and seasonal in stream nitrate concentration wriedt et al 2007 in one study refsgaard et al 2019 showed that geological heterogeneity in tile drained fields resulted in substantial local spatial variations in nitrogen reduction in groundwater and surface water borehole data is usually available for the estimation of the soil parameters however the natural variability in the soil hydraulic parameters is too large for reliable estimation of soil heterogeneity only based on locally and widely spaced borehole data this limitation can be addressed by correlating local measurements to an auxiliary variable that represents the spatial distribution of the parameters blöschl and sivapalan 1995 geophysical methods such as electrical conductivity ec surveys are well suited to detect spatial soil heterogeneity at very high resolution krüger et al 2013 georeferenced soil ec measurements have proven suitable for mapping soil properties such as texture water content organic matter and cation exchange capacity in non saline soils corwin and lesch 2004 heil and schmidhalter 2012 huang et al 2017 koganti et al 2017 sheets and hendricks 1995 recent advances in electromagnetic induction emi instruments and the development of sophisticated inversion routines have enabled on the go measurement of apparent electrical conductivity eca at multiple depths allowing the determination of depth specific ec estimates these estimates can be related to soil properties such as salinity soil water and clay contents huang et al 2016 koganti et al 2018 robinet et al 2018 møller et al 2021 and can provide three dimensional mapping of these properties koganti et al 2018 khongnawang et al 2019 hence emi is a promising tool to quantify the depth dependent zonation of soil parameters using bulk soil eca measurements in a tile drained field varvaris et al 2018 illustrated that the clay size fraction increased with depth they identified depression zones and the presence of a shallow low permeability layer hansen et al 2019 used resistivity data for sediments down to 3 5 m below ground surface based on emi measurements to set up a 3d hydrological model to simulate drain flow at the field scale they associated a zone of higher resistivity to a higher sand content and used it to delineate in their model a zone of high hydraulic conductivity from 0 to 3 5 m in depth there are still however only a few published studies where depth specific ec estimates generated from the inversion of eca data measured by an emi instrument have been used to delineate soil heterogeneity for integrated hydrological simulations furthermore to the authors knowledge there are no studies where heterogeneous soil zones in tile drained areas were delineated based on ec estimates for the investigation of hydrological simulations as opposed to a homogeneous soil layers model the objective of the present study is to demonstrate the use of depth specific ec estimates to improve hydrological simulations in a tile drained field we hypothesize that including clay rich zones using ec estimates in a 3d coupled surface subsurface hydrological model of a tile drained field would improve the model performance resulting in a more accurate description of the local groundwater table level drainage discharge groundwater surface water exchange and surface runoff we used the integrated surface subsurface hydrological model hydrogeosphere aquanty 2017 which simulates the interaction between groundwater and surface water and the possible redistribution of water by exfiltration followed by run off and re infiltration the study focuses on a highly heterogeneous tile drained field in denmark the methodology consisted in 1 delineating clay rich zones at different depths using soil ec estimates with a vertical resolution of 20 cm and borehole soil texture analyses 2 simulating coupled surface water groundwater and tile drain flow in a tile drained field for a reference model with homogeneous soil layers and a second model with heterogeneous soil layers defined from the ec estimates and 3 analyzing the flow components for the two model conceptualisations and comparing observed and simulated hydraulic heads and drainage discharge 2 methods and data 2 1 site description the study site is located in an agricultural region about 20 km south of the city of aarhus denmark 55 59 n 10 4 e fig 1 it covers an area of 14 ha and is within the larger fensholt catchment whose area is 6 km2 the study site is tile drained with a network configuration shown in fig 1c the local climate is characterized by mild winters cool summers and frequent precipitation he et al 2015 the landscape consists of rolling hilly terrain with ground elevation ranging from 72 to 95 m above mean sea level approximately 83 of the site area is used for agricultural activities the surficial geology consists of a 20 50 m thick cover of quaternary glacial deposits composed of both clayey and sandy sediments the lithology of the clay sediments varies from glaciolacustrine clay to clayey till containing distributed and relatively small units of sandy glacial deposits of glaciofluvial origin 2 2 hydrologic data tile drainage discharge at the site was measured daily at the outlet indicated by the drainage station in fig 1c by an electromagnetic flow meter krohne optiflux 3070 flow meter krohne messtechnik gmbh duisburg germany the water table is shallow in the area de schepper et al 2017 hansen et al 2019 he et al 2014 and three piezometers p17 p18 and p19 shown in fig 1c screened from ground surface to a depth of 2 m were installed to manually measure water table levels twice a month the piezometers were already installed at the field site prior to our study as part of the idræn project of aarhus university see more in www idraen dk rainfall events were not studied because the hydraulic head observations were not available at a sufficiently fine temporal resolution e g daily precipitation data were obtained from a meteorological station situated 3 km southwest of the study area total annual precipitation for 2014 and 2015 was 909 and 1134 mm respectively potential evapotranspiration was estimated with the penman monteith equation using data from a meteorological station in foulum denmark 56 29 n 9 35 e 62 5 km from the study area 2 3 soil data varvaris et al 2018 collected a total of 76 soil samples from various depths at locations shown in fig 1c and determined the soil texture for sixteen of these samples the main soil textures are coarse sandy loam sandy clay loam and clayey loam according to the usda soil texture classification the clay content increases with depth due to pedological clay illuviation processes leading to an expected decrease in permeability with depth the redistribution of soil particles according to the hydro topographical gradients results in high clay and organic matter contents in depression zones the average thickness of each soil horizon was determined from borehole descriptions the soil water retention swr curves were determined for 31 undisturbed 100 cm3 soil samples from that total 16 samples were excavated from the topsoil at the site and 15 samples were taken at three different depths 0 20 cm 28 48 cm and 85 105 cm at a nearby area immediately south of the drainage area fig 1b the soil cores were placed in a sandbox and slowly saturated with ascendant water they were then drained to different pressure heads utilizing a sandbox 30 and 100 cm h2o hanging water column 300 cm h2o and a ceramic pressure plate apparatus 1000 cm h2o the dry bulk density was determined by oven drying the soil samples at 105 c for 24 h the volumetric water content at each pressure head θ cm3 cm 3 was determined from the weight of the soil sample after each drainage step afterwards the van genuchten parameters α and n were estimated using the soil water retention and the variably saturated hydraulic conductivity as input in the retc software van genuchten et al 1991 the saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured at different depths at the nearby area with the constant head method as described by iversen et al 2004 using undisturbed 6280 cm3 soil samples we used the single transmitter multi receiver emi instrument operating at a frequency of 9 khz dualem 21s dualem inc milton on canada for measuring the bulk soil eca at various depths in this instrument a transmitter coil is located at one end and is shared by two pairs of receiver coils in both horizontal coplanar hcp and perpendicular prp orientations for the hcp configurations the transmitter receiver separation distances are 1 and 2 m and for the prp configurations they are 1 1 and 2 1 m respectively the quadrature phase and in phase signal responses of the emi sensor are representative of the eca and the apparent magnetic susceptibility of the soil mcneill 1980 each of the four coil configurations results in the sensing of different soil volumes represented in the eca measurements dualem inc 2008 callegary et al 2012 the dualem sensor was mounted on a sled at a height of 0 3 m above ground attached to an all terrain vehicle with real time data georeferencing using real time kinematic global navigation satellite system rtk gnss and the data were collected on transects spaced approximately 8 m apart the aarhus workbench software auken et al 2009 was used for both automatic and manual data processing and for inversion the data were first automatically processed to remove negative eca values and to correct for the offset between the rtk gnss setup and the individual channels the signal to noise ratio was improved by averaging the data using an appropriate sounding distance 3 m and running mean width 6 m the raw data was then manually inspected to remove noise caused by anthropogenic coupling induced by features such as metal cables or field monitoring installations the changes made to the raw data are incorporated into the averaged data generated by the automatic processing step to better represent the ec distribution with depth and to estimate the average ec for the desired soil depths i e 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm 80 100 cm and 100 120 cm we inverted the processed eca data with a quasi 3d spatially constrained inversion algorithm auken et al 2015 viezzoli et al 2008 the inversion was necessary because the depth sensitivities of hcp and prp arrays are nonlinear measured eca is therefore a depth weighted average e g callegary et al 2007 tolboll and christensen 2007 and hence is a complicated representation of the true ec variability christiansen et al 2016 we refer the reader to christiansen et al 2016 for a comprehensive overview of data processing and inversion of the dualem measurements using the aarhus workbench software 2 4 geology and hydrogeology the geology and hydrogeology of both the fensholt catchment and study site have been previously characterized and conceptual models for the subsurface geology were developed he et al 2014 de schepper et al 2017 varvaris et al 2018 hansen et al 2019 he et al 2014 used geophysical and borehole data to develop multiple stochastic representations of the subsurface geology for a larger catchment that covers about 100 km2 and includes the study site the soil and geological model proposed by he et al 2014 was used by de schepper et al 2017 who developed a 3d hydrological model using hydrogeosphere for the fensholt catchment for the top 1 3 m of soil at the study site varvaris et al 2018 demonstrated that the single porosity model performed as well as the dual permeability model for simulating drainage outflow in a modeling study focused on an area close to our study site fig 1b varvaris et al 2021 show that including macropores in 2d hydrological models improved the fit between simulated and observed bromide concentrations in tile drains their results suggest that macropores can play a dominant role in water and solute transport in loamy structured tile drained fields 3 model application 3 1 numerical model the hydrogeosphere model aquanty 2017 was used for 2d surface and 3d subsurface hydrologic simulations for the tile drained field hydrogeosphere uses the control volume finite element method to simulate fully coupled surface water groundwater and tile drainage flow two dimensional surface water flow is simulated by solving the diffusion wave approximation of the saint venant equation three dimensional variably saturated groundwater flow is described by the modified form of richards equation 1 q γ ex q s w s s h t θ s s w t where q is a volumetric source positive or sink negative 1 t γ ex is the volumetric fluid exchange rate 1 t between the subsurface and the other simulation domains such as the surface domain s s is the specific storage coefficient l 1 s w θ θ s is the porous medium volumetric saturation and θ and θ s are the volumetric water content and volumetric water content at saturation respectively the fluid flux q l t is described by 2 q k k r ψ z where ψ is the pressure head l z is the elevation head l k is the hydraulic conductivity tensor l t and k r k r s w is the relative permeability of the porous media which is a function of its saturation hydrogeosphere simulates interception and actual evapotranspiration aet as mechanistic processes as described in panday and huyakorn 2004 and aquanty 2017 the newton raphson iterative method is used to linearize and solve the discretized nonlinear equations a maximum saturation variation of 0 05 between successive time steps was specified for the variable time stepping procedure in hydrogeosphere aquanty 2017 the initial time step was 60 s and time steps were limited to a maximum of 1 h 3 2 surface domain the horizontal boundaries of the surface flow domain coincide with the water contributing area for the outlet of the tile drainage system to discretize the surface flow domain a 2d triangular mesh was generated with the algomesh software fig 2 the topography was generated by interpolating a 1 6 m resolution digital elevation model onto the surface mesh in the vicinity of the drains the triangular elements of the mesh were refined with a maximum segment length equal to 10 m and an element area ranging from 2 to 35 m2 the number of nodes and triangular elements in the 2d surface mesh were 1481 and 2856 respectively the overland flow parameters specified for the surface domain are provided in table 1 the concepts of rill storage height hr and obstruction storage height ho in hydrogeosphere were applied to implicitly represent the micro topography of the soil surface the coupling length lc listed in table 1 represents the thickness of the interface between the subsurface and the surface domains 3 3 subsurface domain the 3d subsurface mesh was constructed by superimposing the surface triangular mesh along the vertical direction to generate 3d triangular prism elements the top of the 3d mesh corresponds to ground surface and a uniform vertical thickness of 20 m was assigned everywhere a total of 21 layers of 3d triangular prism elements were generated with each layer having a uniform thickness for the whole domain as shown in the cross section in fig 2 the upper soil horizons cover the entire study area from the surface down to a depth of 3 0 m those soil horizons ap 25 cm e 25 cm btg1 40 cm btg2 40 cm and c 170 cm were discretized with twelve layers of 3d elements the c horizon corresponds to a clayey till according to the stratigraphy presented by de schepper et al 2017 and varvaris et al 2018 one element layer was defined from a depth of 3 m to 4 m and 8 layers having each a thickness of 2 m were defined from a depth of 4 m down to the bottom of the simulation domain the number of nodes and triangular prism elements in the 3d mesh were 32 582 and 59976 respectively the location of the subsurface tile drains was obtained from existing maps and from consultations with local farmers the tile drains were assumed to be located at a depth of 1 2 m varvaris et al 2018 the total tile drains length is 1457 m and the drainage density total length per surface area is 106 m ha the vertical discretization around the drains was 10 cm which is the same value used by mohanty et al 1998 and thomas et al 2016 the tile drains were represented as seepage nodes in hydrogeosphere with a fixed pressure of zero and without resistance to flow hence tile drain flow occurs when the water table rises above the drain level water at the seepage nodes is instantaneously removed from the system and therefore water flow inside the drains towards the outlet is not numerically simulated outflow from all active seepage nodes is added to provide the total drainage flow rate at each time step typical tile drain velocities vary from 0 1 to 0 6 m s szejba and bajkowski 2019 but can reach as much as 1 5 m s sammons et al 2005 at our study site the longest linked drain connection is about 530 m using the range of values cited above between 0 1 m s and 1 5 m s the travel time in that longest drain connection could range between 350 s and 53 000 s considering these potential travel times with respect to the temporal scale of the discharge observations daily and the seasonal analysis 2 years using the sum of drainage discharge at all active seepage nodes to represent the total drain discharge was assumed to be a suitable approximation coupled surface water groundwater and tile drain flow were simulated for two different models that differ in the representation of the soil horizons in the top 1 3 m of the simulation domain both models use the same description of the geology for the rest of the domain between depths of 1 3 m and 20 m where a spatially variable distribution of quaternary sand and clay units is assigned based on the study of he et al 2014 fig 2 the hydraulic properties of the stochastic model assigned between depths of 3 m and 20 m are provided in table 2 the two models are described below 3 4 reference homogeneous layered soil model the first model called here the reference model assumes that each soil horizon between ground surface and a depth of 1 3 m is homogeneous soil properties calibrated by varvaris et al 2018 are assigned to horizons ap e btg1 and btg2 shown in fig 2 for each soil horizon the average values of soil parameters measured on core samples collected across the field are used as input for the pedotransfer functions ptf developed by iversen et al 2011 the ptf predicted values were used for the initial parameterization of the water flow models and afterwards the parameters were further adjusted during calibration that used the observed tile drainage discharge as the objective function varvaris et al 2018 assumed that their four layer two dimensional models were suitable to represent the spatial variation in topography and soil hydraulic characteristics of tile drained fields therefore in this study it is assumed that the three dimensional homogeneous soil layers model implicitly accounts for heterogeneity since the parameterization was based on the calibrated two dimensional models by varvaris et al 2018 varvaris et al 2018 assumed that the clayey till underneath the soil layers below a depth of 1 3 m is impermeable however we chose to include the clayey till in the simulations from a depth of 1 3 m to 3 0 m and define it as a low permeability unit corresponding to the c soil horizon fig 2 we assign to that unit hydraulic properties similar to those used by he et al 2015 de schepper et al 2017 and børgesen and schaap 2005 a similar c horizon configuration was used by de schepper et al 2017 and hansen et al 2019 specific storage values from he et al 2015 are assigned to all soil horizons the hydraulic properties of the soil horizons for the reference model are presented in table 3 3 5 heterogeneous soil layers model borehole data investigation showed that the soils are stratified and spatially heterogeneous varvaris et al 2018 with clay rich soils embedded in loamy soils coarse sandy loam and sandy clay loam for the development of the heterogeneous layered soil model we assume that soil properties can be inferred from ec estimates based on electromagnetic induction hansen et al 2019 also applied this approach for the delineation of soil zones in a field in the same catchment the ec measurements indicate the presence of zones with higher ec and a probably higher clay content and lower hydraulic conductivity in the uppermost portion of the soil down to a depth of 1 2 m however no specific ec values were related to the soil texture three loamy soil layers with clay rich zones were therefore defined based on the ec vertical resolution of 20 cm table 4 a coarse sandy loam soil between 0 and 40 cm depth and two sandy clay loam soils between 40 and 80 cm and 80 and 120 cm depth the nomenclature of soil horizons defined for the homogeneous layered model ap e btg1 btg2 and c was therefore not adopted and a clayey till layer was defined between 120 and 300 cm depth the borehole description was used to support the clay rich zones delineation although few clayey samples were located out of the delineated clay rich zones fig 3 the textures noted in borehole descriptions are approximated for each 20 cm layer for example if most of the soil located in the 20 40 cm is described as loamy then the texture for this depth interval indicates loamy soil fig 3 van genuchten parameters and k values obtained on samples from the nearby area fig 1b were used for the loamy soils the hydraulic properties of the clay rich zones from a depth of 0 120 cm were assumed invariable with depth and the van genuchten parameters obtained from samples of the topsoil with high clay content were used the hydraulic conductivities of the clay rich zones were extracted from he et al 2015 those hydraulic properties were also applied for the clayey till between 120 and 300 cm depth however the vertical hydraulic conductivity kv of the clay rich zones was increased to account for the effect of the macropores and improve model performance drainage discharges and hydraulic heads were better simulated for kv values 100 times higher than the horizontal hydraulic conductivities from 0 to 120 cm depth the hydraulic properties of the soil layers for the heterogeneous soil model are presented in table 4 3 6 actual evapotranspiration aet from the surface and subsurface are simulated using climatic and land use factors to define the complete soil water budget evapotranspiration properties of winter wheat triticum aestivum l listed in table 5 were assigned to the top of the model the maximum root depth was set to 1 2 m palosuo et al 2011 and a canopy interception of 0 05 mm was defined based on li et al 2008 values for the transpiration fitting parameters c1 c2 and c3 and the evaporation depth were those recommended by kristensen and jensen 1975 for danish soils the values of evaporation and transpiration limiting pressure heads were adjusted for winter wheat varvaris et al 2018 leaf area index values were extracted from an 8 day composite data set from the nasa earth observation data earthdata 2015 3 7 boundary conditions the upper boundary of the model corresponding to ground surface is assigned daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration fluxes for the surface water flow domain a critical depth boundary was assigned at the field outlet corresponding to the lowest ground surface elevation in the model where the drainage station is located the lateral boundaries correspond to groundwater divides and are therefore impermeable de schepper et al 2017 included a downward flow component in the fensholt catchment at a depth of 20 m we tested the addition of this downward flow component but it had a negligible effect for our study site therefore the bottom boundary was assumed impermeable 3 8 simulation strategy and performance metrics the simulations target a two year period 2014 and 2015 for which measurements of drainage discharge and hydraulic head are available a prior model spin up was required which is typical for coupled surface and subsurface hydrologic models ajami et al 2014 for the spin up we ran both models for 10 years using precipitation data from 23 july 2002 to 22 july 2012 the simulated hydraulic heads at the end of this 10 year period were then used as initial hydraulic heads for the simulation period from 23 july 2012 to 1st january 2016 the two different models were based on existing conceptual models developed for the site their performance in reproducing drainage discharge was assessed by computing the mean absolute error mae the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 the reproduction of hydraulic heads was assessed with the mae and the root mean square error rmse 3 9 sensitivity analysis and correlation we calculated the composite scaled sensitivity and the parameter correlation coefficients of the vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivities specific storage and porosity of all geological formations for the measured hydraulic heads and drainage discharges the observations were grouped into head and discharge groups the same weight was applied to each group such that they have the same contribution to the objective function regardless of the number of measurements of heads and drainage discharges available no information on the measurement uncertainty was available for the application of weights to the individual measurements the period of 01 08 2015 to 01 11 2015 was chosen for the sensitivity analysis the three months period comprises low and high flow conditions and was chosen to keep simulation times manageable the value of each parameter was varied by 10 in successive simulations while keeping fixed values for the other parameters to compute the jacobian matrix with the pest software doherty 2016a doherty 2016b that allows to quantify the composite scaled sensitivity and the parameter correlation coefficients 4 results 4 1 drainage discharge and surface runoff the simulated drainage discharge evapotranspiration and surface runoff for 2014 and 2015 are shown for the reference model and the heterogeneous soil model in fig 5 a and b respectively the figures also show the observed drainage discharge and the precipitation times series used as input for the reference model the nse for drainage discharge is equal to 0 75 for the 2014 2015 period which indicates an overall good performance the model is able to represent low flow rates lower than 1 mm d observed in summer however no drainage discharge is simulated during the summer of 2014 although a few summer peaks were observed for the summer of 2015 the simulated discharge during flow peaks is slightly higher than the observed one some discharge peaks are underestimated in 2014 and in january and april 2015 resulting in an underestimated cumulative drainage discharge from january 2014 to mid september 2015 fig 6 the global water balance for the reference model and the observed drain discharge for the years 2014 and 2015 are presented in fig 7 a and b respectively the surface runoff shown in the figures corresponds to surface water outflow at the critical depth boundary the actual evapotranspiration includes canopy surface and porous medium evaporation as well as transpiration the simulated drainage corresponds to 42 of the total rainfall for 2014 a percentage comparable to the observed drainage which is equal to 44 of total rainfall for the same year for 2015 the simulated discharge corresponds to 53 of the rainfall against 49 for the observed discharge evapotranspiration is the most important outflow during the summer period and it is similar in magnitude to the change in water stored during the winter period simulated surface runoff is not significant the variation in water stored in the surface and the porous medium is less than 1 of the total precipitation for the yearly basis analyses although more complexity is included in the heterogeneous soil layer model potentially providing a more realistic representation the performance of the model in reproducing drainage discharge shown in fig 5b mae 0 47 mm d nse 0 74 and kge 0 76 is slightly worse compared to the reference model mae 0 44 mm d nse 0 75 and kge 0 83 including spatially variable hydraulic properties of the more loamy and clayey soils therefore does not improve the model compared to the reference model that uses average values compared to the reference model surface runoff increases and the drain discharge volume decreases for the heterogeneous model consequently drainage discharge peaks are in general underestimated and the cumulative discharge volumes are lower than for the reference model fig 6 the water mass balance for the heterogeneous model is presented in fig 8 in 2014 the aet is the most important outflow followed by drainage in 2015 the drainage discharge is higher than aet the annual simulated drainage discharge is 352 mm in 2014 and 536 mm in 2015 these volumes correspond to 39 and 47 of total rainfall for 2014 and 2015 respectively drainage discharge underestimates the annual observed values of 404 mm and 553 mm for 2014 and 2015 respectively simulated surface runoff corresponds to 10 and 12 of the total rainfall for 2014 and 2015 larger than simulated by the reference model at the study site observations indicate that surface runoff mostly occurs in winter when aet is very low relative to precipitation see winter periods in fig 8 however the summer of 2015 presents higher simulated surface runoff 8 of rainfall than expected for the period the water exchange from the surface to the subsurface media at each time step represents infiltration which can originate from precipitation ponding of water on the soil surface and surface runoff the cumulative simulated infiltration for 2014 and 2015 is 2116 mm which is only 150 mm higher than the total infiltration of the reference model for the same period however the exfiltration from the porous medium to the surface 598 mm is 336 mm higher than the exfiltration of the homogeneous soils model 262 mm contributing to the higher surface runoff volumes in the heterogeneous soils model for 2014 and 2015 the total simulated drainage discharge corresponds to 50 of the infiltration against 49 of observed discharge storage variations in the porous medium surface domains have little effect on annual water balances the surface runoff peaks simulated at the outlet coincide with the peaks of rainfall during winter when the soil is saturated at the end of the 2015 summer when the rainfall intensity is high runoff for both models is greater than at the end of the 2014 summer when rainfall intensity is lower 4 2 hydraulic head observed hydraulic heads in piezometer 17 which corresponds to the local water table elevation and its seasonal variation are generally well reproduced by the reference model fig 9 except for the periods from november to december 2014 and september to november 2015 when the head is overestimated the seasonal variation is also well simulated in piezometers 18 and 19 but the hydraulic head is underestimated by around 50 cm the model adequately simulates the slow decrease of water levels in the spring and summer and the fast increase in the fall error statistics for the 3 piezometers are shown in table 6 with average mae and rmse values of 0 55 m and 0 61 m a snapshot of the spatial distribution of the water table depth for the reference model is shown in fig 10 a for both winter and summer in winter 15 01 2015 the simulated water table level is near the tile drain elevation and it rises to the soil surface in several areas located further from the drains in summer 15 07 2015 the hydraulic heads are lower than the tile drain elevation almost everywhere the heterogeneous soil model also reproduces observed hydraulic heads fairly well fig 9 especially for piezometers p18 and p19 which are located in clay rich zones the reproduction of hydraulic heads observed at piezometers p18 and p19 is better than for the reference model with mae varying from 0 68 m to 0 28 m p18 and from 0 68 m to 0 17 m p19 and rmse varying from 0 71 m to 0 40 m p18 and from 0 70 m to 0 20 m p19 the mae for hydraulic heads observed at p17 for the heterogeneous model 0 38 m is higher compared to that of the reference model 0 30 m simulated heads in piezometer p17 are generally lower than observed heads and heads simulated with the reference model the spatial distribution of the water table depth in winter 15 01 2015 shown in fig 10b is drastically different from that simulated with the homogeneous soil layers model simulated hydraulic heads are higher and the depth to water table is lower in the clay rich zones around the tile drains mainly in the central part of the study site in summer 15 07 2015 the simulated water table depth is almost similar for the reference and homogeneous models 4 3 sensitivity analysis and correlation for the reference homogeneous soil layers model one or more observations were highly sensitive to the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the btg1 and btg2 horizons and the porosities of the ap e and btg1 horizons the most correlated parameters are the specific storage of the btg2 horizon with the porosities of both the btg2 horizon and the glacial clay and the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the btg1 and btg2 soil horizons however other parameters are also highly correlated as indicated in fig 4a for the heterogeneous soil layers model one or more observations were highly sensitive to the horizontal hydraulic conductivities of the clayey till the sandy soil from 40 to 80 cm and the clayey loam from 80 to 120 cm the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the glacial clay and the porosities of both sandy and clayey loam from 0 to 40 cm depth in general the sensitivity of simulated hydraulic heads with respect to the model parameters was greater for piezometers p18 and p19 than for p17 and they were also greater than for the reference model the most correlated parameters are the specific storage of the clayey soil from 0 to 40 cm with the horizontal k for the clayey soil from 40 to 80 cm and the porosity of the sandy soil 80 120 cm with the vertical k of the glacial sand the parameter correlation coefficients are overall lower than for the homogeneous model fig 4b 5 discussion 5 1 zonation based on spatially distributed ec estimates when creating a hydrological model assumptions about the structure of the subsurface will inevitably be wrong impairing the representation of critical hydrological processes voss 2011 we assumed that including heterogeneity in the model would provide more realistic hydrological simulations in tile drained fields this assumption was based on the fact that tile drainage discharge represents an important water flow path and is controlled by both large and small scale heterogeneity the definition of heterogeneous soil zones based on spatially distributed ec estimates is promising due to the non invasive measurements obtained at different depths however the zonation based on ec estimates remains a coarse estimation of reality for a few boreholes the delineated areas based on the ec estimates shown in fig 3 are not consistent with the visual description available from the borehole logs the zonation of soil heterogeneity was suitable for the implementation in the 3d hydrological model and avoided the need to interpolate from sparse borehole data which could result in an erroneous distribution of soil properties the depth specific ec estimates were used as a criterion to define zones with effective parameters these zones were easily delineated using the triangular mesh structure for the implementation of different soil properties in the heterogeneous soil layers model the most significant difference between piezometers p17 p18 and p19 is that piezometers p18 and p19 are located in strongly anisotropic clay rich soils that have a 100 1 ratio between the vertical and horizontal hydraulic while soils in the vicinity of piezometer p17 are isotropic the anisotropy for p18 and p19 favors flow in the vertical direction as opposed to the horizontal direction the strong anisotropy around p18 and p19 and the lack of anisotropy around p17 may explain the contrasted response observed for the sensitivity analysis with simulated hydraulic heads at p18 and p19 more sensitive to the model parameters than heads at piezometer p17 for the same model and also compared to the reference model for all piezometers the parameter correlation coefficients are lower in the heterogeneous soils model fig 4a and b suggesting that the enhanced representation of soil heterogeneity could potentially improve the capacity of the model to assimilate the observations when compared to the reference model furthermore the combination of relatively high composite scaled sensitivity and low parameter correlation coefficients indicates a good capability of the calibration process to constrain the model parameters hill et al 2016 the delineated zones were based only on sparse borehole data and ec estimates however the topography also plays an important role in recharge and surface runoff a depression zone located around piezometer p18 may affect the soil properties as indicated from the soil texture from the boreholes analysis at the depth of 0 40 cm fig 3 future work can focus on delineating soil zones also based on topography 5 2 subsurface drainage simulation the reference homogeneous and heterogeneous soil layers models reproduce the observed tile drainage discharge reasonably well with lower tile drain flow in summer and higher in winter the low summer drainage discharge mainly results from higher evapotranspiration during the crop growing season the transition from low flow or almost no flow to the initiation of drainage in autumn is reproduced by both models both models also capture the dynamics of the drainage discharge peaks and reproduce the low no flow behavior during the summer periods in 2014 and 2015 the cumulative drainage from 2014 to 2015 is underestimated with the heterogeneous soil layers model during the entire period and it is underestimated from january 2014 to october 2015 with the reference homogeneous model using a 2d hydrological model at the same site varvaris et al 2019 overestimated the cumulative drainage discharge for the period 01 06 2013 01 06 2014 this overestimation was likely caused by the inclusion in their model of a systematic coverage of the field by tile drains whereas tile drains are only at specific locations in the field our models represent the tile drain network more realistically with lateral spreading between tile drains sufficiently large to allow some of the percolated water to bypass the tile drain system and flow deeper the underestimation observed in our models could be caused by the lack of lateral subsurface inflow the cumulative drainage for 2014 and 2015 indicated that increasing the model complexity with horizontally heterogeneous soils does not improve the overall behavior of the drainage discharge simulations in terms of volume and temporal dynamics however including heterogeneity results in a markedly different spatial resolution in hydraulic heads and thus water table elevations especially in winter left panel in fig 10 for the homogeneous model the water table is generally low in the vicinity of the drains but close to or at ground surface further away for the heterogeneous model areas with a near surface water table are in the clay rich zones and the total extent of areas with high water table elevations is smaller although the spatial hydraulic head distribution cannot be validated from field observations the simulated distribution for the homogeneous case may be questioned because a water table close to ground surface over such large areas is unlikely in an agricultural tile drained field despite the similarity of the simulated drainage discharges for both models their marked differences in the simulated spatial variation of the water table can in turn affect a subsequent simulation of nutrient reduction and transport processes dependent on moisture content such denitrification one implication of these results is that head observations complement the drainage discharge data for the evaluation of the model s performance eastman et al 2010 observed that the soil texture in drained fields influences the generation of outflow drainage discharge and surface runoff from precipitation it can be assumed from our study that the soil texture heterogeneity within a drained field also influences outflow generation 5 3 hydraulic heads and surface subsurface water exchange the groundwater dynamics observed in the piezometers is reproduced both with the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil layers model the water table fluctuations are more sensitive to soil properties than the simulated drainage discharge especially for the heterogeneous soil layers model one possible reason is that hydraulic heads represent local measurements representative of conditions in the vicinity of a piezometer while drainage discharge provides a cumulative value for the study field at our field site the piezometer screens were installed from ground surface to a depth of 2 m and the topsoil properties thus have a potentially great influence on the observed heads using the homogeneous soil layers model it was not possible to reproduce observed heads in all three piezometers simultaneously which suggests that soil heterogeneity should be accounted for to accurately simulate observed heads by introducing the clay rich zones in the soil layers the heterogeneous model resulted in an overall improvement in the fit for the three piezometers table 6 heads in piezometer p17 located in the sandy loam soil are underestimated which can be explained by the fact that the hydraulic properties for the loamy soils were estimated by water retention curves and applied directly without calibration moreover the effect of hysteresis was not considered in this study since the soil water retention curves were only measured under drying conditions not including hysteresis may explain some of the differences between the simulated and observed hydraulic heads across the field since several studies have identified the important role of hysteresis in water flow and solute transport modeling kaluarachchi and parker 1987 arrey et al 2018 likos et al 2014 the model results corroborate the assumptions of hansen et al 2013 that a better representation of local heterogeneity and the spatial variation of hydraulic conductivities can improve the spatial dynamics in hydraulic heads therefore the hypothesis that including clay rich zones in tile drained field improves the model performance may be true for the hydraulic heads but we cannot conclude that it was also the case for the drainage discharges according to woolhiser et al 1996 poor surface runoff simulation is expected if 1 a model structure cannot accommodate the spatial variability of saturated hydraulic conductivity or precipitation 2 a model cannot simulate the interaction between infiltration and surface runoff after a rainfall event or 3 there is an inadequate knowledge of the soil properties adding spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity in the model increased the simulated surface runoff volumes from 2 to 10 in 2014 and from 2 to 12 in 2015 related to the total precipitation as a comparison sloan et al 2016 simulated the water balance components for drained soils at the edge of the study site using the drainmod model and found that surface runoff represented 12 of total precipitation for clay 7 for silt and 0 4 for sand the higher volume of exfiltration water from the porous medium saturated excess runoff simulated for the heterogeneous models can be explained by the difference of hydraulic conductivity values between the loamy soils coarse sandy loam and sandy clay loam and clay rich zones in the more permeable loamy soil subsurface flow is more likely to occur than in the clayey soil where surface runoff would be generated sloan et al 2016 although surface runoff was not monitored in the study area and simulated runoff could not be compared to observed runoff including clay rich zones identified using ec estimates in the hydrological model resulted in more realistic runoff patterns compared to the study of sloan et al 2016 our simulations demonstrate that soil properties are a controlling factor for runoff generation as confirmed by hümann et al 2011 who conducted experiments to identify the dominant runoff generation process in agricultural and forested sites larger values for overland flow were also obtained in the hydrological models of merz and bárdossy 1998 which were conceptualized with structured or organized or deterministic soil variability as opposed to homogeneous and stochastic variability merz and plate 1997 developed physically based hydrological models including spatial variability of soil properties and compared a spatially homogeneous a randomly heterogeneous and a structured heterogeneous model they investigated a subcatchment that was composed of clay particles with a downslope position similar to our study site they showed that the structured heterogeneous spatial variability strongly influenced runoff furthermore the effects of the spatial variability were small for very small and for large runoff events although they only investigated summer events in our model larger surface runoff was generated during the large rainfall events in winter due to increased soil saturation in the study of merz and plate 1997 the soil was relatively dry prior to the large rainfall event representing the effect of infiltration excess runoff the flooded areas in depression zones observed around piezometer 18 dominated by clay rich zones are better represented by the heterogeneous soil layers model fig 10 that result suggests that the simulation of groundwater surface water exchange is spatially improved when horizontal soil heterogeneity was included using ec estimates 5 4 model resolution and computational time the same mesh was used in both models with maximum cell length of 10 m in the vicinity of the tile drains a similar cell discretization configuration was adopted in the 3d hydrological model developed by nousiainen et al 2015 they used a grid cell diameter of 6 25 m in the control model and 12 5 m in the model realizations for an agricultural field with an area of 12 ha which is similar to the area of our study site 14 ha the vertical discretization was refined to match the ec data resolution 20 cm we also generated a triangular mesh with higher resolution by reducing the maximum element size from 10 m to 5 m in the vicinity of the tile drains where the element areas ranged from 0 1 to 10 m2 the number of nodes and triangular elements in the refined 2d surface mesh were 3789 and 7446 respectively however refining the triangular mesh near the tile drains did not have a significant effect on the simulation of the drainage discharge and heads and the coarser configuration was maintained the horizontal mesh resolution was slightly coarser far from the tile drains with element size up to 30 m a finer mesh with a maximum element length of 1 m could better represent the horizontal heterogeneity far from the tile drains at the expense of increased simulation times however simulated heads at the boundaries p17 and p19 further away from the tile drains are less influenced by preferential flow in the tile drains consequently we assume that increasing the mesh resolution near the boundary and further away from the drains would not improve drain flow simulations and therefore not justify the additional computational burden of a denser mesh the maximum 1 h time step was used to ensure numerical stability especially for the heterogeneous soil model daily stress periods were necessary to accommodate daily drainage discharges including greater soil heterogeneity considerably increased the simulation time from 15 to 91 h the difference in soil properties changed the water flow paths creating larger hydraulic gradients which requires smaller time steps to solve the porous medium water flow and the surface subsurface water exchange the location of all drains was included explicitly in the model by resolving the drain location in the mesh if this approach were to be used for large scale models the number of computational nodes would increase very significantly leading to very large computational times that may render the simulation impractical 5 5 limitations of the conceptual model only one stochastic realization of the geological model developed by he et al 2014 was used to assign hydraulic properties for model layers between the depths of 3 to 20 m the small area of the studied field and the lack of deep piezometers do not allow a comprehensive analysis of groundwater flow below a depth of 2 m therefore alternative representations of the deeper geological units were not investigated considering the overall good simulations of the outflow the use of a different geological model for the deeper units would likely not improve the drainage discharge simulations including the soil horizontal heterogeneity in hydrological models with tile drains is relevant for the identification of flooded areas furthermore the parameter correlation coefficients indicate that the soil parameters are less correlated reducing the likelihood of non unique parameter sets however the heterogeneous soil layers model required a larger number of parameters than the reference model as each soil layer had two different soil zones soil heterogeneity data such as in situ measurements of soil water content is rarely available at other sites and at larger scales therefore further calibration is necessary to overcome the lack of representation of soil hydraulic properties 5 6 limitations of the modeling approach in structured soils macropores can be an important pathway for water flow and solute transport as observed in some danish glacial tills klint and gravesen 1999 nilsson et al 2001 christiansen et al 2004 in a modeling study haws et al 2005 found that assuming homogeneity for a field with preferential pathways contributed to the deficiencies of their tile drain water and solute discharge simulations vogel et al 2000 showed that including spatial variability in the hydraulic properties using the dual permeability approach improved the simulation of water and solute movement in naturally heterogeneous field soils in the clayey areas at our study site the soil may exhibit strong structures and possibly a high content of macropores iversen et al 2004 in the homogeneous model the effect of macropores is implicitly accounted for in the parameter estimation as described by varvaris et al 2018 while it was only considered in the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the clay rich zones in the heterogeneous model the drainage network at the site is represented explicitly by resolving the network in the computational mesh and defining seepage nodes for the exchange of water the amount of water drained is assumed to be controlled by the hydraulic gradient that develops between the subsurface and the drain which depends on the drain elevation and the hydraulic conductivity of the porous media while the drain pipes themselves are assumed not to pose a resistance to water flow in reality the tile drain walls and possible clogging of drains will increase resistance to flow which can only be estimated through model calibration improved model performance is therefore likely to be obtained through model calibration however both models provided results that are in good agreement with observed head and drainage discharge in terms of absolute values and temporal dynamics it was thus assumed that the performances of the models were adequate for assessing the impact on local scale heterogeneity for the study site it was possible to represent the drainage network explicitly in the computational mesh for large scale modeling this will not be computationally efficient furthermore the location of drains is commonly unavailable and the tile drainage system outlets are rarely documented this lack of data makes the explicit representation of drains in large scale model very uncertain and ways to represent the effect of drainage from agricultural fields need to be developed 5 7 equifinality in tile drainage discharge modeling uncertainty associated with the structure of a model the correlation between parameters the accuracy of the numerical solution the scarcity of data and the scale of representation leads to inherently non unique model solutions whereby different model configurations might adequately reproduce historical observations and honour expert knowledge refsgaard et al 2012 zhou et al 2014 hill et al 2016 delottier et al 2017 aster et al 2018 this concept referred to as equifinality beven 2006 beven and freer 2001 was systematically studied by klaus and zehe 2010 for the simulation of physically based preferential flow in a tile drained field among the large number of model configurations tested they showed that a smaller group of models performed equally well during calibration leading to equifinality which in turn affects the predictive uncertainty for their preferential flow simulations we investigated how the inclusion of heterogeneity consisting of clay rich zones can influence simulation results for the tile drained field provided that the model inputs observations and tile drain network are identical representation of heterogeneity was based on ec estimates but there is uncertainty associated with the delineation the clay rich zones and their hydraulic properties even if the inclusion of clay rich zones using ec estimates in the model closely represented the soil structure and their properties were accurately defined the model would still be subject to equifinality due to errors in prior model assumptions boundary conditions and field measurements in our study using average soil properties for the homogeneous soil layers resulted in simulated drainage discharges that reproduce observations as well as the heterogeneous soil layer model these results reveals equifinality for our simulations as shown also by klaus and zehe 2010 incorporating soil heterogeneity to simulate drainage discharges at our field site is probably not warranted because the homogeneous model performs equally well and it reduces computational times and facilitates model refutability and transparency hill 2006 furthermore data at most sites will likely be more scarce than for our well monitored field site such that increasing the inverse problem dimensionality by introducing more parameters could favour equifinality and increase uncertainty for simulated drainage discharges 6 conclusion this study demonstrates that spatially distributed depth specific electrical conductivity ec estimates can be used with borehole data for mapping soil heterogeneities in clayey till soils improving hydrological simulations in a tile drained field the effect of heterogeneous soil properties on drainage discharge and the water table fluctuation were investigated using 3d integrated hydrological models conceptualized with homogeneous and heterogeneous topsoil layers respectively heterogeneous soil zones were identified using depth specific ec estimates derived from the apparent electrical conductivity data measured using an electromagnetic induction instrument hydraulic parameters for the loamy soils were estimated from soil water retention measurements in the laboratory the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the clay rich soils in the heterogeneous soil model was manually calibrated all other parameters for both models were obtained from previous hydrological assessments at the site and the models were therefore not calibrated simulations with the heterogeneous soil layers model showed that including clay rich zones in predominately loamy soils coarse sandy loam and sandy clay loam affected the spatial distribution on shallow groundwater heads and drainage discharge together with a change in surface runoff actual evapotranspiration and storage including the topsoil heterogeneity generally improved the match to observed shallow groundwater levels particularly where clay rich zones had been identified although the drainage discharge simulated by the two models was comparable the homogeneous soil layers model resulted in better agreement between simulated and observed drainage discharge this improvement is probably due to the implicit representation of preferential water flow through macropores in defining hydraulic properties while only the vertical hydraulic conductivities were adjusted in the heterogeneous case the good reproduction of drain flow by the homogeneous soil layers model implies that including average soil hydraulic properties in 3d hydrological models can be adequate to simulate tile drainage discharges even for complex heterogeneous subsurface properties however the homogeneous model fails to realistically describe the spatial distribution of hydraulic heads within the field which is important to simulate nutrient reduction and transport processes dependent on water table elevation and moisture content credit authorship contribution statement vinicius f boico conceptualization methodology investigation writing

3836,in agricultural fields tile drains represent potential pathways for the migration of solutes such as nitrates in groundwater and surface water bodies tile drain flow is controlled by the temporal and spatial dynamics of the shallow groundwater table which results from complex interactions between climate topography and soil heterogeneity studies on the effect of topsoil heterogeneity on shallow water and drainage dynamics by fully 3d surface water and groundwater flow modeling are limited the objective of our study is to demonstrate the use of depth specific electrical conductivity ec estimates to improve hydrological simulations in a tile drained field the model was applied to a field site in denmark where times series of drainage discharge and water table elevations are available clay rich soil zones were identified in a tile drained field using depth specific electrical conductivity estimates generated by the inversion of apparent electrical conductivity data measured using an electromagnetic induction instrument one model that included the low permeability clayey zones in the soil layers down to a depth of 1 2 m was compared to a simpler model that assumed homogeneous soil layers both models simulate drainage discharge that compares well to the observations however including the clayey zones improves the simulation of hydraulic heads and water table fluctuations and generates flooded areas that are more representative of those observed during the wet seasons our results suggest that the simulation of water table fluctuations can be improved when the soil heterogeneity determined from depth specific ec estimates is included in integrated hydrological models a better representation of the subsurface flow dynamics will also improve subsequent simulations of the transport and fate of agrochemical substances leaching from fields such as nitrate which may deteriorate the quality of groundwater and surface water bodies 1 introduction the spatial variability of the structure and hydraulic properties of soils can have a great impact on water flow and solute transport however it is often poorly known and the uncertainty associated with the parameterization of soil structure and properties in hydrological models can be large this uncertainty then propagates to predictions of hydrological models to reduce uncertainty and improve simulations with process based hydrological models several authors have explicitly incorporated subsurface heterogeneity ali et al 2014 atchley and maxwell 2011 hansen et al 2019 in agricultural tile drained fields the water table geometry and consequently water discharge from tile drains are to a high extent controlled by the hydraulic properties of the soils and the deeper geological units akay et al 2008 bednorz et al 2016 de schepper et al 2017 kennedy et al 2012 hansen et al 2009 and by the configuration of the tile drain network de schepper et al 2015 for instance eastman et al 2010 compared subsurface drainage discharge for several agricultural sites and observed greater discharge for clay loam soils compared to sandy loam soils hansen et al 2013 simulated coupled groundwater surface water flow in tile drained areas and found that an insufficient representation of local subsurface heterogeneity is one of the limiting factors for adequately reproducing observed hydraulic heads and local scale drainage discharge dynamics haws et al 2005 used effective homogeneous soil properties to simulate flow and transport in tile drained macroporous agricultural fields and concluded that assuming soil homogeneity hindered the reproduction of observed tile drain water and solute discharge in addition to allowing a better representation of flow dynamics accounting for different flow route contributions by including tile drains and soil heterogeneity is also deemed essential for the accurate simulation of solute transport van der velde et al 2010 nitrate leaching bednorz et al 2016 and seasonal in stream nitrate concentration wriedt et al 2007 in one study refsgaard et al 2019 showed that geological heterogeneity in tile drained fields resulted in substantial local spatial variations in nitrogen reduction in groundwater and surface water borehole data is usually available for the estimation of the soil parameters however the natural variability in the soil hydraulic parameters is too large for reliable estimation of soil heterogeneity only based on locally and widely spaced borehole data this limitation can be addressed by correlating local measurements to an auxiliary variable that represents the spatial distribution of the parameters blöschl and sivapalan 1995 geophysical methods such as electrical conductivity ec surveys are well suited to detect spatial soil heterogeneity at very high resolution krüger et al 2013 georeferenced soil ec measurements have proven suitable for mapping soil properties such as texture water content organic matter and cation exchange capacity in non saline soils corwin and lesch 2004 heil and schmidhalter 2012 huang et al 2017 koganti et al 2017 sheets and hendricks 1995 recent advances in electromagnetic induction emi instruments and the development of sophisticated inversion routines have enabled on the go measurement of apparent electrical conductivity eca at multiple depths allowing the determination of depth specific ec estimates these estimates can be related to soil properties such as salinity soil water and clay contents huang et al 2016 koganti et al 2018 robinet et al 2018 møller et al 2021 and can provide three dimensional mapping of these properties koganti et al 2018 khongnawang et al 2019 hence emi is a promising tool to quantify the depth dependent zonation of soil parameters using bulk soil eca measurements in a tile drained field varvaris et al 2018 illustrated that the clay size fraction increased with depth they identified depression zones and the presence of a shallow low permeability layer hansen et al 2019 used resistivity data for sediments down to 3 5 m below ground surface based on emi measurements to set up a 3d hydrological model to simulate drain flow at the field scale they associated a zone of higher resistivity to a higher sand content and used it to delineate in their model a zone of high hydraulic conductivity from 0 to 3 5 m in depth there are still however only a few published studies where depth specific ec estimates generated from the inversion of eca data measured by an emi instrument have been used to delineate soil heterogeneity for integrated hydrological simulations furthermore to the authors knowledge there are no studies where heterogeneous soil zones in tile drained areas were delineated based on ec estimates for the investigation of hydrological simulations as opposed to a homogeneous soil layers model the objective of the present study is to demonstrate the use of depth specific ec estimates to improve hydrological simulations in a tile drained field we hypothesize that including clay rich zones using ec estimates in a 3d coupled surface subsurface hydrological model of a tile drained field would improve the model performance resulting in a more accurate description of the local groundwater table level drainage discharge groundwater surface water exchange and surface runoff we used the integrated surface subsurface hydrological model hydrogeosphere aquanty 2017 which simulates the interaction between groundwater and surface water and the possible redistribution of water by exfiltration followed by run off and re infiltration the study focuses on a highly heterogeneous tile drained field in denmark the methodology consisted in 1 delineating clay rich zones at different depths using soil ec estimates with a vertical resolution of 20 cm and borehole soil texture analyses 2 simulating coupled surface water groundwater and tile drain flow in a tile drained field for a reference model with homogeneous soil layers and a second model with heterogeneous soil layers defined from the ec estimates and 3 analyzing the flow components for the two model conceptualisations and comparing observed and simulated hydraulic heads and drainage discharge 2 methods and data 2 1 site description the study site is located in an agricultural region about 20 km south of the city of aarhus denmark 55 59 n 10 4 e fig 1 it covers an area of 14 ha and is within the larger fensholt catchment whose area is 6 km2 the study site is tile drained with a network configuration shown in fig 1c the local climate is characterized by mild winters cool summers and frequent precipitation he et al 2015 the landscape consists of rolling hilly terrain with ground elevation ranging from 72 to 95 m above mean sea level approximately 83 of the site area is used for agricultural activities the surficial geology consists of a 20 50 m thick cover of quaternary glacial deposits composed of both clayey and sandy sediments the lithology of the clay sediments varies from glaciolacustrine clay to clayey till containing distributed and relatively small units of sandy glacial deposits of glaciofluvial origin 2 2 hydrologic data tile drainage discharge at the site was measured daily at the outlet indicated by the drainage station in fig 1c by an electromagnetic flow meter krohne optiflux 3070 flow meter krohne messtechnik gmbh duisburg germany the water table is shallow in the area de schepper et al 2017 hansen et al 2019 he et al 2014 and three piezometers p17 p18 and p19 shown in fig 1c screened from ground surface to a depth of 2 m were installed to manually measure water table levels twice a month the piezometers were already installed at the field site prior to our study as part of the idræn project of aarhus university see more in www idraen dk rainfall events were not studied because the hydraulic head observations were not available at a sufficiently fine temporal resolution e g daily precipitation data were obtained from a meteorological station situated 3 km southwest of the study area total annual precipitation for 2014 and 2015 was 909 and 1134 mm respectively potential evapotranspiration was estimated with the penman monteith equation using data from a meteorological station in foulum denmark 56 29 n 9 35 e 62 5 km from the study area 2 3 soil data varvaris et al 2018 collected a total of 76 soil samples from various depths at locations shown in fig 1c and determined the soil texture for sixteen of these samples the main soil textures are coarse sandy loam sandy clay loam and clayey loam according to the usda soil texture classification the clay content increases with depth due to pedological clay illuviation processes leading to an expected decrease in permeability with depth the redistribution of soil particles according to the hydro topographical gradients results in high clay and organic matter contents in depression zones the average thickness of each soil horizon was determined from borehole descriptions the soil water retention swr curves were determined for 31 undisturbed 100 cm3 soil samples from that total 16 samples were excavated from the topsoil at the site and 15 samples were taken at three different depths 0 20 cm 28 48 cm and 85 105 cm at a nearby area immediately south of the drainage area fig 1b the soil cores were placed in a sandbox and slowly saturated with ascendant water they were then drained to different pressure heads utilizing a sandbox 30 and 100 cm h2o hanging water column 300 cm h2o and a ceramic pressure plate apparatus 1000 cm h2o the dry bulk density was determined by oven drying the soil samples at 105 c for 24 h the volumetric water content at each pressure head θ cm3 cm 3 was determined from the weight of the soil sample after each drainage step afterwards the van genuchten parameters α and n were estimated using the soil water retention and the variably saturated hydraulic conductivity as input in the retc software van genuchten et al 1991 the saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured at different depths at the nearby area with the constant head method as described by iversen et al 2004 using undisturbed 6280 cm3 soil samples we used the single transmitter multi receiver emi instrument operating at a frequency of 9 khz dualem 21s dualem inc milton on canada for measuring the bulk soil eca at various depths in this instrument a transmitter coil is located at one end and is shared by two pairs of receiver coils in both horizontal coplanar hcp and perpendicular prp orientations for the hcp configurations the transmitter receiver separation distances are 1 and 2 m and for the prp configurations they are 1 1 and 2 1 m respectively the quadrature phase and in phase signal responses of the emi sensor are representative of the eca and the apparent magnetic susceptibility of the soil mcneill 1980 each of the four coil configurations results in the sensing of different soil volumes represented in the eca measurements dualem inc 2008 callegary et al 2012 the dualem sensor was mounted on a sled at a height of 0 3 m above ground attached to an all terrain vehicle with real time data georeferencing using real time kinematic global navigation satellite system rtk gnss and the data were collected on transects spaced approximately 8 m apart the aarhus workbench software auken et al 2009 was used for both automatic and manual data processing and for inversion the data were first automatically processed to remove negative eca values and to correct for the offset between the rtk gnss setup and the individual channels the signal to noise ratio was improved by averaging the data using an appropriate sounding distance 3 m and running mean width 6 m the raw data was then manually inspected to remove noise caused by anthropogenic coupling induced by features such as metal cables or field monitoring installations the changes made to the raw data are incorporated into the averaged data generated by the automatic processing step to better represent the ec distribution with depth and to estimate the average ec for the desired soil depths i e 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm 80 100 cm and 100 120 cm we inverted the processed eca data with a quasi 3d spatially constrained inversion algorithm auken et al 2015 viezzoli et al 2008 the inversion was necessary because the depth sensitivities of hcp and prp arrays are nonlinear measured eca is therefore a depth weighted average e g callegary et al 2007 tolboll and christensen 2007 and hence is a complicated representation of the true ec variability christiansen et al 2016 we refer the reader to christiansen et al 2016 for a comprehensive overview of data processing and inversion of the dualem measurements using the aarhus workbench software 2 4 geology and hydrogeology the geology and hydrogeology of both the fensholt catchment and study site have been previously characterized and conceptual models for the subsurface geology were developed he et al 2014 de schepper et al 2017 varvaris et al 2018 hansen et al 2019 he et al 2014 used geophysical and borehole data to develop multiple stochastic representations of the subsurface geology for a larger catchment that covers about 100 km2 and includes the study site the soil and geological model proposed by he et al 2014 was used by de schepper et al 2017 who developed a 3d hydrological model using hydrogeosphere for the fensholt catchment for the top 1 3 m of soil at the study site varvaris et al 2018 demonstrated that the single porosity model performed as well as the dual permeability model for simulating drainage outflow in a modeling study focused on an area close to our study site fig 1b varvaris et al 2021 show that including macropores in 2d hydrological models improved the fit between simulated and observed bromide concentrations in tile drains their results suggest that macropores can play a dominant role in water and solute transport in loamy structured tile drained fields 3 model application 3 1 numerical model the hydrogeosphere model aquanty 2017 was used for 2d surface and 3d subsurface hydrologic simulations for the tile drained field hydrogeosphere uses the control volume finite element method to simulate fully coupled surface water groundwater and tile drainage flow two dimensional surface water flow is simulated by solving the diffusion wave approximation of the saint venant equation three dimensional variably saturated groundwater flow is described by the modified form of richards equation 1 q γ ex q s w s s h t θ s s w t where q is a volumetric source positive or sink negative 1 t γ ex is the volumetric fluid exchange rate 1 t between the subsurface and the other simulation domains such as the surface domain s s is the specific storage coefficient l 1 s w θ θ s is the porous medium volumetric saturation and θ and θ s are the volumetric water content and volumetric water content at saturation respectively the fluid flux q l t is described by 2 q k k r ψ z where ψ is the pressure head l z is the elevation head l k is the hydraulic conductivity tensor l t and k r k r s w is the relative permeability of the porous media which is a function of its saturation hydrogeosphere simulates interception and actual evapotranspiration aet as mechanistic processes as described in panday and huyakorn 2004 and aquanty 2017 the newton raphson iterative method is used to linearize and solve the discretized nonlinear equations a maximum saturation variation of 0 05 between successive time steps was specified for the variable time stepping procedure in hydrogeosphere aquanty 2017 the initial time step was 60 s and time steps were limited to a maximum of 1 h 3 2 surface domain the horizontal boundaries of the surface flow domain coincide with the water contributing area for the outlet of the tile drainage system to discretize the surface flow domain a 2d triangular mesh was generated with the algomesh software fig 2 the topography was generated by interpolating a 1 6 m resolution digital elevation model onto the surface mesh in the vicinity of the drains the triangular elements of the mesh were refined with a maximum segment length equal to 10 m and an element area ranging from 2 to 35 m2 the number of nodes and triangular elements in the 2d surface mesh were 1481 and 2856 respectively the overland flow parameters specified for the surface domain are provided in table 1 the concepts of rill storage height hr and obstruction storage height ho in hydrogeosphere were applied to implicitly represent the micro topography of the soil surface the coupling length lc listed in table 1 represents the thickness of the interface between the subsurface and the surface domains 3 3 subsurface domain the 3d subsurface mesh was constructed by superimposing the surface triangular mesh along the vertical direction to generate 3d triangular prism elements the top of the 3d mesh corresponds to ground surface and a uniform vertical thickness of 20 m was assigned everywhere a total of 21 layers of 3d triangular prism elements were generated with each layer having a uniform thickness for the whole domain as shown in the cross section in fig 2 the upper soil horizons cover the entire study area from the surface down to a depth of 3 0 m those soil horizons ap 25 cm e 25 cm btg1 40 cm btg2 40 cm and c 170 cm were discretized with twelve layers of 3d elements the c horizon corresponds to a clayey till according to the stratigraphy presented by de schepper et al 2017 and varvaris et al 2018 one element layer was defined from a depth of 3 m to 4 m and 8 layers having each a thickness of 2 m were defined from a depth of 4 m down to the bottom of the simulation domain the number of nodes and triangular prism elements in the 3d mesh were 32 582 and 59976 respectively the location of the subsurface tile drains was obtained from existing maps and from consultations with local farmers the tile drains were assumed to be located at a depth of 1 2 m varvaris et al 2018 the total tile drains length is 1457 m and the drainage density total length per surface area is 106 m ha the vertical discretization around the drains was 10 cm which is the same value used by mohanty et al 1998 and thomas et al 2016 the tile drains were represented as seepage nodes in hydrogeosphere with a fixed pressure of zero and without resistance to flow hence tile drain flow occurs when the water table rises above the drain level water at the seepage nodes is instantaneously removed from the system and therefore water flow inside the drains towards the outlet is not numerically simulated outflow from all active seepage nodes is added to provide the total drainage flow rate at each time step typical tile drain velocities vary from 0 1 to 0 6 m s szejba and bajkowski 2019 but can reach as much as 1 5 m s sammons et al 2005 at our study site the longest linked drain connection is about 530 m using the range of values cited above between 0 1 m s and 1 5 m s the travel time in that longest drain connection could range between 350 s and 53 000 s considering these potential travel times with respect to the temporal scale of the discharge observations daily and the seasonal analysis 2 years using the sum of drainage discharge at all active seepage nodes to represent the total drain discharge was assumed to be a suitable approximation coupled surface water groundwater and tile drain flow were simulated for two different models that differ in the representation of the soil horizons in the top 1 3 m of the simulation domain both models use the same description of the geology for the rest of the domain between depths of 1 3 m and 20 m where a spatially variable distribution of quaternary sand and clay units is assigned based on the study of he et al 2014 fig 2 the hydraulic properties of the stochastic model assigned between depths of 3 m and 20 m are provided in table 2 the two models are described below 3 4 reference homogeneous layered soil model the first model called here the reference model assumes that each soil horizon between ground surface and a depth of 1 3 m is homogeneous soil properties calibrated by varvaris et al 2018 are assigned to horizons ap e btg1 and btg2 shown in fig 2 for each soil horizon the average values of soil parameters measured on core samples collected across the field are used as input for the pedotransfer functions ptf developed by iversen et al 2011 the ptf predicted values were used for the initial parameterization of the water flow models and afterwards the parameters were further adjusted during calibration that used the observed tile drainage discharge as the objective function varvaris et al 2018 assumed that their four layer two dimensional models were suitable to represent the spatial variation in topography and soil hydraulic characteristics of tile drained fields therefore in this study it is assumed that the three dimensional homogeneous soil layers model implicitly accounts for heterogeneity since the parameterization was based on the calibrated two dimensional models by varvaris et al 2018 varvaris et al 2018 assumed that the clayey till underneath the soil layers below a depth of 1 3 m is impermeable however we chose to include the clayey till in the simulations from a depth of 1 3 m to 3 0 m and define it as a low permeability unit corresponding to the c soil horizon fig 2 we assign to that unit hydraulic properties similar to those used by he et al 2015 de schepper et al 2017 and børgesen and schaap 2005 a similar c horizon configuration was used by de schepper et al 2017 and hansen et al 2019 specific storage values from he et al 2015 are assigned to all soil horizons the hydraulic properties of the soil horizons for the reference model are presented in table 3 3 5 heterogeneous soil layers model borehole data investigation showed that the soils are stratified and spatially heterogeneous varvaris et al 2018 with clay rich soils embedded in loamy soils coarse sandy loam and sandy clay loam for the development of the heterogeneous layered soil model we assume that soil properties can be inferred from ec estimates based on electromagnetic induction hansen et al 2019 also applied this approach for the delineation of soil zones in a field in the same catchment the ec measurements indicate the presence of zones with higher ec and a probably higher clay content and lower hydraulic conductivity in the uppermost portion of the soil down to a depth of 1 2 m however no specific ec values were related to the soil texture three loamy soil layers with clay rich zones were therefore defined based on the ec vertical resolution of 20 cm table 4 a coarse sandy loam soil between 0 and 40 cm depth and two sandy clay loam soils between 40 and 80 cm and 80 and 120 cm depth the nomenclature of soil horizons defined for the homogeneous layered model ap e btg1 btg2 and c was therefore not adopted and a clayey till layer was defined between 120 and 300 cm depth the borehole description was used to support the clay rich zones delineation although few clayey samples were located out of the delineated clay rich zones fig 3 the textures noted in borehole descriptions are approximated for each 20 cm layer for example if most of the soil located in the 20 40 cm is described as loamy then the texture for this depth interval indicates loamy soil fig 3 van genuchten parameters and k values obtained on samples from the nearby area fig 1b were used for the loamy soils the hydraulic properties of the clay rich zones from a depth of 0 120 cm were assumed invariable with depth and the van genuchten parameters obtained from samples of the topsoil with high clay content were used the hydraulic conductivities of the clay rich zones were extracted from he et al 2015 those hydraulic properties were also applied for the clayey till between 120 and 300 cm depth however the vertical hydraulic conductivity kv of the clay rich zones was increased to account for the effect of the macropores and improve model performance drainage discharges and hydraulic heads were better simulated for kv values 100 times higher than the horizontal hydraulic conductivities from 0 to 120 cm depth the hydraulic properties of the soil layers for the heterogeneous soil model are presented in table 4 3 6 actual evapotranspiration aet from the surface and subsurface are simulated using climatic and land use factors to define the complete soil water budget evapotranspiration properties of winter wheat triticum aestivum l listed in table 5 were assigned to the top of the model the maximum root depth was set to 1 2 m palosuo et al 2011 and a canopy interception of 0 05 mm was defined based on li et al 2008 values for the transpiration fitting parameters c1 c2 and c3 and the evaporation depth were those recommended by kristensen and jensen 1975 for danish soils the values of evaporation and transpiration limiting pressure heads were adjusted for winter wheat varvaris et al 2018 leaf area index values were extracted from an 8 day composite data set from the nasa earth observation data earthdata 2015 3 7 boundary conditions the upper boundary of the model corresponding to ground surface is assigned daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration fluxes for the surface water flow domain a critical depth boundary was assigned at the field outlet corresponding to the lowest ground surface elevation in the model where the drainage station is located the lateral boundaries correspond to groundwater divides and are therefore impermeable de schepper et al 2017 included a downward flow component in the fensholt catchment at a depth of 20 m we tested the addition of this downward flow component but it had a negligible effect for our study site therefore the bottom boundary was assumed impermeable 3 8 simulation strategy and performance metrics the simulations target a two year period 2014 and 2015 for which measurements of drainage discharge and hydraulic head are available a prior model spin up was required which is typical for coupled surface and subsurface hydrologic models ajami et al 2014 for the spin up we ran both models for 10 years using precipitation data from 23 july 2002 to 22 july 2012 the simulated hydraulic heads at the end of this 10 year period were then used as initial hydraulic heads for the simulation period from 23 july 2012 to 1st january 2016 the two different models were based on existing conceptual models developed for the site their performance in reproducing drainage discharge was assessed by computing the mean absolute error mae the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 the reproduction of hydraulic heads was assessed with the mae and the root mean square error rmse 3 9 sensitivity analysis and correlation we calculated the composite scaled sensitivity and the parameter correlation coefficients of the vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivities specific storage and porosity of all geological formations for the measured hydraulic heads and drainage discharges the observations were grouped into head and discharge groups the same weight was applied to each group such that they have the same contribution to the objective function regardless of the number of measurements of heads and drainage discharges available no information on the measurement uncertainty was available for the application of weights to the individual measurements the period of 01 08 2015 to 01 11 2015 was chosen for the sensitivity analysis the three months period comprises low and high flow conditions and was chosen to keep simulation times manageable the value of each parameter was varied by 10 in successive simulations while keeping fixed values for the other parameters to compute the jacobian matrix with the pest software doherty 2016a doherty 2016b that allows to quantify the composite scaled sensitivity and the parameter correlation coefficients 4 results 4 1 drainage discharge and surface runoff the simulated drainage discharge evapotranspiration and surface runoff for 2014 and 2015 are shown for the reference model and the heterogeneous soil model in fig 5 a and b respectively the figures also show the observed drainage discharge and the precipitation times series used as input for the reference model the nse for drainage discharge is equal to 0 75 for the 2014 2015 period which indicates an overall good performance the model is able to represent low flow rates lower than 1 mm d observed in summer however no drainage discharge is simulated during the summer of 2014 although a few summer peaks were observed for the summer of 2015 the simulated discharge during flow peaks is slightly higher than the observed one some discharge peaks are underestimated in 2014 and in january and april 2015 resulting in an underestimated cumulative drainage discharge from january 2014 to mid september 2015 fig 6 the global water balance for the reference model and the observed drain discharge for the years 2014 and 2015 are presented in fig 7 a and b respectively the surface runoff shown in the figures corresponds to surface water outflow at the critical depth boundary the actual evapotranspiration includes canopy surface and porous medium evaporation as well as transpiration the simulated drainage corresponds to 42 of the total rainfall for 2014 a percentage comparable to the observed drainage which is equal to 44 of total rainfall for the same year for 2015 the simulated discharge corresponds to 53 of the rainfall against 49 for the observed discharge evapotranspiration is the most important outflow during the summer period and it is similar in magnitude to the change in water stored during the winter period simulated surface runoff is not significant the variation in water stored in the surface and the porous medium is less than 1 of the total precipitation for the yearly basis analyses although more complexity is included in the heterogeneous soil layer model potentially providing a more realistic representation the performance of the model in reproducing drainage discharge shown in fig 5b mae 0 47 mm d nse 0 74 and kge 0 76 is slightly worse compared to the reference model mae 0 44 mm d nse 0 75 and kge 0 83 including spatially variable hydraulic properties of the more loamy and clayey soils therefore does not improve the model compared to the reference model that uses average values compared to the reference model surface runoff increases and the drain discharge volume decreases for the heterogeneous model consequently drainage discharge peaks are in general underestimated and the cumulative discharge volumes are lower than for the reference model fig 6 the water mass balance for the heterogeneous model is presented in fig 8 in 2014 the aet is the most important outflow followed by drainage in 2015 the drainage discharge is higher than aet the annual simulated drainage discharge is 352 mm in 2014 and 536 mm in 2015 these volumes correspond to 39 and 47 of total rainfall for 2014 and 2015 respectively drainage discharge underestimates the annual observed values of 404 mm and 553 mm for 2014 and 2015 respectively simulated surface runoff corresponds to 10 and 12 of the total rainfall for 2014 and 2015 larger than simulated by the reference model at the study site observations indicate that surface runoff mostly occurs in winter when aet is very low relative to precipitation see winter periods in fig 8 however the summer of 2015 presents higher simulated surface runoff 8 of rainfall than expected for the period the water exchange from the surface to the subsurface media at each time step represents infiltration which can originate from precipitation ponding of water on the soil surface and surface runoff the cumulative simulated infiltration for 2014 and 2015 is 2116 mm which is only 150 mm higher than the total infiltration of the reference model for the same period however the exfiltration from the porous medium to the surface 598 mm is 336 mm higher than the exfiltration of the homogeneous soils model 262 mm contributing to the higher surface runoff volumes in the heterogeneous soils model for 2014 and 2015 the total simulated drainage discharge corresponds to 50 of the infiltration against 49 of observed discharge storage variations in the porous medium surface domains have little effect on annual water balances the surface runoff peaks simulated at the outlet coincide with the peaks of rainfall during winter when the soil is saturated at the end of the 2015 summer when the rainfall intensity is high runoff for both models is greater than at the end of the 2014 summer when rainfall intensity is lower 4 2 hydraulic head observed hydraulic heads in piezometer 17 which corresponds to the local water table elevation and its seasonal variation are generally well reproduced by the reference model fig 9 except for the periods from november to december 2014 and september to november 2015 when the head is overestimated the seasonal variation is also well simulated in piezometers 18 and 19 but the hydraulic head is underestimated by around 50 cm the model adequately simulates the slow decrease of water levels in the spring and summer and the fast increase in the fall error statistics for the 3 piezometers are shown in table 6 with average mae and rmse values of 0 55 m and 0 61 m a snapshot of the spatial distribution of the water table depth for the reference model is shown in fig 10 a for both winter and summer in winter 15 01 2015 the simulated water table level is near the tile drain elevation and it rises to the soil surface in several areas located further from the drains in summer 15 07 2015 the hydraulic heads are lower than the tile drain elevation almost everywhere the heterogeneous soil model also reproduces observed hydraulic heads fairly well fig 9 especially for piezometers p18 and p19 which are located in clay rich zones the reproduction of hydraulic heads observed at piezometers p18 and p19 is better than for the reference model with mae varying from 0 68 m to 0 28 m p18 and from 0 68 m to 0 17 m p19 and rmse varying from 0 71 m to 0 40 m p18 and from 0 70 m to 0 20 m p19 the mae for hydraulic heads observed at p17 for the heterogeneous model 0 38 m is higher compared to that of the reference model 0 30 m simulated heads in piezometer p17 are generally lower than observed heads and heads simulated with the reference model the spatial distribution of the water table depth in winter 15 01 2015 shown in fig 10b is drastically different from that simulated with the homogeneous soil layers model simulated hydraulic heads are higher and the depth to water table is lower in the clay rich zones around the tile drains mainly in the central part of the study site in summer 15 07 2015 the simulated water table depth is almost similar for the reference and homogeneous models 4 3 sensitivity analysis and correlation for the reference homogeneous soil layers model one or more observations were highly sensitive to the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the btg1 and btg2 horizons and the porosities of the ap e and btg1 horizons the most correlated parameters are the specific storage of the btg2 horizon with the porosities of both the btg2 horizon and the glacial clay and the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the btg1 and btg2 soil horizons however other parameters are also highly correlated as indicated in fig 4a for the heterogeneous soil layers model one or more observations were highly sensitive to the horizontal hydraulic conductivities of the clayey till the sandy soil from 40 to 80 cm and the clayey loam from 80 to 120 cm the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the glacial clay and the porosities of both sandy and clayey loam from 0 to 40 cm depth in general the sensitivity of simulated hydraulic heads with respect to the model parameters was greater for piezometers p18 and p19 than for p17 and they were also greater than for the reference model the most correlated parameters are the specific storage of the clayey soil from 0 to 40 cm with the horizontal k for the clayey soil from 40 to 80 cm and the porosity of the sandy soil 80 120 cm with the vertical k of the glacial sand the parameter correlation coefficients are overall lower than for the homogeneous model fig 4b 5 discussion 5 1 zonation based on spatially distributed ec estimates when creating a hydrological model assumptions about the structure of the subsurface will inevitably be wrong impairing the representation of critical hydrological processes voss 2011 we assumed that including heterogeneity in the model would provide more realistic hydrological simulations in tile drained fields this assumption was based on the fact that tile drainage discharge represents an important water flow path and is controlled by both large and small scale heterogeneity the definition of heterogeneous soil zones based on spatially distributed ec estimates is promising due to the non invasive measurements obtained at different depths however the zonation based on ec estimates remains a coarse estimation of reality for a few boreholes the delineated areas based on the ec estimates shown in fig 3 are not consistent with the visual description available from the borehole logs the zonation of soil heterogeneity was suitable for the implementation in the 3d hydrological model and avoided the need to interpolate from sparse borehole data which could result in an erroneous distribution of soil properties the depth specific ec estimates were used as a criterion to define zones with effective parameters these zones were easily delineated using the triangular mesh structure for the implementation of different soil properties in the heterogeneous soil layers model the most significant difference between piezometers p17 p18 and p19 is that piezometers p18 and p19 are located in strongly anisotropic clay rich soils that have a 100 1 ratio between the vertical and horizontal hydraulic while soils in the vicinity of piezometer p17 are isotropic the anisotropy for p18 and p19 favors flow in the vertical direction as opposed to the horizontal direction the strong anisotropy around p18 and p19 and the lack of anisotropy around p17 may explain the contrasted response observed for the sensitivity analysis with simulated hydraulic heads at p18 and p19 more sensitive to the model parameters than heads at piezometer p17 for the same model and also compared to the reference model for all piezometers the parameter correlation coefficients are lower in the heterogeneous soils model fig 4a and b suggesting that the enhanced representation of soil heterogeneity could potentially improve the capacity of the model to assimilate the observations when compared to the reference model furthermore the combination of relatively high composite scaled sensitivity and low parameter correlation coefficients indicates a good capability of the calibration process to constrain the model parameters hill et al 2016 the delineated zones were based only on sparse borehole data and ec estimates however the topography also plays an important role in recharge and surface runoff a depression zone located around piezometer p18 may affect the soil properties as indicated from the soil texture from the boreholes analysis at the depth of 0 40 cm fig 3 future work can focus on delineating soil zones also based on topography 5 2 subsurface drainage simulation the reference homogeneous and heterogeneous soil layers models reproduce the observed tile drainage discharge reasonably well with lower tile drain flow in summer and higher in winter the low summer drainage discharge mainly results from higher evapotranspiration during the crop growing season the transition from low flow or almost no flow to the initiation of drainage in autumn is reproduced by both models both models also capture the dynamics of the drainage discharge peaks and reproduce the low no flow behavior during the summer periods in 2014 and 2015 the cumulative drainage from 2014 to 2015 is underestimated with the heterogeneous soil layers model during the entire period and it is underestimated from january 2014 to october 2015 with the reference homogeneous model using a 2d hydrological model at the same site varvaris et al 2019 overestimated the cumulative drainage discharge for the period 01 06 2013 01 06 2014 this overestimation was likely caused by the inclusion in their model of a systematic coverage of the field by tile drains whereas tile drains are only at specific locations in the field our models represent the tile drain network more realistically with lateral spreading between tile drains sufficiently large to allow some of the percolated water to bypass the tile drain system and flow deeper the underestimation observed in our models could be caused by the lack of lateral subsurface inflow the cumulative drainage for 2014 and 2015 indicated that increasing the model complexity with horizontally heterogeneous soils does not improve the overall behavior of the drainage discharge simulations in terms of volume and temporal dynamics however including heterogeneity results in a markedly different spatial resolution in hydraulic heads and thus water table elevations especially in winter left panel in fig 10 for the homogeneous model the water table is generally low in the vicinity of the drains but close to or at ground surface further away for the heterogeneous model areas with a near surface water table are in the clay rich zones and the total extent of areas with high water table elevations is smaller although the spatial hydraulic head distribution cannot be validated from field observations the simulated distribution for the homogeneous case may be questioned because a water table close to ground surface over such large areas is unlikely in an agricultural tile drained field despite the similarity of the simulated drainage discharges for both models their marked differences in the simulated spatial variation of the water table can in turn affect a subsequent simulation of nutrient reduction and transport processes dependent on moisture content such denitrification one implication of these results is that head observations complement the drainage discharge data for the evaluation of the model s performance eastman et al 2010 observed that the soil texture in drained fields influences the generation of outflow drainage discharge and surface runoff from precipitation it can be assumed from our study that the soil texture heterogeneity within a drained field also influences outflow generation 5 3 hydraulic heads and surface subsurface water exchange the groundwater dynamics observed in the piezometers is reproduced both with the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil layers model the water table fluctuations are more sensitive to soil properties than the simulated drainage discharge especially for the heterogeneous soil layers model one possible reason is that hydraulic heads represent local measurements representative of conditions in the vicinity of a piezometer while drainage discharge provides a cumulative value for the study field at our field site the piezometer screens were installed from ground surface to a depth of 2 m and the topsoil properties thus have a potentially great influence on the observed heads using the homogeneous soil layers model it was not possible to reproduce observed heads in all three piezometers simultaneously which suggests that soil heterogeneity should be accounted for to accurately simulate observed heads by introducing the clay rich zones in the soil layers the heterogeneous model resulted in an overall improvement in the fit for the three piezometers table 6 heads in piezometer p17 located in the sandy loam soil are underestimated which can be explained by the fact that the hydraulic properties for the loamy soils were estimated by water retention curves and applied directly without calibration moreover the effect of hysteresis was not considered in this study since the soil water retention curves were only measured under drying conditions not including hysteresis may explain some of the differences between the simulated and observed hydraulic heads across the field since several studies have identified the important role of hysteresis in water flow and solute transport modeling kaluarachchi and parker 1987 arrey et al 2018 likos et al 2014 the model results corroborate the assumptions of hansen et al 2013 that a better representation of local heterogeneity and the spatial variation of hydraulic conductivities can improve the spatial dynamics in hydraulic heads therefore the hypothesis that including clay rich zones in tile drained field improves the model performance may be true for the hydraulic heads but we cannot conclude that it was also the case for the drainage discharges according to woolhiser et al 1996 poor surface runoff simulation is expected if 1 a model structure cannot accommodate the spatial variability of saturated hydraulic conductivity or precipitation 2 a model cannot simulate the interaction between infiltration and surface runoff after a rainfall event or 3 there is an inadequate knowledge of the soil properties adding spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity in the model increased the simulated surface runoff volumes from 2 to 10 in 2014 and from 2 to 12 in 2015 related to the total precipitation as a comparison sloan et al 2016 simulated the water balance components for drained soils at the edge of the study site using the drainmod model and found that surface runoff represented 12 of total precipitation for clay 7 for silt and 0 4 for sand the higher volume of exfiltration water from the porous medium saturated excess runoff simulated for the heterogeneous models can be explained by the difference of hydraulic conductivity values between the loamy soils coarse sandy loam and sandy clay loam and clay rich zones in the more permeable loamy soil subsurface flow is more likely to occur than in the clayey soil where surface runoff would be generated sloan et al 2016 although surface runoff was not monitored in the study area and simulated runoff could not be compared to observed runoff including clay rich zones identified using ec estimates in the hydrological model resulted in more realistic runoff patterns compared to the study of sloan et al 2016 our simulations demonstrate that soil properties are a controlling factor for runoff generation as confirmed by hümann et al 2011 who conducted experiments to identify the dominant runoff generation process in agricultural and forested sites larger values for overland flow were also obtained in the hydrological models of merz and bárdossy 1998 which were conceptualized with structured or organized or deterministic soil variability as opposed to homogeneous and stochastic variability merz and plate 1997 developed physically based hydrological models including spatial variability of soil properties and compared a spatially homogeneous a randomly heterogeneous and a structured heterogeneous model they investigated a subcatchment that was composed of clay particles with a downslope position similar to our study site they showed that the structured heterogeneous spatial variability strongly influenced runoff furthermore the effects of the spatial variability were small for very small and for large runoff events although they only investigated summer events in our model larger surface runoff was generated during the large rainfall events in winter due to increased soil saturation in the study of merz and plate 1997 the soil was relatively dry prior to the large rainfall event representing the effect of infiltration excess runoff the flooded areas in depression zones observed around piezometer 18 dominated by clay rich zones are better represented by the heterogeneous soil layers model fig 10 that result suggests that the simulation of groundwater surface water exchange is spatially improved when horizontal soil heterogeneity was included using ec estimates 5 4 model resolution and computational time the same mesh was used in both models with maximum cell length of 10 m in the vicinity of the tile drains a similar cell discretization configuration was adopted in the 3d hydrological model developed by nousiainen et al 2015 they used a grid cell diameter of 6 25 m in the control model and 12 5 m in the model realizations for an agricultural field with an area of 12 ha which is similar to the area of our study site 14 ha the vertical discretization was refined to match the ec data resolution 20 cm we also generated a triangular mesh with higher resolution by reducing the maximum element size from 10 m to 5 m in the vicinity of the tile drains where the element areas ranged from 0 1 to 10 m2 the number of nodes and triangular elements in the refined 2d surface mesh were 3789 and 7446 respectively however refining the triangular mesh near the tile drains did not have a significant effect on the simulation of the drainage discharge and heads and the coarser configuration was maintained the horizontal mesh resolution was slightly coarser far from the tile drains with element size up to 30 m a finer mesh with a maximum element length of 1 m could better represent the horizontal heterogeneity far from the tile drains at the expense of increased simulation times however simulated heads at the boundaries p17 and p19 further away from the tile drains are less influenced by preferential flow in the tile drains consequently we assume that increasing the mesh resolution near the boundary and further away from the drains would not improve drain flow simulations and therefore not justify the additional computational burden of a denser mesh the maximum 1 h time step was used to ensure numerical stability especially for the heterogeneous soil model daily stress periods were necessary to accommodate daily drainage discharges including greater soil heterogeneity considerably increased the simulation time from 15 to 91 h the difference in soil properties changed the water flow paths creating larger hydraulic gradients which requires smaller time steps to solve the porous medium water flow and the surface subsurface water exchange the location of all drains was included explicitly in the model by resolving the drain location in the mesh if this approach were to be used for large scale models the number of computational nodes would increase very significantly leading to very large computational times that may render the simulation impractical 5 5 limitations of the conceptual model only one stochastic realization of the geological model developed by he et al 2014 was used to assign hydraulic properties for model layers between the depths of 3 to 20 m the small area of the studied field and the lack of deep piezometers do not allow a comprehensive analysis of groundwater flow below a depth of 2 m therefore alternative representations of the deeper geological units were not investigated considering the overall good simulations of the outflow the use of a different geological model for the deeper units would likely not improve the drainage discharge simulations including the soil horizontal heterogeneity in hydrological models with tile drains is relevant for the identification of flooded areas furthermore the parameter correlation coefficients indicate that the soil parameters are less correlated reducing the likelihood of non unique parameter sets however the heterogeneous soil layers model required a larger number of parameters than the reference model as each soil layer had two different soil zones soil heterogeneity data such as in situ measurements of soil water content is rarely available at other sites and at larger scales therefore further calibration is necessary to overcome the lack of representation of soil hydraulic properties 5 6 limitations of the modeling approach in structured soils macropores can be an important pathway for water flow and solute transport as observed in some danish glacial tills klint and gravesen 1999 nilsson et al 2001 christiansen et al 2004 in a modeling study haws et al 2005 found that assuming homogeneity for a field with preferential pathways contributed to the deficiencies of their tile drain water and solute discharge simulations vogel et al 2000 showed that including spatial variability in the hydraulic properties using the dual permeability approach improved the simulation of water and solute movement in naturally heterogeneous field soils in the clayey areas at our study site the soil may exhibit strong structures and possibly a high content of macropores iversen et al 2004 in the homogeneous model the effect of macropores is implicitly accounted for in the parameter estimation as described by varvaris et al 2018 while it was only considered in the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the clay rich zones in the heterogeneous model the drainage network at the site is represented explicitly by resolving the network in the computational mesh and defining seepage nodes for the exchange of water the amount of water drained is assumed to be controlled by the hydraulic gradient that develops between the subsurface and the drain which depends on the drain elevation and the hydraulic conductivity of the porous media while the drain pipes themselves are assumed not to pose a resistance to water flow in reality the tile drain walls and possible clogging of drains will increase resistance to flow which can only be estimated through model calibration improved model performance is therefore likely to be obtained through model calibration however both models provided results that are in good agreement with observed head and drainage discharge in terms of absolute values and temporal dynamics it was thus assumed that the performances of the models were adequate for assessing the impact on local scale heterogeneity for the study site it was possible to represent the drainage network explicitly in the computational mesh for large scale modeling this will not be computationally efficient furthermore the location of drains is commonly unavailable and the tile drainage system outlets are rarely documented this lack of data makes the explicit representation of drains in large scale model very uncertain and ways to represent the effect of drainage from agricultural fields need to be developed 5 7 equifinality in tile drainage discharge modeling uncertainty associated with the structure of a model the correlation between parameters the accuracy of the numerical solution the scarcity of data and the scale of representation leads to inherently non unique model solutions whereby different model configurations might adequately reproduce historical observations and honour expert knowledge refsgaard et al 2012 zhou et al 2014 hill et al 2016 delottier et al 2017 aster et al 2018 this concept referred to as equifinality beven 2006 beven and freer 2001 was systematically studied by klaus and zehe 2010 for the simulation of physically based preferential flow in a tile drained field among the large number of model configurations tested they showed that a smaller group of models performed equally well during calibration leading to equifinality which in turn affects the predictive uncertainty for their preferential flow simulations we investigated how the inclusion of heterogeneity consisting of clay rich zones can influence simulation results for the tile drained field provided that the model inputs observations and tile drain network are identical representation of heterogeneity was based on ec estimates but there is uncertainty associated with the delineation the clay rich zones and their hydraulic properties even if the inclusion of clay rich zones using ec estimates in the model closely represented the soil structure and their properties were accurately defined the model would still be subject to equifinality due to errors in prior model assumptions boundary conditions and field measurements in our study using average soil properties for the homogeneous soil layers resulted in simulated drainage discharges that reproduce observations as well as the heterogeneous soil layer model these results reveals equifinality for our simulations as shown also by klaus and zehe 2010 incorporating soil heterogeneity to simulate drainage discharges at our field site is probably not warranted because the homogeneous model performs equally well and it reduces computational times and facilitates model refutability and transparency hill 2006 furthermore data at most sites will likely be more scarce than for our well monitored field site such that increasing the inverse problem dimensionality by introducing more parameters could favour equifinality and increase uncertainty for simulated drainage discharges 6 conclusion this study demonstrates that spatially distributed depth specific electrical conductivity ec estimates can be used with borehole data for mapping soil heterogeneities in clayey till soils improving hydrological simulations in a tile drained field the effect of heterogeneous soil properties on drainage discharge and the water table fluctuation were investigated using 3d integrated hydrological models conceptualized with homogeneous and heterogeneous topsoil layers respectively heterogeneous soil zones were identified using depth specific ec estimates derived from the apparent electrical conductivity data measured using an electromagnetic induction instrument hydraulic parameters for the loamy soils were estimated from soil water retention measurements in the laboratory the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the clay rich soils in the heterogeneous soil model was manually calibrated all other parameters for both models were obtained from previous hydrological assessments at the site and the models were therefore not calibrated simulations with the heterogeneous soil layers model showed that including clay rich zones in predominately loamy soils coarse sandy loam and sandy clay loam affected the spatial distribution on shallow groundwater heads and drainage discharge together with a change in surface runoff actual evapotranspiration and storage including the topsoil heterogeneity generally improved the match to observed shallow groundwater levels particularly where clay rich zones had been identified although the drainage discharge simulated by the two models was comparable the homogeneous soil layers model resulted in better agreement between simulated and observed drainage discharge this improvement is probably due to the implicit representation of preferential water flow through macropores in defining hydraulic properties while only the vertical hydraulic conductivities were adjusted in the heterogeneous case the good reproduction of drain flow by the homogeneous soil layers model implies that including average soil hydraulic properties in 3d hydrological models can be adequate to simulate tile drainage discharges even for complex heterogeneous subsurface properties however the homogeneous model fails to realistically describe the spatial distribution of hydraulic heads within the field which is important to simulate nutrient reduction and transport processes dependent on water table elevation and moisture content credit authorship contribution statement vinicius f boico conceptualization methodology investigation writing

surface water storage sum of soil moisture snow water equivalent canopy water and surface water bodies was subtracted from reconstructed grace based terrestrial water storage tws changes through ghf filtering to estimate the required hydrological parameters both the global land data assimilation system gldas and water global hydrology model wghm were used and evaluated water level changes for major surface water bodies were estimated using satellite altimetry based products the monthly average of gws variations over the prairies ranged between 200 mm and 230 mm a positive trend was found for both tws and gws variations with the highest values in the region surrounding hudson bay particularly in northern manitoba about 55 mm year estimated gws anomalies error was equivalent to about 10

gaussian han fan ghf filter canadian prairies grace satellite 1 introduction groundwater is a critical natural resource for domestic industrial and agricultural use throughout the world megdal 2018 unfortunately excess withdrawal climate change and other human impacts can affect its dynamics and availability as has been highlighted by several studies chen et al 2014 al zyoud et al 2015 xiao et al 2015 bhanja et al 2016 hu et al 2017 tangdamrongsub et al 2018 agutu et al 2019 lin et al 2020 lv et al 2020 these extensive demands can result in lowered water tables and even depletion of the aquifer leading to increased water scarcity hu et al 2019 thomas and famiglietti 2019 vasco et al 2019 wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 geological formations storing groundwater can be compromised with withdrawal of large quantities of the latter rock strata collapse upon themselves because interstitial water provides structural support land subsidence results from continued excessive pumping e g san joaquin and san jacinto valleys of california much of which is widespread globally and may be permanent herrera garcía et al 2021 given the aforementioned conditions and geological settings indeed compaction of the parent material results not only in reduced aquifer capacity but also reduces its ability to recharge consequently groundwater systems are endangered in some of the most densely populated areas across the globe rodell et al 2009 voss et al 2013 long et al 2016 zhong et al 2018 bhanja and mukherjee 2019 bierkens and wada 2019 sayre and taraz 2019 liu et al 2019 herrera garcía et al 2021 in the context of rapid population growth increased demand for food intensive agriculture climate change shortages of surface water resources and strong pressures that are placed on aquifers the sustainable management of groundwater resources has become a major global concern singh et al 2019 long et al 2020 wu et al 2020 these resources must be properly monitored and managed to balance the needs of domestic industrial and irrigational water for sustainable development konikow and kendy 2005 wu et al 2019 despite the abundance of lakes and rivers in many parts of canada the possible depletion of groundwater remains a concern in western canada particularly in the canadian prairies this vast region 1 982 million km2 fig 1 a is composed of three provinces manitoba saskatchewan and alberta where one third of the population depends upon groundwater supplies larocque and broda 2016 the area is particularly well known for intensive agricultural activities which demand substantial quantities of both surface and groundwater for irrigation kromm 1993 other industrial activities such as mining also consume considerable quantities of water warming climate human activities and shortages of water in surface water bodies are the dominant reasons for groundwater depletion in the area gan 2000 melt from glaciers mitigates water shortages during dry years yet the dynamics are changing given that mountain snowpack and glaciers are melting earlier and faster and snow accumulation is less conspicuous thereby affecting the water volume in river basins castellazzi et al 2019 decreasing surface water availability combined with these important needs places a great deal of pressure on groundwater sources all of the above reasons call for a better understanding of the current dynamics and natural variability in groundwater levels so that water resources management can be improved including the protection of aquifers cca 2009 in situ monitoring of wells is the traditional approach for estimating groundwater storage however this form of monitoring often is neither spatially continuous nor temporally regular and of sufficient duration and requires detailed budgets to cover large regions including extensive hydrogeological baseline and other ancillary data as a result groundwater observation networks frequently lack adequate spatial resolution and temporal coverage frequency consequently estimates may be unreliable in many regions of the world see rau et al 2020 unreliability of water resources subsequently hampers prompt decision making and appropriate management actions the launch of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace twin satellite system in 2002 opened up the possibility for studying water mass redistributions by measuring temporal variations in the gravity field of the earth tapley et al 2004 grace does not have the ability to detect any signal of the water cycle separately but it is capable of monitoring monthly changes in total water storage tws from the land surface to the bottom of the deepest aquifer sun et al 2020 here tws corresponds to the sum of canopy water surface water snow soil moisture and groundwater even though grace provided only coarse resolution tws changes during its lifetime it has made significant contributions to groundwater studies chen et al 2016 feng et al 2018 frappart

1999 and 2005 over the prairies several studies examined the potential for grace tws to characterize the phenomenon for instance yirdaw et al 2008 used a cumulative total storage deficit index for the saskatchewan river basin a large drainage basin in the prairies 405 864 km2 to produce a map of long term dryness and wetness they determined that the drought episode ended in may 2004 hanesiak et al 2011 also studied this drought using various climatological parameters to determine more clearly which metric had contributed substantially to its impacts on the physical environment they confirmed the results that were found by yirdaw et al 2008 hanesiak et al 2011 further observed intense drought between 2001 and 2002 which they explained in terms of diminished precipitation and snowfall wang et al 2014 examined variations in surface water budgets across sixteen large canadian drainage basins between 2002 and 2008 based upon improved observation networks and reanalysis models the monthly water budget imbalance was positive and negative for the southern and northern basins respectively wang et al 2015 reported an increase in tws on the canadian prairies at a rate of about 74 gigatonnes year following episodic severe droughts between 1999 and 2005 wang and li 2016 classified canada into several drainage basins in which they studied tws climatology from 2002 to 2014 they concluded that tws minima and maxima in most basins occurred respectively in september and april the smallest seasonal variations were found within the southern prairies 100 mm using principal component analysis pca li et al 2016 found a positive trend in tws in eastern canada the prairies and the northwest mackenzie river basin maximum 0 2 mm month and a negative trend in the regions of the arctic cordillera and the yukon minimum of 0 2 mm month in recent work fatolazadeh and goïta 2021 showed a positive trend of tws changes in the region surrounding hudson bay particularly in the northern part of the prairies recent outcomes using grace mark a major step forward in assessing groundwater storage gws variation in alberta huang et al 2016 showed an increased trend for groundwater accumulation over the province during the period 2002 2014 using monthly grace gravity models and gldas their results were validated using in situ data from 36 wells bhanja et al 2018 likewise estimated trends in groundwater storage variation in 11 major river basins across alberta using the hodrick prescott filter a non linear trend tool they found depletion in about half of the basins and showed that precipitation rainfall and melting snow influenced groundwater variation continual demand for water in irrigation based agriculture exerts tremendous pressure upon water resources particularly on groundwater prairie provinces water board 2019 https www ppwb ca groundwater activities understanding the dynamics of water in the prairies is thus a major national issue given the significant contribution of the region to canada s agricultural production this study focused upon a comprehensive approach of deriving groundwater storage changes and associated uncertainties using the grace satellites altimetric data and a hydrological model system with a new improved gaussian han fan ghf filter the approach that is proposed was evaluated over the canadian prairies using grace observations which were acquired between april 2002 and june 2017 the research was articulated in terms of three specific objectives i proposing a new filter with its optimal radius and evaluating its benefits compared to previous published filters ii proposing a comprehensive procedure for reconstructing refining and mapping gws variations using grace signals hydrological system model and altimetric data iii determining optimal gws variation uncertainties based upon best quadratic unbiased estimators bque without using external information to illustrate the performance of the approach that has been proposed estimated gws variations were validated using 116 in situ wells which were distributed over five different river basins in alberta namely peace athabasca churchill north saskatchewan south saskatchewan and missouri 2 study site and materials 2 1 study area the study area is the canadian prairies 95 w to 120 w 50 n to 60 n about 1 762 million km2 of the land surface are dry uplands while water bodies cover about 0 201 million km2 10 of total area prairie provinces water board 2019 https www ppwb ca prairie vegetation cover consisting of grasslands farmlands and shrub lands predominates in the south moving northward the vegetation changes from open plains to mixed boreal forest the topography can be divided into three principal zones at the western edge of the region the rocky mountains and foothills dominate the topography southern areas have almost flat topography which is largely dominated by farmlands and pastures the canadian shield lies in the northeast and includes shallow soils and rock outcrops variations in both temperature and precipitation are important aspects of the prairie climate dumanski et al 2015 annual precipitation varies from just over 300 mm in southeastern alberta and southwestern saskatchewan to over 900 mm in the rocky mountains sauchyn and kulshreshtha 2008 rapid spring snowmelt produces runoff which is the main source of water supplying the basins throughout the region due to the climate and hydrology the prairies experience both drought and flooding depending upon the year mcginn 2010 2 2 grace observations the space borne gravimetric data from grace that were used consist of the monthly geophysical coefficients of release 6 which were processed by the center for space research csr06 these data are produced on the maximum degree and order 60 and are publicly available they cover the period between april 2002 and june 2017 with some missing data 20 months out of 183 months linear interpolation was performed to complete the data series for the 15 years as was the case in other studies the grace coefficient with degree 2 and order 0 which has larger errors was replaced with the coefficient that was obtained from satellite laser ranging cheng et al 2011 since grace data do not contain a degree 1 gravity term these coefficients were estimated from coefficients that are based upon ocean and atmospheric models and which were developed and expanded by sun et al 2016 in addition we used the glacial isostatic adjustment gia model of ice 6g c vm5a and modified the model s coefficients to correct for gia effects peltier et al 2015 2 3 hydrological data the most effective hydrological outputs that were used in this study included soil moisture content from the surface to a depth of 2 m sm snow water equivalent swe and canopy water content cw the data were derived respectively from the global land data assimilation system gldas and the watergap global hydrological model wghm which we refer to as hydrological models in this paper both hydrological models operate at a global scale and integrate various meteorological data global water use models and land cover data to compute water storage and fluxes for land areas across the earth outputs from the new gldas noah land surface model l4 v2 1 monthly temporal resolution from april 2002 to june 2017 0 5 spatial resolution and the new wghm v2 2c monthly temporal resolution from april 2002 to december 2014 0 5 spatial resolution were employed rodell et al 2004 beaudoing and rodell 2016 bailing et al 2018 döll et al 2012 müller schmied et al 2014 müller schmied 2017 the aforementioned domain periods were chosen based upon their availability and consistency with the grace time frame to maintain consistency with gldas and grace the spatial resolution of both simulation data was increased from 0 5 to 1 moreover the shapiro wilk test shapiro and wilk 1965 verified whether the hydrological data were normally distributed unlike gldas wghm produces water storage estimates from groundwater lakes and rivers but they were not used in this study because of major uncertainties which may cause the phase difference between well station measurements and model estimates long et al 2017 2 4 altimetric data as mentioned in section 2 1 water bodies occupy about 10 of the prairie region the most important lakes and rivers were considered here prairie provinces water board https www ppwb ca these surface water bodies swb listed in table 1 13 lakes 1 river often play important role in the occurrence of floods in the prairies satellite based altimetric products were used over the selected swbs to estimate surface water storage the time series of water level changes which were considered as sea level anomalies sla in this study together with their associated uncertainties were extracted from dahiti database for hydrological time series of inland waters https dahiti dgfi tum de en products water level altimetry these products were more fully developed by applying various geophysical corrections and by combining different multi mission altimeter results from envisat ers 2 jason 1 jason 2 jason 3 topex poseidon and saral altika following an approach that was proposed by schwatke et al 2015 the monthly average of the 13 lakes and 1 river was computed to be consistent with grace observations april 2002 to june 2017 2 5 validation datasets the study used in situ well data from five river basins that were located within the province of alberta to validate the results well information is indeed well documented in these basins through the groundwater observation well network gown the data were derived from 116 active unconfined wells which had more complete records as the deep confined aquifers might not play a major role in determining groundwater storage changes over the region we only used unconfined aquifers moreover lower groundwater changes have been reported for confined aquifers in some previous studies bhanja et al 2018 their approximate locations across the basins are depicted in fig 1b although most were located in the south to be consistent with grace data availability we considered measurements spanning the period from april 2002 to june 2017 3 method 3 1 introducing new gaussian han fan ghf filtering approach as the first specific objective of the research a new ghf smoothing filter is proposed the correlation between harmonic coefficients in monthly gravity field models of grace and noise at higher degrees n and orders m that are due to the attenuation factor may lead to inaccurate results wahr 2006 this noise tends to weaken recovery of short wavelengths in the gravity field of the earth inclination angle of the satellite orbit causes biases data accumulation which tends to appear in the north south along track direction thus retrieval of zonal spherical harmonics m 0 is easier dependent upon latitude compared to sectorial spherical harmonics n m dependent upon longitude swenson and wahr 2006 showed that correlations between the coefficients emerge at degree and order from 8 and continue in higher degrees and orders therefore a low pass filter is needed to decrease the contribution of higher spherical harmonic degrees with low wavelengths to retrieve zonal coefficients one very simple approach truncates degrees beyond a specific degree point rather than truncating coefficients an isotropic filter referred to as a gaussian filter was introduced by jekeli 1981 to smooth the earth s gravity field by decreasing the effects of higher harmonic coefficients a modified version of this filter was applied by chambers 2006 to generate more uniform behaviour in the coefficients at higher degrees yet this type of isotropic filter is dependent only upon the degree of the harmonic coefficients due to the accumulation of data in the north south direction the effects of tesseral n m 0 and sectorial coefficients in grace gravity field models are emphasized thus a filter is required to increase contributions of zonal coefficients and to decrease the effects of sectorial coefficients in addition to the spherical harmonic degree several non isotropic filters have been investigated that are also dependent upon spherical harmonic order han et al 2005 introduced a non isotropic smoother referred to as a han filter to enhance geophysical signal retrieval from grace observations the han filter works between two radii and is written as 1 w nm exp n ρ a e 2 4 l n 2 ρ ρ 1 ρ 0 m 1 m ρ 0 where ρ 0 and ρ 1 are two lower and upper bands of radii n and m are respectively degree and order m 1 is defined as maximum order for each degree order is defined from zero to its maximum and a e is the mean radius of the earth the basis of the han filter is similar to that of the gaussian filter both filters depend on the degree only however han filter uses a range of radiuses working between two radii may be advantageous in obtaining better results for mass redistribution changes from grace observations however the main weakness of the filter is that it is not dependent on the order m when radius takes maximum order therefore retrieval of some sectorial coefficients n m is impossible zhang et al 2009 for the first time introduced the fan filter which is defined by the function projection on a fan shaped plane this is a 2 d double non isotropic filter which is dependent upon both degree and order the fan filter is expressed as 2 w nm e x p n m ρ 0 a e 2 4 l n 2 this filter can be seen as an advanced version of the isotropic gaussian filter which simultaneously uses low pass along both degree n and order m the advantage of the fan filter is that it does not require external or a priori information moreover it takes only one radius lower for this purpose which is similar to gaussian filter in both han and fan filters when the spherical harmonic order is zero zonal harmonics the filter reverts to an isotropic gaussian filter therefore an improvement in performance that can be accrued by producing a new filter may be obtained when combining these two filters in this study we introduced a new filter by combining the han and fan filters given the simultaneous influence of gaussian han and fan filters we refer to this tool as the gaussian han fan ghf filter the new ghf filter can be written as 3 w nm exp n m ρ a e 2 4 l n 2 ρ ρ 1 ρ 0 m 1 m ρ 0 the ghf filter can incorporate the advantages of both han and fan filters its main advantage is that it is dependent upon both degree and order when the radius changes dynamically according to harmonic order in other words the filter reverts to an isotropic gaussian filter when zonal harmonics m 0 are used and the effects of fan and han filters are applied on the coefficients when sectorial and tesseral harmonics n m and n m 0 are used in this research a legitimate concern raises the following two main questions first what are the actual benefits of the ghf over the component gaussian han and fan filters separately second which range of radius should be selected for the ghf to produce optimal results to answer these questions the following steps were employed i showing that errors in monthly gravity field models of grace are dependent on both degree and order ii comparing power spectra of ghf and previous filters gaussian han and fan to confirm merits of the proposed filter iii comparing geoid height change error in ghf and previous filters to confirm its merits iv comparing geoid height change in each filter ghf and previous filters to more advanced ddk filter coefficients kusche 2007 to confirm the performance of the new filter v displaying the power spectrum of the ghf over different ranges of radii to find the optimal damped radius range vi comparing geoid height change in the ghf filter with different ranges of radii and ddk filter coefficients to find optimal damped radius range in all cases performance was evaluated by examining different statistical metrics including pearson correlations and root mean square errors rmse together with graphic analysis 3 2 required processes to derive groundwater storage gws changes the second objective of the research is the reconstruction of gws variations based upon a comprehensive procedure grace coefficients provide global scale mass variations of the earth we defined a regional kernel function to obtain the regional averaged tws changes as huang et al 2019 4 υ x 1 i f x q 0 i f x ω q where x is the position on the earth s surface q is the region of interest prairies and ω is the entire earth s surface this kernel was expanded to spherical harmonic coefficients υ nm c and υ nm s and then applied to obtain regional averaged tws variations in the area of interest thus regional scale monthly tws variations were computed using eq 5 as follows 5 δ t w s φ λ a ρ a v e 3 ω r e g i o n ρ w n 1 60 m 0 n p nm sin φ 2 n 1 1 k n w nm υ nm c δ c nm cos m λ υ nm s δ s nm sin m λ 6 ω r e g i o n s r e g i o n a 2 where δ represents the variations a is the equatorial radius of the earth ρ a v e is the mean density of the earth s r e g i o n is the area of the region of interest ρ w is the density of fresh water and p nm is the fully normalized legendre function of degree n maximum 60 in this study and order m w nm are the proposed ghf smoothing filter coefficients and k n is the load love number of degree n in addition φ is latitude λ is longitude and c nm and s nm are the spherical harmonic coefficients that are provided by grace monthly solutions the basis of the detailed development of eq 5 can be found in wahr 2006 it should be mentioned that the proposed ghf filter is only applicable to the spherical solutions of grace data and has no application on mascon based solutions we performed the following processing steps to derive corrected values of δtws first missing or erroneous coefficients should be replaced zonal harmonic coefficients of c 20 were replaced with coefficients from satellite laser ranging cheng et al 2011 degree 1 coefficients were replaced by those coefficients that had been developed by sun et al 2016 and which were based upon ocean and atmospheric models second gia effects see section 2 2 must be removed from the grace coefficients for this we used the ice 6g c vm5a model peltier et al 2015 the uplift rate due to gia effects then was transformed to its corresponding spherical coefficients and subtracted from the grace coefficients li et al 2018 third the leakage error should be removed to remove leakage effects leakage in and recover the attenuated true signals bias or leakage out we used a forward modelling correction approach based on additive correction the true signal of grace is defined as feng 2019 7 δ t w s t r u e δ t w s e q 5 a f t e r c o r r e c t i o n s l e a k a g e i n s l e a k a g e o u t 8 s l e a k a g e i n 1 s r

hydrological and surface water body level anomalies oceanic uncertainties as well as those originating from grace observations the error in water levels for each of the 14 lakes σ δ s w b is available from the dahiti service hydrological data from models have unknown errors due to the lack of field measurements in most cases uncertainties are estimated through inter comparison of different models or by validation with in situ data if these are available in most of these processes less attention is often paid to the uncertainties that are related to the stochastic component of the hydrological signals cai et al 2017 khan et al 2018 jung et al 2019 in our study we used a least squares approach to estimate hydrological uncertainties without external information or comparisons with other sources which have their own unknown errors a system of equations was subsequently constructed and variance component estimation that was based upon best quadratic unbiased estimators bque was applied to error computations and data reweighting koch 1999 the approach is summarized below more details are available in fatolazadeh et al 2020 to optimally estimate the unknown parameters we define the

statistical expectation operator q j is the co factor matrix of the observation sets with variance components of σ j 2 and q denotes the number of variance components tws hydrology can be written as 17 tws hydrology s m s w e c w 0 in some systems of equations the unknown parameters necessarily support certain geometric or physical conditions these special conditions are referred to as constraints between unknown parameters ghilani 2017 having an estimate of unknowns to guarantee that these conditions are fulfilled requires the imposition of this additional constraint or constraints on the system of equations or on the mathematical model here the matrix form of bx 0 provides this additional constraint for the system of equations therefore the solution of eq 13 with its residual errors vector r can be written as 18 x a t q 1 a b b t 1 a t q 1 l 19 r q 1 i a a t q 1 a b b t 1 a t q 1 where q is the co factor matrix of the observation sets with variance components of σ 2 since

variance component resulting from the i 1 th iterative step errors in grace data may be due to several sources such as measurement and residual leakage errors these may be significant in some areas depending upon location and geophysical features riegger et al 2012 khaki et al 2018 assuming that tws errors originate from uncertainties in the spherical harmonics coefficients we can write 22 σ δ c 2 nm σ δ s 2 nm σ c 2 nm t 2 σ s 2 nm t 2 σ c 2 nm t 1 σ s 2 nm t 1 where σ 2 is the variance of these coefficients c nm and s nm are normalized spherical harmonic coefficients of the grace models and δ is difference between periods t 2 and t 1 the grace spherical coefficient errors in tws variations then can be expressed as 23 σ 2 δ t w s φ λ g r a c e c o e f f i c i e n t s a ρ a v e 3 ρ w 2 n 1

variation can be obtained by using the error propagation law for random errors 24 σ δ g w s σ δ t w s g r a c e c o e f f i c i e n t s 2 σ δ s m 2 σ δ s w e 2 σ δ c w 2 σ δ s w b 2 3 4 validation groundwater level depth data that were acquired from 116 in situ piezometric wells were used to validate the results of gws variations that were estimated using the proposed procedure the wells that were used are located in five basins across the province of alberta i e peace athabasca churchill north saskatchewan south saskatchewan and missouri drainage basins fig 1b the limitation of using wells for validation is related primarily to their time variant nature input output relationships of the system change over time consequently the accumulated well data may not be representative at the coarse spatial resolution characterizing grace the observations in the wells that were considered are provided on a daily basis they were converted to monthly means to make them comparable with other data that were used in the study it is worth mentioning that in situ wells provide groundwater level data that must be converted to equivalent water layer thicknesses the transformation was performed using the following equation 25 δ g w s w e l l δ h w e l l s y where δ g w s w e l l is gws variation in the well and δ h w e l l is water level changes in the well s y is the specific yield i e the quantity of water that is released by an unconfined aquifer in drainage form thereby lowering the water table the ratio s y varies between 0 and 1 and is specific to a given place and type of soil material johnson 1967 its value is unknown for numerous locations in the world huang et al 2016 computed the specific yield in alberta based upon lithology and obtained values between 10 and 30 we used these values to estimate gws variations for the wells across the basins for the validation of the results that were obtained we considered various statistical metrics including the pearson product moment correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse mean bias error mbe and unbiased root mean square error unrmse 4 results 4 1 analysis of ghf filtering approach this sub section summarizes the results that were found by comparing the proposed ghf filter with previous filters gaussian han and fan filters with the intention of showing that the former performs better than the latter filters and is not region dependent results of analysis for determining the optimal radii for the use of the ghf filter are also presented 4 1 1 performance analysis fig 2 illustrates the behaviours of the zonal sectorial and tesseral spherical harmonic functions that were extracted from their legendre function formulae for the sake of illustration maximum degree and order of 8 are shown as can be seen the three harmonic components show oscillations on the latitude axis and longitude axis and in both latitudinal and longitudinal directions the anomalies show cosine and sine components in the normalized associated legendre functions grace errors vary according to both degree and order as a consequence better filters are required to handle the variations this is the main reason justifying the development of the ghf which is dependent upon the entire range of degrees and orders to illustrate this process we used fully normalized accuracy estimates associated with grace coefficients http icgem gfz potsdam de series fig 3 shows the distribution of these estimates for both sine and cosine components of grace coefficients june 2017 data are shown as an example dependency of grace errors on both degree and order is clear the sine and cosine components exhibit the same behaviour with a correlation of about r 0 99 for further analysis we produced the spectra for ghf and previous filters fig 4 shows the spectrum for ghf filter with r 0 300 k m r 1 500 k m compared to the gaussian filter with r 300 k m the han filter with r 0 300 k m r 1 500 k m and the fan filter with r 500 k m maximum degree and order 60 were considered in all cases based on the aforementioned theory section 3 1 the required filter should decrease rather than truncate the contribution of higher spherical harmonic degrees and orders in comparison to other filters the results presented in fig 4 show that the ghf filter can effectively pass higher degrees and orders and detect all of the coefficients the contribution of high degrees and orders is low as expected the gaussian filter cannot detect coefficients higher than degree and order 40 another weakness of the gaussian filter is that it provides only a constant value for a given degree regardless of order the han filter was effective in attaining the degree and order up to 50 but could not proceed beyond this threshold the fan filter can just pass lower degrees and orders 20 working with other radii for previous filters yielded worse results from the power spectrum analysis ghf filter emerges as being more efficient than the previous filters that were considered in the study we did further comparisons to assess the merits of the ghf filter for instance we computed degree variance of accumulated geoid change height error using grace monthly coefficients and the different filters the aforementioned radii and maximum degree of 60 were considered for illustrative purposes fig 5 shows results of june 2017 this period corresponds to the end of grace s lifetime we can expect maximum errors in the observations the ghf filter shows increasing geoid change height errors with increasing degree consistent with expectation however han gaussian and fan filters were overdamped in the degree of about 45 35 and 10 respectively finally geoid height change that had been obtained by applying the different filters on grace monthly coefficients was compared to the filtered ddk monthly coefficients here considered as the reference state this comparison was limited to the 12 months of the year 2010 because complete grace and ddk data were available also degrees and orders lower than 10 were excluded from the analysis to emphasize the shorter wavelength features fig 6 shows results of the pearson correlation analysis for each filter compared to ddk while table 2 summarizes the corresponding rmse values clearly the new ghf filter shows better agreement with ddk results r 0 89 rmse 0 10 compared to the previous filters indeed the performance of filters over the 12 month period could be ordered highest to lowest correlations as ghf han gauss fan a trend that was fairly consistent from month to month kendall s coefficient of concordance w 0 85 p 0 0001 where w 1 is complete agreement and w 0 is no agreement among the rankings monthly ranking among the filters was much more consistent for rmse w 0 99 p 0 0001 table 2 than for values of r fig 6 but the ordering of their performance from lowest to highest error i e fan gauss han ghf was the converse of that produced for pearson correlations these different comparative analyses bolster our confidence in applying the ghf filter 4 1 2 determination of optimal radii for the ghf filter to find the optimal damped range best set of radii for the ghf filter we computed the power spectrum with different pairs of radii r 0 r 1 where r 1 r 0 200 km 300 km 400 km or 500 km in each case the results for the zonal sectorial and tesseral components are shown in figs 7 to 10 it should be mentioned that several combinations of degrees and orders are possible for the tesseral component therefore for the purposes of illustration only degree 50 is shown here to emphasize the shortest wavelength features the ideal filter is normally a filter that has a maximum weight for the lowest degrees and orders and decreasing values towards the highest degrees and orders in other words the ideal filter preserves lower degrees and orders and decreases the contribution of the higher ones regardless of the radius combination that was used the zonal component shows maximum weight in n m 0 0 and lowest weight in n m 60 0 as it can be seen on figs 7 to 10a this translates the high performance of the ghf filter into preservation of the zonal component the situation is different when we examine the sectorial and tesseral components overdamping can be observed for radius pairings of 100 300 150 350 and 200 400 km in n m 15 15 n m 25 25 and n m 30 30 respectively fig 7b underdamping occurs at n m 15 15 for radii 300 500 and higher only the combination of radii r 0 250 km and r 1 450 km with red colour could be damped the results in figs 8 to 10b exhibit overdamping or underdamping in all cases indicating no optimal radius pair except for the combination of radii r 0 250 km and r 1 450 km which shows ideal behaviour fig 7c overdamping or underdamping occurs in the tesseral component for all other combinations figs 7 to 10c based on these different results we can conclude that the best performance by the ghf filter can be achieved for zonal sectorial and tesseral components when the radius range is r 0 250 km and r 1 450 km additional analyses were performed to confirm the selection of the optimal radius pair 250 450 km by comparing geoid height changes to filtered ddk monthly coefficients the height changes were computed using the ghf filter which was applied to grace monthly coefficients with different radius combinations 250 450 km 250 550 km 250 650 km and 250 750 km degrees and orders lower than 10 were excluded from the analysis fig 11 summarizes the results for year 2010 which has a complete available dataset the optimal radius pair that was found in the aforementioned analysis was supported by higher correlations r 0 89 with ddk coefficients compared to other radius combinations month to month ordering of radius pair performance was very consistent w 0 94 p 0 0001 with 250 450 ranking highest for its strong correlations with ddk distantly trailed by 250 550 250 750 and 250 650 with much weaker correlations fig 11 for the remainder of this research the pair of radii r 0 250 km and r 1 450 km was thus applied to the grace data to extract and analyse gws variations 4 2 estimation of gws variations results of the second objective of the research i e the reconstruction of gws variations following the proposed comprehensive procedure are summarized here results of the pre processing steps are shown first followed by those of groundwater variations 4 2 1 leakage effects as indicated in equations 8 and 9 computation of leakage error requires that mass variations which could be estimated from hydrological parameters and altimetric data be considered as a priori information fig 12 illustrates the results of anomalies of water storage variations from soil snow and canopy that were computed using gldas data fig 12a it also shows sea level anomalies for the hudson bay that were derived from altimetry data for the same period fig 12b a maximum of 0 15 m and 0 10 m were obtained for the anomalies of sm swe cw and sea level anomalies respectively the region around the hudson bay is the most significant contributor to leakage in the area therefore it was the only region that was considered in the computation of sea level anomalies overall the anomalies of surface water storage δsws δsm δswe δcw δswb in the prairie region and its surroundings vary between about 0 22 m and 0 15 m fig 12c these anomalies were then transformed to their corresponding spherical harmonic coefficients up to degree and order 60 fig 12d these coefficients were then filtered by ghf to form s o u t and s i n in equations 8 and 9 to calculate leakage out and leakage in fig 13 shows leakage out and leakage in results for june 2017 for illustrative purposes leakage in effects are more important along the margins of a region than at its centre this response could be explained simply by the fact that marginal areas are closer to the signals that originate from outside the region areas that were near to hudson bay northeast manitoba and close to the pacific ocean southwest of calgary ab exhibit the maximum leakage in effects about 0 04 m this confirms that the signal from the surrounding areas with particular climate conditions leaked into nearby regions of the prairies a maximum value of 0 02 m was found in june 2017 for leakage out toward surrounding areas this occurs along the southwest boundary of alberta overall the analysis that was performed in the research demonstrates that leakage effects exist in the study region as described in equation 7 leakage in and leakage out must be removed from grace monthly coefficients in order to compute true tws variations therefore we computed monthly averaged leakage effects which are summarized in fig 14 for each year computations could be accomplished only for eight months april to november during the remaining four months hudson bay is covered by snow and the results could be unrealistic the signals that leaked from surrounding areas into the prairies are higher than those that leaked from prairies into the adjacent regions in fig 14 these leakage effects were significant in 2005 2010 and 2011 with maximum values of 0 33 m for leakage in and 0 25 m for leakage out therefore correction of leakage from grace coefficients is recommended for the prairies region 4 2 2 hydrological data anomalies fig 15 shows monthly time series for sm swe and cw anomalies that were calculated using both gldas and wghm sm and swe appear to be the most important anomalies given that they exhibit considerable amplitude variation about 100 mm globally both models show comparable time series of sm and swe anomalies for swe the amplitude and periodicity of the time series for the two models track one another particularly closely in contrast canopy water cw anomalies do have discernible signals but very small amplitudes a range of 0 4 mm that appear out of phase between the two models compared to the other variables summation of the three parameters sm swe and cw is also shown in fig 15 gldas and wghm have very similar values except in 2005 to 2007 and 2010 to 2012 where a bias higher amplitude can be seen favouring gldas a small positive trend is visible from 2002 to 2011 subsequently followed by a less subtle decrease up to 2015 4 2 3 surface water body anomalies fig 16 shows the sea level anomalies that were computed with altimetry data for 14 lakes or rivers which were considered as representative of swb in the region the range of variation is relatively low for most of the lakes i e between 50 mm and 50 mm in a few cases the variations are marked cedar lesser slave and dunkin lakes and saskatchewan river the average of the fourteen swbs shows a range of variations between 86 mm and 59 mm with a slight pattern of smooth increase from april 2002 to june 2017 a positive trend of 0 17 mm month all swbs show a slight positive trend 0 06 mm month to 0 71 mm month except for dunkin frank and zama lakes where the trend is weak but negative 0 08 mm month to 0 60 mm month the variations of surface water bodies may be explained by numerous factors including glacial melt received precipitation evapotranspiration sedimentation and use of water for domestic and industrial needs among others 4 2 4 surface water storage sws anomalies sws anomalies can be deriving by summing of anomalies of the hydrological data δsm δswe δcw and swb anomaly see eq 10 the results are illustrated in fig 17 a overall the variations range between 100 mm and 100 mm a positive trend was observed for the period covered but the slope of line was stronger when only wghm was considered 0 27 mm month compared the weak trend displayed by gldas 0 004 mm month both models agree on the low values during the drought period 2002 2005 and a well marked positive trend from 2002 to 2006 indicating a clear improvement towards 2006 end of drought as explained in section 3 spherical harmonic coefficient models were used to estimate mass anomalies from grace gravity field measurements in the form of tws variations from the debut to the end of the grace mission 183 months viz april 2002 to june 2017 fig 17b presents the monthly time series of average tws changes across the canadian prairies that were estimated using the new ghf filter the time series show seasonal and inter annual variations with maximum storage occurring in the beginning of the winter and minimum in autumn tws variations roughly vary between 250 mm and 250 mm over the 15 year period according to fig 17b there is a steep gradual increase during the 15 years in tws variations with a trend of 2 33 mm month this increase is consistent with those values reported in the studies performed by huang et al 2016 and wang and li 2016 here a positive trend was calculated for alberta between 2002 and 2014 about 2 mm month and 1 5 mm month respectively and for the prairies between 2002 and 2014 1 5 mm month the continued increase in storage values after 2010 when δtws 0 fig 17b could be due to severe flooding that had occurred earlier on the canadian prairies the timing of this phenomenon is interesting given that it happened after 2009 when one of the driest spring and summer periods on record in over 50 years was reported in the region 44 c environment and climate change canada another steep increase occurred in 2016 this latter response may be explained by severe weather on the prairies which was marked by heavy rain and tornadoes exceeding the 30 year average 1986 2015 canada s top ten weather stories in 2016 canadian meteorological and oceanographic society url https cmos ca site top ten a 2016 the decrease in tws changes at the beginning and during mid 2015 could be linked to moisture stress in the agricultural landscape which was due to severe dryness across most of the area the considerable low value of tws changes in 2003 that was obtained with the ghf approach agrees with the results that were reported by yirdaw et al 2008 it is a consequence of the drought which was characterized by low precipitation which persisted in the region during the indicated period yirdaw et al 2008 hanesiak et al 2011 in general high peaks may be due to several factors including long rainy periods snow water equivalent or the presence of vast forested and wetland landscapes the increase that was computed for tws variations in the prairies can be linked not only to snowmelt bahrami et al 2020 but also to precipitation leading to greater soil moisture accumulation meng et al 2019 in contrast evapotranspiration that was driven by higher temperatures during dry months and glacier mass losses favour a decrease in tws variations meng et al 2019 xie et al 2018 4 2 5 groundwater storage gws anomalies monthly gws variations were computed using equations 10 and 11 section 3 fig 18 shows the resulting time series that is averaged for the whole study area for each hydrological model the beginning and end of the time series depends upon the availability of model simulated data as has been previously mentioned section 2 3 amplitudes of gws variations that were found using gldas range between 200 mm and 230 mm from 2002 to 2017 with wghm the amplitudes lie between 220 mm and 135 mm from 2002 to 2014 results that were found using the two models agree particularly well in 2002 2005 and 2007 2010 both results show a positive trend of gws changes during the study period with quite similar values same rank ordering of 2 33 mm month for gldas and 2 19 mm month for wghm the trends displayed by gws variations are very consistent with those of previous studies e g huang et al 2016 who reported a positive trend in alberta from 2002 to 2014 the discrepancy in gws variations between gldas and wghm results can be seen from 2005 to mid 2006 2010 to 2011 and mid 2013 to 2014 more precisely gldas exhibits the highest groundwater increase in the summer of 2016 and beginning of 2017 about 230 mm and the greatest depletion meaning high rate of water discharge at the beginning of the grace mission april 2002 about 200 mm other notable depletions occurred in may 2004 185 mm may 2006 167 mm and march 2010 78 mm with wghm maximum amplitudes of gws variations occur in january 2013 september 2013 and august to october 2014 with values around 130 mm the greatest depletions can be seen in april 2002 and may 2004 i e the same months and values as gldas overall there is a good agreement between gldas and wghm both in terms of the occurrence of maximum amplitude and depletion times it is worth mentioning that exact occurrence times of maximum and minimum gws variations values vary according to geographical location hydrological regime climate conditions and geological situation van der kamp and maathuis 1991 in certain years for example in 2006 2010 and 2011 results that were found using both gldas and wghm agree in terms of the co occurrence of maximum and minimum gws variations this congruence may be due to the effect of el niño southern oscillation enso on gws variations enso is a climate pattern that is specifically associated with warm surface waters of the central and eastern pacific ocean forootan et al 2016 several studies in canada have shown links between groundwater level variation and enso events coulibaly and burn 2004 fleming and quilty 2006 gan et al 2007 a rise of about 20 above the normal rate of precipitation which is directly related to gws variation has been reported for la niña years cold phase of enso a decrease of about 14 was observed for el niño warm phase of enso further work is needed to better understand the effects of these phenomena on grace derived gws variations 4 2 6 temporal decomposition of groundwater signals for further insights we applied temporal decomposition to the gws variations signals based upon eq 12 section 3 to retrieve their various components including acceleration annual trend annual amplitude semi annual amplitude annual phase and semi annual phase for illustrative purposes we only show spatial patterns of four temporal components trend acceleration annual and semi annual amplitudes using both gldas and wghm figs 19 20 however statistical values that were estimated across the study area for all components that were computed are provided in table 3 based upon figs 19 and 20 results that were found using both models show similar trend patterns in gws variations for instance the average trend that was obtained with gldas is about 21 90 mm year table 3 wghm shows a mean trend in the same positive direction but it has a higher value about 24 94 mm year generally the positive values that were observed in the canadian prairies may be explained as the consequence of tws variations recovery following severe drought between 1999 and 2003 wang et al 2015 in all cases a positive trend is observed in the northern prairies especially in northern manitoba and saskatchewan the highest trend occurs in the region surrounding hudson bay about 53 mm year with gldas 57 mm year with wghm this is response consistent with the increasing trend of precipitation in the area which was estimated at 0 2 mm month by li et al 2016 using both approaches maximum depletion was estimated to occur particularly in the southern prairies which is dominated by farming activities furthermore the dynamics of gws changes differ from one province to another alberta for example exhibits a slight positive trend except in its southern region in 2009 groundwater in this province represented only 3 of total licensed water volumes compared to 97 for surface water alberta environment information centre 2010 therefore less pressure is placed on groundwater resources in the province moreover about 23 of the population in alberta relies upon groundwater compared to 30 and 43 in manitoba and saskatchewan respectively rutherford 2004 the acceleration component of gws variations is low and similar to those reported in various previous studies ogawa et al 2011 velicogna et al 2014 eicker et al 2016 overall acceleration and annual amplitude that were estimated using wghm are about double those estimated with gldas table 3 this agrees with the findings of jin and feng 2013 who reported mean acceleration and mean annual amplitude of gws that were derived using wghm in north america and europe are larger than corresponding results from the gldas model due to differences in modelling climate and hydrology components another reason can be explained by differences in the data assimilation system that was used in the two models the observation sources and choices of data forcing differ between these models chen et al 2017 scanlon et al 2019 fatolazadeh et al 2020 using wghm the maximum annual amplitude was observed in western alberta and northern manitoba and saskatchewan about 94 mm with gldas western alberta eastern saskatchewan and most part of manitoba experienced a maximum annual amplitude of about 50 mm although semi annual amplitude was less than half of the annual amplitude that was derived using both models its spatial pattern was not the same as the annual amplitude this accords with other studies jin and feng 2013 zhou et al 2016 jin and feng 2013 further showed that this situation occurs across the world due to seasonal contributions of semi annual amplitude to the total signal of gws variations changes in the location of long term and seasonal components that are mainly oriented in a latitudinal direction have been confirmed by scanlon et al 2019 in general the results yield signals with much more variable patterns therefore differences were expected to emerge in wghm and gldas models at low frequencies of gws semi annual components the maximum and minimum annual and semi annual phase showed positive and negative values respectively which are in agreement with the findings of zhou et al 2016 more precisely the mean annual and semi annual phases that were found in our study using gldas are about 29 and 135 respectively with wghm mean annual and semi annual phases are about 18 and 91 respectively the results of both models are close to the ranges that were found by the other studies for instance jin and feng 2013 reported in their global scale study that the annual and semi annual phase over canada was from 180 to 180 respective decreases and increases of annual and semi annual phases towards the north pole 4 3 uncertainty analysis in gws variations the uncertainties that were associated to gws variations were estimated and have been summarized here first uncertainties that are related to both gldas and wghm hydrological parameters were computed using least squares estimation with reweighting by bque see section 3 3 second the errors for water levels of each of the 14 lakes in the canadian prairies σ δ s w b are available from the dahiti service third errors that are related to grace tws changes have then been computed section 3 3 finally based upon the error propagation law uncertainties in gws variations were estimated fig 21 shows the monthly time series of the absolute uncertainties for each component uncertainties vary in the range of 10 34 mm for sm 0 28 mm for swe and 0 0 2 mm for cw sm makes the greatest contribution to total water storage fig 21a given its largest proportion yin et al 2017 chen et al 2019 uncertainties may be due to the difficulty of modelling complex water circulation in regions that are characterized by seasonally frozen soil and snowmelt conditions the topography of the canadian prairies may also contribute to uncertainties in the sm component moreover differences in soil thicknesses that were used by the two different hydrological models to compute sm may introduce further uncertainties rempe 2016 the result for swe fig 21b shows that uncertainties reach their maxima at the beginning of each year due to the hydrological regime prevailing on the canadian prairies during the winter cw errors are weak fig 21c as this component appears as a negligible element in tws variations across the prairies overall uncertainties in the different components from hydrological models exhibit cyclic patterns which denotes seasonal dependence this is particularly obvious for swe and cw with the occurrence of cold and frozen conditions each year the errors that are related to swb are displayed in fig 21d they fluctuate between 2 mm and 4 mm these errors may be due to the noise that is incorporated into the geophysical corrections of altimetry data through the inclusion of tides and dynamical atmospheric correction prandi et al 2021 the errors in tws changes from grace which were computed using equations 29 and 30 section 3 3 are illustrated in fig 21e they appear to be weak 5 mm until 2014 after that period they start to increase significantly towards the end life of the twin satellite system and attain their highest values i e 13 mm based on the error propagation law eq 31 and 32 section 3 3 we calculated the corresponding errors in gws variations fig 21f shows these uncertainties over the canadian prairies for the study period the maximum errors on gws variations occurred frequently in summer time except for 2013 which is in winter season the highest error was found in summer 2006 at about 34 mm mean errors over the whole study period were calculated to be 19 mm roughly corresponding to about 10 of the maximum absolute values for gws variations in the prairies fig 18 4 4 validation of gws estimates in this section results of gws variations are compared with in situ observations that are distributed across five basins throughout alberta the results are shown for each individual basin and for the whole area encompassing the five basins the corresponding statistical metrics are reported in table 4 fig 22 compares gws variations that were obtained from our approach using both gldas and wghm to in situ well profiles first all the datasets that were compared agree in terms of the positive trend in gws from 2002 to 2017 for each individual basin and for the whole area some discrepancies can be seen between grace based estimates and in situ observations particularly in the years between 2003 and 2005 and 2010 and 2012 quantitatively there is a very good agreement between our results and in situ values as can be seen in table 4 all of the correlations that were found significantly differed from zero 95 confidence intervals the lowest correlation that was obtained is r 0 70 while the highest worst rmse is 54 mm the highest agreements occur in the basin of north saskatchewan using both gldas and wghm r 0 91 to 0 92 rmse between 32 and 37 and unrmse between 27 and 33 mm in all basins except for the south saskatchewan the use of gldas in the grace processing procedure provided better results than wghm in terms of correlations and rmse however lower unrmses are obtained with wghm in most cases meaning its results are more affected by biases as attested by the mbe values summarized in table 4 when the average of the entire area encompassing the five basins is considered the agreement between grace based estimations and in situ observations improves greatly with very similar results from gldas and wghm gldas r 0 93 unrmse 27 mm wghm r 0 91 unrmse 23 mm overall the results demonstrated that our proposed method worked well in deriving gws variations 5 discussion an important aspect of this paper was the introduction of the new ghf filter accordingly effort has been devoted to comparing ghf to several previously published filters to highlight its merits the ghf filter has been constructed as an evolutionary filter combining the advantage of gaussian han and fan filters each of these previous filters has limitations which may affect grace data processing when they are used individually for instance the gaussian filter as seen in fig 4 provides only constant values for each order of a given degree but exerts no effect on degrees higher than 44 the fan filter is not effective for degrees higher than 25 while han filter works for neither higher degree nor higher order coefficients fig 4 compared to previous filters that we considered the ghf filter shows dependency to both degree and order when the radius changes dynamically according to harmonic order and appears effective in filtering all zonal tesseral and sectorial components despite interesting results that were obtained it is important to mention that filters like the ghf can add the same weights to both signal and noise this may affect the desired balance between signal retention and noise reduction le et al 2020 the definition of the optimal radius range for the ghf filter is also important figs 7 to 10a show that the choice of radius does not affect the zonal component however this is not the case for the tesseral and sectorial components all simulations that were performed in the study indicate that the best radius range for the ghf filter is r 0 250 km and r 1 450 km outside this range overdamping or underdamping occurs to confirm the results we compared the ghf gaussian han and fan filters to the ddk filter which was considered as the reference various radius ranges were used in the comparison clearly the ghf filter showed maximum correlations with the ddk filter fig 6 and the best results were found with the radius range r 0 250 km and r 1 450 km fig 11 therefore from the different results that were obtained it can be concluded that the ghf filter provides better filtering performance compared to gaussian han and fan filters thus it was used in the comprehensive procedure that we proposed for reconstructing groundwater variations this procedure starts with the retrieval of proper tws changes from the grace data it requires different pre processing steps including leakage and surface water storage corrections based on fig 13 most signals in the marginal regions near hudson bay and pacific ocean leaked in to the area of the interest to correct for these leakage effects we used preliminary information that was derived from hydrological parameters some errors may affect this process given that hydrological parameters from both gldas and wghm models have inherent uncertainties themselves fatolazadeh et al 2020 moreover four months of each year were neglected in the computation of leakage these months correspond to the winter period that dominated by ice surfaces they are characterized by a lack of data which in turn can introduce some uncertainties fig 14 as mentioned in subsection 2 2 the considered grace dataset also has missing months data a simple linear interpolation was used in the study to fill the gaps some uncertainties may result from this simple process indeed missing data could be eventually treated in a better way by using more advanced approaches such as singular spectrum analysis independent component analysis integral equation approach or even linear regression analysis forootan et al 2020 yi and sneeuw 2021 to compute surface water storage hydrological models and satellite altimetry data were used sections 4 2 2 to 4 2 4 in terms of swe both gldas and wghm provided comparable values fig 15b they also provided comparable amplitudes for canopy water cw however with a time lag fig 15c overall cw values appear too weak 0 3 to affect total surface water storage in the region the uncertainties that are related to gldas and wghm data affect estimated surface water storage these uncertainties mostly originate from different sources including the model structures and parameters input data and the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the surface jung et al 2019 as an example there is a general lack of ground based stations monitoring soil moisture in most regions this paucity of data can cause large uncertainties in simulated sm in land surface models scanlon et al 2015 this is reflected in fig 21a where sm exhibits the highest errors about 32 mm compared to other hydrological parameters water level change in surface water bodies should also be taken into account in the computation of surface water storage satellite altimetry data were used to extract this information for major lakes and rivers in the canadian prairies fig 16 overall most of these showed a positive trend during the study period that was considered fig 16 estimation of water level changes from altimetry data may be affected by the noise introduced by the aforementioned geophysical corrections prandi et al 2021 in this study a maximum 4 mm error was found fig 21d the amplitude of tws variations is a little higher than gws changes demonstrating that gws variations were an important factor in the canadian prairies based on fig 21f the maximum gws variations error of 32 mm was found by the propagation law which takes into account errors from the different sources including hydrological models altimetry data and grace tws errors in spite of the uncertainties evaluated gws had a positive trend over the entire period fig 18 with discrepancies from 2005 to 2006 and from 2010 to 2011 figs 17a 18 the drivers of groundwater storage increase in the region may include glacier melt from surrounding areas precipitation and postglacial rebound in north america indeed it has been reported by previous studies that mass loss from glaciers across canada has increased significantly since 2000 for instance glacial meltwater contributes to base flow increase in many river basins of the prairies such as athabasca north saskatchewan bow and south saskatchewan thus influencing positively groundwater storage increase castellazzi et al 2019 bash and marshall 2014 moreover the combined effects of snowmelt processes and precipitations also contribute to increasing groundwater storage across the prairies bhanja et al 2018 postglacial rebound is another factor that may affect groundwater storage due to its effects on water flow at different time scales for instance tregoning et al 2009 computed a groundwater gain at the west of hudson bay due to the vertical uplift resulting from postglacial rebound decomposition of gws variations showed maximum amplitude of 45 mm when gldas is considered while amplitude was doubled with wghm which does not seem to be realistic figs 19 20 overall based upon fig 19 the gws trend was minimum about 20 mm year in palliser s triangle the triangle is the northernmost extension of the great american desert mcinnise 2004 it is the most arid region of the canadian prairies semi arid steppe the canada us border 49 n 115 w forms its southern boundary which extends northward beyond the city of edmonton alberta 53 5 n 113 5 w and then diagonally southeast to the manitoba north dakota border 49 n 97 9 w marchildon et al 2016 reported similar patterns for the validation of gws results in situ wells were used in five different river basins within alberta these wells have the most complete series of data corresponding to the study period as can be seen in table 4 some basins have few wells in these cases in situ well values may not be representative of the entire basin for instance only 6 wells were available for the study in that portion of the missouri basin which is located in the southern part of alberta this may eventually explain the relatively low correlations 0 74 to 0 79 and high rmse 47 mm that were associated with the estimated gws in this basin compared to the other basins for all of the individual basins validation showed statistically significant correlations p 10 4 and low errors the results are much improved when averaged for the five basins error 30 mm for both gldas and wghm compared to the metrics that were reported in previous studies in the region huang et al 2016 bhanja et al 2018 we found much better values in gws validation that were estimated by our approach despite the interesting metrics that were obtained it is worth mentioning that the validation of grace based estimates using in situ measurements remains a challenge where more effort is still necessary the spatial and temporal representativeness of in situ well data is a potential source of errors due to the scale mismatch between satellite and ground based observations in addition specific yield storativity may be different for each well location and could introduce uncertainties higher and lower specific yield values can be found in regions that are covered by dry soils black dark and brown soils and wet areas respectively including regosolic organic and brunisolic intermediate values are expected in regions with moist grey and dark grey soils johnson 1967 including vertisolic luvisolic and chernozemic the 116 in situ unconfined wells that were used in the validation process of this study are scattered over different soil conditions throughout the five basins that were considered in alberta based on canadian soil classification orders 80 of the alberta covered by chernozemic basin 1 luvisolic basins 1 2 and 3 and vertisolic basins 4 and 5 about 15 of this province covered by regosolic basins 1 and 4 and organic basins 1 and 2 a small region of alberta about 5 covered by brunisolic basins 1a 2 and 4 therefore potential errors that are due to specific yield may be possible here 6 conclusion in this study a comprehensive approach was proposed and employed to retrieve gws changes using data from grace satellite hydrological models and altimetry water level changes for a period spanning april 2002 to june 2017 across the canadian prairies a new ghf filter was introduced and applied to refine the estimation of tws changes and gws changes the ghf with the radius range of r 0 250 km and r 1 450 km performed well compared to previous filters soil moisture was the dominant contributor to tws anomalies in the prairies with a range of 85 mm to 85 mm while canopy water makes a relatively negligible contribution 0 2 mm to 0 3 mm soil moisture also exhibited the greatest uncertainties the contribution that is made by snow water equivalent 20 mm to 80 mm is very important in the prairies even if it is less than that of soil moisture the average sea level anomaly from 14 major water bodies in the prairies showed a very weak positive trend with uncertainties 2 mm after 2010 according to the results that were found it is worth applying leakage corrections to grace data in the study region following the comprehensive procedure that was proposed the amplitudes of the retrieved monthly gws variations covered a range varying from about 200 mm to 230 mm with a mean uncertainty of about 19 mm about 10 error temporal decomposition of gws variations signals showed a positive trend of gws changes in the northern part of with the canadian prairies about 45 mm and a negative trend in the southern part especially in manitoba 15 mm overall improved correlations were found between grace based groundwater estimates and in situ observations in the southern part of the study area r 0 80 which is covered by mountains grassland and parkland compared to the northern part 0 75 which is dominated by boreal forest and wetlands overall the metrics that were estimated during the validation process demonstrate the strong potential of the proposed comprehensive approach for gws variations estimation regardless of the hydrological model system gldas whghm that was used forthcoming studies will focus on further evaluation of the ghf

surface water storage sum of soil moisture snow water equivalent canopy water and surface water bodies was subtracted from reconstructed grace based terrestrial water storage tws changes through ghf filtering to estimate the required hydrological parameters both the global land data assimilation system gldas and water global hydrology model wghm were used and evaluated water level changes for major surface water bodies were estimated using satellite altimetry based products the monthly average of gws variations over the prairies ranged between 200 mm and 230 mm a positive trend was found for both tws and gws variations with the highest values in the region surrounding hudson bay particularly in northern manitoba about 55 mm year estimated gws anomalies error was equivalent to about 10

gaussian han fan ghf filter canadian prairies grace satellite 1 introduction groundwater is a critical natural resource for domestic industrial and agricultural use throughout the world megdal 2018 unfortunately excess withdrawal climate change and other human impacts can affect its dynamics and availability as has been highlighted by several studies chen et al 2014 al zyoud et al 2015 xiao et al 2015 bhanja et al 2016 hu et al 2017 tangdamrongsub et al 2018 agutu et al 2019 lin et al 2020 lv et al 2020 these extensive demands can result in lowered water tables and even depletion of the aquifer leading to increased water scarcity hu et al 2019 thomas and famiglietti 2019 vasco et al 2019 wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 geological formations storing groundwater can be compromised with withdrawal of large quantities of the latter rock strata collapse upon themselves because interstitial water provides structural support land subsidence results from continued excessive pumping e g san joaquin and san jacinto valleys of california much of which is widespread globally and may be permanent herrera garcía et al 2021 given the aforementioned conditions and geological settings indeed compaction of the parent material results not only in reduced aquifer capacity but also reduces its ability to recharge consequently groundwater systems are endangered in some of the most densely populated areas across the globe rodell et al 2009 voss et al 2013 long et al 2016 zhong et al 2018 bhanja and mukherjee 2019 bierkens and wada 2019 sayre and taraz 2019 liu et al 2019 herrera garcía et al 2021 in the context of rapid population growth increased demand for food intensive agriculture climate change shortages of surface water resources and strong pressures that are placed on aquifers the sustainable management of groundwater resources has become a major global concern singh et al 2019 long et al 2020 wu et al 2020 these resources must be properly monitored and managed to balance the needs of domestic industrial and irrigational water for sustainable development konikow and kendy 2005 wu et al 2019 despite the abundance of lakes and rivers in many parts of canada the possible depletion of groundwater remains a concern in western canada particularly in the canadian prairies this vast region 1 982 million km2 fig 1 a is composed of three provinces manitoba saskatchewan and alberta where one third of the population depends upon groundwater supplies larocque and broda 2016 the area is particularly well known for intensive agricultural activities which demand substantial quantities of both surface and groundwater for irrigation kromm 1993 other industrial activities such as mining also consume considerable quantities of water warming climate human activities and shortages of water in surface water bodies are the dominant reasons for groundwater depletion in the area gan 2000 melt from glaciers mitigates water shortages during dry years yet the dynamics are changing given that mountain snowpack and glaciers are melting earlier and faster and snow accumulation is less conspicuous thereby affecting the water volume in river basins castellazzi et al 2019 decreasing surface water availability combined with these important needs places a great deal of pressure on groundwater sources all of the above reasons call for a better understanding of the current dynamics and natural variability in groundwater levels so that water resources management can be improved including the protection of aquifers cca 2009 in situ monitoring of wells is the traditional approach for estimating groundwater storage however this form of monitoring often is neither spatially continuous nor temporally regular and of sufficient duration and requires detailed budgets to cover large regions including extensive hydrogeological baseline and other ancillary data as a result groundwater observation networks frequently lack adequate spatial resolution and temporal coverage frequency consequently estimates may be unreliable in many regions of the world see rau et al 2020 unreliability of water resources subsequently hampers prompt decision making and appropriate management actions the launch of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace twin satellite system in 2002 opened up the possibility for studying water mass redistributions by measuring temporal variations in the gravity field of the earth tapley et al 2004 grace does not have the ability to detect any signal of the water cycle separately but it is capable of monitoring monthly changes in total water storage tws from the land surface to the bottom of the deepest aquifer sun et al 2020 here tws corresponds to the sum of canopy water surface water snow soil moisture and groundwater even though grace provided only coarse resolution tws changes during its lifetime it has made significant contributions to groundwater studies chen et al 2016 feng et al 2018 frappart

1999 and 2005 over the prairies several studies examined the potential for grace tws to characterize the phenomenon for instance yirdaw et al 2008 used a cumulative total storage deficit index for the saskatchewan river basin a large drainage basin in the prairies 405 864 km2 to produce a map of long term dryness and wetness they determined that the drought episode ended in may 2004 hanesiak et al 2011 also studied this drought using various climatological parameters to determine more clearly which metric had contributed substantially to its impacts on the physical environment they confirmed the results that were found by yirdaw et al 2008 hanesiak et al 2011 further observed intense drought between 2001 and 2002 which they explained in terms of diminished precipitation and snowfall wang et al 2014 examined variations in surface water budgets across sixteen large canadian drainage basins between 2002 and 2008 based upon improved observation networks and reanalysis models the monthly water budget imbalance was positive and negative for the southern and northern basins respectively wang et al 2015 reported an increase in tws on the canadian prairies at a rate of about 74 gigatonnes year following episodic severe droughts between 1999 and 2005 wang and li 2016 classified canada into several drainage basins in which they studied tws climatology from 2002 to 2014 they concluded that tws minima and maxima in most basins occurred respectively in september and april the smallest seasonal variations were found within the southern prairies 100 mm using principal component analysis pca li et al 2016 found a positive trend in tws in eastern canada the prairies and the northwest mackenzie river basin maximum 0 2 mm month and a negative trend in the regions of the arctic cordillera and the yukon minimum of 0 2 mm month in recent work fatolazadeh and goïta 2021 showed a positive trend of tws changes in the region surrounding hudson bay particularly in the northern part of the prairies recent outcomes using grace mark a major step forward in assessing groundwater storage gws variation in alberta huang et al 2016 showed an increased trend for groundwater accumulation over the province during the period 2002 2014 using monthly grace gravity models and gldas their results were validated using in situ data from 36 wells bhanja et al 2018 likewise estimated trends in groundwater storage variation in 11 major river basins across alberta using the hodrick prescott filter a non linear trend tool they found depletion in about half of the basins and showed that precipitation rainfall and melting snow influenced groundwater variation continual demand for water in irrigation based agriculture exerts tremendous pressure upon water resources particularly on groundwater prairie provinces water board 2019 https www ppwb ca groundwater activities understanding the dynamics of water in the prairies is thus a major national issue given the significant contribution of the region to canada s agricultural production this study focused upon a comprehensive approach of deriving groundwater storage changes and associated uncertainties using the grace satellites altimetric data and a hydrological model system with a new improved gaussian han fan ghf filter the approach that is proposed was evaluated over the canadian prairies using grace observations which were acquired between april 2002 and june 2017 the research was articulated in terms of three specific objectives i proposing a new filter with its optimal radius and evaluating its benefits compared to previous published filters ii proposing a comprehensive procedure for reconstructing refining and mapping gws variations using grace signals hydrological system model and altimetric data iii determining optimal gws variation uncertainties based upon best quadratic unbiased estimators bque without using external information to illustrate the performance of the approach that has been proposed estimated gws variations were validated using 116 in situ wells which were distributed over five different river basins in alberta namely peace athabasca churchill north

are dry uplands while water bodies cover about 0 201 million km2 10 of total area prairie provinces water board 2019 https www ppwb ca prairie vegetation cover consisting of grasslands farmlands and shrub lands predominates in the south moving northward the vegetation changes from open plains to mixed boreal forest the topography can be divided into three principal zones at the western edge of the region the rocky mountains and foothills dominate the topography southern areas have almost flat topography which is largely dominated by farmlands and pastures the canadian shield lies in the northeast and includes shallow soils and rock outcrops variations in both temperature and precipitation are important aspects of the prairie climate dumanski et al 2015 annual precipitation varies from just over 300 mm in southeastern alberta and southwestern saskatchewan to over 900 mm in the rocky mountains sauchyn and kulshreshtha 2008 rapid spring snowmelt produces runoff which is the main source of water supplying the basins throughout the region due to the climate and hydrology the prairies experience both drought and flooding depending upon the year mcginn 2010 2 2 grace observations the space borne gravimetric data from grace that were used consist of the monthly geophysical coefficients of release 6 which were processed by the center for space research csr06 these data are produced on the maximum degree and order 60 and are publicly available they cover the period between april 2002 and june 2017 with some missing data 20 months out of 183 months linear interpolation was performed to complete the data series for the 15 years as was the case in other studies the grace coefficient with degree 2 and order 0 which has larger errors was replaced with the coefficient that was obtained from satellite laser ranging cheng et al 2011 since grace data do not contain a degree 1 gravity term these coefficients were estimated from coefficients that are based upon ocean and atmospheric models and which were developed and expanded by sun et al 2016 in addition we used the glacial isostatic adjustment gia model of ice 6g c vm5a and modified the model s coefficients to correct for gia effects peltier et al 2015 2 3 hydrological data the most effective hydrological outputs that were used in this study included soil moisture content from the surface to a depth of 2 m sm snow water equivalent swe and canopy water content cw the data were derived respectively from the global land data assimilation system gldas and the watergap global hydrological model wghm which we refer to as hydrological models in this paper both hydrological models operate at a global scale and integrate various meteorological data global water use models and land cover data to compute water storage and fluxes for land areas across the earth outputs from the new gldas noah land surface model l4 v2 1 monthly temporal resolution from april 2002 to june 2017 0 5 spatial resolution and the new wghm v2 2c monthly temporal resolution from april 2002 to december 2014 0 5 spatial resolution were employed rodell et al 2004 beaudoing and rodell 2016 bailing et al 2018 döll et al 2012 müller schmied et al 2014 müller schmied 2017 the aforementioned domain periods were chosen based upon their availability and consistency with the grace time frame to maintain consistency with gldas and grace the spatial resolution of both simulation data was increased from 0 5 to 1 moreover the shapiro wilk test shapiro and wilk 1965 verified whether the hydrological data were normally distributed unlike gldas wghm produces water storage estimates from groundwater lakes and rivers but they were not used in this study because of major uncertainties which may cause the phase difference between well station measurements and model estimates long et al 2017 2 4 altimetric data as mentioned in section 2 1 water bodies occupy about 10 of the prairie region the most important lakes and rivers were considered here prairie provinces water board https www ppwb ca these surface water bodies swb listed in table 1 13 lakes 1 river often play important role in the occurrence of floods in the

these products were more fully developed by applying various geophysical corrections and by combining different multi mission altimeter results from envisat ers 2 jason 1 jason 2 jason 3 topex poseidon and saral altika following an approach that was proposed by schwatke et al 2015 the monthly average of the 13 lakes and 1 river was computed to be consistent with grace observations april 2002 to june 2017 2 5 validation datasets the study used in situ well data from five river basins that were located within the province of alberta to validate the results well information is indeed well documented in these basins through the groundwater observation well network gown the data were derived from 116 active unconfined wells which had more complete records as the deep confined aquifers might not play a major role in determining groundwater storage changes over the region we only used unconfined aquifers moreover lower groundwater changes have been reported for confined aquifers in some previous studies bhanja et al 2018 their approximate locations across the basins are depicted in fig 1b although most were located in the south to be consistent with grace data availability we considered measurements spanning the period from april 2002 to june 2017 3 method 3 1 introducing new gaussian han fan ghf filtering approach as the first specific objective of the research a new ghf smoothing filter is proposed the correlation between harmonic coefficients in monthly gravity field models of grace and noise at higher degrees n and orders m that are due to the attenuation factor may lead to inaccurate results wahr 2006 this noise tends to weaken recovery of short wavelengths in the gravity field of the earth inclination angle of the satellite orbit causes biases data accumulation which tends to appear in the north south along track direction thus retrieval of zonal spherical harmonics m 0 is easier dependent upon latitude compared to sectorial spherical harmonics n m dependent upon longitude swenson and wahr 2006 showed that correlations between the coefficients emerge at degree and order from 8 and continue in higher degrees and orders therefore a low pass filter is needed to decrease the contribution of higher spherical harmonic degrees with low wavelengths to retrieve zonal coefficients one very simple approach truncates degrees beyond a specific degree point rather than truncating coefficients an isotropic filter referred to as a gaussian filter was introduced by jekeli 1981 to smooth the earth s gravity field by decreasing the effects of higher harmonic coefficients a modified version of this filter was applied by chambers 2006 to generate more uniform behaviour in the coefficients at higher degrees yet this type of isotropic filter is dependent only upon the degree of the harmonic coefficients due to the accumulation of data in the north south direction the effects of tesseral n m 0 and sectorial coefficients in grace gravity field models are emphasized thus a filter is required to increase contributions of zonal coefficients and to decrease the effects of sectorial coefficients in addition to the spherical harmonic degree several non isotropic filters have been investigated that are also dependent upon spherical harmonic order han et al 2005 introduced a non isotropic smoother referred to as a han filter to enhance geophysical signal retrieval from grace observations the han filter works between two radii and is written as 1 w nm exp n ρ a e 2 4 l n 2 ρ ρ 1 ρ 0 m 1 m ρ 0 where ρ 0 and ρ 1 are two lower and upper bands of radii n and m are respectively degree and order m 1 is defined as maximum order for each degree order is defined from zero to its maximum and a e is the mean radius of the earth the basis of the han filter is similar to that of the gaussian filter both filters depend on the degree only however han filter uses a range of radiuses working between two radii may be advantageous in obtaining better results for mass redistribution changes from grace observations however the main weakness of the filter is that it is not dependent on the order m when radius takes maximum order therefore retrieval of some sectorial coefficients n m is impossible zhang et al 2009 for the first time introduced the fan filter which is defined by the function projection on a fan shaped plane this is a 2 d double non isotropic filter which is dependent upon both degree and order the fan filter is expressed as 2 w nm e x p n m ρ 0 a e 2 4 l n 2 this filter can be seen as an advanced version of the isotropic gaussian filter which simultaneously uses low pass along both degree n and order m the advantage of the fan filter is that it does not require external or a priori information moreover it takes only one radius lower for this purpose which is similar to gaussian filter in both han and fan filters when the spherical harmonic order is zero zonal harmonics the filter reverts to an isotropic gaussian filter therefore an improvement in performance that can be accrued by producing a new filter may be obtained when combining these two filters in this study we introduced a new filter by combining the han and fan filters given the simultaneous influence of gaussian han and fan filters we refer to this tool as the gaussian han fan ghf filter the new ghf filter can be written as 3 w nm exp n m ρ a e 2 4 l n 2 ρ ρ 1 ρ 0 m 1 m ρ 0 the ghf filter can incorporate the advantages of both han and fan filters its main advantage is that it is dependent upon both degree and order when the radius changes dynamically according to harmonic order in other words the filter reverts to an isotropic gaussian filter when zonal harmonics m 0 are used and the effects of fan and han filters are applied on the coefficients when sectorial and tesseral harmonics n m and n m 0 are used in this research a legitimate concern raises the following two main questions first what are the actual benefits of the ghf over the component gaussian han and fan filters separately second which range of radius should be selected for the ghf to produce optimal results to answer these questions the following steps were employed i showing that errors in monthly gravity field models of grace are dependent on both degree and order ii comparing power spectra of ghf and previous filters gaussian han and fan to confirm merits of the proposed filter iii comparing geoid height change error in ghf and previous filters to confirm its merits iv comparing geoid height change in each filter ghf and previous filters to more advanced ddk filter coefficients kusche 2007 to confirm the performance of the new filter v displaying the power spectrum of the ghf over different ranges of radii to find the optimal damped radius range vi comparing geoid height change in the ghf filter with different ranges of radii and ddk filter coefficients to find optimal damped radius range in all cases performance was evaluated by examining different statistical metrics including pearson correlations and root mean square errors rmse together with graphic analysis 3 2 required processes to derive groundwater storage gws changes the second objective of the research is the reconstruction of gws variations based upon a comprehensive procedure grace coefficients provide global scale mass variations of the earth we defined a regional kernel function to obtain the regional averaged tws changes as huang et al 2019 4 υ x 1 i f x q 0 i f x ω q where x is the position on the earth s surface q is the region of interest prairies and ω is the entire earth s surface this kernel was expanded to spherical harmonic coefficients υ nm c and υ nm s and then applied to obtain regional averaged tws variations in the area of interest thus regional scale monthly tws variations were computed using eq 5 as follows 5 δ t w s φ λ a ρ a v e 3 ω r e g i o n ρ w n 1 60 m 0

mean density of the earth s r e g i o n is the area of the region of interest ρ w is the density of fresh water and p nm is the fully normalized legendre function of degree n maximum 60 in this study and order m w nm are the proposed ghf smoothing filter coefficients and k n is the load love number of degree n in addition φ is latitude λ is longitude and c nm and s nm are the spherical harmonic coefficients that are provided by grace monthly solutions the basis of the detailed development of eq 5 can be found in wahr 2006 it should be mentioned that the proposed ghf filter is only applicable to the spherical solutions of grace data and has no application on mascon based solutions we performed the following processing steps to derive corrected values of δtws first missing or erroneous coefficients should be replaced zonal harmonic coefficients of c 20 were replaced with coefficients from satellite laser ranging cheng et al 2011 degree 1 coefficients were replaced by those coefficients that had been developed by sun et al 2016 and which were based upon ocean and atmospheric models second gia effects see section 2 2 must be removed from the grace coefficients for this we used the ice 6g c vm5a model peltier et al 2015 the uplift rate due to gia effects then was transformed to its corresponding spherical coefficients and subtracted from the grace coefficients li et al 2018 third the leakage error should be removed to remove leakage effects leakage in and recover the attenuated true signals bias or leakage out we used a forward modelling correction approach based on additive correction the true signal of grace is defined as feng 2019 7 δ t w s t r u e δ t w s e q 5 a f t e r c o r r e c t i o n s l e a k a g e i n s l e a k a g e o u t 8 s l e a k a g e i n 1 s r

could be estimated computations were performed using the following equation long et al 2013 singh et al 2017 bhanja et al 2018 feng et al 2018 chen et al 2019 frappart et al 2019 vissa et al 2019

equivalent and total canopy water and δ s w b is the anomaly for surface water bodies for our purposes we computed monthly groundwater anomalies by subtracting the monthly time series from the average

hydrological and surface water body level anomalies oceanic uncertainties as well as those originating from grace observations the error in water levels for each of the 14 lakes σ δ s w b is available from the dahiti service hydrological data from models have unknown errors due to the lack of field measurements in most cases uncertainties are estimated through inter comparison of different models or by validation with in situ data if these are available in most of these processes less attention is often paid to the uncertainties that are related to the stochastic component of the hydrological signals cai et al 2017 khan et al 2018 jung et al 2019 in our study we used a least squares approach to estimate hydrological uncertainties without external information or comparisons with other sources which have their own unknown errors a system of equations was subsequently constructed and variance component estimation that was based upon best quadratic unbiased estimators bque was applied to error computations and data reweighting koch 1999 the approach is summarized below more details are available in fatolazadeh et al 2020 to optimally estimate the unknown parameters we define the gauss markov model as 13 a x l ε w h e r e e ε ε t j 1 q σ j 2 q j a n d e ε 0 14 x t tws hydrology sm swe cw 15 l t sm gldas sm wghm swe gldas swe wghm cw gldas cw wghm 16 a t 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0

statistical expectation operator q j is the co factor matrix of the observation sets with variance components of σ j 2 and q denotes the number of variance components tws hydrology can be written as 17 tws hydrology s m s w e c w 0 in some systems of equations the unknown parameters necessarily support certain geometric or physical conditions these special conditions are referred to as constraints between unknown parameters ghilani 2017 having an estimate of unknowns to guarantee that these conditions are fulfilled requires the imposition of this additional constraint or constraints on the system of equations or on the mathematical model here the matrix form of bx 0 provides this additional constraint for the system of equations therefore the solution of eq 13 with its residual errors vector r can be written as 18 x a t q 1 a b b t 1 a t q 1 l 19 r q 1 i a a t q 1 a b b t 1 a t q 1 where q is the co factor matrix of the observation sets with variance components of σ 2 since four types of measurements are used in the combination four variance components and cofactor matrices are defined for the stochastic part of the model 20 e ε ε t σ 1 2 q 1 σ 2 2 q 2 σ 3 2 q 3 σ 1 2 i

variance component resulting from the i 1 th iterative step errors in grace data may be due to several sources such as measurement and residual leakage errors these may be significant in some areas depending upon location and geophysical features riegger et al 2012 khaki et al 2018 assuming that tws errors originate from uncertainties in the spherical harmonics coefficients we can write 22 σ δ c 2 nm σ δ s 2 nm σ c 2 nm t 2 σ s 2 nm t 2 σ c 2 nm t 1 σ s 2 nm t 1 where σ 2 is the variance of these coefficients c nm and s nm are normalized spherical harmonic coefficients of the grace models and δ is difference between periods t 2 and t 1 the grace spherical coefficient errors in tws variations then can be expressed as 23 σ 2 δ t w s φ λ g r a c e c o e f f i c i e n t s a ρ a v e 3 ρ w 2 n 1 60 m 0 n p nm sin φ 2 2 n 1 1 k n 2 w nm 2 σ δ c nm 2 cos 2 m λ σ δ s nm 2 sin 2 m λ all of the above parameters have been defined previously finally the uncertainties that are related to gws variation can be obtained by using the error propagation law for random errors 24 σ δ g w s σ δ t w s g r a c e c o e f f i c i e n t s 2 σ δ s m 2 σ δ s w e 2 σ δ c w 2 σ δ s w b 2 3 4 validation groundwater level depth data that were acquired from 116 in situ piezometric wells were used to validate the results of gws variations that were estimated using the proposed procedure the wells that were used are located in five basins across the province of alberta i e peace athabasca churchill north saskatchewan south saskatchewan and missouri drainage basins fig 1b the limitation of using wells for validation is related primarily to their time variant nature input output relationships of the system change over time consequently the accumulated well data may not be representative at the coarse spatial resolution characterizing grace the observations in the wells that were considered are provided on a daily basis they were converted to monthly means to make them comparable with other data that were used in the study it is worth mentioning that in situ wells provide groundwater level data that must be converted to equivalent water layer thicknesses the transformation was performed using the following equation 25 δ g w s w e l l δ h w e l l s y where δ g w s w e l l is gws variation in the well and δ h w e l l is water level changes in the well s y is the specific yield i e the quantity of water that is released by an unconfined aquifer in drainage form thereby lowering the water table the ratio s y varies between 0 and 1 and is specific to a given place and type of soil material johnson 1967 its value is unknown for numerous locations in the world huang et al 2016 computed the specific yield in alberta based upon lithology and obtained values between 10 and 30 we used these values to estimate gws variations for the wells across the basins for the validation of the results that were obtained we considered various statistical metrics including the pearson product moment correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse mean bias error mbe and unbiased root mean square error unrmse 4 results 4 1 analysis of ghf filtering approach this sub section summarizes the results that were found by comparing the proposed ghf filter with previous filters gaussian han and fan filters with the intention of showing that the former performs better than the latter filters and is not region dependent results of analysis for determining the optimal radii for the use of the ghf filter are also presented 4 1 1 performance analysis fig 2 illustrates the behaviours of the zonal sectorial and tesseral spherical harmonic functions that were extracted from their legendre function formulae for the sake of illustration maximum degree and order of 8 are shown as can be seen the three harmonic components show oscillations on the latitude axis and longitude axis and in both latitudinal and longitudinal directions the anomalies show cosine and sine components in the normalized associated legendre functions grace errors vary according to both degree and order as a consequence better filters are required to handle the variations this is the main reason justifying the development of the ghf which is dependent upon the entire range of degrees and orders to illustrate this process we used fully normalized accuracy estimates associated with grace coefficients http icgem gfz potsdam de series fig 3 shows the distribution of these estimates for both sine and cosine components of grace coefficients june 2017 data are shown as an example dependency of grace errors on both degree and order is clear the sine and cosine components exhibit the same behaviour with a correlation of about r 0 99 for further analysis we produced the spectra for ghf and previous filters fig 4 shows the spectrum for ghf filter with r 0 300 k m r 1 500 k m compared to the gaussian filter with r 300 k m the han filter with r 0 300 k m r 1 500 k m and the fan filter with r 500 k m maximum degree and order 60 were considered in all cases based on the aforementioned theory section 3 1 the required filter should decrease rather than truncate the contribution of higher spherical harmonic degrees and orders in comparison to other filters the results presented in fig 4 show that the ghf filter can effectively pass higher degrees and orders and detect all of the coefficients the contribution of high degrees and orders is low as expected the gaussian filter cannot detect coefficients higher than degree and order 40 another weakness of the gaussian filter is that it provides only a constant value for a given degree regardless of order the han filter was effective in attaining the degree and order up to 50 but could not proceed beyond this threshold the fan filter can just pass lower degrees and orders 20 working with other radii for previous filters yielded worse results from the power spectrum analysis ghf filter emerges as being more efficient than the previous filters that were considered in the study we did further comparisons to assess the merits of the ghf filter for instance we computed degree variance of accumulated geoid change height error using grace monthly coefficients and the different filters the aforementioned radii and maximum degree of 60 were considered for illustrative purposes fig 5 shows results of june 2017 this period corresponds to the end of grace s lifetime we can expect maximum errors in the observations the ghf filter shows increasing geoid change height errors with increasing degree consistent with expectation however han gaussian and fan filters were overdamped in the degree of about 45 35 and 10 respectively finally geoid height change that had been obtained by applying the different filters on grace monthly coefficients was compared to the filtered ddk monthly coefficients here considered as the reference state this comparison was limited to the 12 months of the year 2010 because complete grace and ddk data were available also degrees and orders lower than 10 were excluded from the analysis to emphasize the shorter wavelength features fig 6 shows results of the pearson correlation analysis for each filter compared to ddk while table 2 summarizes the corresponding rmse values clearly the new ghf filter shows better agreement with ddk results r 0 89 rmse 0 10 compared to the previous filters indeed the performance of filters over the 12 month period could be ordered highest to lowest correlations as ghf han gauss fan a trend that was fairly consistent from month to month kendall s coefficient of concordance w 0 85 p 0 0001 where w 1 is complete agreement and w 0 is no agreement among the rankings monthly ranking among the filters was much more consistent for rmse w 0 99 p 0 0001 table 2 than for values of r fig 6 but the ordering of their performance from lowest to highest error i e fan gauss han ghf was the converse of that produced for pearson correlations these different comparative analyses bolster our confidence in applying the ghf filter 4 1 2 determination of optimal radii for the ghf filter to find the optimal damped range best set of radii for the ghf filter we computed the power spectrum with different pairs of radii r 0 r 1 where r 1 r 0 200 km 300 km 400 km or 500 km in each case the results for the zonal sectorial and tesseral components are shown in figs 7 to 10 it should be mentioned that several combinations of degrees and orders are possible for the tesseral component therefore for the purposes of illustration only degree 50 is shown here to emphasize the shortest wavelength features the ideal filter is normally a filter that has a maximum weight for the lowest degrees and orders and decreasing values towards the highest degrees and orders in other words the ideal filter preserves lower degrees and orders and decreases the contribution of the higher ones regardless of the radius combination that was used the zonal component shows maximum weight in n m 0 0 and lowest weight in n m 60 0 as it can be seen on figs 7 to 10a this translates the high performance of the ghf filter into preservation of the zonal component the situation is different when we examine the sectorial and tesseral components overdamping can be observed for radius pairings of 100 300 150 350 and 200 400 km in n m 15 15 n m 25 25 and n m 30 30 respectively fig 7b underdamping occurs at n m 15 15 for radii 300 500 and higher only the combination of radii r 0 250 km and r 1 450 km with red colour could be damped the results in figs 8 to 10b exhibit overdamping or underdamping in all cases indicating no optimal radius pair except for the combination of radii r 0 250 km and r 1 450 km which shows ideal behaviour fig 7c overdamping or underdamping occurs in the tesseral component for all other combinations figs 7 to 10c based on these different results we can conclude that the best performance by the ghf filter can be achieved for zonal sectorial and tesseral components when the radius range is r 0 250 km and r 1 450 km additional analyses were performed to confirm the selection of the optimal radius pair 250 450 km by comparing geoid height changes to filtered ddk monthly coefficients the height changes were computed using the ghf filter which was applied to grace monthly coefficients with different radius combinations 250 450 km 250 550 km 250 650 km and 250 750 km degrees and orders lower than 10 were excluded from the analysis fig 11 summarizes the results for year 2010 which has a complete available dataset the optimal radius pair that was found in the aforementioned analysis was supported by higher correlations r 0 89 with ddk coefficients compared to other radius combinations month to month ordering of radius pair performance was very consistent w 0 94 p 0 0001 with 250 450 ranking highest for its strong correlations with ddk distantly trailed by 250 550 250 750 and 250 650 with much weaker correlations fig 11 for the remainder of this research the pair of radii r 0 250 km and r 1 450 km was thus applied to the grace data to extract and analyse gws variations 4 2 estimation of gws variations results of the second objective of the research i e the reconstruction of gws variations following the proposed comprehensive procedure are summarized here results of the pre processing steps are shown first followed by those of groundwater variations 4 2 1 leakage effects as indicated in equations 8 and 9 computation of leakage error requires that mass variations which could be estimated from hydrological parameters and altimetric data be considered as a priori information fig 12 illustrates the results of anomalies of water storage variations from soil snow and canopy that were computed using gldas data fig 12a it also shows sea level anomalies for the hudson bay that were derived from altimetry data for the same period fig 12b a maximum of 0 15 m and 0 10 m were obtained for the anomalies of sm swe cw and sea level anomalies respectively the region around the hudson bay is the most significant contributor to leakage in the area therefore it was the only region that was considered in the computation of sea level anomalies overall the anomalies of surface water storage δsws δsm δswe δcw δswb in the prairie region and its surroundings vary between about 0 22 m and 0 15 m fig 12c these anomalies were then transformed to their corresponding spherical harmonic coefficients up to degree and order 60 fig 12d these coefficients were then filtered by ghf to form s o u t and s i n in equations 8 and 9 to calculate leakage out and leakage in fig 13 shows leakage out and leakage in results for june 2017 for illustrative purposes leakage in effects are more important along the margins of a region than at its centre this response could be explained simply by the fact that marginal areas are closer to the signals that originate from outside the region areas that were near to hudson bay northeast manitoba and close to the pacific ocean southwest of calgary ab exhibit the maximum leakage in effects about 0 04 m this confirms that the signal from the surrounding areas with particular climate conditions leaked into nearby regions of the prairies a maximum value of 0 02 m was found in june 2017 for leakage out toward surrounding areas this occurs along the southwest boundary of alberta overall the analysis that was performed in the research demonstrates that leakage effects exist in the study region as described in equation 7 leakage in and leakage out must be removed from grace monthly coefficients in order to compute true tws variations therefore we computed monthly averaged leakage effects which are summarized in fig 14 for each year computations could be accomplished only for eight months april to november during the remaining four months hudson bay is covered by snow and the results could be unrealistic the signals that leaked from surrounding areas into the prairies are higher than those that leaked from prairies into the adjacent regions in fig 14 these leakage effects were significant in 2005 2010 and 2011 with maximum values of 0 33 m for leakage in and 0 25 m for leakage out therefore correction of leakage from grace coefficients is recommended for the prairies region 4 2 2 hydrological data anomalies fig 15 shows monthly time series for sm swe and cw anomalies that were calculated using both gldas and wghm sm and swe appear to be the most important anomalies given that they exhibit considerable amplitude variation about 100 mm globally both models show comparable time series of sm and swe anomalies for swe the amplitude and periodicity of the time series for the two models track one another particularly closely in contrast canopy water cw anomalies do have discernible signals but very small amplitudes a range of 0 4 mm that appear out of phase between the two models compared to the other variables summation of the three parameters sm swe and cw is also shown in fig 15 gldas and wghm have very similar values except in 2005 to 2007 and 2010 to 2012 where a bias higher amplitude can be seen favouring gldas a small positive trend is visible from 2002 to 2011 subsequently followed by a less subtle decrease up to 2015 4 2 3 surface water body anomalies fig 16 shows the sea level anomalies that were computed with altimetry data for 14 lakes or rivers which were considered as representative of swb in the region the range of variation is relatively low for most of the lakes i e between 50 mm and 50 mm in a few cases the variations are marked cedar lesser slave and dunkin lakes and saskatchewan river the average of the fourteen swbs shows a range of variations between 86 mm and 59 mm with a slight pattern of smooth increase from april 2002 to june 2017 a positive trend of 0 17 mm month all swbs show a slight positive trend 0 06 mm month to 0 71 mm month except for dunkin frank and zama lakes where the trend is weak but negative 0 08 mm month to 0 60 mm month the variations of surface water bodies may be explained by numerous factors including glacial melt received precipitation evapotranspiration sedimentation and use of water for domestic and industrial needs among others 4 2 4 surface water storage sws anomalies sws anomalies can be deriving by summing of anomalies of the hydrological data δsm δswe δcw and swb anomaly see eq 10 the results are illustrated in fig 17 a overall the variations range between 100 mm and 100 mm a positive trend was observed for the period covered but the slope of line was stronger when only wghm was considered 0 27 mm month compared the weak trend displayed by gldas 0 004 mm month both models agree on the low values during the drought period 2002 2005 and a well marked positive trend from 2002 to 2006 indicating a clear improvement towards 2006 end of drought as explained in section 3 spherical harmonic coefficient models were used to estimate mass anomalies from grace gravity field measurements in the form of tws variations from the debut to the end of the grace mission 183 months viz april 2002 to june 2017 fig 17b presents the monthly time series of average tws changes across the canadian prairies that were estimated using the new ghf filter the time series show seasonal and inter annual variations with maximum storage occurring in the beginning of the winter and minimum in autumn tws variations roughly vary between 250 mm and 250 mm over the 15 year period according to fig 17b there is a steep gradual increase during the 15 years in tws variations with a trend of 2 33 mm month this increase is consistent with those values reported in the studies performed by huang et al 2016 and wang and li 2016 here a positive trend was calculated for alberta between 2002 and 2014 about 2 mm month and 1 5 mm month respectively and for the prairies between 2002 and 2014 1 5 mm month the continued increase in storage values after 2010 when δtws 0 fig 17b could be due to severe flooding that had occurred earlier on the canadian prairies the timing of this phenomenon is interesting given that it happened after 2009 when one of the driest spring and summer periods on record in over 50 years was reported in the region 44 c environment and climate change canada another steep increase occurred in 2016 this latter response may be explained by severe weather on the prairies which was marked by heavy rain and tornadoes exceeding the 30 year average 1986 2015 canada s top ten weather stories in 2016 canadian meteorological and oceanographic society url https cmos ca site top ten a 2016 the decrease in tws changes at the beginning and during mid 2015 could be linked to moisture stress in the agricultural landscape which was due to severe dryness across most of the area the considerable low value of tws changes in 2003 that was obtained with the ghf approach agrees with the results that were reported by yirdaw et al 2008 it is a consequence of the drought which was characterized by low precipitation which persisted in the region during the indicated period yirdaw et al 2008 hanesiak et al 2011 in general high peaks may be due to several factors including long rainy periods snow water equivalent or the presence of vast forested and wetland landscapes the increase that was computed for tws variations in the prairies can be linked not only to snowmelt bahrami et al 2020 but also to precipitation leading to greater soil moisture accumulation meng et al 2019 in contrast evapotranspiration that was driven by higher temperatures during dry months and glacier mass losses favour a decrease in tws variations meng et al 2019 xie et al 2018 4 2 5 groundwater storage gws anomalies monthly gws variations were computed using equations 10 and 11 section 3 fig 18 shows the resulting time series that is averaged for the whole study area for each hydrological model the beginning and end of the time series depends upon the availability of model simulated data as has been previously mentioned section 2 3 amplitudes of gws variations that were found using gldas range between 200 mm and 230 mm from 2002 to 2017 with wghm the amplitudes lie between 220 mm and 135 mm from 2002 to 2014 results that were found using the two models agree particularly well in 2002 2005 and 2007 2010 both results show a positive trend of gws changes during the study period with quite similar values same rank ordering of 2 33 mm month for gldas and 2 19 mm month for wghm the trends displayed by gws variations are very consistent with those of previous studies e g huang et al 2016 who reported a positive trend in alberta from 2002 to 2014 the discrepancy in gws variations between gldas and wghm results can be seen from 2005 to mid 2006 2010 to 2011 and mid 2013 to 2014 more precisely gldas exhibits the highest groundwater increase in the summer of 2016 and beginning of 2017 about 230 mm and the greatest depletion meaning high rate of water discharge at the beginning of the grace mission april 2002 about 200 mm other notable depletions occurred in may 2004 185 mm may 2006 167 mm and march 2010 78 mm with wghm maximum amplitudes of gws variations occur in january 2013 september 2013 and august to october 2014 with values around 130 mm the greatest depletions can be seen in april 2002 and may 2004 i e the same months and values as gldas overall there is a good agreement between gldas and wghm both in terms of the occurrence of maximum amplitude and depletion times it is worth mentioning that exact occurrence times of maximum and minimum gws variations values vary according to geographical location hydrological regime climate conditions and geological situation van der kamp and maathuis 1991 in certain years for example in 2006 2010 and 2011 results that were found using both gldas and wghm agree in terms of the co occurrence of maximum and minimum gws variations this congruence may be due to the effect of el niño southern oscillation enso on gws variations enso is a climate pattern that is specifically associated with warm surface waters of the central and eastern pacific ocean forootan et al 2016 several studies in canada have shown links between groundwater level variation and enso events coulibaly and burn 2004 fleming and quilty 2006 gan et al 2007 a rise of about 20 above the normal rate of precipitation which is directly related to gws variation has been reported for la niña years cold phase of enso a decrease of about 14 was observed for el niño warm phase of enso further work is needed to better understand the effects of these phenomena on grace derived gws variations 4 2 6 temporal decomposition of groundwater signals for further insights we applied temporal decomposition to the gws variations signals based upon eq 12 section 3 to retrieve their various components including acceleration annual trend annual amplitude semi annual amplitude annual phase and semi annual phase for illustrative purposes we only show spatial patterns of four temporal components trend acceleration annual and semi annual amplitudes using both gldas and wghm figs 19 20 however statistical values that were estimated across the study area for all components that were computed are provided in table 3 based upon figs 19 and 20 results that were found using both models show similar trend patterns in gws variations for instance the average trend that was obtained with gldas is about 21 90 mm year table 3 wghm shows a mean trend in the same positive direction but it has a higher value about 24 94 mm year generally the positive values that were observed in the canadian prairies may be explained as the consequence of tws variations recovery following severe drought between 1999 and 2003 wang et al 2015 in all cases a positive trend is observed in the northern prairies especially in northern manitoba and saskatchewan the highest trend occurs in the region surrounding hudson bay about 53 mm year with gldas 57 mm year with wghm this is response consistent with the increasing trend of precipitation in the area which was estimated at 0 2 mm month by li et al 2016 using both approaches maximum depletion was estimated to occur particularly in the southern prairies which is dominated by farming activities furthermore the dynamics of gws changes differ from one province to another alberta for example exhibits a slight positive trend except in its southern region in 2009 groundwater in this province represented only 3 of total licensed water volumes compared to 97 for surface water alberta environment information centre 2010 therefore less pressure is placed on groundwater resources in the province moreover about 23 of the population in alberta relies upon groundwater compared to 30 and 43 in manitoba and saskatchewan respectively rutherford 2004 the acceleration component of gws variations is low and similar to those reported in various previous studies ogawa et al 2011 velicogna et al 2014 eicker et al 2016 overall acceleration and annual amplitude that were estimated using wghm are about double those estimated with gldas table 3 this agrees with the findings of jin and feng 2013 who reported mean acceleration and mean annual amplitude of gws that were derived using wghm in north america and europe are larger than corresponding results from the gldas model due to differences in modelling climate and hydrology components another reason can be explained by differences in the data assimilation system that was used in the two models the observation sources and choices of data forcing differ between these models chen et al 2017 scanlon et al 2019 fatolazadeh et al 2020 using wghm the maximum annual amplitude was observed in western alberta and northern manitoba and saskatchewan about 94 mm with gldas western alberta eastern saskatchewan and most part of manitoba experienced a maximum annual amplitude of about 50 mm although semi annual amplitude was less than half of the annual amplitude that was derived using both models its spatial pattern was not the same as the annual amplitude this accords with other studies jin and feng 2013 zhou et al 2016 jin and feng 2013 further showed that this situation occurs across the world due to seasonal contributions of semi annual amplitude to the total signal of gws variations changes in the location of long term and seasonal components that are mainly oriented in a latitudinal direction have been confirmed by scanlon et al 2019 in general the results yield signals with much more variable patterns therefore differences were expected to emerge in wghm and gldas models at low frequencies of gws semi annual components the maximum and minimum annual and semi annual phase showed positive and negative values respectively which are in agreement with the findings of zhou et al 2016 more precisely the mean annual and semi annual phases that were found in our study using gldas are about 29 and 135 respectively with wghm mean annual and semi annual phases are about 18 and 91 respectively the results of both models are close to the ranges that were found by the other studies for instance jin and feng 2013 reported in their global scale study that the annual and semi annual phase over canada was from 180 to 180 respective decreases and increases of annual and semi annual phases towards the north pole 4 3 uncertainty analysis in gws variations the uncertainties that were associated to gws variations were estimated and have been summarized here first uncertainties that are related to both gldas and wghm hydrological parameters were computed using least squares estimation with reweighting by bque see section 3 3 second the errors for water levels of each of the 14 lakes in the canadian prairies σ δ s w b are available from the dahiti service third errors that are related to grace tws changes have then been computed section 3 3 finally based upon the error propagation law uncertainties in gws variations were estimated fig 21 shows the monthly time series of the absolute uncertainties for each component uncertainties vary in the range of 10 34 mm for sm 0 28 mm for swe and 0 0 2 mm for cw sm makes the greatest contribution to total water storage fig 21a given its largest proportion yin et al 2017 chen et al 2019 uncertainties may be due to the difficulty of modelling complex water circulation in regions that are characterized by seasonally frozen soil and snowmelt conditions the topography of the canadian prairies may also contribute to uncertainties in the sm component moreover differences in soil thicknesses that were used by the two different hydrological models to compute sm may introduce further uncertainties rempe 2016 the result for swe fig 21b shows that uncertainties reach their maxima at the beginning of each year due to the hydrological regime prevailing on the canadian prairies during the winter cw errors are weak fig 21c as this component appears as a negligible element in tws variations across the prairies overall uncertainties in the different components from hydrological models exhibit cyclic patterns which denotes seasonal dependence this is particularly obvious for swe and cw with the occurrence of cold and frozen conditions each year the errors that are related to swb are displayed in fig 21d they fluctuate between 2 mm and 4 mm these errors may be due to the noise that is incorporated into the geophysical corrections of altimetry data through the inclusion of tides and dynamical atmospheric correction prandi et al 2021 the errors in tws changes from grace which were computed using equations 29 and 30 section 3 3 are illustrated in fig 21e they appear to be weak 5 mm until 2014 after that period they start to increase significantly towards the end life of the twin satellite system and attain their highest values i e 13 mm based on the error propagation law eq 31 and 32 section 3 3 we calculated the corresponding errors in gws variations fig 21f shows these uncertainties over the canadian prairies for the study period the maximum errors on gws variations occurred frequently in summer time except for 2013 which is in winter season the highest error was found in summer 2006 at about 34 mm mean errors over the whole study period were calculated to be 19 mm roughly corresponding to about 10 of the maximum absolute values for gws variations in the prairies fig 18 4 4 validation of gws estimates in this section results of gws variations are compared with in situ observations that are distributed across five basins throughout alberta the results are shown for each individual basin and for the whole area encompassing the five basins the corresponding statistical metrics are reported in table 4 fig 22 compares gws variations that were obtained from our approach using both gldas and wghm to in situ well profiles first all the datasets that were compared agree in terms of the positive trend in gws from 2002 to 2017 for each individual basin and for the whole area some discrepancies can be seen between grace based estimates and in situ observations particularly in the years between 2003 and 2005 and 2010 and 2012 quantitatively there is a very good agreement between our results and in situ values as can be seen in table 4 all of the correlations that were found significantly differed from zero 95 confidence intervals the lowest correlation that was obtained is r 0 70 while the highest worst rmse is 54 mm the highest agreements occur in the basin of north saskatchewan using both gldas and wghm r 0 91 to 0 92 rmse between 32 and 37 and unrmse between 27 and 33 mm in all basins except for the south saskatchewan the use of gldas in the grace processing procedure provided better results than wghm in terms of correlations and rmse however lower unrmses are obtained with wghm in most cases meaning its results are more affected by biases as attested by the mbe values summarized in table 4 when the average of the entire area encompassing the five basins is considered the agreement between grace based estimations and in situ observations improves greatly with very similar results from gldas and wghm gldas r 0 93 unrmse 27 mm wghm r 0 91 unrmse 23 mm overall the results demonstrated that our proposed method worked well in deriving gws variations 5 discussion an important aspect of this paper was the introduction of the new ghf filter accordingly effort has been devoted to comparing ghf to several previously published filters to highlight its merits the ghf filter has been constructed as an evolutionary filter combining the advantage of gaussian han and fan filters each of these previous filters has limitations which may affect grace data processing when they are used individually for instance the gaussian filter as seen in fig 4 provides only constant values for each order of a given degree but exerts no effect on degrees higher than 44 the fan filter is not effective for degrees higher than 25 while han filter works for neither higher degree nor higher order coefficients fig 4 compared to previous filters that we considered the ghf filter shows dependency to both degree and order when the radius changes dynamically according to harmonic order and appears effective in filtering all zonal tesseral and sectorial components despite interesting results that were obtained it is important to mention that filters like the ghf can add the same weights to both signal and noise this may affect the desired balance between signal retention and noise reduction le et al 2020 the definition of the optimal radius range for the ghf filter is also important figs 7 to 10a show that the choice of radius does not affect the zonal component however this is not the case for the tesseral and sectorial components all simulations that were performed in the study indicate that the best radius range for the ghf filter is r 0 250 km and r 1 450 km outside this range overdamping or underdamping occurs to confirm the results we compared the ghf gaussian han and fan filters to the ddk filter which was considered as the reference various radius ranges were used in the comparison clearly the ghf filter showed maximum correlations with the ddk filter fig 6 and the best results were found with the radius range r 0 250 km and r 1 450 km fig 11 therefore from the different results that were obtained it can be concluded that the ghf filter provides better filtering performance compared to gaussian han and fan filters thus it was used in the comprehensive procedure that we proposed for reconstructing groundwater variations this procedure starts with the retrieval of proper tws changes from the grace data it requires different pre processing steps including leakage and surface water storage corrections based on fig 13 most signals in the marginal regions near hudson bay and pacific ocean leaked in to the area of the interest to correct for these leakage effects we used preliminary information that was derived from hydrological parameters some errors may affect this process given that hydrological parameters from both gldas and wghm models have inherent uncertainties themselves fatolazadeh et al 2020 moreover four months of each year were neglected in the computation of leakage these months correspond to the winter period that dominated by ice surfaces they are characterized by a lack of data which in turn can introduce some uncertainties fig 14 as mentioned in subsection 2 2 the considered grace dataset also has missing months data a simple linear interpolation was used in the study to fill the gaps some uncertainties may result from this simple process indeed missing data could be eventually treated in a better way by using more advanced approaches such as singular spectrum analysis independent component analysis integral equation approach or even linear regression analysis forootan et al 2020 yi and sneeuw 2021 to compute surface water storage hydrological models and satellite altimetry data were used sections 4 2 2 to 4 2 4 in terms of swe both gldas and wghm provided comparable values fig 15b they also provided comparable amplitudes for canopy water cw however with a time lag fig 15c overall cw values appear too weak 0 3 to affect total surface water storage in the region the uncertainties that are related to gldas and wghm data affect estimated surface water storage these uncertainties mostly originate from different sources including the model structures and parameters input data and the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the surface jung et al 2019 as an example there is a general lack of ground based stations monitoring soil moisture in most regions this paucity of data can cause large uncertainties in simulated sm in land surface models scanlon et al 2015 this is reflected in fig 21a where sm exhibits the highest errors about 32 mm compared to other hydrological parameters water level change in surface water bodies should also be taken into account in the computation of surface water storage satellite altimetry data were used to extract this information for major lakes and rivers in the canadian prairies fig 16 overall most of these showed a positive trend during the study period that was considered fig 16 estimation of water level changes from altimetry data may be affected by the noise introduced by the aforementioned geophysical corrections prandi et al 2021 in this study a maximum 4 mm error was found fig 21d the amplitude of tws variations is a little higher than gws changes demonstrating that gws variations were an important factor in the canadian prairies based on fig 21f the maximum gws variations error of 32 mm was found by the propagation law which takes into account errors from the different sources including hydrological models altimetry data and grace tws errors in spite of the uncertainties evaluated gws had a positive trend over the entire period fig 18 with discrepancies from 2005 to 2006 and from 2010 to 2011 figs 17a 18 the drivers of groundwater storage increase in the region may include glacier melt from surrounding areas precipitation and postglacial rebound in north america indeed it has been reported by previous studies that mass loss from glaciers across canada has increased significantly since 2000 for instance glacial meltwater contributes to base flow increase in many river basins of the prairies such as athabasca north saskatchewan bow and south saskatchewan thus influencing positively groundwater storage increase castellazzi et al 2019 bash and marshall 2014 moreover the combined effects of snowmelt processes and precipitations also contribute to increasing groundwater storage across the prairies bhanja et al 2018 postglacial rebound is another factor that may affect groundwater storage due to its effects on water flow at different time scales for instance tregoning et al 2009 computed a groundwater gain at the west of hudson bay due to the vertical uplift resulting from postglacial rebound decomposition of gws variations showed maximum amplitude of 45 mm when gldas is considered while amplitude was doubled with wghm which does not seem to be realistic figs 19 20 overall based upon fig 19 the gws trend was minimum about 20 mm year in palliser s triangle the triangle is the northernmost extension of the great american desert mcinnise 2004 it is the most arid region of the canadian prairies semi arid steppe the canada us border 49 n 115 w forms its southern boundary which extends northward beyond the city of edmonton alberta 53 5 n 113 5 w and then diagonally southeast to the manitoba north dakota border 49 n 97 9 w marchildon et al 2016 reported similar patterns for the validation of gws results in situ wells were used in five different river basins within alberta these wells have the most complete series of data corresponding to the study period as can be seen in table 4 some basins have few wells in these cases in situ well values may not be representative of the entire basin for instance only 6 wells were available for the study in that portion of the missouri basin which is located in the southern part of alberta this may eventually explain the relatively low correlations 0 74 to 0 79 and high rmse 47 mm that were associated with the estimated gws in this basin compared to the other basins for all of the individual basins validation showed statistically significant correlations p 10 4 and low errors the results are much improved when averaged for the five basins error 30 mm for both gldas and wghm compared to the metrics that were reported in previous studies in the region huang et al 2016 bhanja et al 2018 we found much better values in gws validation that were estimated by our approach despite the interesting metrics that were obtained it is worth mentioning that the validation of grace based estimates using in situ measurements remains a challenge where more effort is still necessary the spatial and temporal representativeness of in situ well data is a potential source of errors due to the scale mismatch between satellite and ground based observations in addition specific yield storativity may be different for each well location and could introduce uncertainties higher and lower specific yield values can be found in regions that are covered by dry soils black dark and brown soils and wet areas respectively including regosolic organic and brunisolic intermediate values are expected in regions with moist grey and dark grey soils johnson 1967 including vertisolic luvisolic and chernozemic the 116 in situ unconfined wells that were used in the validation process of this study are scattered over different soil conditions throughout the five basins that were considered in alberta based on canadian soil classification orders 80 of the alberta covered by chernozemic basin 1 luvisolic basins 1 2 and 3 and vertisolic basins 4 and 5 about 15 of this province covered by regosolic basins 1 and 4 and organic basins 1 and 2 a small region of alberta about 5 covered by brunisolic basins 1a 2 and 4 therefore potential errors that are due to specific yield may be possible here 6 conclusion in this study a comprehensive approach was proposed and employed to retrieve gws changes using data from grace satellite hydrological models and altimetry water level changes for a period spanning april 2002 to june 2017 across the canadian prairies a new ghf filter was introduced and applied to refine the estimation of tws changes and gws changes the ghf with the radius range of r 0 250 km and r 1 450 km performed well compared to previous filters soil moisture was the dominant contributor to tws anomalies in the prairies with a range of 85 mm to 85 mm while canopy water makes a relatively negligible contribution 0 2 mm to 0 3 mm soil moisture also exhibited the greatest uncertainties the contribution that is made by snow water equivalent 20 mm to 80 mm is very important in the prairies even if it is less than that of soil moisture the average sea level anomaly from 14 major water bodies in the prairies showed a very weak positive trend with uncertainties 2 mm after 2010 according to the results that were found it is worth applying leakage corrections to grace data in the study region following the comprehensive procedure that was proposed the amplitudes of the retrieved monthly gws variations covered a range varying from about 200 mm to 230 mm with a mean uncertainty of about 19 mm about 10 error temporal decomposition of gws variations signals showed a positive trend of gws changes in the northern part of with the canadian prairies about 45 mm and a negative trend in the southern part especially in manitoba 15 mm overall improved correlations were found between grace based groundwater estimates and in situ observations in the southern part of the study area r 0 80 which is covered by mountains grassland and parkland compared to the northern part 0 75 which is dominated by boreal forest and wetlands overall the metrics that were estimated during the validation process demonstrate the strong potential of the proposed comprehensive approach for gws variations estimation regardless of the hydrological model system gldas whghm that was used forthcoming studies will focus on further evaluation of the ghf

3838,the modeling of seasonal ground ice sgi freeze thaw a common feature in boreal peatlands has often been completed using a unidirectional approach where melting is driven by energy inputs from the surface however bi directional melt is known to occur and can potentially increase the spring melt rate accurate modelling of the timing of ice free conditions in peatlands is important because sgi can impede spring infiltration and lead to substantial spring snowmelt runoff from peatlands however when modelling melt only from above erroneous results in the model estimation of ice free conditions can occur which can lead to knock on effects for modelling peatland hydrological function furthermore as the climate warms it is unclear how this role of sgi may change in the future this study used the stefan equation to model unidirectional and bi directional melt to assess which performed better in modelling the timing of ice free conditions compared to observed values bi 3 9 2 1 days uni 9 0 4 7 including bi directional melt improved model performance by reducing this difference by approximately 5 days model performance for sgi freeze thaw cycles were similar with bi being slightly more accurate in freezing rmse 2 7 cm versus 3 3 cm and melting rmse 2 6 cm vs 3 7 cm compared to the unidirectional approach while the model improvement in the timing of ice free conditions was substantial careful consideration is needed in determining when a peatland is functionally ice free in future modelling studies the stefan equation was found to be most sensitive to changes in soil moisture compared to ground surface temperature and peat porosity likely due to the relationship between thermal conductivity and frozen and liquid water content comparisons with future climate change projections suggest that the timing of ice free conditions could shift by as much as 2 weeks earlier in the 2050 s and by almost a month earlier in the 2080 s however the timing of snowfall and rain on snow events continues to be a source of model uncertainty future studies should work to investigate the potential positive feedbacks this could create in conclusion the stefan equation presents a relatively easy path for incorporating bi directional melt into peatland models this process should be included in peatland ecohydrological models in order to properly model the timing of melt and ice free conditions keywords peatlands seasonal ground ice stefan equation freeze thaw western boreal plain 1 introduction seasonal ground ice sgi is a common feature in boreal peatlands e g

from 15 to 90 cm in thickness e g kingsbury moore 1987 smerdon mendoza 2010 van huizen et al 2019 this near surface ice impedes water infiltration and drastically reduces the peatland subsurface water storage capacity price fitzgibbon 1987 during the subsequent spring snowmelt can quickly exceed the limited storage capacity causing extensive spring flooding and large snowmelt losses from the peatland bowling et al 2003 woo 2012 this results in the peatland acting as a source of water within the western boreal plain wbp landscape thompson et al 2015 once the sgi has melted here referring to the complete phase change of sgi completely or at least to a depth where its influence is negligible thompson et al 2015 van huizen et al 2019 infiltration can readily occur filling the peatland

their persistence hwang et al 2018 in the dry wbp climate integrating peatlands and their ecohydrological dynamics into larger scale climate models has received renewed focus helbig et al 2020 wania et al 2009 wu et al 2016 owing to the impact peatland carbon and water fluxes have on climatic feedbacks drever et al 2020 gorham 1991 hayward clymo 1982 waddington et al 2015 and their wide spatial coverage xu et al 2018 as the climate changes boreal peatland ecosystem function has been repeatedly highlighted as at risk of shifting helbig et al 2020 tarnocai 2009 vaughan et al 2013 waddington et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 due in part to the longer growing season brought on by a shorter duration of below freezing air temperatures bush lemmen 2019 therefore properly accounting for the freezing and melting of sgi in boreal peatlands will provide insight as to how climate change may impact these northern ecosystems when modelling peatland ecohydrology ensuring that sgi freeze melt is accurately represented in peatland models allows for robust predictions in both peatland carbon and water fluxes not properly accounting for the unique role of sgi in peatlands can lead to erroneous estimation of surface runoff connon et al 2015 and dissolved organic carbon concentrations davidson et al 2019 dyson et al 2011 this is of particular importance given that the duration and timing of sgi melt is projected to diminish under a warming climate thompson et al 2015 the modelling of frozen ground has been studied extensively over the years lamontagne hallé et al 2020 with models ranging

et al 2017 patankar et al 2015 sutton price 2020 as such it is important to know the extent of sgi formation specifically the depth to which sgi forms and during melt the depth below the surface which dictates the peatland water storage capacity during the spring depth of freezing and melting can be modelled using the stefan equation lunardini 1981 which provides a relatively simple approach to modelling one dimensional freeze and melt in one top down krogh et al 2017 xie gough 2013 and two directions top down bottom up woo et al 2004 xie gough 2013 while there have been extensive studies

underlain by permafrost e g krogh et al 2017 zhang et al 2008 yet a large proportion of boreal peatlands are not underlain by permafrost tarnocai 2009 in such systems groundwater flow can still occur even while the peatland is frozen price fitzgibbon 1987 and melting during the spring can occur both from above and below kingsbury moore 1987 reported a higher melt rate from below 4 1 mm day

accurately model peatland sgi to understand how high latitude ecosystems may respond to warming understanding how the timing of ice free conditions may change under a warming climate can help mitigate some of the uncertainty of how the spring freshet may change thompson et al 2015 2017 however not every peatland is the same nor are peatlands internally homogeneous hydrophysical properties that determine water storage capacity such as porosity can vary with depth petrone et al 2008a petrone et al 2008b van huizen et al 2019 wells et al 2017 and peat parent vegetation goetz price 2015 mccarter price 2014 and subsequently between boreal peatlands redding devito 2005 along with precipitation patterns differences in porosity and water retention capacity will lead to differences in the absolute amount of antecedent soil moisture at the time of freezing this quantity of moisture has a critical impact on the magnitude of ice formation over the winter due to the complex relationships between the volumetric heat capacity of water as it changes from liquid to solid and subsequent changes in thermal conductivity hayashi et al 2007 oke 1987 for the peat matrix ireson et al 2013 the depth and volume of sgi formation will dictate the infiltrability of the peat soil following spring further it is important to not only accurately model freeze melt in a peatland but also to assess how hydrophysical properties and soil moisture may impact freezing this will contribute to a better understanding of how the behaviour of sgi in boreal peatlands may change as the climate continues to warm and what impact that will have on the spring freshet and the ecohydrological role of boreal peatlands therefore the objectives of this study are to 1 quantify the difference in the timing of ice free conditions when modelling sgi melt with a unidirectional versus a bi directional melt approach and assess the goodness of fit with both approaches 2 conduct a sensitivity analysis on the model to better understand how freeze thaw cycle progresses under different soil moisture regimes and hydrophysical properties in peatlands 2 methods 2 1 study area data used for this study were obtained at

equal to porosity and ρl is the density of water ice 997 kg m3 to employ a bi directional melt routine this equation was run separately for both the 2 cm assumed surface ground temperature tempsurface and the 50 cm ground temperature tempbelow see figure a6 in the appendix to calculate two independent melting indices where tempbelow is referring to the temperature driving melt from below the position of the 0 degree isotherm was determined first with the melting index calculated from tempsurface and then any upward thaw upward shift in 0 degree isotherm driven by tempbelow was subtracted however during freezing a simplifying assumption was employed whereby it was assumed that if tempsurface tempbelow then melting from below was considered negligible and ignored thus bidirectional melting was implemented primarily during the spring thaw and any brief mid winter periods when the surface temperature increased above freezing k was calculated using the following equation as outlined by farouki 1981 2 k a k a f a using the individual thermal conductivities as listed in woo xia 1996 for peat moss 0 25 w m c air 0 025 w m c water 0 57 w m c and ice 2 20 w m c where a refers to each soil component ka refers to each component thermal conductivity and f refers to the fractional proportion of each component the ω was assumed to be equal to porosity for this particular peatland the average porosity for the top 50 cm was determined to be 0 96 van huizen et al 2019 due to data gaps in measured soil moisture 7 5 cm below ground surface at the time of freeze up the logged daily volumetric moisture content vmc was not used and saturated conditions were assumed for the base model run i e vmc porosity for both bi directional and unidirectional modelling approaches vmc was also assumed constant for the duration of each model run this assumption was deemed to be adequate because varying soil moisture during the growing season does not impact the freeze melt status rather it is the soil moisture prior to freeze up that is important furthermore the site generally experiences high soil moisture close to or at saturation prior to freezing van huizen et al 2019 during the freezing process frozen soil layers were assumed to have a residual liquid vmc of 0 15 nagare et al 2012 show for the peat soil used in their study 3 model performance sensitivity and statistical analysis model performance was assessed by comparing modelled freezing and melting depths to observed values and calculating the root mean square error rmse mean average error mae and the relative time domain error rtde for rmse and mae the smaller the value the better the performance for the rtde a value 1 indicates good model performance woo et al 2004 to conduct the sensitivity analysis soil moisture ground surface temperature and peat porosity were all altered altering each of these provides insight into both potential climate change impacts soil moisture and ground surface temperature and variation in peatland hydrophysical properties soil moisture and porosity each model run was completed using r statistical software r core team 2020 to conduct the temperature sensitivity analysis the average monthly ground temperature c measured at 2 cm was calculated for each month across all years that ground temperature was recorded october 29 2012 july 24 2019 for each temperature scenario a percentage starting at 10 and increasing to 70 of each of monthly average was added to each daily average ground temperature as measured by tempsurface while holding porosity at 0 96 and saturation at 1 the 10 70 range used kept the adjusted temperatures within the expected range of temperature data under the different climate change scenarios used in thompson et al 2017 for the soil moisture scenarios vmc was decreased by 10 each scenario up to 50 for the different porosity scenarios the model was run with peat porosity values of 0 96 0 9 0 85 and 0 8 while saturation was assumed to be 1 and the ground temperature was set to the observed values the effects of vmc and porosity are likely to be similar owing to the control of porosity has on the total volume of water present in the soil however they were both included because vmc elucidates the role of changing water content while porosity elucidates the role of changing peat physical structure on the formation of ice sensitivity was determined by comparing percentage change in maximum frost depth from the base model run and conducting a multiple linear regression to assess the most influential variable to maximum frost depth to assess the impact of climate on timing of ice free conditions average ground temperatures for the month of may when the snow has already melted and when ice free conditions typically occur were compared to modelled mean ground temperature in the month of may under 13 different climate scenarios which were run from 2011 to 2090 for a detailed overview of these scenarios we refer the reader to thompson et al 2017 an overview of how modelled ground temperatures were calculated can be found in appendix a 4 results 4 1 freezing melting depth model performance the results from both the unidirectional approach uni where melt came from the top down and a bidirectional approach bi where melting occurred from above and below are shown below in fig 2 hashed lines represent the modeled and solid lines represent the observed data in general there is good agreement between modeled and observed freezing depth for both uni and bi with bi having a slightly better root mean square error rmse based on all years 5 3 cm compared to uni rmse 7 6 cm some years appear to have a better fit than others 2012 2013 vs 2016 2017 in fig 2 however in general rmse mean average error mae and relative time domain error rtde were very similar for freezing depth under both modelling approaches table 1 but the bi directional approach did show a slightly better fit overall r2 of 0 80 compared to uni r2 of 0 65 fig 3 while overall fit did not appear to vary much between bi and uni accurate modelling of bi directional melt and estimation of the timing of ice free conditions did improve table 1 this is evident in the model years of 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 substantial melting from below can be seen in the observed data decreasing depth of the freezing depth with time during april and may uni model runs do not capture this and ice free conditions are dependent on the melting front meeting the freezing front at much deeper depths bi model runs do capture this bidirectional melt where a clear decrease in the freezing front occurs approximately in line with the observed decline using the bi model improved the average estimation of ice free conditions by just under a week absolute difference of 5 1 days there was a similar model performance for melting depth orange lines fig 2 bi scenarios performed slightly better rmse 2 7 cm compared to the uni scenario in rmse 2 7 cm vs 4 2 cm and mae 1 8 cm vs 2 3 cm however the r2 were much lower bi 0 26 uni 0 10 compared to the modelled freezing depths due to difference in the observed ground surface temperature being measured at 2 cm 4 2 model sensitivity to porosity soil moisture and ground surface temperature the results from the sensitivity analysis fig 4 a b c showed that all three parameters play a significant role in controlling the depth of freezing the multiple linear regression showed that all three coefficients are significant p value 0 05 appendix a while each parameter was significant there were differences in the parameters relative impact on freezing depth changes in the variables were meant to reflect potential changes that could be seen in the field therefore for an expected range in vmc there were bigger changes in max freezing depth compared to reasonable changes in porosity this is shown clearly in fig 5 center panel where a decline in soil moisture up to 50 resulted in a decline of 66 in maximum ice depth this was double the 70 ground surface temperature scenario which resulted in a decline of 30 porosity appeared to have the smallest impact where a porosity of 0 8 only led to a 14 decline in maximum ice depth 4 3 sensitivity to a warming climate fig 6 illustrates the average difference in the day of year for the timing of ice free conditions melt and freeze up for each temperature scenario warmer ground surface temperatures lead to later starts for ice freeze up from 1 day earlier to as much as 30 days fig 6c this corresponds to a potential shift in the initiation of freezing conditions by as much as a month where freeze up typically began in november under base model conditions this shifted to early december under the warmest scenario 70 conversely the timing of melt shifted from 1 day earlier up to 25 days earlier on average fig 6b meaning a shift in the beginning of melt from may to the beginning of april consequently there is a shift in the timing of ice free conditions ranging from on average 2 to 18 days earlier fig 6 c of note is a consistent shift in the earlier later timing of melt freeze up and ice free conditions that occurs between the 30 and 40 temperature scenarios which coincide with the largest increase in the average number of days where ground temperatures are greater than 0 c appendix figure a5 between 30 and 40 the average increases by 12 days compared to the average increases between the other temperature scenarios which are 8 days these results indicate that a large shift in the modelling of frozen conditions is occurring between the 30 and 40 modelling scenario to contextualize these results within a changing climate the mean 2 cm temperature representing the ground surface temperature for the month of may for each temperature sensitivity analysis run was plotted against the average modelled ground surface temperature for the month of may under a warming climate in the western boreal plains thompson et al 2017 except for the 10 and 70 runs each sensitivity run falls within the range of one of the climate change scenarios horizontal dashed lines these results suggest that by the end of the 2020 s there could be a shift in the timing of ice free conditions by approximately 3 5 days by the 2050 s this increases to approximately 17 days and by the 2080 s the timing of ice free conditions may shift by as much as a month earlier i e may to april 5 discussion 5 1 model performance and the need for bi directional melt incorporating bi directional melt led to marginal increases in model performance when assessing freezing depth this could be due to the relative importance of melting from below in fig 2 the observed freezing depth solid blue line shows that bi directional melt is not always an important process while there is clear melting from below occurring in the 2014 2015 2015 2016 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 ice seasons it is less clear if there is any significant melting from below in the 2012 2013 2013 2014 and 2016 2017 for melting from below to occur enough energy needs to be supplied to the bottom of the ice layer from the warmer groundwater to overcome the rate of energy loss from the freezing front up the ice to the surface mohammed et al 2018 the high thermal conductivity of the ice dominated peat matrix 1 6 w m c while frozen 0 55 w m c while unfrozen in our study means that melting from below is unlikely to occur during the winter where steep energy gradients between the ground surface and the cooler air above mean that the ground is losing energy of course with a snowpack present maintaining the ground surface at near freezing temperatures friesen et al 2021 it is possible these energy gradients could reverse allowing for some melting from below to occur during the winter there are some periods fig 2 where melting from below is possibly occurring during the winter months dec march in each of the years however it is difficult to determine what is actual melt from below and what might be noise introduced by the thermocouple on a daily time scale similar model performance between bi and uni may also be due to significant bi directional melt not occurring until the spring melt season which on average is a relatively short time frame average 15 1 days compared to the length of the entire ice season average 181 8 days indeed when analyzing model fit for just the spring season the difference in uni and bi model runs stays similar to the model fit for the entire season see table 1 as both uni and bi have improved model fit during the spring bi r2 0 80 rmse 0 054 m mae 0 035 cm uni r2 0 67 rmse 0 077 m mae 0 048 m compared to the model fit for the entire season table 1 therefore both models can accurately simulate freezing depth for most of the winter months and it is only when melting from below is occurring that the two models begin to deviate in their performance model fit of freezing depth for both the bi and uni models were consistent with similar studies that used the stefan equation woo et al 2004 reported an rtde of 0 55 and 0 19 for uni and bi respectively table 1 however their wet tundra site had relatively low peat porosity 0 8 for the top 20 cm compared to pauciflora 0 96 while our uni model run rtde was similar to woo et al 2004 our model performance did not exhibit as big an improvement in rtde between both model run approaches it is possible these differences could be due to the single soil layer for the model that was employed in our study compared to the multi layered soil used in theirs while it does not occur consistently in every year there does appear to be a general deviation between the modelled and observed data that occurs in the 15 20 cm depth below surface see fig 2 2013 2014 2014 2015 2017 2018 the average porosity value of 0 96 is less representative of the lower 20 cm of the 0 50 cm model domain another possible reason is because the stefan equation assumes that the sensible heat required to change the ground temperature is negligible kurylyk hayashi 2016 although the favourable model performance suggests that this impact is relatively small finally it is also possible that woo et al 2004 found a greater improvement in model fit because there was more bi directional melt occurring at their more northern location 69 08 n 148 51 w although for that to occur there would need to be talik development to provide a thawed layer devoie connon 2019 beneath the frozen layer similar model performance was also shown when comparing to peatlands in other permafrost environments xie gough 2013 showed that the stefan equation produced a model error of 5 10 cm while krough et al 2017 report a model difference of 4 cm for summer melt depth although the model performance was poorer for freezing depth difference of 15 cm while evaluating several different freeze thaw algorithms zhang et al 2008 found a model error of 12 14 cm for a permafrost peatland when using a bi directional stefan s equation however they also concluded that unless the original assumptions of the stefan s equation are met i e wet homogenous soil conditions that the stefan s equation is not suitable compared to using more computationally intensive numerical models for peatlands though wet homogenous soil conditions are generally present these results suggest that the stefan equation is a suitable and simple model for estimating the general trends of freezing depth in boreal peatlands furthermore with climate change leading to talik development connon et al 2018 the prevalence of bi directional melt in the active layer of permafrost peatlands may become more important the relative ease with which to measure the surface temperature in a peatland also means establishing the driving data for the equation is less intensive compared to other approaches such as the n factor kurylyk watanabe 2013 where the bi model run outperformed the uni model run is specifically the timing of ice free conditions 3 9 vs 9 days almost a weeklong discrepancy in the timing of ice free conditions can lead to erroneous model results for example if a model shows that the ground is still frozen despite being unfrozen in reality and a large precipitation event occurs there will likely be significant runoff when compared to observed data of course there are ways of mitigating this by modelling infiltration into frozen soils e g granger et al 1984 gray et al 2001 hayashi 2013 mohammed et al 2018 however many of these approaches rely on the assumption that unfrozen unsaturated macropores are present in the soil allowing for preferential flow paths while this is likely to be true in mineral soils preferential flow is less likely to occur in peatlands especially when there are high antecedent moisture conditions prior to freezing rather as the sgi melts away large unfrozen areas form within the peatland allowing for infiltration barring a spatially distributed freeze thaw model it is important to have a representative approximation of the frozen status of a peatland consequently when modelling frozen peatlands it is likely more important to capture the timing of ice free conditions rather than some intermediate state bi directional melt can enhance the spring melt which is due not only to the relatively warmer groundwater underneath but as the sgi melts it begins to form holes van huizen et al 2019 these holes increase the surface area of the sgi exposing more of it to warmer air temperatures from above but also likely inducing lateral melting as the sgi becomes fully surrounded by an unfrozen saturated peat matrix lateral melting has been suggested as being more important when thicker ice is present where the vertical heat inputs are not sufficient to melt all of the ice present kurylyk et al 2016 in kurylyk et al 2016 their permafrost was reported to be 9 m 3 m the frozen layer at pauciflora was between 30 and 40 cm much thinner compared to the 900 cm reported above suggesting that the relatively thinner ice at pauciflora could be melted primarily from vertical energy inputs the generally good agreement between observed and modelled values fig 2 table 1 suggests that lateral melt is likely less influential for the thinner sgi found at pauciflora this study took place in a poor fen where groundwater inputs from the surrounding hillslopes occur quite regularly there is uncertainty if bi directional melt is as important in a bog where groundwater inputs from adjacent mineral uplands do not occur however there is lateral groundwater movement that can occur within a bog especially if there is a dome present mckenzie et al 2007a while warmer pulses of groundwater from upward hydraulic gradients may not occur this internal horizontal flow of water may enhance bi directional melt due to the dependence on precipitation for water a bog could experience water table decline over the winter this can lead to a decoupling between the water table and sgi layer further limiting melting from below decoupling of the sgi and water table could also occur due to frost heave moore 1987 future work is needed to characterize the differences between sgi freeze thaw in bogs and fens 5 2 model sensitivity what is the most important to parameterize accurately results fig 6 and appendix a table 1 demonstrate that vmc was the most significant controlling factor on freezing depth which can be attributed to the thermal conductivity of water when it is in a frozen 2 2 w m c and liquid state 0 57 w m c when saturated and frozen the bulk soil thermal conductivity was greater by a factor of 2 1 65 w m c compared to unfrozen 0 55 w m c a difference of 1 1 w m c this shift in thermal conductivity which controls the rate at which energy is transferred upwards from the freezing front through the soil during freezing is what causes freezing depth to be most sensitive to soil moisture as such when modelling freeze thaw in peatlands it is important to accurately measure soil moisture prior to freezing for our study soil moisture was not directly measured however pauciflora is a relatively wet site owed to its local climate wells et al 2017 and given the good base model performance rmse 5 4 cm our assumption of saturated conditions prior to freezing appears to be reasonable this presents a challenge for using field based data for modelling peatlands though as there is uncertainty around the accuracy of typical soil moisture measurement methods during frozen conditions and pressure transducers for logging water table measurements seldom function properly under freezing conditions for the purposes of this modelling experiment once freezing was initiated the amount of soil moisture present in the top 50 cm of the peat column was not allowed to change only the relative proportions of liquid and frozen water changed i e moisture migration was not explicitly modelled upward vapor flux in a frozen soil has been shown to vary from 1 to 30 mm winter season santeford 1978 woo 1982 in peatlands while kingsbury moore 1987 suggested it as a possible mechanism for the development of a partially dehydrated frozen peat layer at depth however for pauciflora given the likelihood of saturated conditions prior to freeze up and the presence of sgi at the surface prior to spring melt it is assumed that moisture migration had a negligible impact on the freezing characteristics in this study once a portion of the soil was frozen it was assumed that a small amount of liquid vmc 15 remained nagare et al 2012 adsorbed to the peat fibres farouki 1981 this unfrozen water content can also vary depending on the soil type and subsurface temperature however based on the typical ranges of liquid vmc in a frozen soil 0 01 0 3 ireson et al 2013 the thermal conductivity range is likely to be relatively small 0 64 w m c in the highly porous upper soil layers ground surface temperature had the second biggest impact on freezing depth after vmc its relatively lower impact compared to vmc is likely because ground surface temperature is more important for initiating the freezing conditions while vmc due to its disproportionate impact on thermal conductivity has a bigger influence over freezing depth changes in porosity had the smallest impact on freezing depth due to the small range of porosity values used in the sensitivity analysis 0 8 0 98 for the modelled soil layer this range is representative of the top 50 cm of the moss and peat in most peatlands typical freezing depths extend from the first few cm to 50 cm depth which can however cover a range of porosities for pauciflora the highly fibric moss and peat extended down through the top 50 cm however based on the sensitivity results freezing rates could vary likely slowing with depth as a lower porosity means a lower water holding capacity under saturated conditions and subsequently lower thermal conductivity of course less porous peat soil does not necessarily mean shallower freezing depths water has a high heat capacity 4 180 mj m3c meaning less water present in the soil means less energy is needed to increase or decrease the temperature above below the freezing point if a highly porous peat soil has a lower vmc prior to freeze up then more air will be present at the time of freezing this can lower the thermal conductivity leading to potentially shallow freezing yet the decrease in heat capacity could also lead to more rapid ground surface temperature swings however with the presence of a snowpack it is likely these rapid changes occur over a short period at the beginning of the winter as the snowpack likely insulates the ground from any further rapid ground surface temperature changes kingsbury moore 1987 furthermore the model used here does not account for heat capacity and our model domain treats the soil as one layer making the modelling of a discrete layer of saturated unfrozen peat over frozen saturated peat difficult to assess however results from wright et al 2009 would seem to suggest that the heat capacity of unfrozen water might not be as important as its higher thermal conductivity during the spring thaw where unfrozen liquid water in the peat matrix above the frozen layer led to faster melt rates this is also likely due to the lower heat capacity 1 9 mj m3c of ice in the winter this could mean that freezing rates are initially slower under saturated conditions and it is not until enough ice forms increasing the thermal conductivity that ice formation can speed up another complicating factor is that if there are unsaturated conditions prior to sgi formation moisture migration or early winter snowmelt could fill up the remaining storage capacity appels et al 2018 redding devito 2011 woo heron 1981 leading to saturated conditions as freezing begins the probability of this occurring will likely increase as well with more frequent mid winter departures above the freezing point over the growing season finally the zero curtain effect outcalt et al 1990 has been shown to delay temperatures rising above the freezing mark in peatlands during the spring mckenzie et al 2007a where the peat soil can be iso thermal for up to a month or more during the spring thaw while there was some evidence of iso thermal soil conditions in the top 20 cm at pauciflora this typically coincided with a ripening snowpack meaning the peatland surface was predominantly covered by snow ground thaw and melting of sgi typically does not occur until the snow has disappeared this likely means the zero curtain effect had little impact on the melt rates and timing of ice free conditions at pauciflora 5 2 implications for a shifting sgi regime in boreal peatlands the results from the climate sensitivity analysis show a clear shift towards earlier ice free conditions figs 6 7 by 2030 the apparent threshold response between the 30 and 40 sensitivity runs may occur resulting in a shift of ice free conditions by approximately a week on average and up to two weeks by the end of the century ice free conditions could occur up to a month earlier these results are generally in line with climate predictions for the boreal forest which suggest warmer air temperatures and earlier onset of spring conditions buermann et al 2013 debeer et al 2020 price et al 2013 these may be conservative estimates of the timing of ice free conditions though as the sensitivity analysis did not account for shifts in precipitation patterns or increased rain on snow events the latter of which is expected to increase zhang et al 2019 an increase in rain on snow events could enhance melting as precipitation provides additional heat inputs both into the snow pack and any exposed ground woo xia 1996 potentially leading to even earlier melt compared to the results of the climate sensitivity analysis in addition to uncertainty in the estimates due to precipitation soil moisture conditions are expected to be drier for the boreal forest wang et al 2014 due to the increase in air temperatures longer growing season and subsequently higher evapotranspiration rates helbig et al 2020 it is possible that sgi freezing depth may increase as the depth is strongly controlled by snowpack thickness friesen et al 2021 iwata et al 2010 although this effect could be mitigated by lower antecedent moisture conditions prior to freeze up our sensitivity analysis implicitly assumes that the timing of snowfall stays the same for each model run as precipitation regimes shift it is possible that there could be slight increases in freezing depth in the short term under a warming climate bi directional melt may also increase in the warmer scenarios there was an increase in the number of freeze thaw events data not shown where melting from below became more frequent as there were more days where the surface temperature was above 0 c this highlights the potential importance of characterizing melt from below when modelling freeze thaw in future model studies interesting to note however is that while shifts in soil moisture resulted in different freezing depths timing of ice free conditions did not change this is likely due to the proportional changes in thermal conductivity associated with changes in vmc appendix a4 where there is less ice to melt energy transfer is less efficient and there is a lower melt rate it is possible with this scenario of decreased melt rates that spring evapotranspiration rates could increase as less energy is allocated to melting ice and could increase potential evaporation rates van huizen et al 2019 this may also lead to more desiccation as a slower melt rate could be outpaced by evapotranspiration rates moore 1987 this increased drying may increase fire risk for peatlands due to a decrease in the near surface soil moisture of the upper moss layer shetler et al 2008 however this increased fire risk may also depend on the relative proportion of hummocks and hollows that form in peatlands as hummocks are typically thought to be more resistant to burning owing to their capacity to maintain higher water content during droughts thompson waddington 2013 also sgi can melt at different rates across a peatland van huizen petrone 2020 while van huizen petrone 2020 showed that these spatial differences were quite small it is possible that evaporation rates could outpace melt rates in one area of the peatland compared to another a similar pattern to the vmc and the timing of ice free conditions is seen with porosity as well where the timing of melt and ice free conditions stays the same despite the changes in the amount of ice that formed this suggests that despite potential differences in upper level soil porosities between bogs and fens any differences in freeze thaw conditions between peatlands will be largely climate driven these similarities in the timing of ice free conditions despite differences in porosity and vmc imply that the thickness of ice i e the amount of ice that forms while consequential for the spring surface energy balance e g van huizen petrone 2020 may not be as integral when modelling the timing of ice free conditions as for the role of sgi in boreal peatlands the thinning of sgi combined with the earlier timing of ice free conditions suggests that boreal peatlands may become less reliable sources of water on the landscape particularly during the spring freshet or at the very least there will be increased variability in the magnitude of the spring freshet 6 conclusions this work builds upon the conclusions of woo et al 2004 which demonstrated that including bi directional melt in peatland hydrological models is important to ensure proper modelling of the timing of ice free conditions using the stefan equation to achieve this provides a relatively simple model that should be easily integrated into soil vegetationatmosphere transfer svat models however more work is needed to better understand if there are any differences in sgi freeze melt cycles between peatland types and if its relative impact on the spring freshet may change with hydrogeomorphic setting of the peatland furthermore this work highlights the importance of conceptualizing what is to be considered as ice free when modelling peatland freeze thaw does it occur when all the ice is gone or is there a functional definition for ice free where the impact of sgi on infiltration and other hydrological processes is negligible despite the presence of some sgi finally as the climate warms the timing of ice free conditions will shift earlier in the season by as much as 1 month earlier by the end of century this could mean that a peatlands role in the landscape may change spring discharge may become more variable especially for headwater catchments and less water could leave these peatlands during the spring in addition to shifts in the peatlands hydrological role within the landscape a reduction in sgi may result in an increased shift in peatland vulnerability to spring fires where increased desiccation due to slower melt rates combined with increased evaporation rates could lead to higher water losses from the living moss layer future research is needed to investigate this potential positive feedback that could increase peatland fire risk and subsequent carbon losses credit authorship contribution statement brandon van huizen conceptualization methodology data

3838,the modeling of seasonal ground ice sgi freeze thaw a common feature in boreal peatlands has often been completed using a unidirectional approach where melting is driven by energy inputs from the surface however bi directional melt is known to occur and can potentially increase the spring melt rate accurate modelling of the timing of ice free conditions in peatlands is important because sgi can impede spring infiltration and lead to substantial spring snowmelt runoff from peatlands however when modelling melt only from above erroneous results in the model estimation of ice free conditions can occur which can lead to knock on effects for modelling peatland hydrological function furthermore as the climate warms it is unclear how this role of sgi may change in the future this study used the stefan equation to model unidirectional and bi directional melt to assess which performed better in modelling the timing of ice free conditions compared to observed values bi 3 9 2 1 days uni 9 0 4 7 including bi directional melt improved model performance by reducing this difference by approximately 5 days model performance for sgi freeze thaw cycles were similar with bi being slightly more accurate in freezing rmse 2 7 cm versus 3 3 cm and melting rmse 2 6 cm vs 3 7 cm compared to the unidirectional approach while the model improvement in the timing of ice free conditions was substantial careful consideration is needed in determining when a peatland is functionally ice free in future modelling studies the stefan equation was found to be most sensitive to changes in soil moisture compared to ground surface temperature and peat porosity likely due to the relationship between thermal conductivity and frozen and liquid water content comparisons with future climate change projections suggest that the timing of ice free conditions could shift by as much as 2 weeks earlier in the 2050 s and by almost a month earlier in the 2080 s however the timing of snowfall and rain on snow events continues to be a source of model uncertainty future studies should work to investigate the potential positive feedbacks this could create in conclusion the stefan equation presents a relatively easy path for incorporating bi directional melt into peatland models this process should be included in peatland ecohydrological models in order to properly model the timing of

adjacent upland forests in undisturbed elmes price 2019 thompson et al 2015 and fire disturbed landscapes depante et al 2019 and convey water to downstream wetlands wells et al 2017 contributing to their persistence hwang et al 2018 in the dry wbp climate integrating peatlands and their ecohydrological dynamics into larger scale climate models has received renewed focus helbig et al 2020 wania et al 2009 wu et al 2016 owing to the impact peatland carbon and water fluxes have on climatic feedbacks drever et al 2020 gorham 1991 hayward clymo 1982 waddington et al 2015 and their wide spatial coverage xu et al 2018 as the climate changes boreal peatland ecosystem function has been repeatedly highlighted as at risk of shifting helbig et al 2020 tarnocai 2009 vaughan et al 2013 waddington et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 due in part to the longer growing season brought on by a shorter duration of below freezing air temperatures bush lemmen 2019 therefore properly accounting for the freezing and melting of sgi in boreal peatlands will provide insight as to how climate change may impact these northern ecosystems when modelling peatland ecohydrology ensuring that sgi freeze melt is accurately represented in peatland models allows for robust predictions in both peatland carbon and water fluxes not properly accounting for the unique role of sgi in peatlands can lead to erroneous estimation of surface runoff connon et al 2015 and dissolved organic carbon concentrations davidson et al 2019 dyson et al 2011 this is of particular importance given that the duration and timing of sgi melt is projected to diminish under a warming climate thompson et al 2015 the modelling of frozen ground has been studied extensively over the years lamontagne hallé et al 2020 with models ranging from complex heat transport models such as sutra ice e g mckenzie et al 2007b shaw e g flerchinger saxton 1989 and coup e g jansson moon 2001 to semi empirical temperature index models kurylyk watanabe 2013 the required level of model complexity is dependent on the research question being asked barbour krahn 2004 and the physical processes that are being modelled lamontagne hallé et al 2020 in the case of freeze melt cycles in northern environments including peatlands focus is often directed on when the ground is frozen versus when it is not e g carey woo 2000 davidson et al 2019 krogh et al 2017 patankar et al 2015 sutton price 2020 as such it is important to know the extent of sgi formation specifically the depth to which sgi forms and during melt the depth below the surface which dictates the peatland water storage capacity during the spring depth of freezing and melting can be modelled using the stefan equation lunardini 1981 which provides a relatively simple approach to modelling one dimensional freeze and melt in one top down krogh et al 2017 xie gough 2013 and two directions top down bottom up woo et al 2004 xie gough 2013 while there have been extensive studies that measure freeze melt in non permafrost peatlands e g fitzgibbon 1981 friesen et al 2021 kingsbury moore 1987 mcclymont et al 2013 moore 1987 petrone et al 2008a petrone et al 2008b smerdon mendoza 2010 van huizen et al 2019 there has been very little work reported in the literature on freeze melt modelling in peatlands e g mckenzie et al 2007a mckenzie et al 2007b while freeze melt cycles have been represented in modelling studies it is often not the focus of study and validation of the freezing routines is often not explicitly discussed further many of these studies take place in peatlands underlain by permafrost e g krogh et al 2017 zhang et al 2008 yet a large proportion of boreal peatlands are not underlain by permafrost tarnocai 2009 in such systems groundwater flow can still occur even while the peatland is frozen price fitzgibbon 1987 and melting during the spring can occur both from above and below kingsbury moore 1987 reported a higher melt rate from below 4 1 mm day compared to melting from above 3 1 mm day while van huizen petrone 2020 reported that melting from below bottom up comprised up to 1 3 of the total ice melting simple models like the stefan equation can be adapted to employ bi directional melt woo et al 2004 zhang et al 2008 and be readily incorporated into soil vegetationatmosphere transfer svat models given the potential importance of bi directional melt in the timing of ice free conditions and the emerging need to include peatland specific hydrological processes in hydrological models e g hwang et al 2018 it is important to accurately model peatland sgi to understand how high latitude ecosystems may respond to warming understanding how the timing of ice free conditions may change under a warming climate can help mitigate some of the uncertainty of how the spring freshet may change thompson et al 2015 2017 however not every peatland is the same nor are peatlands internally homogeneous hydrophysical properties that determine water storage capacity such as porosity can vary with depth petrone et al 2008a petrone et al 2008b van huizen et al 2019 wells et al 2017 and peat parent vegetation goetz price 2015 mccarter price 2014 and subsequently between boreal peatlands redding devito 2005 along with precipitation patterns differences in porosity and water retention capacity will lead to differences in the absolute amount of antecedent soil moisture at the time of freezing this quantity of moisture has a critical impact on the magnitude of ice formation over the winter due to the complex relationships between the volumetric heat capacity of water as it changes from liquid to solid and subsequent changes in thermal conductivity hayashi et al 2007 oke 1987 for the peat matrix ireson et al 2013 the depth and volume of sgi formation will dictate the infiltrability of the peat soil following spring further it is important to not only accurately model freeze melt in a peatland but also to assess how hydrophysical properties and soil moisture may impact freezing this will contribute to a better understanding of how the behaviour of sgi in boreal peatlands may change as the climate continues to warm and what impact that will have on the spring freshet and the ecohydrological role of boreal peatlands therefore the objectives of this study are to 1 quantify the difference in the timing of ice free conditions when modelling sgi melt with a unidirectional versus a bi directional melt approach and assess the goodness of fit with both approaches 2 conduct a sensitivity analysis on the model to better understand how freeze thaw cycle progresses under different soil moisture regimes and hydrophysical properties in peatlands 2 methods 2 1 study area data used for this study were obtained at pauciflora peatland 56 22 30 36 n 111 14 3 29 w a poor fen located on the stoney mountain complex approximately 40 km south of fort mcmurray alberta fig 1 this peatland is located within the sub humid climate of the western boreal plain wbp where precipitation often exceeds potential evapotranspiration on an annual basis devito et al 2005 marshall et al 1999 the 30 year climate normal 1981 2010

relationship between snow density and air temperature hedstrom pomeroy 1998 however due to its elevated position 750 masl 200 m above the surrounding area pauciflora receives approximately 100 mm more precipitation compared to the 30 year climate normal volik et al 2020 wells et al 2017 and precipitation 4 year growing season average of 403 mm often meets or surpasses potential evapotranspiration 4 year growing season average of 369 mm wells et al 2017 data for model parameterization were collected from the central part of the fen corresponding to the neck part of the north fen in wells et al

larix laricina that occur in sporadic groupings hummocks hollows and lawn microtopographic features each comprise approximately 1 3 of the land cover in the study area a ground temperature monitoring station was installed in an open mid fen mf area subsurface temperatures were recorded at 2 5 10 20 50 75 100 and 150 cm below the ground surface in a hollow using type t thermocouples omega engineering norwalk connecticut usa data were measured using a campbell scientific logger cr1000 campbell scientific ltd logan utah at a 60 s interval and averaged at 60 min intervals ground temperatures were then averaged daily any gaps smaller then 3 days were filled by linear interpolation gaps greater than 3 days were filled by averaging daily average ground temperature by day of year across 2012 2019 and using the average value corresponding to the day of year from these ground temperature values the position of the 0 degree isotherm carey woo 2000 was interpolated and represents the observed position of the freezing melting front a modified form of the stefan equation jumikis 1977 kurylyk 2015 for estimating freezing and melting was used 1 z 2 k l i l λ f ω l ρ l where z is the freezing melting depth m kl is the bulk soil thermal conductivity w m c il is the freezing or melting index which represents the accumulated gain or loss of energy used in freezing or melting of sgi it is calculated by summing the daily average ground surface temperature while above and below 0 c λf is the latent heat of fusion of water ice 334 000 j kg ωl is the water ice content for peat equal to porosity and ρl is the density of water ice 997 kg m3 to employ a bi directional melt routine this equation was run separately for both the 2 cm assumed surface ground temperature tempsurface and the 50 cm ground temperature tempbelow see figure a6 in the appendix to calculate two independent melting indices where tempbelow is referring to the temperature driving melt from below the position of the 0 degree isotherm was determined first with the melting index calculated from tempsurface and then any upward thaw upward shift in 0 degree isotherm driven by tempbelow was subtracted however during freezing a simplifying assumption was employed whereby it was assumed that if tempsurface tempbelow then melting from below was considered negligible and ignored thus bidirectional melting was implemented primarily during the spring thaw and any brief mid winter periods when the surface temperature increased above freezing k was calculated using the following equation as outlined by farouki 1981 2 k a k a f a using the individual thermal conductivities as listed in woo xia 1996 for peat moss 0 25 w m c air 0 025 w m c water 0 57 w m c and ice 2 20 w m c where a refers to each soil component ka refers to each component thermal conductivity and f refers to the fractional proportion of each component the ω was assumed to be equal to porosity for this particular peatland the average porosity for the top 50 cm was determined to be 0 96 van huizen et al 2019 due to data gaps in measured soil moisture 7 5 cm below ground surface at the time of freeze up the logged daily volumetric moisture content vmc was not used and saturated conditions were assumed for the base model run i e vmc porosity for both bi directional and unidirectional modelling approaches vmc was also assumed constant for the duration of each model run this assumption was deemed to be adequate because varying soil moisture during the growing season does not impact the freeze melt status rather it is the soil moisture prior to freeze up that is important furthermore the site generally experiences high soil moisture close to or at saturation prior to freezing van huizen et al 2019 during the freezing process frozen soil layers were assumed to have a residual liquid vmc of 0 15 nagare et al 2012 show for the peat soil used in their study 3 model performance sensitivity and statistical analysis model performance was assessed by comparing modelled freezing and melting depths to observed values and calculating the root mean square error rmse mean average error mae and the relative time domain error rtde for rmse and mae the smaller the value the better the performance for the rtde a value 1 indicates good model performance woo et al 2004 to conduct the sensitivity analysis soil moisture ground surface temperature and peat porosity were all altered altering each of these provides insight into both potential climate change impacts soil moisture and ground surface temperature and variation in peatland hydrophysical properties soil moisture and porosity each model run was completed using r statistical software r core team 2020 to conduct the temperature sensitivity analysis the average monthly ground temperature c measured at 2 cm was calculated for each month across all years that ground temperature was recorded october 29 2012 july 24 2019 for each temperature scenario a percentage starting at 10 and increasing to 70 of each of monthly average was added to each daily average ground temperature as measured by tempsurface while holding porosity at 0 96 and saturation at 1 the 10 70 range used kept the adjusted temperatures within the expected range of temperature data under the different climate change scenarios used in thompson et al 2017 for the soil moisture scenarios vmc was decreased by 10 each scenario up to 50 for the different porosity scenarios the model was run with peat porosity values of 0 96 0 9 0 85 and 0 8 while saturation was assumed to be 1 and the ground temperature was set to the observed values the effects of vmc and porosity are likely to be similar owing to the control of porosity has on the total volume of water present in the soil however they were both included because vmc elucidates the role of changing water content while porosity elucidates the role of changing peat physical structure on the formation of ice sensitivity was determined by comparing percentage change in maximum frost depth from the base model run and conducting a multiple linear regression to assess the most influential variable to maximum frost depth to assess the impact of climate on timing of ice free conditions average ground temperatures for the month of may when the snow has already melted and when ice free conditions typically occur were compared to modelled mean ground temperature in the month of may under 13 different climate scenarios which were run from 2011 to 2090 for a detailed overview of these scenarios we refer the reader to thompson et al 2017 an overview of how modelled ground temperatures were calculated can be found in appendix a 4 results 4 1 freezing melting depth model performance the results from both the unidirectional approach uni where melt came from the top down and a bidirectional approach bi where melting occurred from above and below are shown below in fig 2 hashed lines represent the modeled and solid lines represent the observed data in general there is good agreement between modeled and observed freezing depth for both uni and bi with bi having a slightly better root mean square error rmse based on all years 5 3 cm compared to uni rmse 7 6 cm some years appear to have a better fit than others 2012 2013 vs 2016 2017 in fig 2 however in general rmse mean average error mae and relative time domain error rtde were very similar for freezing depth under both modelling approaches table 1 but the bi directional approach did show a slightly better fit overall r2 of 0 80 compared to uni r2 of 0 65 fig 3 while overall fit did not appear to vary much between bi and uni accurate modelling of bi directional melt and estimation of the timing of ice free conditions did improve table 1 this is evident in the model years of 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 substantial melting from below can be seen in the observed data decreasing depth of the freezing depth with time during april and may uni model runs do not capture this and ice free conditions are dependent on the melting front meeting the freezing front at much deeper depths bi model runs do capture this bidirectional melt where a clear decrease in the freezing front occurs approximately in line with the observed decline using the bi model improved the average estimation of ice free conditions by just under a week absolute difference of 5 1 days there was a similar model performance for melting depth orange lines fig 2 bi scenarios performed slightly better rmse 2 7 cm compared to the uni scenario in rmse 2 7 cm vs 4 2 cm and mae 1 8 cm vs 2 3 cm however the r2 were much lower bi 0 26 uni 0 10 compared to the modelled freezing depths due to difference in the observed ground surface temperature being measured at 2 cm 4 2 model sensitivity to porosity soil moisture and ground surface temperature the results from the sensitivity analysis fig 4 a b c showed that all three parameters play a significant role in controlling the depth of freezing the multiple linear regression showed that all three coefficients are significant p value 0 05 appendix a while each parameter was significant there were differences in the parameters relative impact on freezing depth changes in the variables were meant to reflect potential changes that could be seen in the field therefore for an expected range in vmc there were bigger changes in max freezing depth compared to reasonable changes in porosity this is shown clearly in fig 5 center panel where a decline in soil moisture up to 50 resulted in a decline of 66 in maximum ice depth this was double the 70 ground surface temperature scenario which resulted in a decline of 30 porosity appeared to have the smallest impact where a porosity of 0 8 only led to a 14 decline in maximum ice depth 4 3 sensitivity to a warming climate fig 6 illustrates the average difference in the day of year for the timing of ice free conditions melt and freeze up for each temperature scenario warmer ground surface temperatures lead to later starts for ice freeze up from 1 day earlier to as much as 30 days fig 6c this corresponds to a potential shift in the initiation of freezing conditions by as much as a month where freeze up typically began in november under base model conditions this shifted to early december under the warmest scenario 70 conversely the timing of melt shifted from 1 day earlier up to 25 days earlier on average fig 6b meaning a shift in the beginning of melt from may to the beginning of april consequently there is a shift in the timing of ice free conditions ranging from on average 2 to 18 days earlier fig 6 c of note is a consistent shift in the earlier later timing of melt freeze up and ice free conditions that occurs between the 30 and 40 temperature scenarios which coincide with the largest increase in the average number of days where ground temperatures are greater than 0 c appendix figure a5 between 30 and 40 the average increases by 12 days compared to the average increases between the other temperature scenarios which are 8 days these results indicate that a large shift in the modelling of frozen conditions is occurring between the 30 and 40 modelling scenario to contextualize these results within a changing climate the mean 2 cm temperature representing the ground surface temperature for the month of may for each temperature sensitivity analysis run was plotted against the average modelled ground surface temperature for the month of may under a warming climate in the western boreal plains thompson et al 2017 except for the 10 and 70 runs each sensitivity run falls within the range of one of the climate change scenarios horizontal dashed lines these results suggest that by the end of the 2020 s there could be a shift in the timing of ice free conditions by approximately 3 5 days by the 2050 s this increases to approximately 17 days and by the 2080 s the timing of ice free conditions may shift by as much as a month earlier i e may to april 5 discussion 5 1 model performance and the need for bi directional melt incorporating bi directional melt led to marginal increases in model performance when assessing freezing depth this could be due to the relative importance of melting from below in fig 2 the observed freezing depth solid blue line shows that bi directional melt is not always an important process while there is clear melting from below occurring in the 2014 2015 2015 2016 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 ice seasons it is less clear if there is any significant melting from below in the 2012 2013 2013 2014 and 2016 2017 for melting from below to occur enough energy needs to be supplied to the bottom of the ice layer from the warmer groundwater to overcome the rate of energy loss from the freezing front up the ice to the surface mohammed et al 2018 the high thermal conductivity of the ice dominated peat matrix 1 6 w m c while frozen 0 55 w m c while unfrozen in our study means that melting from below is unlikely to occur during the winter where steep energy gradients between the ground surface and the cooler air above mean that the ground is losing energy of course with a snowpack present maintaining the ground surface at near freezing temperatures friesen et al 2021 it is possible these energy gradients could reverse allowing for some melting from below to occur during the winter there are some periods fig 2 where melting from below is possibly occurring during the winter months dec march in each of the years however it is difficult to determine what is actual melt from below and what might be noise introduced by the thermocouple on a daily time scale similar model performance between bi and uni may also be due to significant bi directional melt not occurring until the spring melt season which on average is a relatively short time frame average 15 1 days compared to the length of the entire ice season average 181 8 days indeed when analyzing model fit for just the spring season the difference in uni and bi model runs stays similar to the model fit for the entire season see table 1 as both uni and bi have improved model fit during the spring bi r2 0 80 rmse 0 054 m mae 0 035 cm uni r2 0 67 rmse 0 077 m mae 0 048 m compared to the model fit for the entire season table 1 therefore both models can accurately simulate freezing depth for most of the winter months and it is only when melting from below is occurring that the two models begin to deviate in their performance model fit of freezing depth for both the bi and uni models were consistent with similar studies that used the stefan equation woo et al 2004 reported an rtde of 0 55 and 0 19 for uni and bi respectively table 1 however their wet tundra site had relatively low peat porosity 0 8 for the top 20 cm compared to pauciflora 0 96 while our uni model run rtde was similar to woo et al 2004 our model performance did not exhibit as big an improvement in rtde between both model run approaches it is possible these differences could be due to the single soil layer for the model that was employed in our study compared to the multi layered soil used in theirs while it does not occur consistently in every year there does appear to be a general deviation between the modelled and observed data that occurs in the 15 20 cm depth below surface see fig 2 2013 2014 2014 2015 2017 2018 the average porosity value of 0 96 is less representative of the lower 20 cm of the 0 50 cm model domain another possible reason is because the stefan equation assumes that the sensible heat required to change the ground temperature is negligible kurylyk hayashi 2016 although the favourable model performance suggests that this impact is relatively small finally it is also possible that woo et al 2004 found a greater improvement in model fit because there was more bi directional melt occurring at their more northern location 69 08 n 148 51 w although for that to occur there would need to be talik development to provide a thawed layer devoie connon 2019 beneath the frozen layer similar model performance was also shown when comparing to peatlands in other permafrost environments xie gough 2013 showed that the stefan equation produced a model error of 5 10 cm while krough et al 2017 report a model difference of 4 cm for summer melt depth although the model performance was poorer for freezing depth difference of 15 cm while evaluating several different freeze thaw algorithms zhang et al 2008 found a model error of 12 14 cm for a permafrost peatland when using a bi directional stefan s equation however they also concluded that unless the original assumptions of the stefan s equation are met i e wet homogenous soil conditions that the stefan s equation is not suitable compared to using more computationally intensive numerical models for peatlands though wet homogenous soil conditions are generally present these results suggest that the stefan equation is a suitable and simple model for estimating the general trends of freezing depth in boreal peatlands furthermore with climate change leading to talik development connon et al 2018 the prevalence of bi directional melt in the active layer of permafrost peatlands may become more important the relative ease with which to measure the surface temperature in a peatland also means establishing the driving data for the equation is less intensive compared to other approaches such as the n factor kurylyk watanabe 2013 where the bi model run outperformed the uni model run is specifically the timing of ice free conditions 3 9 vs 9 days almost a weeklong discrepancy in the timing of ice free conditions can lead to erroneous model results for example if a model shows that the ground is still frozen despite being unfrozen in reality and a large precipitation event occurs there will likely be significant runoff when compared to observed data of course there are ways of mitigating this by modelling infiltration into frozen soils e g granger et al 1984 gray et al 2001 hayashi 2013 mohammed et al 2018 however many of these approaches rely on the assumption that unfrozen unsaturated macropores are present in the soil allowing for preferential flow paths while this is likely to be true in mineral soils preferential flow is less likely to occur in peatlands especially when there are high antecedent moisture conditions prior to freezing rather as the sgi melts away large unfrozen areas form within the peatland allowing for infiltration barring a spatially distributed freeze thaw model it is important to have a representative approximation of the frozen status of a peatland consequently when modelling frozen peatlands it is likely more important to capture the timing of ice free conditions rather than some intermediate state bi directional melt can enhance the spring melt which is due not only to the relatively warmer groundwater underneath but as the sgi melts it begins to form holes van huizen et al 2019 these holes increase the surface area of the sgi exposing more of it to warmer air temperatures from above but also likely inducing lateral melting as the sgi becomes fully surrounded by an unfrozen saturated peat matrix lateral melting has been suggested as being more important when thicker ice is present where the vertical heat inputs are not sufficient to melt all of the ice present kurylyk et al 2016 in kurylyk et al 2016 their permafrost was reported to be 9 m 3 m the frozen layer at pauciflora was between 30 and 40 cm much thinner compared to the 900 cm reported above suggesting that the relatively thinner ice at pauciflora could be melted primarily from vertical energy inputs the generally good agreement between observed and modelled values fig 2 table 1 suggests that lateral melt is likely less influential for the thinner sgi found at pauciflora this study took place in a poor fen where groundwater inputs from the surrounding hillslopes occur quite regularly there is uncertainty if bi directional melt is as important in a bog where groundwater inputs from adjacent mineral uplands do not occur however there is lateral groundwater movement that can occur within a bog especially if there is a dome present mckenzie et al 2007a while warmer pulses of groundwater from upward hydraulic gradients may not occur this internal horizontal flow of water may enhance bi directional melt due to the dependence on precipitation for water a bog could experience water table decline over the winter this can lead to a decoupling between the water table and sgi layer further limiting melting from below decoupling of the sgi and water table could also occur due to frost heave moore 1987 future work is needed to characterize the differences between sgi freeze thaw in bogs and fens 5 2 model sensitivity what is the most important to parameterize accurately results fig 6 and appendix a table 1 demonstrate that vmc was the most significant controlling factor on freezing depth which can be attributed to the thermal conductivity of water when it is in a frozen 2 2 w m c and liquid state 0 57 w m c when saturated and frozen the bulk soil thermal conductivity was greater by a factor of 2 1 65 w m c compared to unfrozen 0 55 w m c a difference of 1 1 w m c this shift in thermal conductivity which controls the rate at which energy is transferred upwards from the freezing front through the soil during freezing is what causes freezing depth to be most sensitive to soil moisture as such when modelling freeze thaw in peatlands it is important to accurately measure soil moisture prior to freezing for our study soil moisture was not directly measured however pauciflora is a relatively wet site owed to its local climate wells et al 2017 and given the good base model performance rmse 5 4 cm our assumption of saturated conditions prior to freezing appears to be reasonable this presents a challenge for using field based data for modelling peatlands though as there is uncertainty around the accuracy of typical soil moisture measurement methods during frozen conditions and pressure transducers for logging water table measurements seldom function properly under freezing conditions for the purposes of this modelling experiment once freezing was initiated the amount of soil moisture present in the top 50 cm of the peat column was not allowed to change only the relative proportions of liquid and frozen water changed i e moisture migration was not explicitly modelled upward vapor flux in a frozen soil has been shown to vary from 1 to 30 mm winter season santeford 1978 woo 1982 in peatlands while kingsbury moore 1987 suggested it as a possible mechanism for the development of a partially dehydrated frozen peat layer at depth however for pauciflora given the likelihood of saturated conditions prior to freeze up and the presence of sgi at the surface prior to spring melt it is assumed that moisture migration had a negligible impact on the freezing characteristics in this study once a portion of the soil was frozen it was assumed that a small amount of liquid vmc 15 remained nagare et al 2012 adsorbed to the peat fibres farouki 1981 this unfrozen water content can also vary depending on the soil type and subsurface temperature however based on the typical ranges of liquid vmc in a frozen soil 0 01 0 3 ireson et al 2013 the thermal conductivity range is likely to be relatively small 0 64 w m c in the highly porous upper soil layers ground surface temperature had the second biggest impact on freezing depth after vmc its relatively lower impact compared to vmc is likely because ground surface temperature is more important for initiating the freezing conditions while vmc due to its disproportionate impact on thermal conductivity has a bigger influence over freezing depth changes in porosity had the smallest impact on freezing depth due to the small range of porosity values used in the sensitivity analysis 0 8 0 98 for the modelled soil layer this range is representative of the top 50 cm of the moss and peat in most peatlands typical freezing depths extend from the first few cm to 50 cm depth which can however cover a range of porosities for pauciflora the highly fibric moss and peat extended down through the top 50 cm however based on the sensitivity results freezing rates could vary likely slowing with depth as a lower porosity means a lower water holding capacity under saturated conditions and subsequently lower thermal conductivity of course less porous peat soil does not necessarily mean shallower freezing depths water has a high heat capacity 4 180 mj m3c meaning less water present in the soil means less energy is needed to increase or decrease the temperature above below the freezing point if a highly porous peat soil has a lower vmc prior to freeze up then more air will be present at the time of freezing this can lower the thermal conductivity leading to potentially shallow freezing yet the decrease in heat capacity could also lead to more rapid ground surface temperature swings however with the presence of a snowpack it is likely these rapid changes occur over a short period at the beginning of the winter as the snowpack likely insulates the ground from any further rapid ground surface temperature changes kingsbury moore 1987 furthermore the model used here does not account for heat capacity and our model domain treats the soil as one layer making the modelling of a discrete layer of saturated unfrozen peat over frozen saturated peat difficult to assess however results from wright et al 2009 would seem to suggest that the heat capacity of unfrozen water might not be as important as its higher thermal conductivity during the spring thaw where unfrozen liquid water in the peat matrix above the frozen layer led to faster melt rates this is also likely due to the lower heat capacity 1 9 mj m3c of ice in the winter this could mean that freezing rates are initially slower under saturated conditions and it is not until enough ice forms increasing the thermal conductivity that ice formation can speed up another complicating factor is that if there are unsaturated conditions prior to sgi formation moisture migration or early winter snowmelt could fill up the remaining storage capacity appels et al 2018 redding devito 2011 woo heron 1981 leading to saturated conditions as freezing begins the probability of this occurring will likely increase as well with more frequent mid winter departures above the freezing point over the growing season finally the zero curtain effect outcalt et al 1990 has been shown to delay temperatures rising above the freezing mark in peatlands during the spring mckenzie et al 2007a where the peat soil can be iso thermal for up to a month or more during the spring thaw while there was some evidence of iso thermal soil conditions in the top 20 cm at pauciflora this typically coincided with a ripening snowpack meaning the peatland surface was predominantly covered by snow ground thaw and melting of sgi typically does not occur until the snow has disappeared this likely means the zero curtain effect had little impact on the melt rates and timing of ice free conditions at pauciflora 5 2 implications for a shifting sgi regime in boreal peatlands the results from the climate sensitivity analysis show a clear shift towards earlier ice free conditions figs 6 7 by 2030 the apparent threshold response between the 30 and 40 sensitivity runs may occur resulting in a shift of ice free conditions by approximately a week on average and up to two weeks by the end of the century ice free conditions could occur up to a month earlier these results are generally in line with climate predictions for the boreal forest which suggest warmer air temperatures and earlier onset of spring conditions buermann et al 2013 debeer et al 2020 price et al 2013 these may be conservative estimates of the timing of ice free conditions though as the sensitivity analysis did not account for shifts in precipitation patterns or increased rain on snow events the latter of which is expected to increase zhang et al 2019 an increase in rain on snow events could enhance melting as precipitation provides additional heat inputs both into the snow pack and any exposed ground woo xia 1996 potentially leading to even earlier melt compared to the results of the climate sensitivity analysis in addition to uncertainty in the estimates due to precipitation soil moisture conditions are expected to be drier for the boreal forest wang et al 2014 due to the increase in air temperatures longer growing season and subsequently higher evapotranspiration rates helbig et al 2020 it is possible that sgi freezing depth may increase as the depth is strongly controlled by snowpack thickness friesen et al 2021 iwata et al 2010 although this effect could be mitigated by lower antecedent moisture conditions prior to freeze up our sensitivity analysis implicitly assumes that the timing of snowfall stays the same for each model run as precipitation regimes shift it is possible that there could be slight increases in freezing depth in the short term under a warming climate bi directional melt may also increase in the warmer scenarios there was an increase in the number of freeze thaw events data not shown where melting from below became more frequent as there were more days where the surface temperature was above 0 c this highlights the potential importance of characterizing melt from below when modelling freeze thaw in future model studies interesting to note however is that while shifts in soil moisture resulted in different freezing depths timing of ice free conditions did not change this is likely due to the proportional changes in thermal conductivity associated with changes in vmc appendix a4 where there is less ice to melt energy transfer is less efficient and there is a lower melt rate it is possible with this scenario of decreased melt rates that spring evapotranspiration rates could increase as less energy is allocated to melting ice and could increase potential evaporation rates van huizen et al 2019 this may also lead to more desiccation as a slower melt rate could be outpaced by evapotranspiration rates moore 1987 this increased drying may increase fire risk for peatlands due to a decrease in the near surface soil moisture of the upper moss layer shetler et al 2008 however this increased fire risk may also depend on the relative proportion of hummocks and hollows that form in peatlands as hummocks are typically thought to be more resistant to burning owing to their capacity to maintain higher water content during droughts thompson waddington 2013 also sgi can melt at different rates across a peatland van huizen petrone 2020 while van huizen petrone 2020 showed that these spatial differences were quite small it is possible that evaporation rates could outpace melt rates in one area of the peatland compared to another a similar pattern to the vmc and the timing of ice free conditions is seen with porosity as well where the timing of melt and ice free conditions stays the same despite the changes in the amount of ice that formed this suggests that despite potential differences in upper level soil porosities between bogs and fens any differences in freeze thaw conditions between peatlands will be largely climate driven these similarities in the timing of ice free conditions despite differences in porosity and vmc imply that the thickness of ice i e the amount of ice that forms while consequential for the spring surface energy balance e g van huizen petrone 2020 may not be as integral when modelling the timing of ice free conditions as for the role of sgi in boreal peatlands the thinning of sgi combined with the earlier timing of ice free conditions suggests that boreal peatlands may become less reliable sources of water on the landscape particularly during the spring freshet or at the very least there will be increased variability in the magnitude of the spring freshet 6 conclusions this work builds upon the conclusions of woo et al 2004 which demonstrated that including bi directional melt in peatland hydrological models is important to ensure proper modelling of the timing of ice free conditions using the stefan equation to achieve this provides a relatively simple model that should be easily integrated into soil vegetationatmosphere transfer svat models however more work is needed to better understand if there are any differences in sgi freeze melt cycles between peatland types and if its relative impact on the spring freshet may change with hydrogeomorphic setting of the peatland furthermore this work highlights the importance of conceptualizing what is to be considered as ice free when modelling peatland freeze thaw does it occur when all the ice is gone or is there a functional definition for ice free where the impact of sgi on infiltration and other hydrological processes is negligible despite the presence of some sgi finally as the climate warms the timing of ice free conditions will shift earlier in the season by as much as 1 month earlier by the end of century this could mean that a peatlands role in the landscape may change spring discharge may become more variable especially for headwater catchments and less water could leave these peatlands during the spring in addition to shifts in the peatlands hydrological role within the landscape a reduction in sgi may result in an increased shift in peatland vulnerability to spring fires where increased desiccation due to slower melt rates combined with increased evaporation rates could lead to higher water losses from the living moss layer future research is needed to investigate this potential positive feedback that could increase peatland fire risk and subsequent carbon losses credit authorship contribution statement brandon van huizen conceptualization methodology data

3839,previous studies in the prairie pothole region mainly assessed wetland hydrologic function at seasonal annual and decadal scales while many studies have looked at water balance dynamics and local flow generation processes in wetlands no study looked at hydrological dynamics in response to individual rainfall events in prairie pothole wetlands here after referred as wetlands across a gradient of alteration the present study aimed to investigate 1 the most important metrics needed to characterize the spatial variability of wetland hydrologic response to rainfall runoff events 2 the temporal variability of individual wetland hydrologic response 3 the spatial and temporal variability of wetland stream interaction and 4 the temporal persistence of various spatial controls on individual wetland hydrologic response characteristics high frequency water level data was collected over two years for ten intact three consolidated and seven drainage ditches associated with fully drained wetland s as well as a creek located in southwestern manitoba canada the hydrologic response of the studied wetlands to individual rainfall runoff events was characterized using a range of metrics several data analysis methods were used including principal component analysis graphical assessments of wetland stream hysteresis dynamics and correlations analyses between wetland response metrics and spatial characteristics results suggested that wetland alteration status i e drained versus intact open water wetlands plays an important role in explaining differences in the event scale hydrologic behaviour of wetlands climatic and antecedent storage conditions i e surface and subsurface storage in wetland basin also had a strong influence on the hydrologic responses of wetlands during individual rainfall runoff events and appeared to override the influence of spatial controls such as wetland area volume or catchment area antecedent storage also seemed to be the driving factor of wetland stream interactions a lack of persistent correlations between wetland spatial characteristics and response metrics was observed and suggested nonstationary wetland hydrological behaviours and controls a conclusion that has significant implications for wetland classification and modelling keywords rainfall runoff events prairie pothole region wetland hydrologic response wetland stream interactions spatial wetland characteristics 1 introduction event based analysis of stream hydrographs is commonly used for investigating dominant runoff generation processes in a watershed gou et al 2019 kirchner 2019 specifically different event hydrograph metrics related to the magnitude and timing of hydrograph response can be used to infer watershed dynamic storage and release mechanisms blume et al 2007 kirchner 2019 further the event based analysis of hydrographs sometimes in combination with chemographs has highlighted the importance of nonlinear relationships either in the form of input output thresholds or input output loops loop like behaviours have been notably described as hysteretic relationships whereby a given variable exhibits significantly different dynamics on the rising and falling limbs of a stream hydrograph gharari and razavi 2018 zuecco et al 2016 event based hydrograph analysis approaches have been seldom used in non stream settings however the literature contains few instances of event scale analyses of wetland dynamics and in these instances the goal was to better understand the processes that govern stormflow production in a forested groundwater fed wetland waddington et al 1993 to estimate hydrodynamic parameters moezzibadi et al 2019 and to explain pollution attenuation andrea 2016 in constructed wetlands and to support wetland restoration initiatives in northern peatlands ketcheson and price 2011 event based hydrograph analysis has yet to be applied to smaller yet important types of naturally occuring wetlands such as prairie pothole wetlands especially in landscapes which are dominated by such features extensive wetland loss has taken place around the world in the last 50 years and especially so in archetypical landscapes such as the prairie pothole region ppr van meter and basu 2015 historically draining small wetlands in the ppr required minimum effort and farmers did it for the convenience of agricultural operation van meter and basu 2015 however in some cases multiple small pothole wetlands are drained into one large one i e a consolidated wetland this in an attempt to compensate the loss of small wetlands by creating a large one haque et al 2018 mccauley et al 2015 pothole wetlands therefore offer a unique opportunity to study the hydrological behaviour of small watershed features that exist along a continuum of alteration from intact to consolidated and fully drained while wetland hydrological dynamics can be described using several variables epa 2015 mitsch and gosselink 2007 pond water level hereafter simply referred to as water level is typically relied upon because it is easy to monitor and helpful in understanding changes in surface water storage in watersheds park et al 2014 and hayashi et al 2016 identified precipitation and evapotranspiration as key controls on pond permanence hayashi et al 2016 in addition to those two variables pond water level fluctuations are also known to depend on lateral water inputs to the wetland especially in response to rainfall runoff events hayashi et al 2016 shook et al 2013 during and after such events wetlands that belong to wetland complexes can be inter connected and connected to streams through overland i e via fill spill events and shallow subsurface flow numerous studies have characterized individual or cumulative wetland hydrologic function in a watershed context e g bullock and acreman 2003 epa 2015 gleason et al 2007 haan and johnson 1968 hayashi et al 2003 hayashi et al 2016 huang et al 2011 huang et al 2013 hubbard and linder 1986 johnston et al 1990 lindsay et al 2004 mcallister et al 2000 mclaughlin et al 2014 tiner 2003 wang et al 2010 yang et al 2010 but they have almost exclusively done so over intermediate to long timescales in the ppr in particular recent examples include the assessment of wetland hydrologic function through field data or models at seasonal and annual scales ali et al 2017 brannen et al 2015 euliss and mushet 1996 golden et al 2014 haque et al 2018 hayashi et al 2016 as well as decadal scales ehsanzadeh et al 2016 hayashi et al 2016 one major gap in the current literature is the assessment of individual pothole wetland hydrological dynamics over short timescales namely specific snowmelt or rainfall events in a manner similar to streams that can exhibit a wide range of flow responses to snowmelt or rainfall subdued or sharp water level fluctuations can also occur in pothole wetlands as a function of precipitation intensity antecedent water storage conditions and other factors haque et al 2018 as the ppr is characterized by a semi arid to sub humid climate extreme rainfall events i e in terms of duration and total precipitation and associated rainfall triggered floods were rare until recently dumanski et al 2015 as a result the hydrologic response of pothole wetlands hereafter simply referred to as wetlands to these events is poorly understood the stream focused literature has frequently highlighted that more process insights can be gained from event scale hydrograph analyses e g blume et al 2007 gorski and zimmer 2021 compared to annual or seasonal water balance analyses for instance however it is unclear whether event scale analyses of wetland hydrologic dynamics would also lead to more process insights focusing on wetland hydrological dynamics over short timescales is especially important in the context of land use and climate change as some regions around the world including the ppr are expected to face increased frequencies of extreme but short lived rainfall runoff events khaliq et al 2015 pfahl et al 2017 the present study therefore aims to rely on high frequency pond water level water table and stream water level data combined with a detailed landscape analysis to investigate 1 the most important metrics needed to characterize the spatial variability of wetland hydrologic response to rainfall runoff events 2 the temporal variability of individual wetland hydrologic response 3 the spatial and temporal variability of wetland stream interaction and 4 the temporal persistence of various spatial controls on individual wetland hydrologic response characteristics 2 methods 2 1 study site description the broughton s creek is a tributary of the little saskatchewan river and is located in southwestern manitoba canada fig 1 a it drains an area of approximately 252 km2 fig 1b within the prairie pothole region ppr the ppr is a vast and hydrologically biogeochemically and ecologically important area in north america spanning canada and the united states where numerous topographic depressions or small basins left by glacier retreat have created a dense network of pothole wetlands small lakes and streams average density 13basins km2 range 1 195 basins km2 u s fish and wildlife service 2010 those densities are however changing since rapid agricultural intensification in the ppr has led to significant surface water drainage activities johnston 2013 most pothole wetlands are completely surrounded by uplands without continuous or well defined surface connections to streams cohen et al 2016 leibowitz and nadeau 2003 leibowitz 2015 mushet et al 2015 tiner 2003 even with small surface area less than1 000 m2 the hydrological dynamics prevailing in individual pothole wetlands are thought to exert a significant influence on overall watershed hydrology such as storing snowmelt runoff cohen et al 2016 hayashi et al 2003 mushet et al 2015 individual pothole wetland hydrological behavior is also controlled by static landscape properties such as wetland geometry geographic position and alteration status haque et al 2018 hayashi et al 2016 for instance fill spill events are possible for intact partially drained and consolidated pothole wetlands mccauley et al 2015 shaw et al 2012 but no longer exist in the case of fully drained pothole wetlands fully drained pothole wetlands can nevertheless contribute water to downstream systems by generating surface and shallow subsurface flow haque et al 2018 the broughton s creek watershed can be described as a typical ppr landscape which was created between 20 000 to 12 000b c due to the retreat of the assiniboine glacial lobe wang et al 2010 yang et al 2010 it has numerous potholes sloughs and lakes and is described as a hummocky till plain most soils in the watershed are well drained newdale association soils i e mainly orthic black chernozems however some near stream locations also have soils from the dorset drokan eroded slope complex and jaymar associations mafri 2008 wang et al 2010 according to the u s soil taxonomic classification the udic boroll subgroups have similar properties as soils from the newdale dorset and jaymar associations soil classification working group 1998 most of the land in the broughton s creek watershed is used for agricultural purposes 71 4 followed by rangeland 10 8 wetland 9 8 forest 4 and other uses 4 detailed landscape change detection studies have shown that between 1968 and 2005 approximately 21 of the wetland area in the watershed has been lost i e those are currently fully drained wetlands that no longer have an open water component however 70 of the wetland area has been impacted when we account for all hydrological alterations including partly drained wetlands and farmed wetlands wang et al 2010 for continuous monitoring of wetland hydrology thirteen open water wetlands and seven drainage ditches associated with fully drained wetlands were selected on both sides of a 5 km creek reach in the broughton s creek watershed see fig 1c for the exact locations out of the thirteen open water wetlands ten are intact wetlands i e hydrologically undisturbed wetlands and the remaining three are consolidated wetlands according to ducks unlimited canada s duc wetland inventory established for the watershed there were no morphological changes to the intact wetlands in the last 60 years however multiple wetlands were drained to form a consolidated wetland see example in fig 1d as for drainage ditches they have visible surface connections to the creek reach and are typically located downslope of fully drained wetlands for the present study drainage ditch sites were selected based on the same previously mentioned wetland inventory dataset which includes the location of historic wetlands and confirms their role in diverting water from the drained wetland basins to the creek reach as indicated by haque et al 2018 these ditches are barely incised and have accumulated a lot of eroded materials over time hence while they do not behave like conventional conveyance channels allowing concentrated water flow they are associated with shallow fluctuating water tables that can rise above the ground surface and result in ponding water surface water flow through those ditches is rare except during heavy rainfall and occurs in a diffuse manner very similar to surface runoff 2 2 wetland spatial characteristics a series of wetland spatial characteristics table 1 were calculated for all studied wetlands i e open water and fully drained using the wetland inventory dataset provided by duc for open water wetlands duc used the v a h method minke et al 2010 hayashi and van der kamp 2000 pomeroy et al 2010 to calculate storage volume since this method can estimate volume below the standing water from lidar data however for drained wetlands the surface volume tool in esri arcgis was used to calculate volume from lidar data the areas of the open water wetlands range from 7 4 102 to 1 5 105 m2 while their storage volumes range from 7 4 101 to 4 4 104 m3 the drained wetlands associated with the instrumented ditches had areas and storage volumes ranging from 7 8 102 to 1 3 104 m2 and 1 5 102 to 7 0 103 m3 respectively for open water wetlands the euclidean distance between the center of the wetland and the edge of the creek was used instead of the euclidean or the flowpath distance between the wetland spilling point and the creek the choice of the euclidean rather than flowpath distance was made to avoid the uncertainty associated with the use of gis based flow direction algorithms in mostly flat landscapes also as the monitored prairie pothole wetlands do not have an stablished outlet unique spilling points were not identifiable from field observations or satellite images euclidean distances estimated between each open water wetland and the study creek reach range from 4 7 102 to 1 0 103 m whereas ditch lengths for the drained wetlands range from 9 3 101 2 2 102 m catchment areas for the open water and drained wetlands range from 6 0 103 3 1 105 m2 and 9 8 103 9 0 104 m2 respectively some spatial characteristics such as the incremental contributing area conarea and the total drainage area totdrainarea are only relevant for the consolidated open water wetlands and drained wetlands the incremental contributing area of a consolidated wetland was calculated by summing up the catchment areas of all the drained wetlands that pre existed the consolidated wetland similarly the totdrainarea of a consolidated wetlands was estimated as the sum of its original catchment area and its incremental contributing area 2 3 hydrometric and climate data collection a capacitance based water level logger with approximately 2 to 5 mm accuracy odysseytm dataflow systems was installed at the downstream end of the creek reach i e south end and in each open water wetland using stilling wells to record hourly surface water level fluctuations for each of the drainage ditches associated with fully drained wetlands a one meter deep water table well was installed to house the same kind of logger for measuring hourly shallow water table fluctuations abs pipes 1 5 in diameter screened over the 0 15 1 00 m soil depth range were used for the water table wells continuous monitoring of the creek reach open water wetlands and ditches associated with fully drained wetlands was done during the 2013 and 2014 open water seasons i e april to october the study area within which all monitored wetlands are located is quite small about 15 km2 and it was assumed not to be subject to noticeable spatial variability in rainfall the closest environment and climate change canada weather station brandon a climate id 5010481 world meteorological organization wmo id 71140 is located about 30 km south west from the study location other researchers relied on the data from that station and found it representative of weather in the broughton s creek watershed wang et al 2010 yang et al 2010 climate data pertaining to air temperature and daily rainfall amounts were extracted from the historical record available for that weather station mean air temperature was similar in both study years 13 5 c in april october 2013 and 2014 whereas total open water season precipitation was higher in 2014 i e 523 4 mm compared to 2013 i e 402 8 mm however total open water season precipitation in both years was higher than the long term 1960 2014 average i e 344 2 mm in that region 2 4 rainfall runoff event delineation and response metrics daily average surface or subsurface water levels were calculated from the hourly recorded data for all the open water wetlands the drainage ditch sites associated with drained wetlands and the creek reach average daily values were used simply to avoid dealing with regular diurnal fluctuations or cycles in pond water level that occur irrespective of rainfall runoff events notably as a result of the strong evaporative signal in the region we used wetland fullness values i e we divided the wetland water depth by the wetland spillage level measured manually in the field for open water wetlands as in haque et al 2018 using wetland fullness values allowed us to normalize water level data for comparing wetlands with each other for reasons related to data availability the focus of this study was solely on rainfall runoff events and snowmelt events were not considered the start and end dates of rainfall runoff events were identified from the creek data only i e by manually matching daily rainfall amounts and daily creek water level timeseries creek response was defined as a water level increase of more than 5 mm from one day to the next followed by a peak and then a decrease smaller than 5 mm increases were not considered as the initiation of creek response as they could be measurement error or noise within the accuracy range of the water level loggers based on creek response a total of 17 rainfall runoff events were identified across the 2013 2014 open water seasons table 2 for each studied wetland surface water level fluctuations or water table fluctuations were examined across the whole duration of each event it should be reiterated that the ditches associated with drained wetlands are barely incised channels and therefore any water occasionally moving through them should be seen as diffuse overland flow and not channelized flow because of the very transient nature of standing water or flowing water in the ditches we decided not to separately consider water table fluctuations below the ditches and the occasional water ponding effects or generation of overland flow at the surface instead we considered any of the two surface or subsurface water dynamics to be the manifestation of a hydrologic response linked to the location of historical wetlands which have now been drained similar to creek response wetland response was identified as the presence of a rise in pond water level i e greater than 5 mm departure from pre event water level followed by a peak and then a decrease for the present study wetlands responses were only identified between the start and end dates of the events identified based on creek water level fluctuations see above this methodological choice was motivated by the fact that the goal of the present study was not to characterize all periods during which wetlands may have experienced water level fluctuations which could be caused by recent precipitation but also by other phenomena instead the focus was solely on periods during which noticeable creek water level fluctuations were observed in response to rainfall with the aim to assess whether wetlands located in the surrounding landscape were also experiencing water level fluctuations at the same time fig 2 a series of thirteen hydrologic response metrics were estimated for each of the studied wetlands and drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands and for each of the rainfall runoff events table 3 these metrics were chosen based on their proven usefulness as described in the stream focused literature for instance event peak flow rates have been documented across many watersheds and linked to catchment area hannah et al 2000 response lag times have also been reported as important notably the lag to peak flow defined as the time elapsed from the beginning of the rising limb to the occurrence of the peak flow rate is a good indicator of a watershed s ability to delay its response to a rainfall event beven 2012 hannah et al 2000 chow et al 1988 as for recession rates they describe the rate of change in flow during the receding limb of a hydrograph and have been linked to watershed spatial characteristics such as depressional surface and subsurface storage hannah et al 2000 chow et al 1988 seasonal and annual average values of hydrograph metrics have also been correlated to watershed spatial characteristics making it possible to estimate the former as a function of the latter for example yadav et al 2007 showed that rainfall runoff response characteristics such as the runoff ratio and the slope of the flow duration curve of ungauged watersheds can be expressed as a function of watershed topography i e slope subsurface geology and soils characteristics buttle 2006 also argued that rainfall runoff responses can be explained by three first order controls typology topography and topology similar to traditional hydrograph analysis for streams metrics such as the maximum water level i e maxwl final water level i e finalwl and water level percentage change i e wlpercchange were estimated in the present study to get a sense of changes in actual wetland storage metrics like the lag to maximum water level i e lagtomaxwl water level rise rate i e wlriserate and water level recession rate i e wlrecessrate were also estimated to understand the temporal dynamics of storage change for individual open water wetlands and drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands during a rainfall runoff event almost all the studied wetlands responded noticeably during each of the identified rainfall runoff events the exceptions were events 5 and 6 where more than 50 of the studied wetlands did not appear to respond to rainfall table 2 for event 5 during the identified event period the 28 5 mm of rain occurred in two days with four days without rain in between possibly as a result of two convective storms or thunderstorms wetland water levels rose and fell in less than a day and those fluctuations were not noticeable when using daily data moreover due to the nature of the convective storms or thunderstorms it is possible that the rain at the site was less than the rain at the weather station which is why the wetlands at the site did not appear to respond for those two events wetland response metrics were null zero values and were not reported in result tables and figures below 2 5 statistical analyses since open water wetlands were characterized using surface water levels and drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands were characterized using subsurface water levels each research objective was addressed separately for open water and drained wetlands to identify the most important metrics needed to characterize the spatial variability of wetland hydrologic response i e research objective 1 principal component analysis pca was performed pca a statistical data reduction technique identifies the combinations of original variables i e the principal components that explain the maximum variation in a dataset jolliffe 2011 in the present study pca was performed for each event considering all the hydrologic metrics calculated across all the open water or drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands for that event it should be noted that pca was not performed for events 5 and 6 as they were associated with zero values metrics for many wetlands and some of the assumptions underlying pca are violated with datasets that contain many zeros legendre and legendre 2012 the hydrologic response metrics that contributed the most to the first and second principal components i e had a loading score of 0 50 or higher for one of the first two principal components were deemed to be the metrics that explain the maximum variation across the wetlands the metrics that consistently i e across multiple events had high loading scores on the first two principal components were retained for further analysis to address research objective 2 i e to investigate the temporal variability of individual wetland hydrologic response boxplots were created for the metrics that were retained after pca to address research objective 3 i e to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of wetland stream interaction an analysis of hysteretic behaviors was done several studies in the stream focused literature have looked at examples of hysteretic relationships between streamflow and other hydrological variables e g antecedent storage travel times water level etc during individual rainfall runoff events andermann et al 2012 burt et al 2015 davies and beven 2015 fovet et al 2015 gharari and razavi 2018 shook and pomeroy 2011 valkama and olli 2017 zuecco et al 2016 other studies have rather looked at the hysteretic behaviour between streamflow and water quality variables such as stream nitrate and total phosphorus concentrations lloyd et al 2016 valkama and olli 2017 bedload and suspended sediment concentrations mao et al 2014 landers and sturm 2013 valkama and olli 2017 overall event based hydrograph analysis approaches have been successfully used to conceptualize stream and broad watershed processes in the present study for each of the events and each studied wetland and drainage ditch site a scatter plot of wetland water level x axis versus creek water level y axis was built to examine wetland stream hysteresis dynamics hysteresis curves were classified into five different types namely linear i e no hysteresis clockwise counter clockwise eight shaped and unclear the percent time that each hysteresis type was observed for each wetland or drainage ditch site was then computed lastly to address research objective 4 i e to investigate the temporal persistence of spatial controls on individual wetland hydrologic response characteristics spearman s rank correlation coefficients were calculated between wetland spatial characteristics table 1 and selected wetland hydrologic response metrics for individual rainfall events spearman s rank correlation coefficients were evaluated at the 95 significance level contrary to the commonly used pearson correlation coefficient the spearman s rank correlation coefficient does not assume a normal distribution of the data and is used to assess both linear and nonlinear relations between variables sokal and rohlf 2012 the matlab statistics and machine learning toolbox release 2017b was used for performing pca and calculating the spearman s rank correlation coefficients 3 results 3 1 event characteristics and metrics of wetland hydrologic response total rainfall and average rainfall intensity were strongly positively correlated spearman correlation coefficient 0 72 p value 0 003 across all rainfall runoff events as shown graphically in fig 3 a visual assessment of fig 3 reveals that average rainfall intensities of more than 10 mm day led to noticeable increases in the subsurface water level rise rate of ditch sites associated with drained wetlands whereas no noticeable change was observed above that same rainfall intensity for open water wetlands fig 3 simple descriptive statistics show that some hydrologic response metrics have greater spatial variability i e vary more among the studied wetlands relative to others table 4 for example metrics like wlriserate wlrecessrate and wlpercchange had noticeably greater standard deviation values for both open water and ditch sites compared to other metrics pca showed that not all the calculated hydrologic response metrics were equally effective at capturing variation in wetland hydrologic behavior during individual rainfall runoff events out of the 13 calculated hydrologic response metrics only 8 had loading scores exceeding 0 50 on either the first or the second principal component for at least one rainfall runoff event fig 4 on one hand response metrics such as wlriserate wlrecessrate and wlpercchange were able to capture a large portion of the variation in hydrologic response for both open water wetlands and drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands for almost all the studied rainfall runoff events on the other hand metrics such as lagtomaxwl recessdura and maxrise tr were only able to capture a good portion of the variation in the hydrologic response of drainage ditch sites fig 4 hence for further analyses only selected metrics were retained as they had loading scores exceeding 0 50 on either the first or the second principal component for at least one rainfall runoff event namely lagtomaxwl wlriserate recessdura wlrecessrate wlpercchange maxrise tr maxrise tr ar1 and maxrise tr ar7 3 2 temporal variability of individual wetland hydrologic response the metrics retained after synthesizing the pca results were used to study the temporal variability of individual hydrologic responses across the studied wetlands and drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands figs 4 and 5 when focusing on open water wetlands alone most of the metrics did not show considerable temporal variation i e variation from one event to another illustrated by the small interquartile range of the blue boxes on the boxplot figures except for lagtomaxwl and recessdura fig 5 the lagtomaxwl metric had noticeably lower values i e mostly between 1 and 4 days compared to recessdura i e mostly between 3 and 8 days for the open water wetlands also wlriserate had higher values i e mostly less than 50 mm day compared to wlrecessrate i e mostly less than 20 mm day fig 5 for individual open water wetlands wlpercchange had mostly positive values there were no major differences between the maxrise tr and maxrise tr ar7 metrics in terms of absolute values or temporal variability i e interquartile range fig 5 the event response dynamics observed for drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands were different than those observed for open water wetlands indeed for most of the response metrics drainage ditch sites showed noticeably higher temporal variability compared to the open water wetlands i e red boxes have higher interquartile range than blue boxes on the boxplot figures suggesting that subsurface water storage dynamics were more variable over the short term event to event scale than wetland surface water storage dynamics except for the recessdura metric drainage ditch sites usually had higher values for all the metrics compared to open water wetlands fig 5 with very few exceptions e g d2 and d7 in general individual drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands showed lower lagtomaxwl values compared to the recessdura values similarly wlriserate had considerably higher values i e mostly less than 150 mm day compared to wlrecessrate i e mostly less than 50 mm day fig 5 drainage ditch sites had mostly positive wlpercchange for individual drainage ditch sites there were no noticeable differences between metrics such as maxrise tr maxrise tr ar1 and maxrise tr ar7 however site d5 always had noticeably higher median values compared to the other drainage ditch sites for these metrics all drainage ditch sites showed partial recession for most of the studied rainfall runoff events meaning that their final water table level at the end of a rainfall runoff event was higher than the initial water table level recorded before the event started conversely more than half of the open water wetlands showed full recession for most of the rainfall runoff events fig 6 3 3 spatial and temporal variability of wetland stream interaction there were considerable spatial and temporal variations in wetland stream interaction patterns i e hysteresis loop shapes across the studied wetlands figs 7 and 8 for example during rainfall runoff event 4 most of the open water wetlands were associated with a wetland stream clockwise hysteretic pattern contrary to most drainage ditch sites that were rather associated with a counter clockwise pattern fig 7 some rainfall runoff events showed a lot of spatial variability with individual open water wetlands having different hysteretic patterns e g event 12 conversely a single dominant hysteretic pattern could emerge across all studied wetlands for some events as was the case with the counter clockwise pattern in event 15 fig 7 the spatial variation i e wetland to wetland variation in hysteresis types was more pronounced for events that occurred following dry conditions and or when precipitation duration was short as shown in fig 7 for event 2 in contrast more spatial homogeneity in hysteresis types was observed for longer duration precipitation events and or with wet antecedent conditions as evidenced in fig 7 for event 15 table 2 and fig 7 more importantly when considering individual wetlands one at a time hysteresis patterns were not temporally consistent i e the same wetland was not consistently associated with the same hysteretic pattern for different rainfall runoff events figs 7 and 8 during the study period although most wetlands switched between the five hysteresis types the counter clockwise type was the most common regardless of wetland alteration status fig 8 geographic proximity was not a good predictor of the spatial homogeneity or heterogeneity of hysteresis types very different hysteresis patterns were sometimes obtained for wetlands located close to each other e g i1 and i2 c1 and c2 or d5 and d6 figs 1 and 8 3 4 temporal persistence of spatial controls on individual wetland hydrologic response in the context of this study the phrase temporal persistence is used to refer to situations where correlations between wetland hydrologic response metrics and spatial characteristics are consistently detected across all monitored rainfall runoff events such perfect temporal persistence would manifest through pie charts in figs 9 and 10 that are entirely gray or entirely black with no white patches however as can be seen from those two figures this situation was never observed most notably when considering open water wetlands there was not a single event for which a statistically significant correlation could be detected between pairs of variables such as lagtomaxwl versus catperi wlriserate versus area peri vol catarea cat2vol or elev recessdura versus catperi or sl wlrecessrate versus vol distance or sl and wlperchange versus vol fig 9 for pairs of variables other than the ones just listed large white patches in the pie charts show that for the vast majority of events no statistically significant correlation was detected between wetland hydrologic response metrics and spatial characteristics fig 9 worthy of note are some spatial characteristics i e cat2area conarea conperi totdrainarea and totdrain2catarea which were significantly correlated with key response metrics for a minority of events fig 9 for instance lagtomaxwl was negatively correlated with cat2vol and positively correlated with distance for about 30 and 20 of the monitored events respectively conversely recessdura was positively correlated with cat2vol and negatively correlated with distance for about 30 and 20 of the monitored events respectively fig 9 wlriserate was positively correlated with catperi for about 20 of the monitored events wlrecessrate was positively correlated with catarea and cat2vol and negatively correlated with elev for about 20 of the monitored events wlpercchange was positively correlated with distance and sl for about 20 and 25 of the monitored events respectively fig 9 some hydrologic response metrics did show both positive and negative correlations with some of the spatial characteristics e g correlation between lagtomaxwl recessdura wlpercchange and catarea fig 9 thus while none of the hydrologic response metrics could be described as showing temporally persistent correlation with any of the wetland spatial characteristics spatial characteristics such as catarea cat2vol catperi distance and sl showed somewhat temporally persistent correlations for multiple hydrologic response metrics fig 9 as was the case for open water wetlands temporally persistent spatial influences on hydrologic response were not detected for drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands fig 10 for instance cat2area cat2vol catperi and elev were not correlated with any of the response metrics fig 10 for some events catarea was correlated with wlrecessrate and length was correlated with wlpercchange however for some monitored events in drainage ditch sites spatial characteristics such as area peri vol conarea conperi and totdrain2catarea were significantly correlated with key response metrics for example wlriserate was negatively correlated with area peri vol conarea conperi and totdrain2catarea for about 20 of the monitored events wlrecessrate was positively correlated with area vol conarea conperi and totdrain2catarea and negatively correlated with catarea and totdrainarea for about 20 of the monitored events wlpercchange was negatively correlated with peri for about 20 of the monitored events fig 10 4 discussion 4 1 effective metrics of wetland hydrologic response one premise for the current study was that since stream hydrograph metrics provide useful information on watershed hydrologic function and help assess topographic and climatic controls on watershed hydrologic responses carey and woo 2001 chow et al 1988 a similar approach could be applied to individual wetlands to better understand wetland hydrologic function one hypothesis for the current study was also that metrics that capture most of the variability that exists among wetlands are the most suitable or effective for characterizing and comparing individual wetland response the high standard deviation values in space i e among wetlands estimated for some metrics e g wlriserate wlrecessrate and wlpercchange see table 4 suggest that some hydrologic metrics may indeed be better suited than others for contrasting the hydrologic response of different wetlands during rainfall runoff events the descriptive statistics reported in table 4 and fig 5 also indicate that wetland alteration status i e drained versus open water wetlands has a noticeable impact on wetland hydrologic responses this was evidenced by the consistently higher standard deviation values reflecting higher spatial and temporal variability for response metrics associated with drainage ditch sites linked to fully drained wetlands compared to those associated with open water wetlands table 4 and fig 5 average event rainfall intensity appeared to have more influence on the wlriserate of water tables below drainage ditch sites compared to the wlriserate of pond water level in open water wetlands fig 3 which further suggests a critical role of wetland alteration in modifying the degree to which a climatic control influences wetland hydrologic response pca results were also useful in demonstrating that not all response metrics derived from hydrograph analysis are equally important for characterizing the variability of wetland hydrologic response the stream focused literature is rich in descriptions of how response metrics derived from rainfall runoff hydrographs can reflect either the magnitude or the timing of the hydrologic response beven 2012 hannah et al 2000 response magnitude shows how effective a drainage area can be in converting rainfall into runoff dingman 2015 while response timing provides indirect information about the type of flow i e surface vs subsurface flow that dominates during a rainfall runoff event tallaksen 1995 in this wetland focused study metrics related to the magnitude of hydrologic response e g wlriserate wlrecessrate and wlpercchange were found to be important to assess and compare wetland hydrologic response regardless of wetland alteration status however metrics related to the timing of hydrologic response e g lagtomaxwl recessdura and maxrise tr appeared to be more important when assessing the variability in the hydrologic responses of drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands and less so when considering surface water dynamics in open water wetlands fig 4 the fact that metrics related to the magnitude of hydrologic response i e ability to produce runoff and store water were more commonly associated with high pca loading scores i e they captured a large portion of the variation in the hydrologic responses may suggest that runoff generation processes from the land surrounding the wetlands play an important role in explaining the short term event scale hydrologic behaviour of wetlands in the end through the pca multiple metrics were needed to adequately capture the majority of the variation in hydrologic response among different wetlands highlighting the importance of capturing the multiple facets of wetland hydrologic function even at short timescales similar conclusions about the need for multiple metrics to capture the multiple facets of hydrologic response have been put forward in previous studies focusing on stream and watershed dynamics e g ali et al 2010 carey and woo 2001 post and jakeman 1996 ross et al 2019 4 2 temporal variability in hydrologic response for open water wetlands the relative lack of temporal variability observed for the metrics related to the magnitude of hydrologic response e g wlriserate wlrecessrate and wlpercchange suggests that flow generation mechanisms leading to wetland water level change were temporally consistent the higher temporal variability observed in response magnitude for drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands compared to that observed for open water wetlands strongly suggests that climatic variables exert a stronger influence on subsurface flow dynamics i e beneath the ditches associated with drained wetlands compared to surface flow dynamics in open water wetlands fig 5 all the studied wetlands demonstrated considerable temporal variation for the metrics related to the timing of hydrologic response e g lagtomaxwl recessdura in the stream focused and watershed focused literature response timing is usually deemed to be influenced by rainfall pattern and antecedent moisture conditions carey and woo 2001 dingman 2015 along the same lines in the present wetland focused study temporal variations in response timing metrics could indicate that climatic conditions had a significant influence on the short term wetland storage dynamics regardless of the alteration status of the wetlands it should be noted that for drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands hydrologic response metrics were derived from data collected at the downstream extremity of the drainage ditches i e close to where they connect to the broughton s creek see fig 1 as opposed to upstream where the data would have more directly reflected the conditions prevailing in the former basin of the drained wetlands in light of that it may not be appropriate to compare the open water wetland metrics and the drainage ditch sites associated with the drained wetlands metrics the former are influenced by wetland catchment dynamics and ditch dynamics i e the former encompass travel distances from the wetland catchment to the wetland basin as well as travel distance along the ditch length between the wetland basin and the creek haque et al 2018 higher values of wlriserate and wlrecessrate for drainage ditch sites compared to open water wetlands could be an indication of the flashier nature subsurface flow dynamics fig 5 higher lagtomaxwl and wlriserate values compared to the recessdura and wlrecessrate values respectively suggest that the release of surface or subsurface water from wetlands or ditch sites was slower than the inflow of water towards them these observations not only support the idea that open water wetlands can effectively lower downstream flood peak by providing temporary storage of surface runoff during rainfall runoff events but also that open water wetlands can contribute to stream baseflow during dry conditions epa 2015 hayashi et al 2016 wang et al 2010 yang et al 2010 however this interpretation can be challenged based on the fact that we did not monitor groundwater levels and hydraulic gradients across the whole study area especially between open water wetland and the creek moreover considering daily data for the wetland and creek water level fluctuations may have failed to identify some of the smaller rainfall runoff events some wetlands also showed an unexplained decrease in water level during a rainfall event i e negative wlpercchange value in fig 5 from a theoretical standpoint if we considered pothole wetlands as closed systems then any input of water to them would increase surface water stage however numerous studies have suggested that despite their lack of visible surface connection pothole wetlands are not closed systems and can have subsurface as well as occasional surface connections with near by stream or wetlands epa 2015 haque et al 2018 leibowitz et al 2016 shaw et al 2012 thereby causing them to gain or lose water through mechanisms other than rainfall input the specific reason behind wetland water level decreases during some rainfall events included in our study however remains unknown almost all drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands showed partial recession for most of the studied events hinting at a prolonged contribution of subsurface flow after the rainfall runoff event had ended through the complex ditch drainage network figs 1 and 6 one alternative hypothesis might be that the partial recession of the water table below the drainage ditch sites is due to the proximity to the hyporheic zone of the adjacent stream resulting in higher water tables after a rainfall runoff event another alternative hypothesis might be that water first went into stream bank storage during high stage period before coming back out of storage thus creating a prolonged recession regarding open water wetlands about half of the open water wetlands them showed partial recession while the other half showed full recession for more than 50 of the studied events an open water wetland that showed frequent full recessions during the studied rainfall runoff events could indicate that water levels rose quickly and fell quickly because they were only fed by local or proximal surface and subsurface water therefore open water wetlands may be part of the isolated drainage system as described by other studies cohen et al 2016 epa 2015 haque et al 2018 leibowitz and nadeau 2003 leibowitz 2015 and could also be part of a system that is connected through subsurface flow as outlined by tiner 2003 conversely an open water wetland with frequent partial recession dynamics fig 6 could indicate that the wetland spilled and merged with another mccauley et al 2015 shaw et al 2012 which is why its water level remains high after the event has ended however spilling does not necessarily mean that a wetland is connected to a nearby stream but rather that it is connected to another wetland that may or may not be connected to a stream leibowitz et al 2016 shaw et al 2012 alternatively partial recession dynamics in open water wetlands could indicate longer memory effects in these wetlands memory effects were also observed in other studies that looked at storage dynamics in wetlands and they can be explained by slower drainage due to the time delay i e hysteresis between rainfall runoff and storage changes haque et al 2018 shook et al 2015 shook and pomeroy 2011 it should be noted that all the process hypotheses listed above cannot be tested due to the lack of comprehensive groundwater data or subsurface characterization of the study site future work is warranted to investigate whether some wetlands and ditches have a better hydraulic connection to the subsurface than others which would then explain differences in their relative abilities to reach full recession more quickly 4 3 characterizing wetland stream interaction wetland stream interaction is very difficult to quantify especially in the case of open water wetlands that have no visible surface connections between them and a stream the use of a correlation coefficient between wetland water levels and stream water levels may be especially difficult to gain process insights from since strong and statistically significant correlations might not necessarily reflect causality between wetland and stream hydrological dynamics but rather highlight the fact that similar drivers are behind stream and wetland dynamics additionally in the present study experimental setup the creek location where water levels were monitored is associated with a catchment area that is much greater than the target region in which the monitored wetlands are located this would make any claim of causality between local wetland hydrological dynamics and integrated catchment hydrological response very difficult to justify in the present study the decision was made not to use correlation coefficients but rather to use hysteresis loops to compare the timing of creek and wetland responses interpretations of possible wetland stream interaction scenarios can then be made based on identified timing differences or lack thereof between wetland and creek responses the presence of hysteresis figs 7 and 8 between wetland water level or ditch water table and creek water level may indicate a time delay between wetland storage change and stream response and hence provides indirect information about the travel time of water from wetland to stream shook et al 2015 shook and pomeroy 2011 the predominance of the counter clockwise hysteresis type figs 7 and 8 suggests that wetland water levels i e surface water dynamics or ditch water tables i e subsurface water dynamics responded before the creek water level during a rainfall runoff event as indicated by other studies this scenario is potentially indicative of wetland stream connectivity established via overland flow or shallow sub surface flow during rainfall runoff events haque et al 2018 shook et al 2015 shook and pomeroy 2011 however while the counter clockwise hysteresis type was predominant it was not the only one observed the temporal and spatial variations in wetland stream hysteresis types fig 8 observed in this study suggest that a complex combination of factors might be influencing short term wetland stream interaction such factors include spatial wetland characteristics but also antecedent wetness conditions and precipitation duration hewlett hibbert 1967 ross et al 2019 for one of the major rainfall runoff events monitored in this study i e event 4 table 2 and fig 7 all open water wetlands showed a clockwise hysteresis pattern while drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands showed a counter clockwise pattern these results suggest that the creek increased before the surface water level of open water wetlands but after water tables located underneath the drainage ditches based on these observations it is therefore unlikely that a connection between open water wetlands and the creek was established via fill spill or another overland flow generation mechanism however it is likely that ditches were connected to the creek through shallow subsurface flow and potentially overland flow if the water table intersected the ground surface for another major event that occurred in high antecedent moisture conditions i e event 15 table 2 and fig 7 all the studied wetlands regardless of their alteration status and all drainage ditch sites showed a counter clockwise hysteresis pattern suggesting that they were responding before the creek and may have been connected to it through fill spill or shallow subsurface flow the fact that all the studied wetlands and drainage ditch sites could switch between opposite hysteresis dynamics i e from clockwise to counter clockwise from one rainfall event to the next fig 7 indicates that the overall antecedent wetness or storage conditions and storage memory effects can exert a stronger control on wetland stream interactions compared to local landscape characteristics the presence of more spatially homogeneous hysteresis dynamics across wetlands during wet periods fig 7 could reflect the fact that wetter conditions promote greater hydrologic connectivity thus reducing the influence of individual wetland characteristics on wetland stream interaction hence in some situations the influence of individual wetland characteristics on wetland stream interaction may have been overcome by overall landscape conditions e g connectivity in contrast hydrologic connectivity is less widespread following dry antecedent conditions and is highly dependent on the ability of individual wetlands to generate flow an ability that is notably determined by the balance between wetland catchment area and wetland storage volume shaw et al 2012 4 4 predictability of spatial controls on wetland hydrologic response for open water wetlands a negative correlation between cat2vol and lagtomaxwl and a positive correlation between wlriserate and catperi fig 9 suggest that wetlands with larger catchment areas and with smaller water storage volumes tend to respond quickly during a rainfall runoff event furthermore cat2vol was positively correlated with recessdura and wlrecessrate was positively correlated with both cat2vol and catarea fig 9 suggesting that open water wetlands with proportionally larger catchment areas have slower and partial recession with high water levels persisting long after major rainfall runoff events this could also indicate that these wetlands have a longer storage memory as described in other studies shook et al 2015 shook and pomeroy 2011 for open water wetlands distance was positively correlated with lagtomaxwl and negatively correlated with recessdura fig 9 thereby hinting that the geographic location of a wetland plays an important role in determining wetland stream interaction the fact that wlpercchange was positively correlated with distance and sl fig 9 also hints that wetlands located far from the stream and with higher spill levels are less likely to interact with the stream through the fill spill mechanism while these observations support conclusions made by others regarding wetland to wetland and wetland to stream connectivity via fill spill mccauley et al 2015 shaw et al 2012 they also highlight the strong dependence of wetland stream or wetland wetland connectivity on distance especially when there is no visible surface connection i e drainage network between wetlands or between a wetland and a stream for drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands response magnitude metrics such as wlriserate were negatively correlated with area peri vol conarea conperi and totdrain2catarea fig 10 moreover metrics associated with the timing of hydrologic response e g lagtomaxwl recessdura for drainage ditch sites often showed no significant correlation with wetland spatial characteristics figs 9 and 10 the fact that wlrecessrate for water tables below ditch sites was positively correlated with conarea conperi and totdrain2catarea fig 10 is consistent with the hypothesis that the incremental contributing area for drained wetlands due to the physical alteration of historic wetlands see table 1 and fig 1 leads to enhanced hydrological fluctuations and shorter storage memory in the surrounding landscape including the water tables below drainage ditches such a hypothesis was advanced by haque et al 2018 who relied on annual and seasonal data to conclude that drained wetlands which have lost their water storage capacity do not have any noticeable storage memory due to their physical alteration while investigating hydrologic response metrics in different climatic and geographic settings ross et al 2019 showed that the average slope of a catchment can significantly influence stream hydrologic response metrics however the present study did not investigate the influence of slope parameters on wetland hydrologic response metrics for wetlands the fact that some pairs of response metrics and spatial characteristics were positively correlated for some events and negatively correlated for others highlights the difficulty in identifying consistent or temporally persistent spatial controls on wetland dynamics no single wetland characteristic was found to be significantly correlated to any wetland hydrologic response metric for more than 50 of the monitored events suggesting that the wetland spatial characteristics evaluated here are not good predictors of the spatial variability of wetland hydrologic response and that other characteristics should be considered significant correlations were observed during the events that occurred after the spring melt or following a wet period and during big events this could mean that greater hydrologic connectivity due to wetter conditions enhances the influence of spatial characteristics on wetland hydrologic responses one thing to note is that figs 9 and 10 represent multiple comparisons i e calculating statistically significant correlations between each pair of hydrologic response metrics and wetland landscape characteristic for individual events and then looking at the temporal consistency for each of the correlation and we did not use any adjustment to prevent occurrences of errors or false positives 5 conclusion this study focused on the hydrologic responses of pothole wetlands the interaction between pothole wetlands and a nearby stream and the temporal persistence of spatial controls on individual wetland hydrological response in the prairie pothole region relying on high frequency water level data averaged to daily timesteps and a detailed landscape analysis this study aimed to enhance our understanding of wetland hydrologic function and its controls especially at the timescale of individual rainfall events that is typically not documented in the existing literature while the number of sites investigated in this study was relatively small i e 13 open water wetlands and 7 drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands and did not allow for formal hypothesis tests the results outlined above highlight the high variability in site specific wetland hydrologic response even within a small study area in relation to research objective 1 one major conclusion of this study is that wetland alteration status i e drained versus consolidated versus intact appears to play an important role in explaining the short term event scale hydrologic behaviour of pothole wetlands analyses related to research objective 2 indicate that climatic factors which encompass not only rainfall event characteristics but also antecedent conditions also had a noticeable influence on wetland hydrologic response however the alteration status appeared to modify the degree to which some climatic factors influence wetland hydrologic response results related to research objective 3 show that while a complex combination of factors appeared to influence short term wetland stream interaction antecedent wetness or storage conditions and storage memory seemed to be the driving factors analyses related to research objective 4 rather suggested that the lack of temporally persistent correlations i e from one rainfall event to another between hydrologic response metrics and spatial characteristics either indicates that spatial controls on wetland hydrologic function vary greatly over short timescales or that the spatial characteristics considered in this study are not good predictors of event scale wetland hydrologic response resorting to event scale analyses rather than more commonly relied upon annual and seasonal analyses not only led to the confirmation of findings from previous studies but also allowed some new process related hypotheses to be put forward for future testing provided that higher resolution precipitation data both spatially and temporally become available future work could focus on all instances of short term wetland water level fluctuations with the aim to distinguish dynamics attributable to direct precipitation i e rainfall and snowmelt events from dynamics controlled by diel cycles or surface water groundwater exchanges since the present study did not consider spatial characteristics related to catchment slope land use pattern soil types and soil hydraulic conductivity and wetland vegetation types further research is needed to either validate or invalidate the

3839,previous studies in the prairie pothole region mainly assessed wetland hydrologic function at seasonal annual and decadal scales while many studies have looked at water balance dynamics and local flow generation processes in wetlands no study looked at hydrological dynamics in response to individual rainfall events in prairie pothole wetlands here after referred as wetlands across a gradient of alteration the present study aimed to investigate 1 the most important metrics needed to characterize the spatial variability of wetland hydrologic response to rainfall runoff events 2 the temporal variability of individual wetland hydrologic response 3 the spatial and temporal variability of wetland stream interaction and 4 the temporal persistence of various spatial controls on individual wetland hydrologic response characteristics high frequency water level data was collected over two years for ten intact three consolidated and seven drainage ditches associated with fully drained wetland s as well as a creek located in southwestern manitoba canada the hydrologic response of the studied wetlands to individual rainfall runoff events was characterized using a range of metrics several data analysis methods were used including principal component analysis graphical assessments of wetland stream hysteresis dynamics and correlations analyses between wetland response metrics and spatial characteristics results suggested that wetland alteration status i e drained versus intact open water wetlands plays an important role in explaining differences in the event scale hydrologic behaviour of wetlands climatic and antecedent storage conditions i e surface and subsurface storage in wetland basin also had a strong influence on the hydrologic responses of wetlands during individual rainfall runoff events and appeared to override the influence of spatial controls such as wetland area volume or catchment area antecedent storage also seemed to be the driving factor of wetland stream interactions a lack of persistent correlations between wetland spatial characteristics and response metrics was observed and suggested nonstationary wetland hydrological behaviours and controls a conclusion that has significant implications for wetland classification and modelling keywords rainfall runoff events prairie pothole region wetland hydrologic response wetland stream interactions spatial wetland characteristics 1 introduction event based analysis of stream hydrographs is commonly used for investigating dominant runoff generation processes in a watershed gou et al 2019 kirchner 2019 specifically different event hydrograph metrics related to the magnitude and timing of hydrograph response can be used to infer watershed dynamic storage and release mechanisms blume et al 2007 kirchner 2019 further the event based analysis of hydrographs sometimes in combination with chemographs has highlighted the importance of nonlinear relationships either in the form of input output thresholds or input output loops loop like behaviours have been notably described as hysteretic relationships whereby a given variable exhibits significantly different dynamics on the rising and falling limbs of a stream hydrograph gharari and razavi 2018 zuecco et al 2016 event based hydrograph analysis approaches have been seldom used in non stream settings however the literature contains few instances of event scale analyses of wetland dynamics and in these instances the goal was to better understand the processes that govern stormflow production in a forested groundwater fed wetland waddington et al 1993 to estimate hydrodynamic parameters moezzibadi et al 2019 and to explain pollution attenuation andrea 2016 in constructed wetlands and to support wetland restoration initiatives in northern peatlands ketcheson and price 2011 event based hydrograph analysis has yet to be applied to smaller yet important types of naturally occuring wetlands such as prairie pothole wetlands especially in landscapes which are dominated by such features extensive wetland loss has taken place around the world in the last 50 years and especially so in archetypical landscapes such as the prairie pothole region ppr van meter and basu 2015 historically draining small wetlands in the ppr required minimum effort and farmers did it for the convenience of agricultural operation van meter and basu 2015 however in some cases multiple small pothole wetlands are drained into one large one i e a consolidated wetland this in an attempt to compensate the loss of small wetlands by creating a large one haque et al 2018 mccauley et al 2015 pothole wetlands therefore offer a unique opportunity to study the hydrological behaviour of small watershed features that exist along a continuum of alteration from intact to consolidated and fully drained while wetland hydrological dynamics can be described using several variables epa 2015 mitsch and gosselink 2007 pond water level hereafter simply referred to as water level is typically relied upon because it is easy to monitor and helpful in understanding changes in surface water storage in watersheds park et al 2014 and hayashi et al 2016 identified precipitation and evapotranspiration as key controls on pond permanence hayashi et al 2016 in addition to those two variables pond water level fluctuations are also known to depend on lateral water inputs to the wetland especially in response to rainfall runoff events hayashi et al 2016 shook et al 2013 during and after such events wetlands that belong to wetland complexes can be inter connected and connected to streams through overland i e via fill spill events and shallow subsurface flow numerous studies have characterized individual or cumulative wetland hydrologic function in a watershed context e g bullock and acreman 2003 epa 2015 gleason et al 2007 haan and johnson 1968 hayashi et al 2003 hayashi et al 2016 huang et al 2011 huang et al 2013 hubbard and linder 1986 johnston et al 1990 lindsay et al 2004 mcallister et al 2000 mclaughlin et al 2014 tiner 2003 wang et al 2010 yang et al 2010 but they have almost exclusively done so over intermediate to long timescales in the ppr in particular recent examples include the assessment of wetland hydrologic function through field data or models at seasonal and annual scales ali et al 2017 brannen et al 2015 euliss and mushet 1996 golden et al 2014 haque et al 2018 hayashi et al 2016 as well as decadal scales ehsanzadeh et al 2016 hayashi et al 2016 one major gap in the current literature is the assessment of individual pothole wetland hydrological dynamics over short timescales namely specific snowmelt or rainfall events in a manner similar to streams that can exhibit a wide range of flow responses to snowmelt or rainfall subdued or sharp water level fluctuations can also occur in pothole wetlands as a function of precipitation intensity antecedent water storage conditions and other factors haque et al 2018 as the ppr is characterized by a semi arid to sub humid climate extreme rainfall events i e in terms of duration and total precipitation and associated rainfall triggered floods were rare until recently dumanski et al 2015 as a result the hydrologic response of pothole wetlands hereafter simply referred to as wetlands to these events is poorly understood the stream focused literature has frequently highlighted that more process insights can be gained from event scale hydrograph analyses e g blume et al 2007 gorski and zimmer 2021 compared to annual or seasonal water balance analyses for instance however it is unclear whether event scale analyses of wetland hydrologic dynamics would also lead to more process insights focusing on wetland hydrological dynamics over short timescales is especially important in the context of land use and climate change as some regions around the world including the ppr are expected to face increased frequencies of extreme but short lived rainfall runoff events khaliq et al 2015 pfahl et al 2017 the present study therefore aims to rely on high frequency pond water level water table and stream water level data combined with a detailed landscape analysis to investigate 1 the most important metrics needed to characterize the spatial variability of wetland hydrologic response to rainfall runoff events 2 the temporal variability of individual wetland hydrologic response 3 the spatial and temporal variability of wetland stream interaction and 4 the temporal persistence of various spatial controls on individual wetland hydrologic response characteristics 2 methods 2 1 study site description the broughton s creek is a tributary of the little saskatchewan river and is located in southwestern manitoba canada fig 1 a it drains an area of approximately 252 km2 fig 1b within the prairie pothole region ppr the ppr is a vast and hydrologically biogeochemically and ecologically important area in north america spanning canada and the united states where numerous topographic depressions or small basins left by glacier retreat have created a dense network of pothole wetlands small lakes and streams average density 13basins km2 range 1 195 basins km2 u s fish and wildlife service 2010 those densities are however changing since rapid agricultural intensification in the ppr has led to significant surface water drainage activities johnston 2013 most pothole wetlands are completely surrounded by uplands without continuous or well defined surface connections to streams cohen et al 2016 leibowitz and nadeau 2003 leibowitz 2015 mushet et al 2015 tiner 2003 even with small surface area less than1 000 m2 the hydrological dynamics prevailing in individual pothole wetlands are thought to exert a significant influence on overall watershed hydrology such as storing snowmelt runoff cohen et al 2016 hayashi et al 2003 mushet et al 2015 individual pothole wetland hydrological behavior is also controlled by static landscape properties such as wetland geometry geographic position and alteration status haque et al 2018 hayashi et al 2016 for instance fill spill events are possible for intact partially drained and consolidated pothole wetlands mccauley et al 2015 shaw et al 2012 but no longer exist in the case of fully drained pothole wetlands fully drained pothole wetlands can nevertheless contribute water to downstream systems by generating surface and shallow subsurface flow haque et al 2018 the broughton s creek watershed can be described as a typical ppr landscape which was created between 20 000 to 12 000b c due to the retreat of the assiniboine glacial lobe wang et al 2010 yang et al 2010 it has numerous potholes sloughs and lakes and is described as a hummocky till plain most soils in the watershed are well drained newdale association soils i e mainly orthic black chernozems however some near stream locations also have soils from the dorset drokan eroded slope complex and jaymar associations mafri 2008 wang et al 2010 according to the u s soil taxonomic classification the udic boroll subgroups have similar properties as soils from the newdale dorset and jaymar associations soil classification working group 1998 most of the land in the broughton s creek watershed is used for agricultural purposes 71 4 followed by rangeland 10 8 wetland 9 8 forest 4 and other uses 4 detailed landscape change detection studies have shown that between 1968 and 2005 approximately 21 of the wetland area in the watershed has been lost i e those are currently fully drained wetlands that no longer have an open water component however 70 of the wetland area has been impacted when we account for all hydrological alterations including partly drained wetlands and farmed wetlands wang et al 2010 for continuous monitoring of wetland hydrology thirteen open water wetlands and seven drainage ditches associated with fully drained wetlands were selected on both sides of a 5 km creek reach in the broughton s creek watershed see fig 1c for the exact locations out of the thirteen open water wetlands ten are intact wetlands i e hydrologically undisturbed wetlands and the remaining three are consolidated wetlands according to ducks unlimited canada s duc wetland inventory established for the watershed there were no morphological changes to the intact wetlands in the last 60 years however multiple wetlands were drained to form a consolidated wetland see example in fig 1d as for drainage ditches they have visible surface connections to the creek reach and are typically located downslope of fully drained wetlands for the present study drainage ditch sites were selected based on the same previously mentioned wetland inventory dataset which includes the location of historic wetlands and confirms their role in diverting water from the drained wetland basins to the creek reach as indicated by haque et al 2018 these ditches are barely incised and have accumulated a lot of eroded materials over time hence while they do not behave like conventional conveyance channels allowing concentrated water flow they are associated with shallow fluctuating water tables that can rise above the ground surface and result in ponding water surface water flow through those ditches is rare except during heavy rainfall and occurs in a diffuse manner very similar to surface runoff 2 2 wetland spatial characteristics a series of wetland spatial characteristics table 1 were calculated for all studied wetlands i e open water and fully drained using the wetland inventory dataset provided by duc for open water wetlands duc used the v a h method minke et al 2010 hayashi and van der kamp 2000 pomeroy et al 2010 to calculate storage volume since this method can estimate volume below the standing water from lidar data however for drained wetlands the surface volume tool in esri arcgis was used to calculate volume from lidar data the areas of the open water wetlands range from 7 4 102 to 1 5 105 m2 while their storage volumes range from 7 4 101 to 4 4 104 m3 the drained wetlands associated with the instrumented ditches had areas and storage volumes ranging from 7 8 102 to 1 3 104 m2 and 1 5 102 to 7 0 103 m3 respectively for open water wetlands the euclidean distance between the center of the wetland and the edge of the creek was used instead of the euclidean or the flowpath distance between the wetland spilling point and the creek the choice of the euclidean rather than flowpath distance was made to avoid the uncertainty associated with the use of gis based flow direction algorithms in mostly flat landscapes also as the monitored prairie pothole wetlands do not have an stablished outlet unique spilling points were not identifiable from field observations or satellite images euclidean distances estimated between each open water wetland and the study creek reach range from 4 7 102 to 1 0 103 m whereas ditch lengths for the drained wetlands range from 9 3 101 2 2 102 m catchment areas for the open water and drained wetlands range from 6 0 103 3 1 105 m2 and 9 8 103 9 0 104 m2 respectively some spatial characteristics such as the incremental contributing area conarea and the total drainage area totdrainarea are only relevant for the consolidated open water wetlands and drained wetlands the incremental contributing area of a consolidated wetland was calculated by summing up the catchment areas of all the drained wetlands that pre existed the consolidated wetland similarly the totdrainarea of a consolidated wetlands was estimated as the sum of its original catchment area and its incremental contributing area 2 3 hydrometric and climate data collection a capacitance based water level logger with approximately 2 to 5 mm accuracy odysseytm dataflow systems was installed at the downstream end of the creek reach i e south end and in each open water wetland using stilling wells to record hourly surface water level fluctuations for each of the drainage ditches associated with fully drained wetlands a one meter deep water table well was installed to house the same kind of logger for measuring hourly shallow water table fluctuations abs pipes 1 5 in diameter screened over the 0 15 1 00 m soil depth range were used for the water table wells continuous monitoring of the creek reach open water wetlands and ditches associated with fully drained wetlands was done during the 2013 and 2014 open water seasons i e april to october the study area within which all monitored wetlands are located is quite small about 15 km2 and it was assumed not to be subject to noticeable spatial variability in rainfall the closest environment and climate change canada weather station brandon a climate id 5010481 world meteorological organization wmo id 71140 is located about 30 km south west from the study location other researchers relied on the data from that station and found it representative of weather in the broughton s creek watershed wang et al 2010 yang et al 2010 climate data pertaining to air temperature and daily rainfall amounts were extracted from the historical record available for that weather station mean air temperature was similar in both study years 13 5 c in april october 2013 and 2014 whereas total open water season precipitation was higher in 2014 i e 523 4 mm compared to 2013 i e 402 8 mm however total open water season precipitation in both years was higher than the long term 1960 2014 average i e 344 2 mm in that region 2 4 rainfall runoff event delineation and response metrics daily average surface or subsurface water levels were calculated from the hourly recorded data for all the open water wetlands the drainage ditch sites associated with drained wetlands and the creek reach average daily values were used simply to avoid dealing with regular diurnal fluctuations or cycles in pond water level that occur irrespective of rainfall runoff events notably as a result of the strong evaporative signal in the region we used wetland fullness values i e we divided the wetland water depth by the wetland spillage level measured manually in the field for open water wetlands as in haque et al 2018 using wetland fullness values allowed us to normalize water level data for comparing wetlands with each other for reasons related to data availability the focus of this study was solely on rainfall runoff events and snowmelt events were not considered the start and end dates of rainfall runoff events were identified from the creek data only i e by manually matching daily rainfall amounts and daily creek water level timeseries creek response was defined as a water level increase of more than 5 mm from one day to the next followed by a peak and then a decrease smaller than 5 mm increases were not considered as the initiation of creek response as they could be measurement error or noise within the accuracy range of the water level loggers based on creek response a total of 17 rainfall runoff events were identified across the 2013 2014 open water seasons table 2 for each studied wetland surface water level fluctuations or water table fluctuations were examined across the whole duration of each event it should be reiterated that the ditches associated with drained wetlands are barely incised channels and therefore any water occasionally moving through them should be seen as diffuse overland flow and not channelized flow because of the very transient nature of standing water or flowing water in the ditches we decided not to separately consider water table fluctuations below the ditches and the occasional water ponding effects or generation of overland flow at the surface instead we considered any of the two surface or subsurface water dynamics to be the manifestation of a hydrologic response linked to the location of historical wetlands which have now been drained similar to creek response wetland response was identified as the presence of a rise in pond water level i e greater than 5 mm departure from pre event water level followed by a peak and then a decrease for the present study wetlands responses were only identified between the start and end dates of the events identified based on creek water level fluctuations see above this methodological choice was motivated by the fact that the goal of the present study was not to characterize all periods during which wetlands may have experienced water level fluctuations which could be caused by recent precipitation but also by other phenomena instead the focus was solely on periods during which noticeable creek water level fluctuations were observed in response to rainfall with the aim to assess whether wetlands located in the surrounding landscape were also experiencing water level fluctuations at the same time fig 2 a series of thirteen hydrologic response metrics were estimated for each of the studied wetlands and drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands and for each of the rainfall runoff events table 3 these metrics were chosen based on their proven usefulness as described in the stream focused literature for instance event peak flow rates have been documented across many watersheds and linked to catchment area hannah et al 2000 response lag times have also been reported as important notably the lag to peak flow defined as the time elapsed from the beginning of the rising limb to the occurrence of the peak flow rate is a good indicator of a watershed s ability to delay its response to a rainfall event beven 2012 hannah et al 2000 chow et al 1988 as for recession rates they describe the rate of change in flow during the receding limb of a hydrograph and have been linked to watershed spatial characteristics such as depressional surface and subsurface storage hannah et al 2000 chow et al 1988 seasonal and annual average values of hydrograph metrics have also been correlated to watershed spatial characteristics making it possible to estimate the former as a function of the latter for example yadav et al 2007 showed that rainfall runoff response characteristics such as the runoff ratio and the slope of the flow duration curve of ungauged watersheds can be expressed as a function of watershed topography i e slope subsurface geology and soils characteristics buttle 2006 also argued that rainfall runoff responses can be explained by three first order controls typology topography and topology similar to traditional hydrograph analysis for streams metrics such as the maximum water level i e maxwl final water level i e finalwl and water level percentage change i e wlpercchange were estimated in the present study to get a sense of changes in actual wetland storage metrics like the lag to maximum water level i e lagtomaxwl water level rise rate i e wlriserate and water level recession rate i e wlrecessrate were also estimated to understand the temporal dynamics of storage change for individual open water wetlands and drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands during a rainfall runoff event almost all the studied wetlands responded noticeably during each of the identified rainfall runoff events the exceptions were events 5 and 6 where more than 50 of the studied wetlands did not appear to respond to rainfall table 2 for event 5 during the identified event period the 28 5 mm of rain occurred in two days with four days without rain in between possibly as a result of two convective storms or thunderstorms wetland water levels rose and fell in less than a day and those fluctuations were not noticeable when using daily data moreover due to the nature of the convective storms or thunderstorms it is possible that the rain at the site was less than the rain at the weather station which is why the wetlands at the site did not appear to respond for those two events wetland response metrics were null zero values and were not reported in result tables and figures below 2 5 statistical analyses since open water wetlands were characterized using surface water levels and drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands were characterized using subsurface water levels each research objective was addressed separately for open water and drained wetlands to identify the most important metrics needed to characterize the spatial variability of wetland hydrologic response i e research objective 1 principal component analysis pca was performed pca a statistical data reduction technique identifies the combinations of original variables i e the principal components that explain the maximum variation in a dataset jolliffe 2011 in the present study pca was performed for each event considering all the hydrologic metrics calculated across all the open water or drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands for that event it should be noted that pca was not performed for events 5 and 6 as they were associated with zero values metrics for many wetlands and some of the assumptions underlying pca are violated with datasets that contain many zeros legendre and legendre 2012 the hydrologic response metrics that contributed the most to the first and second principal components i e had a loading score of 0 50 or higher for one of the first two principal components were deemed to be the metrics that explain the maximum variation across the wetlands the metrics that consistently i e across multiple events had high loading scores on the first two principal components were retained for further analysis to address research objective 2 i e to investigate the temporal variability of individual wetland hydrologic response boxplots were created for the metrics that were retained after pca to address research objective 3 i e to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of wetland stream interaction an analysis of hysteretic behaviors was done several studies in the stream focused literature have looked at examples of hysteretic relationships between streamflow and other hydrological variables e g antecedent storage travel times water level etc during individual rainfall runoff events andermann et al 2012 burt et al 2015 davies and beven 2015 fovet et al 2015 gharari and razavi 2018 shook and pomeroy 2011 valkama and olli 2017 zuecco et al 2016 other studies have rather looked at the hysteretic behaviour between streamflow and water quality variables such as stream nitrate and total phosphorus concentrations lloyd et al 2016 valkama and olli 2017 bedload and suspended sediment concentrations mao et al 2014 landers and sturm 2013 valkama and olli 2017 overall event based hydrograph analysis approaches have been successfully used to conceptualize stream and broad watershed processes in the present study for each of the events and each studied wetland and drainage ditch site a scatter plot of wetland water level x axis versus creek water level y axis was built to examine wetland stream hysteresis dynamics hysteresis curves were classified into five different types namely linear i e no hysteresis clockwise counter clockwise eight shaped and unclear the percent time that each hysteresis type was observed for each wetland or drainage ditch site was then computed lastly to address research objective 4 i e to investigate the temporal persistence of spatial controls on individual wetland hydrologic response characteristics spearman s rank correlation coefficients were calculated between wetland spatial characteristics table 1 and selected wetland hydrologic response metrics for individual rainfall events spearman s rank correlation coefficients were evaluated at the 95 significance level contrary to the commonly used pearson correlation coefficient the spearman s rank correlation coefficient does not assume a normal distribution of the data and is used to assess both linear and nonlinear relations between variables sokal and rohlf 2012 the matlab statistics and machine learning toolbox release 2017b was used for performing pca and calculating the spearman s rank correlation coefficients 3 results 3 1 event characteristics and metrics of wetland hydrologic response total rainfall and average rainfall intensity were strongly positively correlated spearman correlation coefficient 0 72 p value 0 003 across all rainfall runoff events as shown graphically in fig 3 a visual assessment of fig 3 reveals that average rainfall intensities of more than 10 mm day led to noticeable increases in the subsurface water level rise rate of ditch sites associated with drained wetlands whereas no noticeable change was observed above that same rainfall intensity for open water wetlands fig 3 simple descriptive statistics show that some hydrologic response metrics have greater spatial variability i e vary more among the studied wetlands relative to others table 4 for example metrics like wlriserate wlrecessrate and wlpercchange had noticeably greater standard deviation values for both open water and ditch sites compared to other metrics pca showed that not all the calculated hydrologic response metrics were equally effective at capturing variation in wetland hydrologic behavior during individual rainfall runoff events out of the 13 calculated hydrologic response metrics only 8 had loading scores exceeding 0 50 on either the first or the second principal component for at least one rainfall runoff event fig 4 on one hand response metrics such as wlriserate wlrecessrate and wlpercchange were able to capture a large portion of the variation in hydrologic response for both open water wetlands and drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands for almost all the studied rainfall runoff events on the other hand metrics such as lagtomaxwl recessdura and maxrise tr were only able to capture a good portion of the variation in the hydrologic response of drainage ditch sites fig 4 hence for further analyses only selected metrics were retained as they had loading scores exceeding 0 50 on either the first or the second principal component for at least one rainfall runoff event namely lagtomaxwl wlriserate recessdura wlrecessrate wlpercchange maxrise tr maxrise tr ar1 and maxrise tr ar7 3 2 temporal variability of individual wetland hydrologic response the metrics retained after synthesizing the pca results were used to study the temporal variability of individual hydrologic responses across the studied wetlands and drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands figs 4 and 5 when focusing on open water wetlands alone most of the metrics did not show considerable temporal variation i e variation from one event to another illustrated by the small interquartile range of the blue boxes on the boxplot figures except for lagtomaxwl and recessdura fig 5 the lagtomaxwl metric had noticeably lower values i e mostly between 1 and 4 days compared to recessdura i e mostly between 3 and 8 days for the open water wetlands also wlriserate had higher values i e mostly less than 50 mm day compared to wlrecessrate i e mostly less than 20 mm day fig 5 for individual open water wetlands wlpercchange had mostly positive values there were no major differences between the maxrise tr and maxrise tr ar7 metrics in terms of absolute values or temporal variability i e interquartile range fig 5 the event response dynamics observed for drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands were different than those observed for open water wetlands indeed for most of the response metrics drainage ditch sites showed noticeably higher temporal variability compared to the open water wetlands i e red boxes have higher interquartile range than blue boxes on the boxplot figures suggesting that subsurface water storage dynamics were more variable over the short term event to event scale than wetland surface water storage dynamics except for the recessdura metric drainage ditch sites usually had higher values for all the metrics compared to open water wetlands fig 5 with very few exceptions e g d2 and d7 in general individual drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands showed lower lagtomaxwl values compared to the recessdura values similarly wlriserate had considerably higher values i e mostly less than 150 mm day compared to wlrecessrate i e mostly less than 50 mm day fig 5 drainage ditch sites had mostly positive wlpercchange for individual drainage ditch sites there were no noticeable differences between metrics such as maxrise tr maxrise tr ar1 and maxrise tr ar7 however site d5 always had noticeably higher median values compared to the other drainage ditch sites for these metrics all drainage ditch sites showed partial recession for most of the studied rainfall runoff events meaning that their final water table level at the end of a rainfall runoff event was higher than the initial water table level recorded before the event started conversely more than half of the open water wetlands showed full recession for most of the rainfall runoff events fig 6 3 3 spatial and temporal variability of wetland stream interaction there were considerable spatial and temporal variations in wetland stream interaction patterns i e hysteresis loop shapes across the studied wetlands figs 7 and 8 for example during rainfall runoff event 4 most of the open water wetlands were associated with a wetland stream clockwise hysteretic pattern contrary to most drainage ditch sites that were rather associated with a counter clockwise pattern fig 7 some rainfall runoff events showed a lot of spatial variability with individual open water wetlands having different hysteretic patterns e g event 12 conversely a single dominant hysteretic pattern could emerge across all studied wetlands for some events as was the case with the counter clockwise pattern in event 15 fig 7 the spatial variation i e wetland to wetland variation in hysteresis types was more pronounced for events that occurred following dry conditions and or when precipitation duration was short as shown in fig 7 for event 2 in contrast more spatial homogeneity in hysteresis types was observed for longer duration precipitation events and or with wet antecedent conditions as evidenced in fig 7 for event 15 table 2 and fig 7 more importantly when considering individual wetlands one at a time hysteresis patterns were not temporally consistent i e the same wetland was not consistently associated with the same hysteretic pattern for different rainfall runoff events figs 7 and 8 during the study period although most wetlands switched between the five hysteresis types the counter clockwise type was the most common regardless of wetland alteration status fig 8 geographic proximity was not a good predictor of the spatial homogeneity or heterogeneity of hysteresis types very different hysteresis patterns were sometimes obtained for wetlands located close to each other e g i1 and i2 c1 and c2 or d5 and d6 figs 1 and 8 3 4 temporal persistence of spatial controls on individual wetland hydrologic response in the context of this study the phrase temporal persistence is used to refer to situations where correlations between wetland hydrologic response metrics and spatial characteristics are consistently detected across all monitored rainfall runoff events such perfect temporal persistence would manifest through pie charts in figs 9 and 10 that are entirely gray or entirely black with no white patches however as can be seen from those two figures this situation was never observed most notably when considering open water wetlands there was not a single event for which a statistically significant correlation could be detected between pairs of variables such as lagtomaxwl versus catperi wlriserate versus area peri vol catarea cat2vol or elev recessdura versus catperi or sl wlrecessrate versus vol distance or sl and wlperchange versus vol fig 9 for pairs of variables other than the ones just listed large white patches in the pie charts show that for the vast majority of events no statistically significant correlation was detected between wetland hydrologic response metrics and spatial characteristics fig 9 worthy of note are some spatial characteristics i e cat2area conarea conperi totdrainarea and totdrain2catarea which were significantly correlated with key response metrics for a minority of events fig 9 for instance lagtomaxwl was negatively correlated with cat2vol and positively correlated with distance for about 30 and 20 of the monitored events respectively conversely recessdura was positively correlated with cat2vol and negatively correlated with distance for about 30 and 20 of the monitored events respectively fig 9 wlriserate was positively correlated with catperi for about 20 of the monitored events wlrecessrate was positively correlated with catarea and cat2vol and negatively correlated with elev for about 20 of the monitored events wlpercchange was positively correlated with distance and sl for about 20 and 25 of the monitored events respectively fig 9 some hydrologic response metrics did show both positive and negative correlations with some of the spatial characteristics e g correlation between lagtomaxwl recessdura wlpercchange and catarea fig 9 thus while none of the hydrologic response metrics could be described as showing temporally persistent correlation with any of the wetland spatial characteristics spatial characteristics such as catarea cat2vol catperi distance and sl showed somewhat temporally persistent correlations for multiple hydrologic response metrics fig 9 as was the case for open water wetlands temporally persistent spatial influences on hydrologic response were not detected for drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands fig 10 for instance cat2area cat2vol catperi and elev were not correlated with any of the response metrics fig 10 for some events catarea was correlated with wlrecessrate and length was correlated with wlpercchange however for some monitored events in drainage ditch sites spatial characteristics such as area peri vol conarea conperi and totdrain2catarea were significantly correlated with key response metrics for example wlriserate was negatively correlated with area peri vol conarea conperi and totdrain2catarea for about 20 of the monitored events wlrecessrate was positively correlated with area vol conarea conperi and totdrain2catarea and negatively correlated with catarea and totdrainarea for about 20 of the monitored events wlpercchange was negatively correlated with peri for about 20 of the monitored events fig 10 4 discussion 4 1 effective metrics of wetland hydrologic response one premise for the current study was that since stream hydrograph metrics provide useful information on watershed hydrologic function and help assess topographic and climatic controls on watershed hydrologic responses carey and woo 2001 chow et al 1988 a similar approach could be applied to individual wetlands to better understand wetland hydrologic function one hypothesis for the current study was also that metrics that capture most of the variability that exists among wetlands are the most suitable or effective for characterizing and comparing individual wetland response the high standard deviation values in space i e among wetlands estimated for some metrics e g wlriserate wlrecessrate and wlpercchange see table 4 suggest that some hydrologic metrics may indeed be better suited than others for contrasting the hydrologic response of different wetlands during rainfall runoff events the descriptive statistics reported in table 4 and fig 5 also indicate that wetland alteration status i e drained versus open water wetlands has a noticeable impact on wetland hydrologic responses this was evidenced by the consistently higher standard deviation values reflecting higher spatial and temporal variability for response metrics associated with drainage ditch sites linked to fully drained wetlands compared to those associated with open water wetlands table 4 and fig 5 average event rainfall intensity appeared to have more influence on the wlriserate of water tables below drainage ditch sites compared to the wlriserate of pond water level in open water wetlands fig 3 which further suggests a critical role of wetland alteration in modifying the degree to which a climatic control influences wetland hydrologic response pca results were also useful in demonstrating that not all response metrics derived from hydrograph analysis are equally important for characterizing the variability of wetland hydrologic response the stream focused literature is rich in descriptions of how response metrics derived from rainfall runoff hydrographs can reflect either the magnitude or the timing of the hydrologic response beven 2012 hannah et al 2000 response magnitude shows how effective a drainage area can be in converting rainfall into runoff dingman 2015 while response timing provides indirect information about the type of flow i e surface vs subsurface flow that dominates during a rainfall runoff event tallaksen 1995 in this wetland focused study metrics related to the magnitude of hydrologic response e g wlriserate wlrecessrate and wlpercchange were found to be important to assess and compare wetland hydrologic response regardless of wetland alteration status however metrics related to the timing of hydrologic response e g lagtomaxwl recessdura and maxrise tr appeared to be more important when assessing the variability in the hydrologic responses of drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands and less so when considering surface water dynamics in open water wetlands fig 4 the fact that metrics related to the magnitude of hydrologic response i e ability to produce runoff and store water were more commonly associated with high pca loading scores i e they captured a large portion of the variation in the hydrologic responses may suggest that runoff generation processes from the land surrounding the wetlands play an important role in explaining the short term event scale hydrologic behaviour of wetlands in the end through the pca multiple metrics were needed to adequately capture the majority of the variation in hydrologic response among different wetlands highlighting the importance of capturing the multiple facets of wetland hydrologic function even at short timescales similar conclusions about the need for multiple metrics to capture the multiple facets of hydrologic response have been put forward in previous studies focusing on stream and watershed dynamics e g ali et al 2010 carey and woo 2001 post and jakeman 1996 ross et al 2019 4 2 temporal variability in hydrologic response for open water wetlands the relative lack of temporal variability observed for the metrics related to the magnitude of hydrologic response e g wlriserate wlrecessrate and wlpercchange suggests that flow generation mechanisms leading to wetland water level change were temporally consistent the higher temporal variability observed in response magnitude for drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands compared to that observed for open water wetlands strongly suggests that climatic variables exert a stronger influence on subsurface flow dynamics i e beneath the ditches associated with drained wetlands compared to surface flow dynamics in open water wetlands fig 5 all the studied wetlands demonstrated considerable temporal variation for the metrics related to the timing of hydrologic response e g lagtomaxwl recessdura in the stream focused and watershed focused literature response timing is usually deemed to be influenced by rainfall pattern and antecedent moisture conditions carey and woo 2001 dingman 2015 along the same lines in the present wetland focused study temporal variations in response timing metrics could indicate that climatic conditions had a significant influence on the short term wetland storage dynamics regardless of the alteration status of the wetlands it should be noted that for drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands hydrologic response metrics were derived from data collected at the downstream extremity of the drainage ditches i e close to where they connect to the broughton s creek see fig 1 as opposed to upstream where the data would have more directly reflected the conditions prevailing in the former basin of the drained wetlands in light of that it may not be appropriate to compare the open water wetland metrics and the drainage ditch sites associated with the drained wetlands metrics the former are influenced by wetland catchment dynamics and ditch dynamics i e the former encompass travel distances from the wetland catchment to the wetland basin as well as travel distance along the ditch length between the wetland basin and the creek haque et al 2018 higher values of wlriserate and wlrecessrate for drainage ditch sites compared to open water wetlands could be an indication of the flashier nature subsurface flow dynamics fig 5 higher lagtomaxwl and wlriserate values compared to the recessdura and wlrecessrate values respectively suggest that the release of surface or subsurface water from wetlands or ditch sites was slower than the inflow of water towards them these observations not only support the idea that open water wetlands can effectively lower downstream flood peak by providing temporary storage of surface runoff during rainfall runoff events but also that open water wetlands can contribute to stream baseflow during dry conditions epa 2015 hayashi et al 2016 wang et al 2010 yang et al 2010 however this interpretation can be challenged based on the fact that we did not monitor groundwater levels and hydraulic gradients across the whole study area especially between open water wetland and the creek moreover considering daily data for the wetland and creek water level fluctuations may have failed to identify some of the smaller rainfall runoff events some wetlands also showed an unexplained decrease in water level during a rainfall event i e negative wlpercchange value in fig 5 from a theoretical standpoint if we considered pothole wetlands as closed systems then any input of water to them would increase surface water stage however numerous studies have suggested that despite their lack of visible surface connection pothole wetlands are not closed systems and can have subsurface as well as occasional surface connections with near by stream or wetlands epa 2015 haque et al 2018 leibowitz et al 2016 shaw et al 2012 thereby causing them to gain or lose water through mechanisms other than rainfall input the specific reason behind wetland water level decreases during some rainfall events included in our study however remains unknown almost all drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands showed partial recession for most of the studied events hinting at a prolonged contribution of subsurface flow after the rainfall runoff event had ended through the complex ditch drainage network figs 1 and 6 one alternative hypothesis might be that the partial recession of the water table below the drainage ditch sites is due to the proximity to the hyporheic zone of the adjacent stream resulting in higher water tables after a rainfall runoff event another alternative hypothesis might be that water first went into stream bank storage during high stage period before coming back out of storage thus creating a prolonged recession regarding open water wetlands about half of the open water wetlands them showed partial recession while the other half showed full recession for more than 50 of the studied events an open water wetland that showed frequent full recessions during the studied rainfall runoff events could indicate that water levels rose quickly and fell quickly because they were only fed by local or proximal surface and subsurface water therefore open water wetlands may be part of the isolated drainage system as described by other studies cohen et al 2016 epa 2015 haque et al 2018 leibowitz and nadeau 2003 leibowitz 2015 and could also be part of a system that is connected through subsurface flow as outlined by tiner 2003 conversely an open water wetland with frequent partial recession dynamics fig 6 could indicate that the wetland spilled and merged with another mccauley et al 2015 shaw et al 2012 which is why its water level remains high after the event has ended however spilling does not necessarily mean that a wetland is connected to a nearby stream but rather that it is connected to another wetland that may or may not be connected to a stream leibowitz et al 2016 shaw et al 2012 alternatively partial recession dynamics in open water wetlands could indicate longer memory effects in these wetlands memory effects were also observed in other studies that looked at storage dynamics in wetlands and they can be explained by slower drainage due to the time delay i e hysteresis between rainfall runoff and storage changes haque et al 2018 shook et al 2015 shook and pomeroy 2011 it should be noted that all the process hypotheses listed above cannot be tested due to the lack of comprehensive groundwater data or subsurface characterization of the study site future work is warranted to investigate whether some wetlands and ditches have a better hydraulic connection to the subsurface than others which would then explain differences in their relative abilities to reach full recession more quickly 4 3 characterizing wetland stream interaction wetland stream interaction is very difficult to quantify especially in the case of open water wetlands that have no visible surface connections between them and a stream the use of a correlation coefficient between wetland water levels and stream water levels may be especially difficult to gain process insights from since strong and statistically significant correlations might not necessarily reflect causality between wetland and stream hydrological dynamics but rather highlight the fact that similar drivers are behind stream and wetland dynamics additionally in the present study experimental setup the creek location where water levels were monitored is associated with a catchment area that is much greater than the target region in which the monitored wetlands are located this would make any claim of causality between local wetland hydrological dynamics and integrated catchment hydrological response very difficult to justify in the present study the decision was made not to use correlation coefficients but rather to use hysteresis loops to compare the timing of creek and wetland responses interpretations of possible wetland stream interaction scenarios can then be made based on identified timing differences or lack thereof between wetland and creek responses the presence of hysteresis figs 7 and 8 between wetland water level or ditch water table and creek water level may indicate a time delay between wetland storage change and stream response and hence provides indirect information about the travel time of water from wetland to stream shook et al 2015 shook and pomeroy 2011 the predominance of the counter clockwise hysteresis type figs 7 and 8 suggests that wetland water levels i e surface water dynamics or ditch water tables i e subsurface water dynamics responded before the creek water level during a rainfall runoff event as indicated by other studies this scenario is potentially indicative of wetland stream connectivity established via overland flow or shallow sub surface flow during rainfall runoff events haque et al 2018 shook et al 2015 shook and pomeroy 2011 however while the counter clockwise hysteresis type was predominant it was not the only one observed the temporal and spatial variations in wetland stream hysteresis types fig 8 observed in this study suggest that a complex combination of factors might be influencing short term wetland stream interaction such factors include spatial wetland characteristics but also antecedent wetness conditions and precipitation duration hewlett hibbert 1967 ross et al 2019 for one of the major rainfall runoff events monitored in this study i e event 4 table 2 and fig 7 all open water wetlands showed a clockwise hysteresis pattern while drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands showed a counter clockwise pattern these results suggest that the creek increased before the surface water level of open water wetlands but after water tables located underneath the drainage ditches based on these observations it is therefore unlikely that a connection between open water wetlands and the creek was established via fill spill or another overland flow generation mechanism however it is likely that ditches were connected to the creek through shallow subsurface flow and potentially overland flow if the water table intersected the ground surface for another major event that occurred in high antecedent moisture conditions i e event 15 table 2 and fig 7 all the studied wetlands regardless of their alteration status and all drainage ditch sites showed a counter clockwise hysteresis pattern suggesting that they were responding before the creek and may have been connected to it through fill spill or shallow subsurface flow the fact that all the studied wetlands and drainage ditch sites could switch between opposite hysteresis dynamics i e from clockwise to counter clockwise from one rainfall event to the next fig 7 indicates that the overall antecedent wetness or storage conditions and storage memory effects can exert a stronger control on wetland stream interactions compared to local landscape characteristics the presence of more spatially homogeneous hysteresis dynamics across wetlands during wet periods fig 7 could reflect the fact that wetter conditions promote greater hydrologic connectivity thus reducing the influence of individual wetland characteristics on wetland stream interaction hence in some situations the influence of individual wetland characteristics on wetland stream interaction may have been overcome by overall landscape conditions e g connectivity in contrast hydrologic connectivity is less widespread following dry antecedent conditions and is highly dependent on the ability of individual wetlands to generate flow an ability that is notably determined by the balance between wetland catchment area and wetland storage volume shaw et al 2012 4 4 predictability of spatial controls on wetland hydrologic response for open water wetlands a negative correlation between cat2vol and lagtomaxwl and a positive correlation between wlriserate and catperi fig 9 suggest that wetlands with larger catchment areas and with smaller water storage volumes tend to respond quickly during a rainfall runoff event furthermore cat2vol was positively correlated with recessdura and wlrecessrate was positively correlated with both cat2vol and catarea fig 9 suggesting that open water wetlands with proportionally larger catchment areas have slower and partial recession with high water levels persisting long after major rainfall runoff events this could also indicate that these wetlands have a longer storage memory as described in other studies shook et al 2015 shook and pomeroy 2011 for open water wetlands distance was positively correlated with lagtomaxwl and negatively correlated with recessdura fig 9 thereby hinting that the geographic location of a wetland plays an important role in determining wetland stream interaction the fact that wlpercchange was positively correlated with distance and sl fig 9 also hints that wetlands located far from the stream and with higher spill levels are less likely to interact with the stream through the fill spill mechanism while these observations support conclusions made by others regarding wetland to wetland and wetland to stream connectivity via fill spill mccauley et al 2015 shaw et al 2012 they also highlight the strong dependence of wetland stream or wetland wetland connectivity on distance especially when there is no visible surface connection i e drainage network between wetlands or between a wetland and a stream for drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands response magnitude metrics such as wlriserate were negatively correlated with area peri vol conarea conperi and totdrain2catarea fig 10 moreover metrics associated with the timing of hydrologic response e g lagtomaxwl recessdura for drainage ditch sites often showed no significant correlation with wetland spatial characteristics figs 9 and 10 the fact that wlrecessrate for water tables below ditch sites was positively correlated with conarea conperi and totdrain2catarea fig 10 is consistent with the hypothesis that the incremental contributing area for drained wetlands due to the physical alteration of historic wetlands see table 1 and fig 1 leads to enhanced hydrological fluctuations and shorter storage memory in the surrounding landscape including the water tables below drainage ditches such a hypothesis was advanced by haque et al 2018 who relied on annual and seasonal data to conclude that drained wetlands which have lost their water storage capacity do not have any noticeable storage memory due to their physical alteration while investigating hydrologic response metrics in different climatic and geographic settings ross et al 2019 showed that the average slope of a catchment can significantly influence stream hydrologic response metrics however the present study did not investigate the influence of slope parameters on wetland hydrologic response metrics for wetlands the fact that some pairs of response metrics and spatial characteristics were positively correlated for some events and negatively correlated for others highlights the difficulty in identifying consistent or temporally persistent spatial controls on wetland dynamics no single wetland characteristic was found to be significantly correlated to any wetland hydrologic response metric for more than 50 of the monitored events suggesting that the wetland spatial characteristics evaluated here are not good predictors of the spatial variability of wetland hydrologic response and that other characteristics should be considered significant correlations were observed during the events that occurred after the spring melt or following a wet period and during big events this could mean that greater hydrologic connectivity due to wetter conditions enhances the influence of spatial characteristics on wetland hydrologic responses one thing to note is that figs 9 and 10 represent multiple comparisons i e calculating statistically significant correlations between each pair of hydrologic response metrics and wetland landscape characteristic for individual events and then looking at the temporal consistency for each of the correlation and we did not use any adjustment to prevent occurrences of errors or false positives 5 conclusion this study focused on the hydrologic responses of pothole wetlands the interaction between pothole wetlands and a nearby stream and the temporal persistence of spatial controls on individual wetland hydrological response in the prairie pothole region relying on high frequency water level data averaged to daily timesteps and a detailed landscape analysis this study aimed to enhance our understanding of wetland hydrologic function and its controls especially at the timescale of individual rainfall events that is typically not documented in the existing literature while the number of sites investigated in this study was relatively small i e 13 open water wetlands and 7 drainage ditch sites associated with fully drained wetlands and did not allow for formal hypothesis tests the results outlined above highlight the high variability in site specific wetland hydrologic response even within a small study area in relation to research objective 1 one major conclusion of this study is that wetland alteration status i e drained versus consolidated versus intact appears to play an important role in explaining the short term event scale hydrologic behaviour of pothole wetlands analyses related to research objective 2 indicate that climatic factors which encompass not only rainfall event characteristics but also antecedent conditions also had a noticeable influence on wetland hydrologic response however the alteration status appeared to modify the degree to which some climatic factors influence wetland hydrologic response results related to research objective 3 show that while a complex combination of factors appeared to influence short term wetland stream interaction antecedent wetness or storage conditions and storage memory seemed to be the driving factors analyses related to research objective 4 rather suggested that the lack of temporally persistent correlations i e from one rainfall event to another between hydrologic response metrics and spatial characteristics either indicates that spatial controls on wetland hydrologic function vary greatly over short timescales or that the spatial characteristics considered in this study are not good predictors of event scale wetland hydrologic response resorting to event scale analyses rather than more commonly relied upon annual and seasonal analyses not only led to the confirmation of findings from previous studies but also allowed some new process related hypotheses to be put forward for future testing provided that higher resolution precipitation data both spatially and temporally become available future work could focus on all instances of short term wetland water level fluctuations with the aim to distinguish dynamics attributable to direct precipitation i e rainfall and snowmelt events from dynamics controlled by diel cycles or surface water groundwater exchanges since the present study did not consider spatial characteristics related to catchment slope land use pattern soil types and soil hydraulic conductivity and wetland vegetation types further research is needed to either validate or invalidate the
