8725,the city of cape town the city is experiencing a water crisis however although a major desalination plant has been on the table for a number of years this continues to be regarded as a long term option due to the apparent high costs associated with this technology we therefore develop a predator prey system dynamics model to assess the feasibility of a major desalination plant compared with the baseline scenarios of business as usual clearing of invasive alien plants in the berg and breede water management areas and renovating and constructing dams cost include both capital costs as well as operational costs we find that increasing block tariffs ibts do not always benefit the poor since these are not always the lowest water users in volumetric terms a major outcome is that in contrast to expectations a desalination plant may actually reduce tariffs across the full spectrum of water users a desalination plant also has the potential to increase access to water by the poorest communities the finding has implications for other developing countries considering a major water infrastructure investment where there are large disparities in income between wealthy and indigent consumers keywords desalination invasive alien plants dams predator prey system dynamics 1 introduction the city of cape town hereafter used interchangeably with the city is currently facing a water crisis resulting from low rainfall over the ensuing winter rainfall period june august dams the primary source of water for the city are currently at 27 down from 47 this time last year 1 this means that should current consumption and rainfall continue the city will have no water left in the next 9 12 months 2 3 for over 100 years the city of cape town the city has built dams to meet its water supply needs a recent study indicates that 98 of all the city of cape town s water supply comes from dams 4 however a number of challenges exist in continuing with this strategy firstly there are constraints on the availability of suitable locations to build dams in areas that are not ecologically sensitive secondly dams are reliant on rainfall and if rainfall is low then it affects the entire water supply system this is the case at present where low rainfall has placed significant pressure on the availability of water in the city of cape town the city of cape town has been aware of the challenges of supplying water to its population for a number of years in 1989 the then department of water affairs and forestry dwaf in conjunction with the cape town city council embarked on the western cape system analysis wcsa to evaluate water supply options the process was concluded in 1995 5 a range of options were identified including the clearing of invasive alien plants the construction of a desalination plant and the building of a new dam on the berg river ultimately it was decided that the additional dam was the most cost effective option work on the dam was competed in 2009 at an estimated cost of r1 5 billion rand 6 however this has not solved the water crisis in the city in order to address the water crisis the city of cape town is considering a number of other water augmentation options these include 1 encouraging rainwater capture systems potentially combined with grey water at household estate level 2 water recycling both as potable water and non potable water 3 groundwater from the table mountain group tmg aquifer 4 the city of cape town has also for a long time employed water demand management as a strategy for resolving water supply issues 5 the berg river to voëlvlei dam augmentation scheme 7 and 7 clearing of invasions to secure water from the current supply systems which are all invaded to some degree and will get worse this is not an exhaustive list but indicates the range of options that are being considered more recently the city has tabled an emergency water supply plan to meet the shortfall that includes temporary desalination barges and reclaiming sewage water all these options provide at best partial and temporary solutions to the problem however they are all believed to offer lower cost alternatives to a desalination plant desalination is a process that has gained much traction globally there are two commercially important technologies 8 multistage flash msf and the more economical reverse osmosis ro distillation most of the larger 5 ml d plants utilise the msf technology 8 a recent feasibility study for a 450 ml d desalination plant for the city was completed but was shelved due to the high costs and electricity concerns 9 the feasibility study estimated that it would cost between r14 20 billion rand to construct the desalination plant however an equivalent plant using the ro technology could cost between r6 7 billion 10 significantly less than the original feasibility study it is possible to supply this as a single plant the technology is continuously evolving with the largest ro plant having a capacity of 326 ml d 8 however there are also proposals to construct multiple smaller modular desalination plants which could supply 100 ml d within 4 months to the city 10 another limitation of desalination plants is the purported high operating costs this is largely due to electricity costs which comprised 50 of the operating costs in the original feasibility study for the city of cape town 9 new units utilise significantly less electricity saving on these operating costs taken together these technologies have the potential to result in significant cost savings which were not taken into consideration in the original feasibility study for the city of cape town in addition a traditional cost benefit analysis cannot effectively model cost recovery through the increasing block tariff ibt system a system dynamic model is needed that can update prices on the fly where water supply is evolving over time in a complex system here we assess whether or not desalination is a cost effective option for the city by taking into consideration recent technological advances as well as cost recovery through employing the economically efficient and equitable ibt rates we compare this with the current baseline approach of building and renovating dams as well as clearing invasive alien plants in the next section we consider the model used for the financial assessment followed by a theoretical discussion of the options considered then the results are presented and we conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings 2 material and methods the model used for the financial analysis is a predator prey model developed using the system dynamics modelling framework the use of system dynamics modelling to model predator prey dynamics was formally proposed by swart 11 although its use preceded this the model is widely used and the literature is quite ubiquitous e g refs 2 3 12 14 although historically the predator and prey were defined from mobile animal species increasingly the model is applied in other areas as well crookes and blignaut 15 model the steel industry where vehicle manufacturing is the predator and the steel industry is the prey ibáñez et al 16 develop a model for a competitively exploited aquifer where groundwater is the prey and the irrigated hectares are the predators dendrinos and mullally 17 develop an urban dynamics model defining the urban population as the predator and per capita income as the prey for a similar urban dynamics application orishimo 18 define population as the prey and land price as the predator these studies indicate that actual predatory behaviour is not a requirement for model development nor is it important which parameter is specified as predator and which is prey the model is largely associated with neoclassical economics theory 19 which is rare for system dynamics modelling applications 20 21 in our model the predator is the number of dams built and the prey is the existing dam storage levels conceptually the dynamics of the model is shown in fig 1 when only a few dams exist in a particular catchment quadrant i an increase in the number of dams increases dam storage levels this is because there is low competition for water resources in the catchment this was the case in the early 1900s more dams were constructed as there was little competition for water however as the number of dams gets progressively greater quadrant ii mean dam storage levels decreases since building an additional dam in a catchment would decrease the volumes of water available for existing dams the number of dams are therefore approaching carrying capacity where after increased competition exists for available water too many dams chasing too little water this is the situation where we find ourselves in at the present time in the future quadrants iii and iv may come into play the shaded area where the number of dams actually decreases however this is not modelled in the present study 2 1 model dynamics 2 1 1 the predator the dynamics of the predator et is given by e t 1 e t n p h t c e t where et is the stock of the number of dams and n is an adjustment coefficient that relates cost recovery to dam building effort in other words the more revenue is derived from the sale of water relative to costs the more dams are built p is the price of water less costs of supply and ht is the water allowance for residents it is assumed that residents will demand what is available in other words water allowance and water supply are equivalent in general this assumption would not hold as it depends on different features e g price policy objectives and culture however in this instance it is believed to hold since water is extremely scarce in the city c is the cost per month of building a dam based on the cost of building the berg river dam completed in 2009 and adjusted to 2016 prices the berg river dam is slightly less than the average capacity of the six dams so is a useful proxy 2 1 2 the prey the dynamics of the prey zt is given by z t 1 z t r z t 1 z t k m h t where zt is dam storage level in month t r is the growth rate in dam levels assumed a function of the rainfall which is modelled stochastically k is the maximum storage capacity of the dam carrying capacity and m is the storage coefficient which relates water supply to dam storage levels 2 1 3 water allowance the water allowance ht is how much water is supplied to residents from the reticulation system it is given as h t q y t where q is the supply coefficient that relates dam yield yt to the water allowance ht the greater the yield the more water consumers are allowed to use the dam yields are from the six largest dams in the city of cape town catchment areas which together account for 99 6 of water stored 2 1 4 supply coefficient the supply coefficient q is calculated as q d a i l y p r o d u c t i o n m l d x 1000 365 12 d a m s t o r a g e x n u m b e r o f d a m s x a v e r a g e s t o r a g e c a p a c i t y p e r d a m this data is based on the most recent city of cape town water dashboard data 27 march 2017 2 1 5 storage coefficient the storage coefficient models the impact of water allowance on dam storage levels the storage coefficient m is calculated as m 1 12 i 1 12 d a m l e v e l c h a n g e m o n t h i m e a n d a i l y p r o d u c t i o n m o n t h i m l d x 1000 n o o f d a y s i n m o n t h i ideally data is needed on weekly dam level changes and daily production values for an entire year to estimate an average monthly estimate for the storage coefficient m in the absence of this data an alternative was to use estimates of monthly dam level change to estimate mean daily production for each month given that we know the daily production in march 2017 and the monthly dam level change for that month which was then used to calculate m per month 2 1 6 cost recovery sub model cost recovery is calculated as revenues from the sale of water in 2016 the city of cape town uses a tiered rate to calculate price the higher the water usage the higher the price the average water use per household was calculated using a tiered approach stratified by volume of water used based on data provided through the city of cape town s open data portal april 2017 the water price applicable at each level of water use was then used costs of water use were obtained from the natural resource accounts for water 2002 values 22 and converted to 2016 values using the consumer price index this was deducted from the water tariff to obtain an estimate for the net price of water the cost model includes the costs of refurbishing existing dams as well as costs of clearing aliens and building a desalination plant we also model the construction of a new dam although a number of other options are considered by the city such as demand side management and supply augmentation we focus on these options since they have the potential to generate the greatest water yields for the city the monthly costs are calculated based on the lifespan of the different water projects the desalination plant is assumed to last 25 years the invasive aliens are assumed to take 15 years to clear and the dam lasts 100 years however these costs continue over the lifespan of the model so that if the time frame of the model is 100 years provision is made for cumulative alien regrowth of up to 6 67 times the baseline area equivalent to re clearing the original area every 15 years over the 100 years the model also makes provision for the building of 4 power plants over the 100 years 1 every 25 years and the refurbishment of all six dams over the 100 years real costs are held constant in the model which is normal for models of this type but which is a conservative assumption in the case of a dam since construction costs have actually increased refurbishment costs per dam are assumed to be the same as the cost of a new dam 2 2 model parameters the exogenous parameters used in the model are given in table 1 we model the total water supply sector including existing dams but excluding other water sources such as boreholes and smaller dams together the water supply sector modelled accounts for 98 of water supply to the city of cape town the model includes the costs of maintaining the existing six dams 2 3 model validation a number of tests were run on the model to ensure that it was suitable for policy analysis firstly the dimensional consistence test was run all the units in the model were consistent secondly sensitivity analysis was conducted on the key variables in the model some of these sensitivities are discussed in the results section thirdly the behaviour replication test was conducted by benchmarking the model against the available historical data two models were developed one a linear model that did not take into consideration rainfall variability and a stochastic model that takes into consideration rainfall variability the linear model replicated the long term behaviour of the system when compared with the available data fig 2 a and the stochastic model picked up the variability resulting from variable rainfall patterns fig 2b although this is not exact because rainfall varies from year to year and is a random event in a given year structure verification is important in this case since although the model is based on the well established predator prey system a number of different specifications are possible for example interspecific competition mutualism or other formulations in this case since the model is not a biological model where the underlying interaction is known with absolute certainty it is necessary to validate the structure of the model the function for the predator is well established in the literature since it is based on profitability see e g refs 12 14 25 however the prey function is fairly novel and needs to be tested following capello and faggian 26 a regression model was fitted to this data in order to determine 1 whether or not the sign of the coefficient of ht was correct a negative sign indicates a predator prey relationship whereas a positive sign indicates mutualism 2 whether or not the coefficient of ht was significantly different from zero and 3 whether or not the coefficient was significantly different from the coefficient estimated by the system dynamics model in order to do this we re write the equation for the prey in the form β 0 z t 2 β 1 z t β 2 z t 1 m h t where β 0 r k β1 r 1 and β2 1 a z test was performed where the null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between the parameter in the system dynamics model and the regression coefficient the results are given in table 2 the regression coefficient was of the correct sign verifying that a predator prey relationship exists the coefficient is also significant although only at the 10 level the regression coefficient is also comparable in value to the value generated by the sd model with an approximate 15 difference in value between the two estimates the residual plots are also provided see supplementary material furthermore the z test indicates that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that sd and regression coefficient are the same the results taken together suggest that the predator prey framework is an appropriate structure for the data the structure of the model is deemed adequate overall the model passes all validation tests adequately and is therefore deemed useful for policy analysis 3 theory here we extend the theory by considering in greater depth the water supply options evaluated two baseline options namely dam building and refurbishment and invasive alien plant clearing and then the desalination option the baseline options are chosen since these water supply options currently represent the status quo with regard to water supply to the city 3 1 dam building refurbishment table 3 indicates the six major dams in the city of cape town catchment area and the year completed two major issues face the city of cape town in the future the first is limited options for building additional dams in non environmentally sensitive areas and secondly the documented lifespan of dam according to government records is 100 years where after there is an increased risk of failure of the dam 27 this means that in addition to meeting future water demand all of the city of cape town dams will need refurbishment over the next 100 years just to maintain existing water supplies some of these refurbishments could be quite imminent steenbras lower may be reaching the end of its useful life by as soon as the year 2021 table 3 roughly half of the city s water supply comes from the berg wma and half from the breede wma table 3 given the fact that dam building has been the major strategy for water supply augmentation in the city in one of the baseline scenarios we evaluate is the building of a new dam in the city of cape town region although the available geographic locations to undertake this are limited 3 2 clearing of invasive alien plants van zyl 28 evaluation of water supply options for the city of cape town more than 20 years ago concluded that iap clearing was the preferred alternative for releasing additional water the city of cape town s 6 dams are in the berg and breede wmas the berg and breede wmas are defined in rsa 29 as breede wma major rivers include the breede sonderend sout bot and palmiet tertiary drainage regions g40 excluding quaternary catchment g40a g50 and h10 to h70 berg wma major rivers include the berg diep and steenbras tertiary drainage regions g10 g21 and g22 and quaternary catchment g40a with the northern boundary following the watershed between tertiary drainage regions g10 and g30 up to the town of aurora from aurora the boundary runs directly to the coast in a westerly direction alien clearing has been undertaken in the western cape since 1995 23 there are a few studies that have assessed the effect of alien clearing in quaternary drainage region g10a 30 31 these studies have indicated that potential yields from clearing iaps in this drainage region are low however according to data in kotzé et al 24 there are still 350 141 condensed hectares of aliens in the breede and berg wma or 23 6 of total condensed area of aliens there is therefore still substantial scope to increase water supply into dams by clearing aliens however clearing of invasive alien plants on its own is unlikely to be sufficient to increase yields particularly in low rainfall years other water supply options also need to be considered 3 3 desalination plants most of the available water supply options rely on rainfall which has been sporadic and unrealible yet the city of cape town is situated adjacent to the atlantic ocean and a major saline water supply is available on its doorstep desalination which was previously regarded as too expensive has decreased in cost a number of coastal municipalities are implementing this technology however concerns still remain over the costs of such technologies the city of cape town reported that it was bringing forward several emergency water supply options including a small scale desalination plant capable of delivering 2ml day to the city here however we evaluate whether or not a large scale permanent desalination plant is economically viable to augment the water supply needs of city of cape town residents 3 4 costs of the alternatives table 4 summarises the costs of the three options the desalination plant the construction of a new dam and the cost of clearing invasive alien plants unit costs for the desalination plant and dam were derived from two sources the 1995 values for the desalination plant and dam were obtained from the 1995 systems analysis whereas the more recent estimates were obtained from most recent estimates available the dam costs are based on the construction of berg river dam all costs are inflated to 2016 values for use in the model the most recent cost of the desalination plant is based on the cost of a reverse osmosis ro plant not far from the city of cape town the costs include the construction and bulk infrastructure costs costs therefore exclude maintenance costs which are likely to be sizeable brine is discharged into the sea for the dam and desalination option costs excludes any interest and depreciation charges on capital financing as well as decommissioning costs intake and outfall costs may also be critical and add to the overall costs therefore we conclude that both the dam costs and the desalination costs are likely to be understated although probably by the same order of magnitude the desalination plant costs increase at slightly less than inflation whereas the cost of the dam increases at slightly more than inflation table 4 these increases are in accordance with expectations improved technology reduces the cost increases of the desalination plant relative to inflation 33 3 5 alternative water tariff systems increasingly governments are shifting from a fixed tariff structure to an increasing block tariff ibt structure also known as tiered rates progressive tariffs or inverted block rates 34 37 the city of cape town is no exception using an ibt pricing system to promote efficiency 38 however ibts are difficult to take into consideration in conventional financial assessments of water infrastructure development projects since the tariff structure varies depending on the volume of water supplied however these effects are important to model since it could affect the financial decision whether or not to proceed with the water infrastructure investment the advantage of the system dynamics modelling software is that a variable tariff structure may be modelled using a lookup table fig 3 with higher volume of water supplied generating the higher the earnings of the city of cape town we also take into consideration alternative users since this will affect the different tariffs that are charged table 5 indicates the potential benefits of stratifying tariffs structures by land use although houses with an erf size of less than 1500m3 use the bulk of the city s water allocation actual usage per unit per month is relatively low at 13 02 by contrast industrial and large high volume users such as shopping malls sports stadium certain farms and other high end users comprise 23 of the water allocated we estimate that assuming domestic tariffs are applicable to all users that tier 6 users potentially fund over 71 of the city of cape town water budget there is therefore a need to bring relief at all levels of the tariff spectrum the tiered tariff structure works as follows in the model total water supply is allocated among the different users and then amalgamated to produce a composite estimate of the tariff expressed as r kl this then feeds into the predator prey model for the water supply options determining the dynamics of water flows 3 6 options evaluated the option we evaluate in this study are therefore the construction of a major 1 000 ml d desalination plant and compared against the baseline of continued dam construction refurbishment of existing dams and iap clearing the costs of all options are compared and potential impact on tariff structure evaluated 3 7 limitations of the study this study does not take into consideration population growth or economic development however dam refurbishment the proposed desalination plant and alien clearing could potentially deliver approximately 2000 ml d providing a reasonable buffer to make allowance for these developments the current water production allowance is 750 ml d so this is more than double that provision secondly the model makes allowance for the cost of building the desalination plants and the maintenance of dams but does not include associated costs of supply and reticulation such as pumping stations and pipelines it is assumed that for each of the options assessed these costs would be the same and would largely depend on the location of the said dams and desalination plants the costs of the dams and the desalination plant exclude environmental externalities for the dam this would include damage to ecosystems resulting from construction and operation and associated impact on streamflow the externalities of the desalination plant would include the energy use thereof another limitation of the present study is that the seasonality of rainfall in the western cape is not well modelled rainfall in the western cape is primarily during the winter months however in our model a drought episode or high rainfall event flash flood could occur at any time of the year finally the model uses a very coarse allocation of invasive species to water management area wma this might overstate the impact of invasive alien plants on water usage 4 results 4 1 cost recovery parameters average water consumption for city of cape town residents for the 2016 17 year was 21 5kl household month this equates to a step 4 water tariff the step 4 water tariff for domestic users was r40 96 kl in 2016 17 the proposed water tariff for 2017 18 year is r41 53 kl according to the city s draft integrated development plan according to stats sa 22 water related expenditure per unit of water is r1 9 kl 2002 prices which is r4 1 kl in 2016 prices adjusted for inflation comparing the tariffs r40 96 kl with the expenditure r4 06 kl indicates that substantial revenues in excess of cost recovery are made from the sale of water by the city of cape town 4 2 probability that dam levels will drop below 10 according to the city of cape town the last 10 of dam storage cannot be effectively used for domestic consumption using the stochastic model which allows for rainfall variability we used monte carlo simulation to model the probability that dam levels would drop below 10 in the next five years and the next 100 years we used an ensemble of 1000 realisations to model different stochastic outcomes dependent on different combinations of rainfall patterns for the 5 year model the probability was 0 343 table 6 this means that given historical variability in rainfall the probability that dam levels will drop below 10 in the next five years is 34 this probability increases to 0 785 over the next 100 years in other words the probability that dam levels drop below 10 over the next 100 years is 78 5 this outcome assumes current population levels so taking population growth into consideration would result in a higher probability this also assumes that alien densities remain at current levels in other words there is no clearing beyond existing levels if this assumption is relaxed and it is assumed that all aliens are cleared over the next 15 years and that maintenance of clearance is sustained over the ensuing 100 years then the probability that dams levels will drop below 10 over the next 100 years is 0 592 59 see table 6 this is a much lower probability than under no clearing 0 785 in fact the probability decreases by almost 20 so is certainly worth pursuing but alien clearance on its own is not sufficient and also does not take into consideration the cost implications we therefore evaluate these cost implications in the next section along with the cost of a desalination as well as consider the additional water released from these two options the analysis also includes the maintenance of the six primary storage dams of the city of cape town over the next 100 years we use the linear model to conduct this assessment 4 3 scenario analysis we model three scenarios 2 baseline and the desalination option and consider the water costs and the implied water tariffs associated with these different scenarios table 7 the baseline scenario assumes no invasive plant clearance beyond existing levels no desalination plant no new dam built but with dam maintenance over the next 100 years all six dams would be refurbished under this scenario the baseline scenario assumes historical trends in rainfall which is not necessarily the best predictor of future rainfall under baseline 2 aliens are cleared over 15 years and maintained and an additional dam is constructed at the mean dam size of the six dams already in existence roughly 150 000ml under scenario 1 a desalination plant producing 1000 ml day is constructed every 25 years the assumed lifespan of a plant over the next 100 years and invasive aliens plants are cleared over 15 years and then maintained until the end of the simulation an increasing block tariff ibt is modelled for the pricing structure desalination generates the lowest water cost of the three scenarios table 7 these findings however also point to the benefits of desalination which may actually result in a reduction in tariffs compared with the two baseline simulations status quo and new dam built our results also indicate lower water costs compared with international studies table 7 which may indicate cost factors omitted but also indicate the benefit of desalination even if international values are used tariffs may still decrease compared with baseline values table 7 another factor contributing to lowering costs is the clearing of invasive alien plants which has the benefit of increasing dam levels during rainfall periods compared with no clearing 5 discussion our study focussed on the economic benefits of proceeding with a desalination plant in the city of cape town our findings concur with the findings of a number of engineering studies for the western cape as a whole blersch du plessis 39 assessed the benefits of a desalination plant in the western cape they found that a desalination plant should not be used for emergency water treatment but rather that a large plant should be constructed since unit reference values decrease with an increase in capacity they argue that the optimal solution is to have one large desalination plant operational immediately they argue that the desalination plant should be used for the base flow operational at all times pienaar 40 utilises a system dynamics model to assess a suite of options for a transition to a green economy in the western cape including water demand management the augmentation of the supply system through the construction of a dam groundwater utilisation wastewater treatment works construction and desalination implementation the results showed that although the costs were higher than under a business as usual scenario the real risk of drought in the western cape in the future meant these options were essential to supply the western cape s water needs into the future many believe that a desalination plant will increase raw water tariffs our study shows that in contrast to expectations a desalination plant may in fact create the possibility to reduce tariffs this is because increased water supply reduces unit costs this is important since table 5 indicates that it is not always the poorest households that consume the least water informal dwellings in the city consume water at a level 4 volumetric level suggesting that an ibt may not always benefit the poor these findings concur with jansen 41 and pinto and marques 42 since a desalination plant may actually decrease tariffs this may actually alleviate financial burdens on the poorer residents in the city our results therefore indicate the importance of urgently proceeding with a desalination plant for the city of cape town continuation of baseline water supply options such as alien plant clearance and renovation of existing dams should continue but not as a substitute for a desalination plant our study also has application for other developing countries considering water supply augmentation often governments in developing countries shy away from major capital development projects due to perceived financial and institutional constraints as well as concerns over the impact of rising costs on the poorest citizens however we show here that not only does a major infrastructure development supply the necessary water requirements overall the finances released through water sales may actually improve city coffers making it possible to actually reduce tariffs our study shows modelling realism such as taking into consideration the relevant tariff structure used by the entity see e g ref 43 is important in financial assessments of water infrastructure development projects this may positively influence the provision of loans for infrastructure development in developing countries thereby enabling increased access to water provision particularly to poorer households in times of water scarcity foreign skills and technologies are also important in developing countries facing capacity constraints a desalination plant is a preferred option compared with the current approach employed by the city namely water demand management in particular water rationing which according to janmaat 44 is regarded as a last resort our results indicate the importance of urgently proceeding with a desalination plant for the city of cape town 6 conclusions our model indicates that a desalination plant along with alien clearance is the most cost effective option for the city of cape town and generates the most water for the city of cape town residents we are not necessarily advocating that all the money for water infrastructure capital development projects should come from city of cape town water budgets central government certainly also has a role to play both in terms of 1 assisting with iap clearing in the berg and breede wma as well as maintenance of that clearance and 2 providing financing for desalination plants also as we have indicated in the discussion foreign capital and expertise may also be an option and indeed a necessity the study shows that it is financially viable for a large scale desalination plant to be constructed in the city of cape town and not only that also generates greater cost recovery than the business as usual options acknowledgments the author would like to thank dea nrm for the financial

8725,the city of cape town the city is experiencing a water crisis however although a major desalination plant has been on the table for a number of years this continues to be regarded as a long term option due to the apparent high costs associated with this technology we therefore develop a predator prey system dynamics model to assess the feasibility of a major desalination plant compared with the baseline scenarios of business as usual clearing of invasive alien plants in the berg and breede water management areas and renovating and constructing dams cost include both capital costs as well as operational costs we find that increasing block tariffs ibts do not always benefit the poor since these are not always the lowest water users in volumetric terms a major outcome is that in contrast to expectations a desalination plant may actually reduce tariffs across the full spectrum of water users a desalination plant also has the potential to increase access to water by the poorest communities the finding has implications for other developing countries considering a major water infrastructure investment where there are large disparities in income between wealthy and indigent consumers keywords desalination invasive alien plants dams predator prey system dynamics 1 introduction the city of cape town hereafter used interchangeably with the city is currently facing a water crisis resulting from low rainfall over the ensuing winter rainfall period june august dams the primary source of water for the city are currently at 27 down from 47 this time last year 1 this means that should current consumption and rainfall continue the city will have no water left in the next 9 12 months 2 3 for over 100 years the city of cape town the city has built dams to meet its water supply needs a recent study indicates that 98 of all the city of cape town s water supply comes from dams 4 however a number of challenges exist in continuing with this strategy firstly there are constraints on the availability of suitable locations to build dams in areas that are not ecologically sensitive secondly dams are reliant on rainfall and if rainfall is low then it affects the entire water supply system this is the case at present where low rainfall has placed significant pressure on the availability of water in the city of cape town the city of cape town has been aware of the challenges of supplying water to its population for a number of years in 1989 the then department of water affairs and forestry dwaf in conjunction with the cape town city council embarked on the western cape system analysis wcsa to evaluate water supply options the process was concluded in 1995 5 a range of options were identified including the clearing of invasive alien plants the construction of a desalination plant and the building of a new dam on the berg river ultimately it was decided that the additional dam was the most cost effective option work on the dam was competed in 2009 at an estimated cost of r1 5 billion rand 6 however this has not solved the water crisis in the city in order to address the water crisis the city of cape town is considering a number of other water augmentation options these include 1 encouraging rainwater capture systems potentially combined with grey water at household estate level 2 water recycling both as potable water and non potable water 3 groundwater from the table mountain group tmg aquifer 4 the city of cape town has also for a long time employed water demand management as a strategy for resolving water supply issues 5 the berg river to voëlvlei dam augmentation scheme 7 and 7 clearing of invasions to secure water from the current supply systems which are all invaded to some degree and will get worse this is not an exhaustive list but indicates the range of options that are being considered more recently the city has tabled an emergency water supply plan to meet the shortfall that includes temporary desalination barges and reclaiming sewage water all these options provide at best partial and temporary solutions to the problem however they are all believed to offer lower cost alternatives to a desalination plant desalination is a process that has gained much traction globally there are two commercially important technologies 8 multistage flash msf and the more economical reverse osmosis ro distillation most of the larger 5 ml d plants utilise the msf technology 8 a recent feasibility study for a 450 ml d desalination plant for the city was completed but was shelved due to the high costs and electricity concerns 9 the feasibility study estimated that it would cost between r14 20 billion rand to construct the desalination plant however an equivalent plant using the ro technology could cost between r6 7 billion 10 significantly less than the original feasibility study it is possible to supply this as a single plant the technology is continuously evolving with the largest ro plant having a capacity of 326 ml d 8 however there are also proposals to construct multiple smaller modular desalination plants which could supply 100 ml d within 4 months to the city 10 another limitation of desalination plants is the purported high operating costs this is largely due to electricity costs which comprised 50 of the operating costs in the original feasibility study for the city of cape town 9 new units utilise significantly less electricity saving on these operating costs taken together these technologies have the potential to result in significant cost savings which were not taken into consideration in the original feasibility study for the city of cape town in addition a traditional cost benefit analysis cannot effectively model cost recovery through the increasing block tariff ibt system a system dynamic model is needed that can update prices on the fly where water supply is evolving over time in a complex system here we assess whether or not desalination is a cost effective option for the city by taking into consideration recent technological advances as well as cost recovery through employing the economically efficient and equitable ibt rates we compare this with the current baseline approach of building and renovating dams as well as clearing invasive alien plants in the next section we consider the model used for the financial assessment followed by a theoretical discussion of the options considered then the results are presented and we conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings 2 material and methods the model used for the financial analysis is a predator prey model developed using the system dynamics modelling framework the use of system dynamics modelling to model predator prey dynamics was formally proposed by swart 11 although its use preceded this the model is widely used and the literature is quite ubiquitous e g refs 2 3 12 14 although historically the predator and prey were defined from mobile animal species increasingly the model is applied in other areas as well crookes and blignaut 15 model the steel industry where vehicle manufacturing is the predator and the steel industry is the prey ibáñez et al 16 develop a model for a competitively exploited aquifer where groundwater is the prey and the irrigated hectares are the predators dendrinos and mullally 17 develop an urban dynamics model defining the urban population as the predator and per capita income as the prey for a similar urban dynamics application orishimo 18 define population as the prey and land price as the predator these studies indicate that actual predatory behaviour is not a requirement for model development nor is it important which parameter is specified as predator and which is prey the model is largely associated with neoclassical economics theory 19 which is rare for system dynamics modelling applications 20 21 in our model the predator is the number of dams built and the prey is the existing dam storage levels conceptually the dynamics of the model is shown in fig 1 when only a few dams exist in a particular catchment quadrant i an increase in the number of dams increases dam storage levels this is because there is low competition for water resources in the catchment this was the case in the early 1900s more dams were constructed as there was little competition for water however as the number of dams gets progressively greater quadrant ii mean dam storage levels decreases since building an additional dam in a catchment would decrease the volumes of water available for existing dams the number of dams are therefore approaching carrying capacity where after increased competition exists for available water too many dams chasing too little water this is the situation where we find ourselves in at the present time in the future quadrants iii and iv may come into play the shaded area where the number of dams actually decreases however this is not modelled in the present study 2 1 model dynamics 2 1 1 the predator the dynamics of the predator et is given by e t 1 e t n p h t c e t where et is the stock of the number of dams and n is an adjustment coefficient that relates cost recovery to dam building effort in other words the more revenue is derived from the sale of water relative to costs the more dams are built p is the price of water less costs of supply and ht is the water allowance for residents it is assumed that residents will demand what is available in other words water allowance and water supply are equivalent in general this assumption would not hold as it depends on different features e g price policy objectives and culture however in this instance it is believed to hold since water is extremely scarce in the city c is the cost per month of building a dam based on the cost of building the berg river dam completed in 2009 and adjusted to 2016 prices the berg river dam is slightly less than the average capacity of the six dams so is a useful proxy 2 1 2 the prey the dynamics of the prey zt is given by z t 1 z t r z t 1 z t k m h t where zt is dam storage level in month t r is the growth rate in dam levels assumed a function of the rainfall which is modelled stochastically k is the maximum storage capacity of the dam carrying capacity and m is the storage coefficient which relates water supply to dam storage levels 2 1 3 water allowance the water allowance ht is how much water is supplied to residents from the reticulation system it is given as h t q y t where q is the supply coefficient that relates dam yield yt to the water allowance ht the greater the yield the more water consumers are allowed to use the dam yields are from the six largest dams in the city of cape town catchment areas which together account for 99 6 of water stored 2 1 4 supply coefficient the supply coefficient q is calculated as q d a i l y p r o d u c t i o n m l d x 1000 365 12 d a m s t o r a g e x n u m b e r o f d a m s x a v e r a g e s t o r a g e c a p a c i t y p e r d a m this data is based on the most recent city of cape town water dashboard data 27 march 2017 2 1 5 storage coefficient the storage coefficient models the impact of water allowance on dam storage levels the storage coefficient m is calculated as m 1 12 i 1 12 d a m l e v e l c h a n g e m o n t h i m e a n d a i l y p r o d u c t i o n m o n t h i m l d x 1000 n o o f d a y s i n m o n t h i ideally data is needed on weekly dam level changes and daily production values for an entire year to estimate an average monthly estimate for the storage coefficient m in the absence of this data an alternative was to use estimates of monthly dam level change to estimate mean daily production for each month given that we know the daily production in march 2017 and the monthly dam level change for that month which was then used to calculate m per month 2 1 6 cost recovery sub model cost recovery is calculated as revenues from the sale of water in 2016 the city of cape town uses a tiered rate to calculate price the higher the water usage the higher the price the average water use per household was calculated using a tiered approach stratified by volume of water used based on data provided through the city of cape town s open data portal april 2017 the water price applicable at each level of water use was then used costs of water use were obtained from the natural resource accounts for water 2002 values 22 and converted to 2016 values using the consumer price index this was deducted from the water tariff to obtain an estimate for the net price of water the cost model includes the costs of refurbishing existing dams as well as costs of clearing aliens and building a desalination plant we also model the construction of a new dam although a number of other options are considered by the city such as demand side management and supply augmentation we focus on these options since they have the potential to generate the greatest water yields for the city the monthly costs are calculated based on the lifespan of the different water projects the desalination plant is assumed to last 25 years the invasive aliens are assumed to take 15 years to clear and the dam lasts 100 years however these costs continue over the lifespan of the model so that if the time frame of the model is 100 years provision is made for cumulative alien regrowth of up to 6 67 times the baseline area equivalent to re clearing the original area every 15 years over the 100 years the model also makes provision for the building of 4 power plants over the 100 years 1 every 25 years and the refurbishment of all six dams over the 100 years real costs are held constant in the model which is normal for models of this type but which is a conservative assumption in the case of a dam since construction costs have actually increased refurbishment costs per dam are assumed to be the same as the cost of a new dam 2 2 model parameters the exogenous parameters used in the model are given in table 1 we model the total water supply sector including existing dams but excluding other water sources such as boreholes and smaller dams together the water supply sector modelled accounts for 98 of water supply to the city of cape town the model includes the costs of maintaining the existing six dams 2 3 model validation a number of tests were run on the model to ensure that it was suitable for policy analysis firstly the dimensional consistence test was run all the units in the model were consistent secondly sensitivity analysis was conducted on the key variables in the model some of these sensitivities are discussed in the results section thirdly the behaviour replication test was conducted by benchmarking the model against the available historical data two models were developed one a linear model that did not take into consideration rainfall variability and a stochastic model that takes into consideration rainfall variability the linear model replicated the long term behaviour of the system when compared with the available data fig 2 a and the stochastic model picked up the variability resulting from variable rainfall patterns fig 2b although this is not exact because rainfall varies from year to year and is a random event in a given year structure verification is important in this case since although the model is based on the well established predator prey system a number of different specifications are possible for example interspecific competition mutualism or other formulations in this case since the model is not a biological model where the underlying interaction is known with absolute certainty it is necessary to validate the structure of the model the function for the predator is well established in the literature since it is based on profitability see e g refs 12 14 25 however the prey function is fairly novel and needs to be tested following capello and faggian 26 a regression model was fitted to this data in order to determine 1 whether or not the sign of the coefficient of ht was correct a negative sign indicates a predator prey relationship whereas a positive sign indicates mutualism 2 whether or not the coefficient of ht was significantly different from zero and 3 whether or not the coefficient was significantly different from the coefficient estimated by the system dynamics model in order to do this we re write the equation for the prey in the form β 0 z t 2 β 1 z t β 2 z t 1 m h t where β 0 r k β1 r 1 and β2 1 a z test was performed where the null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between the parameter in the system dynamics model and the regression coefficient the results are given in table 2 the regression coefficient was of the correct sign verifying that a predator prey relationship exists the coefficient is also significant although only at the 10 level the regression coefficient is also comparable in value to the value generated by the sd model with an approximate 15 difference in value between the two estimates the residual plots are also provided see supplementary material furthermore the z test indicates that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that sd and regression coefficient are the same the results taken together suggest that the predator prey framework is an appropriate structure for the data the structure of the model is deemed adequate overall the model passes all validation tests adequately and is therefore deemed useful for policy analysis 3 theory here we extend the theory by considering in greater depth the water supply options evaluated two baseline options namely dam building and refurbishment and invasive alien plant clearing and then the desalination option the baseline options are chosen since these water supply options currently represent the status quo with regard to water supply to the city 3 1 dam building refurbishment table 3 indicates the six major dams in the city of cape town catchment area and the year completed two major issues face the city of cape town in the future the first is limited options for building additional dams in non environmentally sensitive areas and secondly the documented lifespan of dam according to government records is 100 years where after there is an increased risk of failure of the dam 27 this means that in addition to meeting future water demand all of the city of cape town dams will need refurbishment over the next 100 years just to maintain existing water supplies some of these refurbishments could be quite imminent steenbras lower may be reaching the end of its useful life by as soon as the year 2021 table 3 roughly half of the city s water supply comes from the berg wma and half from the breede wma table 3 given the fact that dam building has been the major strategy for water supply augmentation in the city in one of the baseline scenarios we evaluate is the building of a new dam in the city of cape town region although the available geographic locations to undertake this are limited 3 2 clearing of invasive alien plants van zyl 28 evaluation of water supply options for the city of cape town more than 20 years ago concluded that iap clearing was the preferred alternative for releasing additional water the city of cape town s 6 dams are in the berg and breede wmas the berg and breede wmas are defined in rsa 29 as breede wma major rivers include the breede sonderend sout bot and palmiet tertiary drainage regions g40 excluding quaternary catchment g40a g50 and h10 to h70 berg wma major rivers include the berg diep and steenbras tertiary drainage regions g10 g21 and g22 and quaternary catchment g40a with the northern boundary following the watershed between tertiary drainage regions g10 and g30 up to the town of aurora from aurora the boundary runs directly to the coast in a westerly direction alien clearing has been undertaken in the western cape since 1995 23 there are a few studies that have assessed the effect of alien clearing in quaternary drainage region g10a 30 31 these studies have indicated that potential yields from clearing iaps in this drainage region are low however according to data in kotzé et al 24 there are still 350 141 condensed hectares of aliens in the breede and berg wma or 23 6 of total condensed area of aliens there is therefore still substantial scope to increase water supply into dams by clearing aliens however clearing of invasive alien plants on its own is unlikely to be sufficient to increase yields particularly in low rainfall years other water supply options also need to be considered 3 3 desalination plants most of the available water supply options rely on rainfall which has been sporadic and unrealible yet the city of cape town is situated adjacent to the atlantic ocean and a major saline water supply is available on its doorstep desalination which was previously regarded as too expensive has decreased in cost a number of coastal municipalities are implementing this technology however concerns still remain over the costs of such technologies the city of cape town reported that it was bringing forward several emergency water supply options including a small scale desalination plant capable of delivering 2ml day to the city here however we evaluate whether or not a large scale permanent desalination plant is economically viable to augment the water supply needs of city of cape town residents 3 4 costs of the alternatives table 4 summarises the costs of the three options the desalination plant the construction of a new dam and the cost of clearing invasive alien plants unit costs for the desalination plant and dam were derived from two sources the 1995 values for the desalination plant and dam were obtained from the 1995 systems analysis whereas the more recent estimates were obtained from most recent estimates available the dam costs are based on the construction of berg river dam all costs are inflated to 2016 values for use in the model the most recent cost of the desalination plant is based on the cost of a reverse osmosis ro plant not far from the city of cape town the costs include the construction and bulk infrastructure costs costs therefore exclude maintenance costs which are likely to be sizeable brine is discharged into the sea for the dam and desalination option costs excludes any interest and depreciation charges on capital financing as well as decommissioning costs intake and outfall costs may also be critical and add to the overall costs therefore we conclude that both the dam costs and the desalination costs are likely to be understated although probably by the same order of magnitude the desalination plant costs increase at slightly less than inflation whereas the cost of the dam increases at slightly more than inflation table 4 these increases are in accordance with expectations improved technology reduces the cost increases of the desalination plant relative to inflation 33 3 5 alternative water tariff systems increasingly governments are shifting from a fixed tariff structure to an increasing block tariff ibt structure also known as tiered rates progressive tariffs or inverted block rates 34 37 the city of cape town is no exception using an ibt pricing system to promote efficiency 38 however ibts are difficult to take into consideration in conventional financial assessments of water infrastructure development projects since the tariff structure varies depending on the volume of water supplied however these effects are important to model since it could affect the financial decision whether or not to proceed with the water infrastructure investment the advantage of the system dynamics modelling software is that a variable tariff structure may be modelled using a lookup table fig 3 with higher volume of water supplied generating the higher the earnings of the city of cape town we also take into consideration alternative users since this will affect the different tariffs that are charged table 5 indicates the potential benefits of stratifying tariffs structures by land use although houses with an erf size of less than 1500m3 use the bulk of the city s water allocation actual usage per unit per month is relatively low at 13 02 by contrast industrial and large high volume users such as shopping malls sports stadium certain farms and other high end users comprise 23 of the water allocated we estimate that assuming domestic tariffs are applicable to all users that tier 6 users potentially fund over 71 of the city of cape town water budget there is therefore a need to bring relief at all levels of the tariff spectrum the tiered tariff structure works as follows in the model total water supply is allocated among the different users and then amalgamated to produce a composite estimate of the tariff expressed as r kl this then feeds into the predator prey model for the water supply options determining the dynamics of water flows 3 6 options evaluated the option we evaluate in this study are therefore the construction of a major 1 000 ml d desalination plant and compared against the baseline of continued dam construction refurbishment of existing dams and iap clearing the costs of all options are compared and potential impact on tariff structure evaluated 3 7 limitations of the study this study does not take into consideration population growth or economic development however dam refurbishment the proposed desalination plant and alien clearing could potentially deliver approximately 2000 ml d providing a reasonable buffer to make allowance for these developments the current water production allowance is 750 ml d so this is more than double that provision secondly the model makes allowance for the cost of building the desalination plants and the maintenance of dams but does not include associated costs of supply and reticulation such as pumping stations and pipelines it is assumed that for each of the options assessed these costs would be the same and would largely depend on the location of the said dams and desalination plants the costs of the dams and the desalination plant exclude environmental externalities for the dam this would include damage to ecosystems resulting from construction and operation and associated impact on streamflow the externalities of the desalination plant would include the energy use thereof another limitation of the present study is that the seasonality of rainfall in the western cape is not well modelled rainfall in the western cape is primarily during the winter months however in our model a drought episode or high rainfall event flash flood could occur at any time of the year finally the model uses a very coarse allocation of invasive species to water management area wma this might overstate the impact of invasive alien plants on water usage 4 results 4 1 cost recovery parameters average water consumption for city of cape town residents for the 2016 17 year was 21 5kl household month this equates to a step 4 water tariff the step 4 water tariff for domestic users was r40 96 kl in 2016 17 the proposed water tariff for 2017 18 year is r41 53 kl according to the city s draft integrated development plan according to stats sa 22 water related expenditure per unit of water is r1 9 kl 2002 prices which is r4 1 kl in 2016 prices adjusted for inflation comparing the tariffs r40 96 kl with the expenditure r4 06 kl indicates that substantial revenues in excess of cost recovery are made from the sale of water by the city of cape town 4 2 probability that dam levels will drop below 10 according to the city of cape town the last 10 of dam storage cannot be effectively used for domestic consumption using the stochastic model which allows for rainfall variability we used monte carlo simulation to model the probability that dam levels would drop below 10 in the next five years and the next 100 years we used an ensemble of 1000 realisations to model different stochastic outcomes dependent on different combinations of rainfall patterns for the 5 year model the probability was 0 343 table 6 this means that given historical variability in rainfall the probability that dam levels will drop below 10 in the next five years is 34 this probability increases to 0 785 over the next 100 years in other words the probability that dam levels drop below 10 over the next 100 years is 78 5 this outcome assumes current population levels so taking population growth into consideration would result in a higher probability this also assumes that alien densities remain at current levels in other words there is no clearing beyond existing levels if this assumption is relaxed and it is assumed that all aliens are cleared over the next 15 years and that maintenance of clearance is sustained over the ensuing 100 years then the probability that dams levels will drop below 10 over the next 100 years is 0 592 59 see table 6 this is a much lower probability than under no clearing 0 785 in fact the probability decreases by almost 20 so is certainly worth pursuing but alien clearance on its own is not sufficient and also does not take into consideration the cost implications we therefore evaluate these cost implications in the next section along with the cost of a desalination as well as consider the additional water released from these two options the analysis also includes the maintenance of the six primary storage dams of the city of cape town over the next 100 years we use the linear model to conduct this assessment 4 3 scenario analysis we model three scenarios 2 baseline and the desalination option and consider the water costs and the implied water tariffs associated with these different scenarios table 7 the baseline scenario assumes no invasive plant clearance beyond existing levels no desalination plant no new dam built but with dam maintenance over the next 100 years all six dams would be refurbished under this scenario the baseline scenario assumes historical trends in rainfall which is not necessarily the best predictor of future rainfall under baseline 2 aliens are cleared over 15 years and maintained and an additional dam is constructed at the mean dam size of the six dams already in existence roughly 150 000ml under scenario 1 a desalination plant producing 1000 ml day is constructed every 25 years the assumed lifespan of a plant over the next 100 years and invasive aliens plants are cleared over 15 years and then maintained until the end of the simulation an increasing block tariff ibt is modelled for the pricing structure desalination generates the lowest water cost of the three scenarios table 7 these findings however also point to the benefits of desalination which may actually result in a reduction in tariffs compared with the two baseline simulations status quo and new dam built our results also indicate lower water costs compared with international studies table 7 which may indicate cost factors omitted but also indicate the benefit of desalination even if international values are used tariffs may still decrease compared with baseline values table 7 another factor contributing to lowering costs is the clearing of invasive alien plants which has the benefit of increasing dam levels during rainfall periods compared with no clearing 5 discussion our study focussed on the economic benefits of proceeding with a desalination plant in the city of cape town our findings concur with the findings of a number of engineering studies for the western cape as a whole blersch du plessis 39 assessed the benefits of a desalination plant in the western cape they found that a desalination plant should not be used for emergency water treatment but rather that a large plant should be constructed since unit reference values decrease with an increase in capacity they argue that the optimal solution is to have one large desalination plant operational immediately they argue that the desalination plant should be used for the base flow operational at all times pienaar 40 utilises a system dynamics model to assess a suite of options for a transition to a green economy in the western cape including water demand management the augmentation of the supply system through the construction of a dam groundwater utilisation wastewater treatment works construction and desalination implementation the results showed that although the costs were higher than under a business as usual scenario the real risk of drought in the western cape in the future meant these options were essential to supply the western cape s water needs into the future many believe that a desalination plant will increase raw water tariffs our study shows that in contrast to expectations a desalination plant may in fact create the possibility to reduce tariffs this is because increased water supply reduces unit costs this is important since table 5 indicates that it is not always the poorest households that consume the least water informal dwellings in the city consume water at a level 4 volumetric level suggesting that an ibt may not always benefit the poor these findings concur with jansen 41 and pinto and marques 42 since a desalination plant may actually decrease tariffs this may actually alleviate financial burdens on the poorer residents in the city our results therefore indicate the importance of urgently proceeding with a desalination plant for the city of cape town continuation of baseline water supply options such as alien plant clearance and renovation of existing dams should continue but not as a substitute for a desalination plant our study also has application for other developing countries considering water supply augmentation often governments in developing countries shy away from major capital development projects due to perceived financial and institutional constraints as well as concerns over the impact of rising costs on the poorest citizens however we show here that not only does a major infrastructure development supply the necessary water requirements overall the finances released through water sales may actually improve city coffers making it possible to actually reduce tariffs our study shows modelling realism such as taking into consideration the relevant tariff structure used by the entity see e g ref 43 is important in financial assessments of water infrastructure development projects this may positively influence the provision of loans for infrastructure development in developing countries thereby enabling increased access to water provision particularly to poorer households in times of water scarcity foreign skills and technologies are also important in developing countries facing capacity constraints a desalination plant is a preferred option compared with the current approach employed by the city namely water demand management in particular water rationing which according to janmaat 44 is regarded as a last resort our results indicate the importance of urgently proceeding with a desalination plant for the city of cape town 6 conclusions our model indicates that a desalination plant along with alien clearance is the most cost effective option for the city of cape town and generates the most water for the city of cape town residents we are not necessarily advocating that all the money for water infrastructure capital development projects should come from city of cape town water budgets central government certainly also has a role to play both in terms of 1 assisting with iap clearing in the berg and breede wma as well as maintenance of that clearance and 2 providing financing for desalination plants also as we have indicated in the discussion foreign capital and expertise may also be an option and indeed a necessity the study shows that it is financially viable for a large scale desalination plant to be constructed in the city of cape town and not only that also generates greater cost recovery than the business as usual options acknowledgments the author would like to thank dea nrm for the financial

8726,a two region spatial economic model is developed to explore the implications of interregional water transfers on household migration and the intraregional distribution of land between urban and agricultural use when there are agglomeration economies in urban production a particular example is considered where an arid region lacks water resources but has differing levels of amenities and agricultural productivity relative to a water rich region the conditions for the stability of both the dispersed and concentrated equilibria are found numerical simulations provide a graphical example of the set of stable equilibria in the parameter space finally the model is calibrated using data on household consumption and agricultural production patterns in the us keywords water land use patterns regional migration amenities jel classification q2 r12 r14 r23 1 introduction the growth of the american west over the last fifty years can be thanked in no small part for its ability to draw on additional water resources beyond the local available supply the california state water project and the colorado river aqueduct both provide southern california households and agricultural producers with water from the northern portion of the state and the colorado river respectively while the central utah project and the central arizona project both significantly supplement their respective region s local water resources more generally a recent study found that arid regions globally are increasingly reliant on imported water for both urban use and agricultural irrigation 1 given the significant constraint that limited water resources place on a region s economic viability why have such large cities and farming communities emerged in these arid locations in regards to cities the urban economics literature has focused on local amenities as a driver of household growth in arid regions 2 4 with the decline of moving costs households are drawn to regions with agreeable weather or physical beauty as for agriculture provided that there is sufficient water for irrigation the moderate climates and a lack of unpredictable weather create highly productive and year round growing conditions this paper develops a spatial economic model to explore how interbasin water transfers affect interregional migration and water use and the intraregional distribution of land between agricultural and urban use the primary contribution of this paper is in integrating the tools of spatial and regional economics in order to gain insight on how access to interregional water transfers in the long run play a role in the location choice of households and agricultural production there has been little theoretical research on the economic implications of regional water transfers an important exception is howe and easter 5 the international trade literature has focused on virtual water which allows arid regions to reduce the amount of water needed for irrigation by importing goods embedded with a high degree of water content 6 while in the short run this is a viable alternative to maintaining a local agricultural sector for a country facing water scarcity this strand of the literature ignores the possible productivity benefits from locating agricultural production in highly fertile but arid regions in order to explore the interplay between natural amenities and agricultural productivity on household migration and land use patterns a novel synthesis of the monocentric city framework and the two region trade models associated with the new economic geography neg is developed the monocentric city model has been the workhorse model in urban economics for the last 40 years for its capability in analyzing the tradeoffs between the scale economies in urban concentration and the diseconomies of scale in commuting within an intraregional setting the neg in contrast has provided a class of models designed to explore the impact of interregional trade costs on population migration when there are scale economies in a monopolistically competitive manufacturing sector 7 9 this paper combines these models in a tractable framework while making a couple of modifications the model consists of two regions of equal size whose land can be used for urban or agricultural use or both each region is naturally endowed with differing degrees of natural amenities which are valued by households and agricultural total factor productivity which determines regional agricultural output households work in an urban manufacturing sector and live in the city where production is located the manufacturing sector in each region has external scale economies associated with the size of the local population the number of residents in each city defines the proportion of each region s land that is developed for urban use with any remaining land in the region devoted to agricultural production there is then an opportunity cost to urban land in lost agricultural production which is increasing in the total factor productivity of the regions agricultural sector agricultural producers compete with urban households for both water and land the agricultural good is assumed to be freely traded between regions as introducing trade costs requires considering different trade regimes autarky incomplete specialization and specialization depending on the relative levels of regional agricultural productivity therefore this assumption consistent with helpman s specification 10 allows us to simplify the analysis and focus on the interregional distribution of water and the intraregional distribution of land transport costs in agricultural goods are nonetheless important for instance volpe et al 11 show how gasoline prices which effect freight rates are a primary driver in the regional variation in prices for agricultural goods however casual empiricism suggests that there is less regional and seasonal variation in available produce varieties than in the past suggesting a decline in transport costs for agricultural goods over time in the model we assume that there is a fixed supply of water which is solely located in a single region with the other region assumed to be arid the arid region can import water but there are transports costs associated with shipment which take the iceberg form where the costs of transport are paid with the water itself therefore the actual available supply of water is dependent on the number of households and the scale of agricultural production in the arid region since samuelson 12 developed the specification of iceberg transport costs it has been widely used in the international trade and spatial economics literature due to the large gains in tractability that the specification provides while recently the assumption of constant parametric transport costs has come under scrutiny for its lack of realism see refs 13 and 14 we argue that with regards to water the parametrization of transport costs in this manner is apt and consistent with samuelson s notion that just as only a fraction of ice exported reaches its destination as unmelted ice 12 water loss in interbasin water transfers come largely from evaporation seepage and carriage water use for instance ma et al 15 find that 8 57 of the water diversion from the middle route of china s south north water transfer project was lost to evaporation a report by the australian government finds that transferring water interregionally through canals would require double the amount of water than would be consumed 16 while the food and agriculture organizations of the united nations finds that only 40 of water transfers for agricultural irrigation actually reach the agricultural products with the remaining portion lost in transit however much of the water loss is returned through acquifier recharge and can be used for other purposes at later dates 17 while carriage water which is the additional water needed to maintain quality is estimated to between 0 and 35 of the transfer 18 19 while we maintain the iceberg assumption to ease the analysis more intricate transport specifications have been developed in the spatial literature rogers and martin 20 and martin 21 retain the iceberg specification but allow the transport costs to be endogenously determined by the level of public infrastructure with a greater quantity of infrastructure reducing transaction costs konishi 22 and de cara et al 23 consider a transport network where goods are collected from their point of origin at common hub and then redistributed out to different markets additionally distance based measures have been applied to pollution costs due to transport to study urban location patterns and densities see refs 24 25 there is a long literature on agricultural productivity as summarized in christensen 26 and ball et al 27 in our model we focus on the regional variation in agricultural productivity which can be seen in the total factor productivity measures that have been published by the us department of agriculture since the 1960 s 28 we consider a simple but tractable production function where output is solely produced using water and land and where relative output between regions is simply a function of relative productivity and transport costs while the model abstracts from many of the important inputs in agricultural production it is able to provide insights into the spatial variation in agricultural production we do not consider labor inputs in the agricultural sector therefore the model is indicative of more developed economies where the share of labor devoted to agricultural production is low furthermore our analysis does not take into account the possibility of adjusting technology or varying the types of crops grown in order to better suit the local environment these issues are considered in the conclusion by motivating future research conceptually the results of our model can be described as a long run outcome for the location centers for households and agricultural production for example empirically in the us the warmer southern and western states have had an increasing share of the us population since the 1960 s while the northern midwest and the northeast have seen a declining population share 48 50 additionally the share of total us agricultural output in the southern pacific and atlantic regions particularly in the water stressed regions of california and florida has been persistently increasing since 1960 29 meanwhile the great lakes region often referred to as the breadbasket of america has shown a steady decline in population however continues to produce a sizable share of us agricultural output 29 a number of papers in the neg literature have aimed to integrate land use into the core periphery model 10 30 32 however the analysis is often restricted to urban areas one of the key features of this model is how variations in agricultural productivity and amenities across regions affect the price of urban land and the extent to which they promote or curtail the concentration of households in a single region recent research suggests that all land is not in fact equal and that variations in land quality across regions have a significant effect on urban land costs 33 34 additionally the uneven distribution of agricultural productivity can be a key determinant in the growth of a region 35 picard and zheng 36 integrated a more fully realized agricultural sector into the neg framework however their analysis did not focus on the competition for land between the urban and agricultural sector which is one of the primary purposes of this research an important question to ask is when water is costly to transport while agricultural goods are freely traded between regions why would the arid region not simply import the agricultural good our model suggests than when the agricultural productivity in the arid region is sufficiently high the output from importing water taking into account any water loss is greater than if agricultural production were left solely in the water rich region however if the amenity level in the arid region is high households would prefer the land developed for urban use therefore the results hinge critically on the relative agricultural productivity and amenity levels between regions more generally our results show that when one region is endowed with both a higher level of amenities and agricultural productivity relative to the other region these features push households to migrate in opposite directions a higher degree of local amenities increases the local population while greater agricultural productivity promotes migration toward the less productive region leaving the more productive region for agricultural use it follows that when amenities and productivity are sufficiently close to one another there is some level of population dispersion between the two regions when economies of scale are introduced in the manufacturing sector if they are sufficiently high the wage premium generated by the concentration of households in a single region dominates any benefit from a more even distribution of households between both regions however if scale economies are high and either amenities or productivity dominates the other only one of the concentrated equilibria is stable the paper is presented as follows section 2 develops the model providing a discussion of both the short run and the long run equilibrium and some results section 3 discusses the equilibrium prices population distributions and urban and agricultural land use as well as the conditions for different equilibrium configurations section 4 provides a numerical simulation of the model using us data on household consumption and agricultural productivity section 5 concludes and offers some suggestions for future research 2 the model table 1 provides an index of notation for the model consider two regions that are populated by a mass n of identical households with n i the number of households in region i 1 2 there is a single source of water with a finite supply w located in region 2 it is costless to transport water within region 2 to supply water in region 1 there are iceberg transport costs that require τ 1 units to be ordered to supply 1 unit with τ 1 units lost in transit each region contains a central business district cbd which holds an urban manufacturing sector all local households provide an inelastic supply of labor to the local manufacturing sector and receive the wage y i households demand 1 unit of land which implies that the size of the city in each region is equivalent to the local population each region is assumed to have a fixed quantity of land n therefore in the case that all households concentrate in a single region all land is used for household consumption a household that lives the distance x i from the city faces commuting costs t x i where t is the units of the numeraire good required to travel a unit of distance it is assumed that interregional commuting is not possible and that all land rent accrues to absentee landlords 1 1 while this assumption is chosen for simplification it does not qualitatively affect the results what changes is the mechanism whereby relative net incomes vary across regions in the model with absentee landlords the net income of households within each region varies with the local rental price when the model is adapted so that all rental income accrues back to households the regional variation in net income enters through changes in the transfer payment however in both models changes in parameters vary relative incomes in the same direction utility is derived from household consumption of the numeraire manufactured good m i and the agricultural good a i which are both freely traded with respective prices 1 and p a additionally households in each region consume urban water w i u and face the regional water price p i w the difference in regional water prices reflect transport costs in the distribution of water and is represented by the relationship p 1 w τ p 2 w all households face the price p 2 w but for a household in region 1 to receive 1 unit of water they must order τ units so that the effective price that they pay is τ p 2 w utility takes the cobb douglas form and a household s problem in each region at location x i is then 1 v i x i max a i m i w i u ϕ i a i α w i u γ m i η α γ η 1 s t y i r i x i t x i p a a i p i w w i u m i the parameter ϕ

across locations within a city utility must be constant by the assumption of unit lot sizes for households the size of the city in each region is simply n i the rent at the boundary of the city is equivalent to the agricultural land rent r i a so that r i n i r i a therefore for utility to be constant it must be the case that v i x i v i n i given common wages and prices within the city and using 2 the regional bid rent function can then be written as 3 r i x i r i a t n i x i note that 4 r i x i t this indicates that marginal rents must decline with the distance from the city in order to compensate households for the additional commuting costs they incur from being located further from the cbd inserting 4 in to the budget constraint the indirect utility can be rewritten as 5 v i α α γ γ η η ϕ i y i r i a t n i p a α p i w γ notice that due to the assumption of an inelastic demand for land by households the demand and indirect utility functions are independent of each resident s commuting distance from the cbd x i therefore the term x i is dropped from the remainder of the paper 2 1 manufacturing the manufacturing sector in each region contains a continuum of small firms which produce outputs using labor with the aggregate linear production function a i n i firms take a i as given therefore perfect competition drives profits to zero implying a i y i however it is assumed that there are external benefits to production from the size of the local labor force therefore workers are paid their average rather than their marginal product with wages taking the form 6 y i a i a 1 n i δ where δ is a measure of the external benefits to output from local labor supply and a is the marginal product of labor of an isolated worker the functional form in 6 implies that there is a wage premium for the region with a larger population 2 2 agriculture in each region the land available for agricultural production is the remainder not devoted to urban use n n i the agricultural good is produced using water and land with the intensive form function 7 2 β i w i a where w i a is the quantity of agricultural water used per unit of land and β i is a shift factor that measures the agricultural productivity of the region the agricultural sector faces the water price p i w and the agricultural land rent r i a and receives p a for each unit of the agricultural good sold the profit function per unit of land is then given by 8 p a 2 β i w i a p i w w i a r i a profit maximization and perfect competition yield the agricultural water demand and land rents 9 w i a p a β i p i w 2 r

land this reflects the water weighted productivity of agricultural land in the arid region note that when water transport costs increase relative productivity between region 1 and 2 falls so that households face a lower opportunity cost for urban land in region 1 increasing disposable income 3 equilibrium prices and population distributions 3 1 short run equilibrium in the short run the population share in each region is assumed to be fixed it is useful to rewrite terms in share form define λ n 1 n with 1 λ n 2 n in equilibrium the revenue generated from the sale of agricultural goods and water respectively must equal the household expenditure on the respective goods the equilibrium conditions are then given by 11 p a 2 1 λ n β 1 w 1 a 2 λ n β 2 w 2 a p a λ n a 1 1 λ n a 2 12 p 2 w w p 2 w 1 λ n w 2 u λ n w 2 a p 1 w λ n w 1 u 1 λ n w 1 a inserting 2 9 and 10 into 11 and 12 yields short run prices as function of λ 13 r 2 a α 2 λ a 1 λ n δ t λ n 1 λ a 1 1 λ n δ t 1 λ n 1 λ

p 1 w τ p 2 w and r 1 a b r 2 a 3 1 1 short run comparative statics this section considers the effects of the parameters on the short run prices table 2 provides the signs of the comparative statics an increase in the parameter α which is the household expenditure share for agricultural goods leads to an increase in all prices as households increase their demand for food there is greater demand for factors of production namely water and land driving up both input and output prices an increase in households demand for water γ raises the price of water and thus the price of agricultural goods but has no effect on agricultural land rents conversely an increase in the available supply of water w reduces the price of water and the agricultural good but has no effect on rents while an increase in the population holding the water supply fixed raises the prices for both water and agricultural good when b increases so that agricultural sector in region 1 is relatively more productive than region 2 region 2 rents fall it is straightforward to show that agricultural rents rise in region 1 with increases in b conversely an increase in τ would reduce b raising the relative productivity of the agricultural sector in region 2 and the land rents the comparative statics on the remaining short run parameters are ambiguous to understand the intuition it is useful to begin with λ in each price there is a common term in the numerator which is the sum of the disposable income net of agricultural land rents for workers in each city multiplied by their respective population share suppose that λ 1 2 so that disposable income net of agricultural land rents are equal for households in both regions consider an increase in λ which would raise the wages of workers in region 1 and lower the wages for workers in region 2 however it would also increase commuting costs in region 1 while reducing such costs in region 2 therefore disposable income increases only if the marginal wage increase outweighs the additional marginal commuting cost now consider the common denominator of each of the prices the denominator is decreasing in λ if b 1 intuitively when λ increases and the agricultural sector in region 1 is sufficiently more productive than region 2 there is a productivity loss due to the transition of land from agricultural to urban use putting upward pressure on prices we can then say that if the external benefits of agglomeration exceed the commuting costs and b 1 p 2 w and p a increase with λ a similar argument holds in the case of n prices rise with the total population provided that the wage increase from agglomeration economies offset additional commuting costs finally we can show the following p 2 w b 0 p a b 0 λ 1 2 p 2 w τ 0 p a τ 0 λ 1 2 this is a curious result given that we would expect productivity increases to lead to reductions in factor and output prices recall that an increase in b raises land rents in region 1 and lowers rents in region 2 therefore when λ 1 2 an increase in b raises disposable income for a greater segment of the population and increases overall expenditure on water and agricultural goods thus raising their respective prices 3 2 long run equilibrium in the long run households locate in the region where they receive the higher utility the migration equation is standard from the literature 9 and is assumed to take the form 16 v λ λ 1 λ v 1 v 2 where v 1 v 2 is simply the utility gap between regions when v 1 v 2 0 households migrate toward region 1 and when v 1 v 2 0 households migrate toward region 2 an equilibrium is characterized by v 0 there are solutions at λ 0 λ 1 and λ 0 1 such that v 1 v 2 a concentrated equilibrium is stable if v λ 0 0 v λ 1 0 while an interior equilibrium is stable if v λ 0 1 0 and v λ λ 0 1 0 where λ denotes an interior equilibrium inserting 13 into 5 and noting the fixed ratio between each region s agricultural land rents and water prices an interior solution implies 17 v 1 v 2 ϕ 1 a 1 λ n δ r 1 a t λ n p a α p 1 w γ ϕ 2 a 1 1 λ n δ r 2 a t 1 λ n p a α p 2 w γ 1 p a α p 1 w γ a φ 1 λ n δ 1 1 λ n δ t φ λ n 1 λ n b φ 1 α 2 λ a 1 λ n δ t λ n 1 λ a 1 1 λ n δ t 1 λ n 1 λ b α 2 λ 1 b α 2 the term φ ϕ 1 ϕ 2 1 τ γ measures the water cost weighted relative amenity level for locating in the arid region thus when transport costs are higher from 1 amenities are weighted down in region 1 relative to region 2 there is an incentive for concentration through the wage premium where household income is higher in the region with the larger population however concentration raises local urban rents by increasing both commuting costs and the agricultural land rent the proceeding section will focus on the interplay of these competing features of the model 3 3 results given the assumption of iceberg transport costs the distribution of the population is independent of the water supply w as p 2 w can be factored out of the utility gap however the true quantity of water available in the economy must take into account any water loss from interbasin water transfers the water loss is a function of the size of the urban population and the agricultural sector in the arid region in terms of households demand is driven by the number of residents in the arid region λ n which in turn is determined by the relative amenity level between regions φ the share of expenditure on own water consumption γ and the expenditure share on the agricultural good α for the agricultural sector water demand in the arid region is driven by the availability of agricultural land 1 λ n and the relative productivity of land between regions b and of course interacting with these terms is τ which defines the extent of the water loss from regional transfers this section begins by analyzing the equilibrium population distributions λ we then consider how changes in the parameters effect the long run equilibrium in order to understand the competing roles of regional amenities and agricultural productivity in the household location decision it is useful to consider the model with no agglomeration economies i e δ 0 proposition 1 when there are no scale economies in the urban manufacturing sector there is a unique interior equilibrium when 18 a r 2 a a t n r 1 a a 1 α 2 α 2 a b t n a t n φ a t n b a b 1 α 2 α 2 a t n a t n r 2 a a r 1 a proof see appendix a the inequalities in 18 ensure that v 0 0 and v 1 0 so that an interior equilibrium exists the term on the left is the ratio of the disposable income of an isolated worker in region 2 to a worker in region 1 when the population is concentrated conversely the term on the right is ratio of disposable income for workers when they are concentrated in region 2 compared to an isolated worker in region 1 these inequalities simply guarantee that the opportunity cost of concentrating in a single region is sufficiently high so that the population is divided between regions the intuition is that if ϕ 1 is large relative to ϕ 2 households receive a greater benefit from concentrating in region 1 leaving the land in region 2 for agricultural use conversely if β 1 is sufficiently greater than β 2 all households locate in region 2 to allow for the more productive land in region 1 to be used for agricultural production therefore in order for the population to be divided between the two regions the relative amenity and productivity levels must be similar in magnitude suppose that the parameters are such that an interior equilibrium exists consider how changes in b and φ affect the equilibrium prices utility and population share in the short run an increase in b raises agricultural output reducing the agricultural price and increasing the price of water in region 2 in order for the zero profit condition to hold agricultural rents fall to accommodate the loss in revenue while the agricultural rents rise in region 1 due to the increase in productivity the overall effect is to raise net income and thus utility in region 2 relative to region 1 leading to a reduction in λ an increase in φ has no short run effects in the long run increasing amenities in region 1 raises the local utility level generating migration toward region 1 this increases the demand for urban land in region 1 which drives up r 1 a and raises p a the increase in the agricultural price raises revenue for the agricultural sector in region 2 increasing r 2 a in addition an increase in p a lowers the demand for agricultural goods and thus the water inputs needed for agricultural production reducing p i w we now introduce urban agglomeration economies it is helpful to define the following terms 19 φ 1 a 1 α 2 b 1 n δ α 2 t n a 1 n δ t n 20 φ 2 b a 1 n δ t n a b α 2 b 1 n δ t n b α 2 φ 1 mirrors 18 and represents the ratio of the opportunity cost of deviating toward region 2 relative to the disposable income of a worker when λ 1 conversely φ 2 represents the ratio of the disposable income of a worker in region 2 when λ 0 relative to the opportunity cost of deviating toward region 1 this yields the following result proposition 2 when there are external scale economies in the manufacturing sector the parameter space can be divided into four cases case 1 if 21 φ 2 φ φ 1 there is a stable interior equilibrium and no stable concentrated equilibria case 2 if 22 φ 2 φ φ 1 both concentrated equilibria are stable with an unstable interior equilibrium case 3 if 23 φ max φ 2 φ 1 λ 1 is a stable equilibrium λ 0 is unstable any interior equilibria come in pairs and alternate between stable and unstable case 4 if 24 φ min φ 2 φ 1 λ 0 is a stable equilibrium λ 1 is unstable any interior equilibria come in pairs and alternate between stable and unstable proof see appendix b fig 1 provides graphical examples of proposition 2 in φ β 1 φ δ and φ τ space respectively as well as three dimensional plots in φ β 1 τ space and φ β 1 δ space case 1 when neither the φ nor b dominates and both scale economies and transport costs are low there is a stable dispersed equilibrium this is due to two factors first when scale economies are low the wage premium generated by household concentration in a single region is not sufficient to offset the additional commuting costs from a single large city second the moderate levels of both φ and b relative to one another ensure that land in each region is devoted to both urban and agricultural use this is an interesting result as in general lower transport costs tend to generate agglomeration in neg models in this case lowering transport costs reduces the costs of locating in the arid region generating more competition for land between the agricultural and urban sectors leading to dispersion case 2 in the case φ and b are relatively close to one another and both scale economies and transport costs are high the wage premium is dominant leading to concentration in either region the competition for land between the urban and agricultural sectors and the higher urban costs from from longer commutes are not sufficiently strong to counter the wage premium generated from household concentration in a single region case 3 there is a tendency toward concentration in region 1 driven by both the wage premium and higher level of amenities in region 1 this effect is more pronounced as τ increases given that in the example households consume less water per unit of land than agricultural production making it more economical in terms of water use for workers to concentrate in the arid region case 4 in contrast to case 3 when b dominates and there are strong economies of scale all households locate in region 2 collecting the full agglomeration wage a 1 n δ leaving the more fertile land in region 1 for agricultural production this outcome becomes less likely as transport costs increase due to the excessive water loss in providing water to the agricultural sector in the arid region up to this point in the analysis the focus has been on the determinants of the equilibrium in order to shed some light on how the population distribution changes with the parameters fig 2 provides bifurcation diagrams for β 1 ϕ 1 n τ α γ t and δ in fig 2 a at low values of β 1 the high amenities in region 1 dominate leading all households to locate in that region as the land in region 1 becomes relatively more productive households migrate toward region 2 to allow the more fertile land to be employed in agricultural production until the whole of the population is concentrated in region 2 similarly in fig 2 b for relatively low levels of ϕ 1 b dominates and the population is concentrated in region 1 as ϕ 1 increases both a stable and an unstable equilibrium emerge in the interior up to a critical level after which all households are concentrated in region 1 fig 2 c provides the effect of changes in the total population n an increase in the population leads to an increase in the wage rate through the external economies pushing households toward the more populous region however the rise in income increases the demand for the agricultural good which is more easily satisfied by using the more productive region for agriculture therefore a second stable concentrated equilibrium emerges in region 2 for higher values of n in fig 2 d when τ 1 b dominates as all land is devoted to agriculture in region 1 as τ increases both b and φ decline however the effect on φ is less significant as it is dampened by the exponent γ therefore increases in transport costs reduce the benefit of agricultural production to a greater degree than urban development in the arid region as τ becomes exceedingly high the whole population locates in region 1 intuitively households consume less water than the agricultural sector therefore water loss is minimized when region 2 is solely dedicated to agriculture and households in the arid region simply import their food fig 2 e provides the simulation for α which determines household demand for the agricultural good when α is small there is less need for the more productive agricultural land in region 1 and the higher amenities dominate leading to concentration of all households in the region as α increases the population begins to divide itself between regions as the higher productivity of land in region 1 begins to dominate the amenities until the whole of the population is located in region 2 in fig 2 f when household demand for water is low so is the water loss from household consumption leading households to locate in the arid region however as household demand for water increases the population begins to shift toward region 2 in fig 2 g when commuting costs are low there exist multiple equilibria with both concentrated equilibrium stable and an unstable interior equilibrium as commuting costs increase a stable interior equilibrium emerges from λ 1 and tends to evenly divide the population between regions intuitively as commuting costs take up a larger portion of income households move to minimize those costs by distributing themselves into two smaller cities in fig 2 h when there are no scale economies i e δ 0 the population share and thus the wage are slightly higher in region 1 therefore as δ increases the wage differential between regions 1 and 2 grows leading to further increases in λ up to a stable concentrated equilibrium at 1 a second unstable arm emerges along with a stable concentrated equilibrium at λ 0 as the wage premium from household concentration becomes dominant notice that the simulations for δ and t are almost mirror images of each other reflecting the trade off of agglomeration between higher wages and higher commuting costs 4 numerical example an application to us data the above model has provided a broad view of the tension between amenity and productivity levels on regional land use patterns and household location choice this section provides a numerical example of the model that is calibrated using stylized facts from us data on household consumption and agricultural production table 3 gives the parameter values employed in the simulation in the case of the productivity premium an index of total factor productivity tfp by state in 2004 ranges from a low of 0 5712 for wyoming to a high of 1 7979 for california implying the following upper and lower bounds b 0 3177 3 1475 β 2 is set at 1 and β 1 1 1 5 2 estimates of interregional unit water transport costs show a great deal of variation between regions largely due to differences in distance and topography we then set τ to 1 2 and 1 6 to represent high and low transport costs consistent with acwa 18 hollinshead and lund 19 and dsewpc 16 this yields for low transport costs b 83 1 87 3 33 and for high transport costs b 63 1 41 2 5 consistent with estimates of per capita water use of 1 acre ft per person in california 46 we set w 1 and n 1 so that regional population is described in share form the model is considered both with and without scale economies in production the value of δ is set at 0 21 which reflects a 7 increase in average productivity with a doubling of employment density consistent with empirical estimates when n 1 t reflects not only the commuting cost per unit of distance but also the cost of commuting from the boundary of the region therefore a worker commuting from the boundary spends roughly 20 of gross income on commuting 37 finally the value of φ 1 1 represents an empirically modest though as we will see not insignificant amenity premium for region 1 table 4 provides the results of the simulation when transport costs are low conceptually this is consistent with a situation where the water transport technology is better able to reduce water loss and thus more effectively take advantage of regional variations in productivity the first set of columns represent the case where agricultural productivity is equivalent in each region but given the transport costs for water region 2 is effectively more productive in agricultural while region 1 provides greater amenities in the case when there are no scale economies 72 of the population reside in region 1 and roughly 65 of region 1 s agricultural demand is imported when scale economies are introduced all households locate in region 1 and all food is imported additionally scale economies uniformly raise prices and utility due to higher household income the concentration of the population implies that only region 2 produces the agricultural good therefore agricultural water use increases in region 2 and urban water use increases in region 1 in this case household concentration shifts agricultural production to the more productive region generating higher total agricultural output and a lower level of water loss notice that average urban land rent which is calculated by integrating the rent function over the city and dividing by the local population is increasing in region 1 and decreasing in region 2 when productivity is held fixed and scale economies are introduced the second set of columns in table 4 represents the case where the agricultural sector in region 1 is moderately more productive given the higher productivity of land in region 1 when there are no scale economies the population is more evenly divided with a 63 share in region 1 however only 13 of region 1 s agricultural demand is imported when scale economies exist again region 1 is solely used for housing and there is a similar effect on prices and utility from an increase in δ however note that there is an increase in the land rent in region 1 and decrease in region 2 in relation to the case where region 2 was more productive note that water loss falls by nearly 50 as all agricultural land in region 1 is taken out of production when households concentrate however there is also a 13 decline in total agricultural output the third set of columns denotes the case where region 1 is significantly more productive than region 2 in this case while scale economies do continue to push more workers toward region 1 28 of the land remains available for agricultural production when there are no scale economies region 1 is a net exporter of agricultural goods however when δ is increased the loss of available land for agriculture makes it so that the region becomes again a net importer while there is a reduction in water loss it is much smaller than in the previous case roughly 10 compared to nearly 50 this occurs due to the fact the region 1 continues to produce the agricultural good given that land used for housing utilizes less water than if used for farming the fact that workers don t fully concentrate in region 1 as before means a significant amount of water continues to be lost through transfers to region 1 for agricultural production however the fact that region 1 continues to produce output reduces the loss to total agricultural output it is worth noting that total urban water use taking into account water loss stays roughly constant over each example finally average urban land rents appear to rise at a slower rate in region 1 and fall at a slower rate in region 2 when scale economies are introduced as productivity increases in region 1 in addition the share of income devoted to housing on average in region 1 goes from roughly 10 when there are no scale economies and β 1 1 to nearly 17 when β 1 2 with scale economies while in region 2 with the same parameter changes the income share falls from 7 5 to 5 5 table 5 gives numerical results for the model when transport costs are high in contrast to the results in table 4 this example highlights a situation where the water transport technology is less effective in this case greater productivity in the arid region is ultimately diminished by the large water loss associated with the water transfer qualitatively the results are largely the same however when both regions have the same productivity so that region 2 is effectively more productive once scale economies are introduced land rents fall this is due to the fact that the scale economies push households toward region 1 generating less competition for land in the more productive region as would be expected water loss is higher and agricultural output is lower than in the case with lower transport costs while urban water use remains largely unchanged when there are no scale economies total agricultural water use is lower with high transport costs compared to low transport costs however the quantity of water used by the agricultural sector in region 2 is higher as the region generates a greater share of the agricultural output interestingly the population shares with no scale economies are largely the same in the case of both high and low transport costs however when β 1 2 when scale economies are introduced there is stronger shift by households toward region 1 when there are high transport costs with a 36 increase in the population compared to 26 when there are low transport costs the larger transition of agricultural land to urban use in region 1 generates a greater decline in agricultural output relative to the case of low transport costs 4 1 a discussion of the numerical results in light of us migration patterns can the results in tables 4 and 5 be used to describe migratory patterns in the us of course a linear two region model cannot fully account for the migration patterns across households in fifty states we nevertheless feel that it is capable of qualitatively reproducing many features in the data consider a relatively small region such as southern california where the productivity of the land is relatively homogenous over the region while the area closer to the coast has more amenable weather compared to the much warmer regions further inland in the early 1900s the land in southern california was largely devoted to agriculture presently the region is completely urbanized from ventura county to the mexican border and well inland through los angeles county riverside county orange county and san diego county the eastern portion of southern california that buttresses arizona and nevada remains largely agricultural containing two of the most productive regions in the country the imperial valley and coachella valley this result would be consistent with the first set of columns in tables 4 and 5 where the agricultural productivity in region 1 is low and the amenities dominate similarly we can compare florida which ranked 2nd in us agricultural tfp in 2004 and grew from the 33rd most populous state to the 4th between the years 1900 and 2000 38 to iowa which ranked 3rd in tfp and fell in population rank from 10th to 30th between 1900 and 2000 this is consistent with a specification where b is relatively low as both regions have similar productive capabilities while φ would favor florida with its warmer climates and coastal amenities finally consider california in relation to texas both offer warm weather and face water supply concerns yet california ranked 1st in agricultural tfp in 2004 while texas was ranked 43rd in 1960 california farm output was 50 greater than that of texas and by 2004 it was 100 larger while over the same time period both houston and the dallas fort worth areas entered into the top 10 of the most populous us cities this is consistent with a more dominant agricultural sector in california both california and texas have significant urban sectors while the agricultural sector is larger and growing at a faster pace in california 5 conclusion and future research this paper has developed a two region economic geography model to explore the interplay of agricultural productivity and amenities in arid regions when water is a mobile factor and there are economies of scale in the urban manufacturing sector when scale economies are sufficiently low it was shown that amenities and agricultural productivity drive land use patterns in opposite directions amenities encourage the development of land for urban use while greater productivity supports land use for agricultural production for moderate levels of both amenities and productivity there is a stable and dispersed equilibrium if economies of scale in the manufacturing sector are high and neither the productivity or amenity levels dominate the other the wage premium generated from all households concentrating in a single region overwhelms the benefits of a more even distribution of the population when either the amenities or agricultural productivity dominates the other and there is a high degree of scale economies only one of the concentrated equilibria is stable the parameter space was explored in order to define the conditions for stable and unstable equilibrium configurations and bifurcation diagrams were shown numerically for key parameters finally the model was calibrated to reflect us data on household consumption and agricultural production patterns while this paper has developed a coherent framework to explore how competing urban and agricultural interests vie for water and land in the interests of tractability a number of realistic features have been excluded iceberg transport costs provide a convenient way to conceptually model freight costs however they focus solely on the marginal cost of distribution associated with the loss of water for carriage water the iceberg specification is appropriate however to consider evaporation and leakage a distance based measure would be more appropriate additionally it would be important to consider additional marginal costs for instance the energy costs associated with pumping water zhou and tol 39 find that water is relatively inexpensive to transport horizontally but becomes exceedingly costly to transport vertically in practice water distribution networks both intra and interregionally have significant fixed costs particularly in the development of the network linking communities to an outside water source such networks require financing from local state and federal governments the economies of scale and public financing of interregional water transfers should be further explored in order to gain a more robust understanding of the effect of water transfers on migration and land use our model assumed that the agricultural good is produced using solely water and land with no labor inputs used for a country like the united states where less than 1 of the population is employed in agricultural production this assumption is less onerous however in countries where agricultural employment is high it would be useful to consider how variations in productivity effect agricultural employment across regions additionally it would be interesting to consider a situation in which agricultural workers face not only a choice between regions but between remaining in the agricultural sector or switching to urban employment furthermore our specification of the technology for the agricultural sector as simply a cobb douglas aggregation of water and land implies unitary elasticity of substitution which is higher than empirical estimates which range from 0 to 0 5 40 41 therefore if the model were to be extended for policy analysis more sophisticated functional forms would need to be employed additionally while our model is able to qualitatively capture some long run macro trends in the location of agricultural production the model ignores the possible use of different production technologies which allow for adaptation to different climates and geography moreover our model does not deal explicitly with varieties of agricultural goods which could allow for regional specialization in distinct varieties of output due to the assumption of iceberg transport costs the available supply of water plays no role in the long run distribution of households it would be useful to introduce a more intricate specification in which the availability of water played an explicit role in the household and agricultural producers location decision in addition an important issue is the reliability of water supply in particular for agriculture for example while households can be relatively flexible in their water use by reducing irrigation taking shorter showers almond farmers can not in the short run as easily adapt without losing a significant share of their crop therefore introducing a dynamic stochastic water supply that takes into account the likelihood of wet average or dry years would help to better understand agricultural producers planting decisions this model has provided a competitive framework where water is allocated to its best use through the price system however water transfers are often dominated by a byzantine set of rules where water prices vary not only by city or region but by consumers within cities and rural areas as well a portion of agricultural land in certain regions may be allocated water rights that are not available to the remaining shares of land therefore an understanding of the institutional factors that define water use patterns often over and above the market structure are crucial in gauging the future development of arid regions and the ability to sustain future growth in population and agricultural production finally high amenity cities tend to have higher rents households respond to these higher prices by reducing the quantity of living space they consume presumably offsetting the loss through the additional benefits they receive from the local amenities relaxing the assumption of inelastic demand for land by households can provide a more realistic portrait of land distribution in a region with both high productivity and amenities in particular it would allow for the possibility of a large share of the population residing in a single region on a relatively small share of the land acknowledgements i would like to thank richard

8726,a two region spatial economic model is developed to explore the implications of interregional water transfers on household migration and the intraregional distribution of land between urban and agricultural use when there are agglomeration economies in urban production a particular example is considered where an arid region lacks water resources but has differing levels of amenities and agricultural productivity relative to a water rich region the conditions for the stability of both the dispersed and concentrated equilibria are found numerical simulations provide a graphical example of the set of stable equilibria in the parameter space finally the model is calibrated using data on household consumption and agricultural production patterns in the us keywords water land use patterns regional migration amenities jel classification q2 r12 r14 r23 1 introduction the growth of the american west over the last fifty years can be thanked in no small part for its ability to draw on additional water resources beyond the local available supply the california state water project and the colorado river aqueduct both provide southern california households and agricultural producers with water from the northern portion of the state and the colorado river respectively while the central utah project and the central arizona project both significantly supplement their respective region s local water resources more generally a recent study found that arid regions globally are increasingly reliant on imported water for both urban use and agricultural irrigation 1 given the significant constraint that limited water resources place on a region s economic viability why have such large cities and farming communities emerged in these arid locations in regards to cities the urban economics literature has focused on local amenities as a driver of household growth in arid regions 2 4 with the decline of moving costs households are drawn to regions with agreeable weather or physical beauty as for agriculture provided that there is sufficient water for irrigation the moderate climates and a lack of unpredictable weather create highly productive and year round growing conditions this paper develops a spatial economic model to explore how interbasin water transfers affect interregional migration and water use and the intraregional distribution of land between agricultural and urban use the primary contribution of this paper is in integrating the tools of spatial and regional economics in order to gain insight on how access to interregional water transfers in the long run play a role in the location choice of households and agricultural production there has been little theoretical research on the economic implications of regional water transfers an important exception is howe and easter 5 the international trade literature has focused on virtual water which allows arid regions to reduce the amount of water needed for irrigation by importing goods embedded with a high degree of water content 6 while in the short run this is a viable alternative to maintaining a local agricultural sector for a country facing water scarcity this strand of the literature ignores the possible productivity benefits from locating agricultural production in highly fertile but arid regions in order to explore the interplay between natural amenities and agricultural productivity on household migration and land use patterns a novel synthesis of the monocentric city framework and the two region trade models associated with the new economic geography neg is developed the monocentric city model has been the workhorse model in urban economics for the last 40 years for its capability in analyzing the tradeoffs between the scale economies in urban concentration and the diseconomies of scale in commuting within an intraregional setting the neg in contrast has provided a class of models designed to explore the impact of interregional trade costs on population migration when there are scale economies in a monopolistically competitive manufacturing sector 7 9 this paper combines these models in a tractable framework while making a couple of modifications the model consists of two regions of equal size whose land can be used for urban or agricultural use or both each region is naturally endowed with differing degrees of natural amenities which are valued by households and agricultural total factor productivity which determines regional agricultural output households work in an urban manufacturing sector and live in the city where production is located the manufacturing sector in each region has external scale economies associated with the size of the local population the number of residents in each city defines the proportion of each region s land that is developed for urban use with any remaining land in the region devoted to agricultural production there is then an opportunity cost to urban land in lost agricultural production which is increasing in the total factor productivity of the regions agricultural sector agricultural producers compete with urban households for both water and land the agricultural good is assumed to be freely traded between regions as introducing trade costs requires considering different trade regimes autarky incomplete specialization and specialization depending on the relative levels of regional agricultural productivity therefore this assumption consistent with helpman s specification 10 allows us to simplify the analysis and focus on the interregional distribution of water and the intraregional distribution of land transport costs in agricultural goods are nonetheless important for instance volpe et al 11 show how gasoline prices which effect freight rates are a primary driver in the regional variation in prices for agricultural goods however casual empiricism suggests that there is less regional and seasonal variation in available produce varieties than in the past suggesting a decline in transport costs for agricultural goods over time in the model we assume that there is a fixed supply of water which is solely located in a single region with the other region assumed to be arid the arid region can import water but there are transports costs associated with shipment which take the iceberg form where the costs of transport are paid with the water itself therefore the actual available supply of water is dependent on the number of households and the scale of agricultural production in the arid region since samuelson 12 developed the specification of iceberg transport costs it has been widely used in the international trade and spatial economics literature due to the large gains in tractability that the specification provides while recently the assumption of constant parametric transport costs has come under scrutiny for its lack of realism see refs 13 and 14 we argue that with regards to water the parametrization of transport costs in this manner is apt and consistent with samuelson s notion that just as only a fraction of ice exported reaches its destination as unmelted ice 12 water loss in interbasin water transfers come largely from evaporation seepage and carriage water use for instance ma et al 15 find that 8 57 of the water diversion from the middle route of china s south north water transfer project was lost to evaporation a report by the australian government finds that transferring water interregionally through canals would require double the amount of water than would be consumed 16 while the food and agriculture organizations of the united nations finds that only 40 of water transfers for agricultural irrigation actually reach the agricultural products with the remaining portion lost in transit however much of the water loss is returned through acquifier recharge and can be used for other purposes at later dates 17 while carriage water which is the additional water needed to maintain quality is estimated to between 0 and 35 of the transfer 18 19 while we maintain the iceberg assumption to ease the analysis more intricate transport specifications have been developed in the spatial literature rogers and martin 20 and martin 21 retain the iceberg specification but allow the transport costs to be endogenously determined by the level of public infrastructure with a greater quantity of infrastructure reducing transaction costs konishi 22 and de cara et al 23 consider a transport network where goods are collected from their point of origin at common hub and then redistributed out to different markets additionally distance based measures have been applied to pollution costs due to transport to study urban location patterns and densities see refs 24 25 there is a long literature on agricultural productivity as summarized in christensen 26 and ball et al 27 in our model we focus on the regional variation in agricultural productivity which can be seen in the total factor productivity measures that have been published by the us department of agriculture since the 1960 s 28 we consider a simple but tractable production function where output is solely produced using water and land and where relative output between regions is simply a function of relative productivity and transport costs while the model abstracts from many of the important inputs in agricultural production it is able to provide insights into the spatial variation in agricultural production we do not consider labor inputs in the agricultural sector therefore the model is indicative of more developed economies where the share of labor devoted to agricultural production is low furthermore our analysis does not take into account the possibility of adjusting technology or varying the types of crops grown in order to better suit the local environment these issues are considered in the conclusion by motivating future research conceptually the results of our model can be described as a long run outcome for the location centers for households and agricultural production for example empirically in the us the warmer southern and western states have had an increasing share of the us population since the 1960 s while the northern midwest and the northeast have seen a declining population share 48 50 additionally the share of total us agricultural output in the southern pacific and atlantic regions particularly in the water stressed regions of california and florida has been persistently increasing since 1960 29 meanwhile the great lakes region often referred to as the breadbasket of america has shown a steady decline in population however continues to produce a sizable share of us agricultural output 29 a number of papers in the neg literature have aimed to integrate land use into the core periphery model 10 30 32 however the analysis is often restricted to urban areas one of the key features of this model is how variations in agricultural productivity and amenities across regions affect the price of urban land and the extent to which they promote or curtail the concentration of households in a single region recent research suggests that all land is not in fact equal and that variations in land quality across regions have a significant effect on urban land costs 33 34 additionally the uneven distribution of agricultural productivity can be a key determinant in the growth of a region 35 picard and zheng 36 integrated a more fully realized agricultural sector into the neg framework however their analysis did not focus on the competition for land between the urban and agricultural sector which is one of the primary purposes of this research an important question to ask is when water is costly to transport while agricultural goods are freely traded between regions why would the arid region not simply import the agricultural good our model suggests than when the agricultural productivity in the arid region is sufficiently high the output from importing water taking into account any water loss is greater than if agricultural production were left solely in the water rich region however if the amenity level in the arid region is high households would prefer the land developed for urban use therefore the results hinge critically on the relative agricultural productivity and amenity levels between regions more generally our results show that when one region is endowed with both a higher level of amenities and agricultural productivity relative to the other region these features push households to migrate in opposite directions a higher degree of local amenities increases the local population while greater agricultural productivity promotes migration toward the less productive region leaving the more productive region for agricultural use it follows that when amenities and productivity are sufficiently close to one another there is some level of population dispersion between the two regions when economies of scale are introduced in the manufacturing sector if they are sufficiently high the wage premium generated by the concentration of households in a single region dominates any benefit from a more even distribution of households between both regions however if scale economies are high and either amenities or productivity dominates the other only one of the concentrated equilibria is stable the paper is presented as follows section 2 develops the model providing a discussion of both the short run and the long run equilibrium and some results section 3 discusses the equilibrium prices population distributions and urban and agricultural land use as well as the conditions for different equilibrium configurations section 4 provides a numerical simulation of the model using us data on household consumption and agricultural productivity section 5 concludes and offers some suggestions for future research 2 the model table 1 provides an index of notation for the model consider two regions that are populated by a mass n of identical households with n i the number of households in region i 1 2 there is a single source of water with a finite supply w located in region 2 it is costless to transport water within region 2 to supply water in region 1 there are iceberg transport costs that require τ 1 units to be ordered to supply 1 unit with τ 1 units lost in transit each region contains a central business district cbd which holds an urban manufacturing sector all local households provide an inelastic supply of labor to the local manufacturing sector and receive the wage y i households demand 1 unit of land which implies that the size of the city in each region is equivalent to the local population each region is assumed to have a fixed quantity of land n therefore in the case that all households concentrate in a single region all land is used for household consumption a household that lives the distance x i from the city faces commuting costs t x i where t is the units of the numeraire good required to travel a unit of distance it is assumed that interregional commuting is not possible and that all land rent accrues to absentee landlords 1 1 while this assumption is chosen for simplification it does not qualitatively affect the results what changes is the mechanism whereby relative net incomes vary across regions in the model with absentee landlords the net income of households within each region varies with the local rental price when the model is adapted so that all rental income accrues back to households the regional variation in net income enters through changes in the transfer payment however in both models changes in parameters vary relative incomes in the same direction utility is derived from household consumption of the numeraire manufactured good m i and the agricultural good a i which are both freely traded with respective prices 1 and p a additionally households in each region consume urban water w i u and face the regional water price p i w the difference in regional water prices reflect transport costs in the distribution of water and is represented by the relationship p 1 w τ p 2 w all households face the price p 2 w but for a household in region 1 to receive 1 unit of water they must order τ units so that the effective price that they pay is τ p 2 w utility takes the cobb douglas form and a household s problem in each region at location x i is then 1 v i x i max a i m i w i u ϕ i a i α w i u γ m i η α γ η 1 s t y i r i x i t x i p a a i p i w w i u m i the parameter ϕ i is a regional shift factor that represents each region s endowment of local natural amenities such as climate or attractive landscape utility maximization yields the following demand functions and indirect utility 2 a i α y i r i x i t x i p a w i u γ y i r i x i t x i p i w m i η y i r i x i t x i v i x i α α γ γ η η y i r i x i t x i p a α p i w γ in order for households to be indifferent across locations within a city utility must be constant by the assumption of unit lot sizes for households the size of the city in each region is simply n i the rent at the boundary of the city is equivalent to the agricultural land rent r i a so that r i n i r i a therefore for utility to be constant it must be the case that v i x i v i n i given common wages and prices within the city and using 2 the regional bid rent function can then be written as 3 r i x i r i a t n i x i note that 4 r i x i t this indicates that marginal rents must decline with the distance from the city in order to compensate households for the additional commuting costs they incur from being located further from the cbd inserting 4 in to the budget constraint the indirect utility can be rewritten as 5 v i α α γ γ η η ϕ i y i r i a t n i p a α p i w γ notice that due to the assumption of an inelastic demand for land by households the demand and indirect utility functions are independent of each resident s commuting distance from the cbd x i therefore the term x i is dropped from the remainder of the paper 2 1 manufacturing the manufacturing sector in each region contains a continuum of small firms which produce outputs using labor with the aggregate linear production function a i n i firms take a i as given therefore perfect competition drives profits to zero implying a i y i however it is assumed that there are external benefits to production from the size of the local labor force therefore workers are paid their average rather than their marginal product with wages taking the form 6 y i a i a 1 n i δ where δ is a measure of the external benefits to output from local labor supply and a is the marginal product of labor of an isolated worker the functional form in 6 implies that there is a wage premium for the region with a larger population 2 2 agriculture in each region the land available for agricultural production is the remainder not devoted to urban use n n i the agricultural good is produced using water and land with the intensive form function 7 2 β i w i a where w i a is the quantity of agricultural water used per unit of land and β i is a shift factor that measures the agricultural productivity of the region the agricultural sector faces the water price p i w and the agricultural land rent r i a and receives p a for each unit of the agricultural good sold the profit function per unit of land is then given by 8 p a 2 β i w i a p i w w i a r i a profit maximization and perfect competition yield the agricultural water demand and land rents 9 w i a p a β i p i w 2 r

land this reflects the water weighted productivity of agricultural land in the arid region note that when water transport costs increase relative productivity between region 1 and 2 falls so that households face a lower opportunity cost for urban land in region 1 increasing disposable income 3 equilibrium prices and population distributions 3 1 short run equilibrium in the short run the population share in each region is assumed to be fixed it is useful to rewrite terms in share form define λ n 1 n with 1 λ n 2 n in equilibrium the revenue generated from the sale of agricultural goods and water respectively must equal the household expenditure on the respective goods the equilibrium conditions are then given by 11 p a 2 1 λ n β 1 w 1 a 2 λ n β 2 w 2 a p a λ n a 1 1 λ n a 2 12 p 2 w w p 2 w 1 λ n w 2 u λ n w 2 a p 1 w λ n w 1 u 1 λ n w 1 a inserting 2 9 and 10 into 11 and 12 yields short run prices as function of λ 13 r 2 a α 2 λ a 1 λ n δ t λ n 1 λ a 1 1 λ n δ t 1 λ n 1 λ

p 1 w τ p 2 w and r 1 a b r 2 a 3 1 1 short run comparative statics this section considers the effects of the parameters on the short run prices table 2 provides the signs of the comparative statics an increase in the parameter α which is the household expenditure share for agricultural goods leads to an increase in all prices as households increase their demand for food there is greater demand for factors of production namely water and land driving up both input and output prices an increase in households demand for water γ raises the price of water and thus the price of agricultural goods but has no effect on agricultural land rents conversely an increase in the available supply of water w reduces the price of water and the agricultural good but has no effect on rents while an increase in the population holding the water supply fixed raises the prices for both water and agricultural good when b increases so that agricultural sector in region 1 is relatively more productive than region 2 region 2 rents fall it is straightforward to show that agricultural rents rise in region 1 with increases in b conversely an increase in τ would reduce b raising the relative productivity of the agricultural sector in region 2 and the land rents the comparative statics on the remaining short run parameters are ambiguous to understand the intuition it is useful to begin with λ in each price there is a common term in the numerator which is the sum of the disposable income net of agricultural land rents for workers in each city multiplied by their respective population share suppose that λ 1 2 so that disposable income net of agricultural land rents are equal for households in both regions consider an increase in λ which would raise the wages of workers in region 1 and lower the wages for workers in region 2 however it would also increase commuting costs in region 1 while reducing such costs in region 2 therefore disposable income increases only if the marginal wage increase outweighs the additional marginal commuting cost now consider the common denominator of each of the prices the denominator is decreasing in λ if b 1 intuitively when λ increases and the agricultural sector in region 1 is sufficiently more productive than region 2 there is a productivity loss due to the transition of land from agricultural to urban use putting upward pressure on prices we can then say that if the external benefits of agglomeration exceed the commuting costs and b 1 p 2 w and p a increase with λ a similar argument holds in the case of n prices rise with the total population provided that the wage increase from agglomeration economies offset additional commuting costs finally we can show the following p 2 w b 0 p a b 0 λ 1 2 p 2 w τ 0 p a τ 0 λ 1 2 this is a curious result given that we would expect productivity increases to lead to reductions in factor and output prices recall that an increase in b raises land rents in region 1 and lowers rents in region 2 therefore when λ 1 2 an increase in b raises disposable income for a greater segment of the population and increases overall expenditure on water and agricultural goods thus raising their respective prices 3 2 long run equilibrium in the long run households locate in the region where they receive the higher utility the migration equation is standard from the literature 9 and is assumed to take the form 16 v λ λ 1 λ v 1 v 2 where v 1 v 2 is simply the utility gap between regions when v 1 v 2 0 households migrate toward region 1 and when v 1 v 2 0 households migrate toward region 2 an equilibrium is characterized by v 0 there are solutions at λ 0 λ 1 and λ 0 1 such that v 1 v 2 a concentrated equilibrium is stable if v λ 0 0 v λ 1 0 while an interior equilibrium is stable if v λ 0 1 0 and v λ λ 0 1 0 where λ denotes an interior equilibrium inserting 13 into 5 and noting the fixed ratio between each region s agricultural land rents and water prices an interior solution implies 17 v 1 v 2 ϕ 1 a 1 λ n δ r 1 a t λ n p a α p 1 w γ ϕ 2 a 1 1 λ n δ r 2 a t 1 λ n p a α p 2 w γ 1 p a α p 1 w γ a φ 1 λ n δ 1 1 λ n δ t φ λ n 1 λ n b φ 1 α 2 λ a 1 λ n δ t λ n 1 λ a 1 1 λ n δ t 1 λ n 1 λ b α 2 λ 1 b α 2 the term φ ϕ 1 ϕ 2 1 τ γ measures the water cost weighted relative amenity level for locating in the arid region thus when transport costs are higher from 1 amenities are weighted down in region 1 relative to region 2 there is an incentive for concentration through the wage premium where household income is higher in the region with the larger population however concentration raises local urban rents by increasing both commuting costs and the agricultural land rent the proceeding section will focus on the interplay of these competing features of the model 3 3 results given the assumption of iceberg transport costs the distribution of the population is independent of the water supply w as p 2 w can be factored out of the utility gap however the true quantity of water available in the economy must take into account any water loss from interbasin water transfers the water loss is a function of the size of the urban population and the agricultural sector in the arid region in terms of households demand is driven by the number of residents in the arid region λ n which in turn is determined by the relative amenity level between regions φ the share of expenditure on own water consumption γ and the expenditure share on the agricultural good α for the agricultural sector water demand in the arid region is driven by the availability of agricultural land 1 λ n and the relative productivity of land between regions b and of course interacting with these terms is τ which defines the extent of the water loss from regional transfers this section begins by analyzing the equilibrium population distributions λ we then consider how changes in the parameters effect the long run equilibrium in order to understand the competing roles of regional amenities and agricultural productivity in the household location decision it is useful to consider the model with no agglomeration economies i e δ 0 proposition 1 when there are no scale economies in the urban manufacturing sector there is a unique interior equilibrium when 18 a r 2 a a t n r 1 a a 1 α 2 α 2 a b t n a t n φ a t n b a b 1 α 2 α 2 a t n a t n r 2 a a r 1 a proof see appendix a the inequalities in 18 ensure that v 0 0 and v 1 0 so that an interior equilibrium exists the term on the left is the ratio of the disposable income of an isolated worker in region 2 to a worker in region 1 when the population is concentrated conversely the term on the right is ratio of disposable income for workers when they are concentrated in region 2 compared to an isolated worker in region 1 these inequalities simply guarantee that the opportunity cost of concentrating in a single region is sufficiently high so that the population is divided between regions the intuition is that if ϕ 1 is large relative to ϕ 2 households receive a greater benefit from concentrating in region 1 leaving the land in region 2 for agricultural use conversely if β 1 is sufficiently greater than β 2 all households locate in region 2 to allow for the more productive land in region 1 to be used for agricultural production therefore in order for the population to be divided between the two regions the relative amenity and productivity levels must be similar in magnitude suppose that the parameters are such that an interior equilibrium exists consider how changes in b and φ affect the equilibrium prices utility and population share in the short run an increase in b raises agricultural output reducing the agricultural price and increasing the price of water in region 2 in order for the zero profit condition to hold agricultural rents fall to accommodate the loss in revenue while the agricultural rents rise in region 1 due to the increase in productivity the overall effect is to raise net income and thus utility in region 2 relative to region 1 leading to a reduction in λ an increase in φ has no short run effects in the long run increasing amenities in region 1 raises the local utility level generating migration toward region 1 this increases the demand for urban land in region 1 which drives up r 1 a and raises p a the increase in the agricultural price raises revenue for the agricultural sector in region 2 increasing r 2 a in addition an increase in p a lowers the demand for agricultural goods and thus the water inputs needed for agricultural production reducing p i w we now introduce urban agglomeration economies it is helpful to define the following terms 19 φ 1 a 1 α 2 b 1 n δ α 2 t n a 1 n δ t n 20 φ 2 b a 1 n δ t n a b α 2 b 1 n δ t n b α 2 φ 1 mirrors 18 and represents the ratio of the opportunity cost of deviating toward region 2 relative to the disposable income of a worker when λ 1 conversely φ 2 represents the ratio of the disposable income of a worker in region 2 when λ 0 relative to the opportunity cost of deviating toward region 1 this yields the following result proposition 2 when there are external scale economies in the manufacturing sector the parameter space can be divided into four cases case 1 if 21 φ 2 φ φ 1 there is a stable interior equilibrium and no stable concentrated equilibria case 2 if 22 φ 2 φ φ 1 both concentrated equilibria are stable with an unstable interior equilibrium case 3 if 23 φ max φ 2 φ 1 λ 1 is a stable equilibrium λ 0 is unstable any interior equilibria come in pairs and alternate between stable and unstable case 4 if 24 φ min φ 2 φ 1 λ 0 is a stable equilibrium λ 1 is unstable any interior equilibria come in pairs and alternate between stable and unstable proof see appendix b fig 1 provides graphical examples of proposition 2 in φ β 1 φ δ and φ τ space respectively as well as three dimensional plots in φ β 1 τ space and φ β 1 δ space case 1 when neither the φ nor b dominates and both scale economies and transport costs are low there is a stable dispersed equilibrium this is due to two factors first when scale economies are low the wage premium generated by household concentration in a single region is not sufficient to offset the additional commuting costs from a single large city second the moderate levels of both φ and b relative to one another ensure that land in each region is devoted to both urban and agricultural use this is an interesting result as in general lower transport costs tend to generate agglomeration in neg models in this case lowering transport costs reduces the costs of locating in the arid region generating more competition for land between the agricultural and urban sectors leading to dispersion case 2 in the case φ and b are relatively close to one another and both scale economies and transport costs are high the wage premium is dominant leading to concentration in either region the competition for land between the urban and agricultural sectors and the higher urban costs from from longer commutes are not sufficiently strong to counter the wage premium generated from household concentration in a single region case 3 there is a tendency toward concentration in region 1 driven by both the wage premium and higher level of amenities in region 1 this effect is more pronounced as τ increases given that in the example households consume less water per unit of land than agricultural production making it more economical in terms of water use for workers to concentrate in the arid region case 4 in contrast to case 3 when b dominates and there are strong economies of scale all households locate in region 2 collecting the full agglomeration wage a 1 n δ leaving the more fertile land in region 1 for agricultural production this outcome becomes less likely as transport costs increase due to the excessive water loss in providing water to the agricultural sector in the arid region up to this point in the analysis the focus has been on the determinants of the equilibrium in order to shed some light on how the population distribution changes with the parameters fig 2 provides bifurcation diagrams for β 1 ϕ 1 n τ α γ t and δ in fig 2 a at low values of β 1 the high amenities in region 1 dominate leading all households to locate in that region as the land in region 1 becomes relatively more productive households migrate toward region 2 to allow the more fertile land to be employed in agricultural production until the whole of the population is concentrated in region 2 similarly in fig 2 b for relatively low levels of ϕ 1 b dominates and the population is concentrated in region 1 as ϕ 1 increases both a stable and an unstable equilibrium emerge in the interior up to a critical level after which all households are concentrated in region 1 fig 2 c provides the effect of changes in the total population n an increase in the population leads to an increase in the wage rate through the external economies pushing households toward the more populous region however the rise in income increases the demand for the agricultural good which is more easily satisfied by using the more productive region for agriculture therefore a second stable concentrated equilibrium emerges in region 2 for higher values of n in fig 2 d when τ 1 b dominates as all land is devoted to agriculture in region 1 as τ increases both b and φ decline however the effect on φ is less significant as it is dampened by the exponent γ therefore increases in transport costs reduce the benefit of agricultural production to a greater degree than urban development in the arid region as τ becomes exceedingly high the whole population locates in region 1 intuitively households consume less water than the agricultural sector therefore water loss is minimized when region 2 is solely dedicated to agriculture and households in the arid region simply import their food fig 2 e provides the simulation for α which determines household demand for the agricultural good when α is small there is less need for the more productive agricultural land in region 1 and the higher amenities dominate leading to concentration of all households in the region as α increases the population begins to divide itself between regions as the higher productivity of land in region 1 begins to dominate the amenities until the whole of the population is located in region 2 in fig 2 f when household demand for water is low so is the water loss from household consumption leading households to locate in the arid region however as household demand for water increases the population begins to shift toward region 2 in fig 2 g when commuting costs are low there exist multiple equilibria with both concentrated equilibrium stable and an unstable interior equilibrium as commuting costs increase a stable interior equilibrium emerges from λ 1 and tends to evenly divide the population between regions intuitively as commuting costs take up a larger portion of income households move to minimize those costs by distributing themselves into two smaller cities in fig 2 h when there are no scale economies i e δ 0 the population share and thus the wage are slightly higher in region 1 therefore as δ increases the wage differential between regions 1 and 2 grows leading to further increases in λ up to a stable concentrated equilibrium at 1 a second unstable arm emerges along with a stable concentrated equilibrium at λ 0 as the wage premium from household concentration becomes dominant notice that the simulations for δ and t are almost mirror images of each other reflecting the trade off of agglomeration between higher wages and higher commuting costs 4 numerical example an application to us data the above model has provided a broad view of the tension between amenity and productivity levels on regional land use patterns and household location choice this section provides a numerical example of the model that is calibrated using stylized facts from us data on household consumption and agricultural production table 3 gives the parameter values employed in the simulation in the case of the productivity premium an index of total factor productivity tfp by state in 2004 ranges from a low of 0 5712 for wyoming to a high of 1 7979 for california implying the following upper and lower bounds b 0 3177 3 1475 β 2 is set at 1 and β 1 1 1 5 2 estimates of interregional unit water transport costs show a great deal of variation between regions largely due to differences in distance and topography we then set τ to 1 2 and 1 6 to represent high and low transport costs consistent with acwa 18 hollinshead and lund 19 and dsewpc 16 this yields for low transport costs b 83 1 87 3 33 and for high transport costs b 63 1 41 2 5 consistent with estimates of per capita water use of 1 acre ft per person in california 46 we set w 1 and n 1 so that regional population is described in share form the model is considered both with and without scale economies in production the value of δ is set at 0 21 which reflects a 7 increase in average productivity with a doubling of employment density consistent with empirical estimates when n 1 t reflects not only the commuting cost per unit of distance but also the cost of commuting from the boundary of the region therefore a worker commuting from the boundary spends roughly 20 of gross income on commuting 37 finally the value of φ 1 1 represents an empirically modest though as we will see not insignificant amenity premium for region 1 table 4 provides the results of the simulation when transport costs are low conceptually this is consistent with a situation where the water transport technology is better able to reduce water loss and thus more effectively take advantage of regional variations in productivity the first set of columns represent the case where agricultural productivity is equivalent in each region but given the transport costs for water region 2 is effectively more productive in agricultural while region 1 provides greater amenities in the case when there are no scale economies 72 of the population reside in region 1 and roughly 65 of region 1 s agricultural demand is imported when scale economies are introduced all households locate in region 1 and all food is imported additionally scale economies uniformly raise prices and utility due to higher household income the concentration of the population implies that only region 2 produces the agricultural good therefore agricultural water use increases in region 2 and urban water use increases in region 1 in this case household concentration shifts agricultural production to the more productive region generating higher total agricultural output and a lower level of water loss notice that average urban land rent which is calculated by integrating the rent function over the city and dividing by the local population is increasing in region 1 and decreasing in region 2 when productivity is held fixed and scale economies are introduced the second set of columns in table 4 represents the case where the agricultural sector in region 1 is moderately more productive given the higher productivity of land in region 1 when there are no scale economies the population is more evenly divided with a 63 share in region 1 however only 13 of region 1 s agricultural demand is imported when scale economies exist again region 1 is solely used for housing and there is a similar effect on prices and utility from an increase in δ however note that there is an increase in the land rent in region 1 and decrease in region 2 in relation to the case where region 2 was more productive note that water loss falls by nearly 50 as all agricultural land in region 1 is taken out of production when households concentrate however there is also a 13 decline in total agricultural output the third set of columns denotes the case where region 1 is significantly more productive than region 2 in this case while scale economies do continue to push more workers toward region 1 28 of the land remains available for agricultural production when there are no scale economies region 1 is a net exporter of agricultural goods however when δ is increased the loss of available land for agriculture makes it so that the region becomes again a net importer while there is a reduction in water loss it is much smaller than in the previous case roughly 10 compared to nearly 50 this occurs due to the fact the region 1 continues to produce the agricultural good given that land used for housing utilizes less water than if used for farming the fact that workers don t fully concentrate in region 1 as before means a significant amount of water continues to be lost through transfers to region 1 for agricultural production however the fact that region 1 continues to produce output reduces the loss to total agricultural output it is worth noting that total urban water use taking into account water loss stays roughly constant over each example finally average urban land rents appear to rise at a slower rate in region 1 and fall at a slower rate in region 2 when scale economies are introduced as productivity increases in region 1 in addition the share of income devoted to housing on average in region 1 goes from roughly 10 when there are no scale economies and β 1 1 to nearly 17 when β 1 2 with scale economies while in region 2 with the same parameter changes the income share falls from 7 5 to 5 5 table 5 gives numerical results for the model when transport costs are high in contrast to the results in table 4 this example highlights a situation where the water transport technology is less effective in this case greater productivity in the arid region is ultimately diminished by the large water loss associated with the water transfer qualitatively the results are largely the same however when both regions have the same productivity so that region 2 is effectively more productive once scale economies are introduced land rents fall this is due to the fact that the scale economies push households toward region 1 generating less competition for land in the more productive region as would be expected water loss is higher and agricultural output is lower than in the case with lower transport costs while urban water use remains largely unchanged when there are no scale economies total agricultural water use is lower with high transport costs compared to low transport costs however the quantity of water used by the agricultural sector in region 2 is higher as the region generates a greater share of the agricultural output interestingly the population shares with no scale economies are largely the same in the case of both high and low transport costs however when β 1 2 when scale economies are introduced there is stronger shift by households toward region 1 when there are high transport costs with a 36 increase in the population compared to 26 when there are low transport costs the larger transition of agricultural land to urban use in region 1 generates a greater decline in agricultural output relative to the case of low transport costs 4 1 a discussion of the numerical results in light of us migration patterns can the results in tables 4 and 5 be used to describe migratory patterns in the us of course a linear two region model cannot fully account for the migration patterns across households in fifty states we nevertheless feel that it is capable of qualitatively reproducing many features in the data consider a relatively small region such as southern california where the productivity of the land is relatively homogenous over the region while the area closer to the coast has more amenable weather compared to the much warmer regions further inland in the early 1900s the land in southern california was largely devoted to agriculture presently the region is completely urbanized from ventura county to the mexican border and well inland through los angeles county riverside county orange county and san diego county the eastern portion of southern california that buttresses arizona and nevada remains largely agricultural containing two of the most productive regions in the country the imperial valley and coachella valley this result would be consistent with the first set of columns in tables 4 and 5 where the agricultural productivity in region 1 is low and the amenities dominate similarly we can compare florida which ranked 2nd in us agricultural tfp in 2004 and grew from the 33rd most populous state to the 4th between the years 1900 and 2000 38 to iowa which ranked 3rd in tfp and fell in population rank from 10th to 30th between 1900 and 2000 this is consistent with a specification where b is relatively low as both regions have similar productive capabilities while φ would favor florida with its warmer climates and coastal amenities finally consider california in relation to texas both offer warm weather and face water supply concerns yet california ranked 1st in agricultural tfp in 2004 while texas was ranked 43rd in 1960 california farm output was 50 greater than that of texas and by 2004 it was 100 larger while over the same time period both houston and the dallas fort worth areas entered into the top 10 of the most populous us cities this is consistent with a more dominant agricultural sector in california both california and texas have significant urban sectors while the agricultural sector is larger and growing at a faster pace in california 5 conclusion and future research this paper has developed a two region economic geography model to explore the interplay of agricultural productivity and amenities in arid regions when water is a mobile factor and there are economies of scale in the urban manufacturing sector when scale economies are sufficiently low it was shown that amenities and agricultural productivity drive land use patterns in opposite directions amenities encourage the development of land for urban use while greater productivity supports land use for agricultural production for moderate levels of both amenities and productivity there is a stable and dispersed equilibrium if economies of scale in the manufacturing sector are high and neither the productivity or amenity levels dominate the other the wage premium generated from all households concentrating in a single region overwhelms the benefits of a more even distribution of the population when either the amenities or agricultural productivity dominates the other and there is a high degree of scale economies only one of the concentrated equilibria is stable the parameter space was explored in order to define the conditions for stable and unstable equilibrium configurations and bifurcation diagrams were shown numerically for key parameters finally the model was calibrated to reflect us data on household consumption and agricultural production patterns while this paper has developed a coherent framework to explore how competing urban and agricultural interests vie for water and land in the interests of tractability a number of realistic features have been excluded iceberg transport costs provide a convenient way to conceptually model freight costs however they focus solely on the marginal cost of distribution associated with the loss of water for carriage water the iceberg specification is appropriate however to consider evaporation and leakage a distance based measure would be more appropriate additionally it would be important to consider additional marginal costs for instance the energy costs associated with pumping water zhou and tol 39 find that water is relatively inexpensive to transport horizontally but becomes exceedingly costly to transport vertically in practice water distribution networks both intra and interregionally have significant fixed costs particularly in the development of the network linking communities to an outside water source such networks require financing from local state and federal governments the economies of scale and public financing of interregional water transfers should be further explored in order to gain a more robust understanding of the effect of water transfers on migration and land use our model assumed that the agricultural good is produced using solely water and land with no labor inputs used for a country like the united states where less than 1 of the population is employed in agricultural production this assumption is less onerous however in countries where agricultural employment is high it would be useful to consider how variations in productivity effect agricultural employment across regions additionally it would be interesting to consider a situation in which agricultural workers face not only a choice between regions but between remaining in the agricultural sector or switching to urban employment furthermore our specification of the technology for the agricultural sector as simply a cobb douglas aggregation of water and land implies unitary elasticity of substitution which is higher than empirical estimates which range from 0 to 0 5 40 41 therefore if the model were to be extended for policy analysis more sophisticated functional forms would need to be employed additionally while our model is able to qualitatively capture some long run macro trends in the location of agricultural production the model ignores the possible use of different production technologies which allow for adaptation to different climates and geography moreover our model does not deal explicitly with varieties of agricultural goods which could allow for regional specialization in distinct varieties of output due to the assumption of iceberg transport costs the available supply of water plays no role in the long run distribution of households it would be useful to introduce a more intricate specification in which the availability of water played an explicit role in the household and agricultural producers location decision in addition an important issue is the reliability of water supply in particular for agriculture for example while households can be relatively flexible in their water use by reducing irrigation taking shorter showers almond farmers can not in the short run as easily adapt without losing a significant share of their crop therefore introducing a dynamic stochastic water supply that takes into account the likelihood of wet average or dry years would help to better understand agricultural producers planting decisions this model has provided a competitive framework where water is allocated to its best use through the price system however water transfers are often dominated by a byzantine set of rules where water prices vary not only by city or region but by consumers within cities and rural areas as well a portion of agricultural land in certain regions may be allocated water rights that are not available to the remaining shares of land therefore an understanding of the institutional factors that define water use patterns often over and above the market structure are crucial in gauging the future development of arid regions and the ability to sustain future growth in population and agricultural production finally high amenity cities tend to have higher rents households respond to these higher prices by reducing the quantity of living space they consume presumably offsetting the loss through the additional benefits they receive from the local amenities relaxing the assumption of inelastic demand for land by households can provide a more realistic portrait of land distribution in a region with both high productivity and amenities in particular it would allow for the possibility of a large share of the population residing in a single region on a relatively small share of the land acknowledgements i would like to thank richard

8727,due to the structural similarities sunflower seed husk ssh an agricultural low cost and eco friendly waste is employed interchangeably with zeolite to extract ni ii ions from model and real industrial wastewater in this work batch experiment adsorption was carried out to investigate the possibility of ni ii ion removal by adsorbents zeolite powder and ssh were used in three different sizes and without any modifications to optimize the effect of adsorbent size the maximum adsorption rate of 76 for the bulk size of ssh was obtained at ph 6 5 20 g l of adsoadsorbent an initial concentration of ions of 20 mg l and 2 h of contact time thermodynamic results showed that the process is spontaneous feasible and exothermic within the set temperature range 10 c 80 c it can be concluded from the results that ssh can be used as a feasible eco friendly and biodegradable organic material for ni ion adsorption keywords biosorbent nickel sunflower seed husk wastewater zeolite data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction apart from being the most necessity of all living creatures in nature water is regarded as the most essential source of life water contamination and inadequacy are putting a major strain on the environment and its restricted supply is worsening as natural water sources are depleted consequently economic growth human sustenance and environmental development are all hampered 1 roughly 40 of the population faces water scarcity difficulties as a result of climatic change increased urbanization natural resource consumption and dietary requirements 2 freshwater utilization for industrial and agricultural needs is increasing resulting in a rise in water demand this issue can be addressed by using recovered wastewater which is a relatively new source of water 3 5 furthermore due to fast industrialization and manufacturing expansion a steady increase in industrial pollution and metal content has occurred in rivers and agricultural regions owing to the inappropriate dumping and disposal of industrialized waste products 6 heavy metals the primary component of the earth s crust are long lasting environmental pollutants that can merely be transferred into nontoxic forms without considering to biodegrade them purely 7 heavy metal pollution in aquatic systems is a worldwide concern because it is a threat to lives of living beings heavy metals like chromium cadmium ni ii lead zinc and copper are common metals present in industrial effluents that can be toxic and chronic even in low concentrations 8 ni ii is one of the heavy metals that is used in silver refineries electroplating and the battery industry which can cause health problems like disruption of the lungs extreme weakness and shortness of breath in high concentrations it can cause different cancers and even death dermatitis ni itch is the most common side effect of exposure to ni ii in some cases the signs of poisoning by ni were reported as severe headaches dizziness nausea and vomiting 9 heavy metals can be removed from aqueous solutions using a variety of techniques ion exchange electrodialysis precipitation flocculation membrane separation and sorption are common methods for heavy metal uptake from wastewaters 10 however each of the methods mentioned above has its own pros and cons 11 chemical precipitation is commonly employed in turkey 12 and thailand 13 to remediate electroplating effluent in china 14 and thailand 13 coagulation flocculation has been used to remove heavy metals from inorganic wastewater the extraction of non surface active metal ions from industrial wastewaters utilizing sorptive flotation has piqued interest in the us 15 and greece 16 ion exchange has gained attraction in spain 17 and italy 18 as one of the key technologies for treating heavy metal laden wastewaters lately adsorption has gained the attraction of many scientists as one of the alternative treatment strategies for removing heavy metals from wastewater 19 adsorption in its most basic form is a mass transfer procedure in which a material is transferred from the liquid phase to the solid s surface and gets bonded by physical chemical interactions 20 simple process and design sludge free environment and being cost effective are the superiorities of adsorption technique against the other methods 21 recently studies have been conducted to create novel adsorbents or improve existing adsorbents to find proper alternatives to common natural adsorbents like zeolite 22 since the earliest initiatives to purify water in the late nineteenth century zeolites as potential materials have been particularly appealing due to their low price and high efficiency for heavy metals 23 natural zeolites are extensively employed in adsorption construction catalysis soil remediation agriculture and energy with global use of natural zeolites reaching 5 5 mt in 2010 24 in accordance to previous studies numerous agricultural residues have been used to remove heavy metals e g coconut husk mango husk corncob and cornstalk tomato waste and green walnut shell 25 30 sunflower seed helianthus annuus is a kind of oil seed used in oil production industries and bakery crafts 31 these applications produce a large amount of ssh that have low density and thus need a large space to store therefore the goal of this research is to develop a cost effective adsorbent as well as test the effectiveness of modified ssh in removing ni ii from synthetic and industrial wastewater hence on a small scale of effluent or low metal ion contaminated industrial wastewater a novel affordable modified adsorbent made from agricultural waste might be used and practicable for metal ion removal aluminum silicate minerals like zeolite are used as commercial absorbers and catalysts the ability of selective ion exchange and its microporous structure make them efficient adsorbents for wastewater treatment 32 33 the mesoporous structure of zeolite is the same as that of ssh hence we used these two adsorbents to study the potential of ssh absorbability in comparison to zeolite 2 materials and methods 2 1 adsorbents the sunflower seeds were bought from a local market in shiraz iran and then dehulled to remove dust and other contaminants they were washed several times with distilled water then they were dried in an oven at 80 c for 24 h 34 to optimize the size three different sizes of ssh were utilized as adsorbents bulk crushed and milled powder see fig 1 the zeolite powders were supplied by afrand tooska company tehran iran 2 2 batch studies experiments were conducted in a 100 ml beaker containing a ni ii ion solution with a specified concentration the ni ion solutions were made from a stock solution of ni ii nitrate the solutions were stirred on a magnetic stirrer to make sure equilibrium was reached as a control sample sampling was performed from a solution containing ni ions before adding the adsorbent at predetermined periods after adding the adsorbent i e 10 15 20 30 45 60 80 100 and 120 min the concentration of ni ii ions remaining in the solution was measured 2 3 experimental apparatuses atomic adsorption spectroscopy aas was used to measure the ni ion concentration in the solution the spectrometer that was used in this study was the shimadzu a a 680 the wavelength was 232 nm and the slit width was 0 5 nm a fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer the avatar model made by thermo company was used to determine the functional groups of ssh before and after adsorption to study the morphology of adsorbents a cambridge s360 scanning electron microscope sem was used the size of powder particles was determined by a dynamic light scattering dls analyzer model sz 100 horiba japan to separate particles suspended in the solution were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min by a centrifuge machine model pc 15000 m the ph values of the solutions were measured by a metrohm ph meter 2 4 ion adsorption measurements a batch mode was used in all adsorption experiments on a magnetic stirrer with a rate of 90 rpm the adsorption phenomenon was studied by adding adsorbents to 100 ml of ni ii ion solution with the required initial concentrations at room temperature the percentage of adsorbed ions from solution was calculated using equation 1 35 1 o f m e t a l i o n r e m o v e d c 0 c e 100 c 0 the following equation was used to determine the adsorbent adsorption capacity 11 36 2 q c 0 c e v m where c 0 and c e are the concentrations of ni ii ions in the solution at the initial and equilibrium state respectively v is the adsorbent mass and m stands for the adsorbent mass 2 5 adsorption isotherm the goal of the adsorption isotherm is to fit experimental data to the common isotherm models such as langmuir and freundlich which represent the relationship between the adsorbed ion per unit of adsorbent and the concentration of an ion in the liquid phase at equilibrium time and are crucial in optimizing adsorbent usage equation 3 37 gives the expression for the applied non linear langmuir model 3 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e where c e is the equilibrium ion concentration remained in the solution mg l k l is the langmuir adsorption constant related to the capacity of adsorbent and adsorption energy and q m stands for the maximum adsorption capacity mg g the favorability of the adsorption process rl was obtained from the parameters of langmuir isotherm model it can be calculate from equation 4 38 4 r l 1 1 k l c 0 the value of r l specifies the state of the adsorption process with r l 1 indicating an unfavorable adsorption process r l between 0 and 1 indicating a favorable adsorption process r l 1 showing linear adsorption and r l 0 representing irreversible circumstances equation 5 39 also gives the freundlich isotherm model 5 q e k f c e 1 n the n value in this equation indicates that the adsorption process is favorable and k f represents the adsorbate s adsorption capacity and intensity 2 6 adsorption kinetics the time dependent experimental adsorption data are used for kinetic modeling 40 to estimate the removal kinetics of ni ii ion from an aqueous solution pseudo first order and pseudo second order models were used the pseudo first order model is given by equation 6 6 log q e q q e k 1 2 303 t where k1 is the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 qe is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium state mg g and qt denotes the amount of metal adsorbed at specific times mg g pseudo second order model was fitted according to equation 7 7 t q 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e the values of q e k 1 and k 2 were determined from the slopes and intercepts of the plot of t q against t 41 and k 2 is the pseudo second order constant rate min 1 2 7 thermodynamic studies the effect of temperature on the sorption of ni ii ion onto the adsorbent was carried out at different temperatures also thermodynamic parameters including gibbs free energy δg j mol enthalpy δh j mol and entropy δs j mol were calculated using the following equation 8 δ g δ g r t l n k l where kl is the langmuir constant r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j molk the values of δh and δs are defined using the vant hoff plot from equation 9 9 ln k l δ h r t δ s r δh and δs values were determined from the slope and intercept respectively based on the plot of ln k l against 1 t 42 43 2 8 pre equilibrium ph measurements to determine the pre equilibrium ph of ssh 1 g of biosorbent was added to 100 ml of distilled water the samples were agitated for 48 h and the ph of the solution was measured using a ph meter 2 9 point of zero charge a 50 ml solution of 1 m kno3 was prepared in multiple containers to determine the point of zero charges of the adsorbent by adding 0 1 m of hcl or 0 1 m of naoh solution to the kno3 solution the ph was changed from 2 to 12 after recording the initial ph of the solution phi 1 g of adsorbent was added to the solution and agitated at room temperature for 48 h on a stirrer the adsorbent solutions were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min and the ultimate ph of the solution phf was measured the intercept of the ph phi phf versus phi plot was used to determine the point of no charge 36 44 45 3 results and discussions 3 1 morphology studies fig 2 depicts the external and internal surfaces of bulk ssh at various magnifications determined from dls measurements the morphology of bulk external surface is smooth and nonporous but the interface of bulk size is rough and few small cavities are visible the inner surface was examined with higher magnification and it was shown in fig 3 as illustrated in fig 3 the mean size of pores is about 50 μm many pores were found in the cross section of ssh indicating that the adsorbent had a porous structure the smallest pore measured roughly 0 86 m in diameter the microstructure image processing software mip was employed and the porosity of the ssh bulk was estimated as 70 a dls analysis was also performed on ssh powder particles to determine the size distribution of the powders the powdered ssh particles have an average size of roughly 9 nm 3 2 ftir spectroscopy before and after the adsorption process the functional group composition of the ssh was analyzed using fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometry the ftir spectra of the adsorbent were recorded using an infrared spectrophotometer ft ir 5300 in the 400 4000 cm 1 range jasco corp tokyo japan before adsorption the bands at 3424 61 and 2922 26 cm 1 correspond to the alcohol group s o h stretching and the alkane s c h stretching respectively the values of these peaks remained unchanged after adsorption but the intensity of the peaks changed the peaks at 1729 5 1030 2 and 1244 9 cm 1 as shown in fig 4 correspond to the co stretching α β unsaturated ester so stretching sulfoxide and c n stretching amine respectively following adsorption these bands changed to 1733 74 cm 1 1028 96 cm 1 and 1242 85 cm 1 indicating a significant decrease in the intensity of these peaks after adsorption the peak at 827 53 cm 1 which belonged to the minerals slipped away 3 3 effects of adsorbent type on the ni ion adsorption efficiency to find out the capacity of adsorbents ssh and zeolite for ni ii removal from solution in the first step 3 ml solution containing ni ii ion ph 6 5 c0 20 mg l t 24c were taken to specify the total dissolved solution tds value of water after adding the adsorbent to the solution and calculate the percentage of ni ii ion removal by different adsorbents the tds value for distilled water was determined as 12 38 ppm and for the solutions containing different sizes of ssh i e powdered crushed and bulk and zeolite were measured as 111 10 137 50 71 12 and 118 25 ppm respectively ssh removed approximately 76 of ni ii ions in bulk and crushed forms powdered ssh and zeolite on the other hand could remove approximately 62 and 92 of the ni ii ions from the solution respectively the tds value is one of the factors used to assess water purification and quality 46 the diagram shows that the amount of tds in the crushed and powdered sizes of ssh as well as the zeolite powder was very high some other studies have generally claimed that powder samples have better sorption capacities when used to remove some kinds of ions from aqueous solutions due to their larger surface areas 47 however in the present study bulk samples were found to be better absorbents than powder samples in ni ii ion removal from aqueous solutions with no significant tds increase as a result bulk size ssh was used as an adsorbent in our experiments the percentage of ni ii ion removal by ssh and zeolite differed by almost 16 so the ability of ssh to absorb ni ii ions is comparable to that of an adsorbent such as zeolite 3 4 effect of contact time the rate of ion removal is one of the most important factors to predicting the required time for water treatment thus to estimate the needed time for ni ii ion removal by ssh and zeolite 2 g of ssh in three different forms and zeolite powder were added to 100 ml solution with the initial concentration of ni ii ion 20 mg l in separate containers initial ph 6 5 t 25c the rate of ni ii ion adsorption in the presence of zeolite and ssh with different sizes is shown in fig 5 the rapid ion removal rate by adsorbents in the first 15 min is seen in contact time plots and the required time to attain equilibrium was roughly 120 min and the rate of adsorption remained constant after equilibrium during the sorption process the sorbent surface has numerous binding sites therefore there is no competition amongst ions for sites at first but as time passes available sites are filled by other ions and there are insufficient sites for ion adsorption the repulsive forces between the adsorbed ions on the sorbent surface and the remaining ions in the solution on the other hand make the adsorption process more difficult than it was in the beginning as a result after attaining equilibrium the rate of adsorption decreased with time 3 5 effect of ph on the sorption process metal ion adsorption depends strongly on ph values ironically the ph of the system regulates the adsorption capacity by influencing the surface characteristics of the adsorbent and the ionic forms of ni ii in the solution 48 49 to investigate the effect of ph on ni ii ion removal by ssh four different ph values in the range of 1 5 9 4 were examined the batch studies were carried out under the aforementioned conditions adsorbent dosage 2 g ni ii ion concentration 20 mg l and t 25 c the results are presented in fig 6 before and after adding the adsorbent as the results show the maximum adsorption occurred at ph 3 5 and decreased gradually by increasing the ph to 9 4 this reduction was due to the precipitation of ni ii ions because of the formation of ni ii hydroxide complexes 50 to substantiate this conclusion the initial concentration of the batch was set to 20 mg l and then the ph range was changed from 1 5 to 9 4 without sorbent then at specified ph values the amounts of ni ii ions remained in the solution were determined after increasing ph to 9 5 the amount of initial ni ii concentration reduced indicating that complexation and precipitation occur at higher ph values the amount of adsorption was negligible at ph 1 5 this can be described in terms of pzc which is the electrical potential at an adsorbent s surface and was determined to be 1 8 in our case as shown in fig 7 the surface of the adsorbent is negatively charged at any ph higher than 1 8 hence the ratio of ni ii ions adsorption increases dramatically when the ph is changed from 3 5 to 6 5 conversely the ions should compete with h ions for active site adhesion below the pzc due to repulsive forces on the sorbent surface as a result at low ph values the adsorption percentage is negligible 51 for additional testing the optimum ph for ni ii ion removal by ssh was determined to be 6 5 argun observed that the highest rate of adsorption of ni ii ion by zeolite occurred at ph 7 52 for low and high values of ph the process of adsorption was the same as for ssh 3 6 effect of temperature on the sorption process 2 g of adsorbent were introduced to 100 ml of solution with an initial concentration of 20 mg l at ph 6 5 to investigate the influence of temperature on ni ii ion sorption by ssh the sorption effectiveness of ni ii ions increased by 67 5 when the temperature was reduced from 80 to 10 c with increasing temperature from 10 to 80 c the adsorbent capacity reduced from 0 877 to 0 183 mg g the increased adsorption of ni ii ions by ssh can be attributed to the lower energy of ni ii cations resulting in more interaction between metal ions and active sites on the adsorbent surface 53 the effect of temperature on the adsorption of ni ii ions is shown in fig 8 similarly hannachi et al investigated zeolite and their findings revealed that the sorption of ni ii ions by zeolite increased with increasing temperature 54 3 7 effect of adsorbent dosage and initial ni ii ion concentration on the sorption process fig 9 a and b shows the capacity and efficiency of ni ii ion adsorption by ssh as functions of the adsorbent respectively the effect of adsorbent dosage on the uptake of ni ii ion at ph 6 5 20 mg l initial ion concentration and at ambient temperature was examined the amount of sorbent varied between 1 and 4 g in a 100 ml solution as can be deduced from fig 9 b the increase in adsorbent dosage from 10 to 40 g l causes an increase in the adsorption of ni ii ions from 67 to 88 this substantial increase is because of the increased surface area of the adsorbent and more accessible active sites for the adsorption of ni ii ions to compare the dose of the adsorbent parameter by zeolite cocaoba et al conducted a similar study they reported the same trend for ni ii ion sorption by zeolite they showed that the efficiency of ni ii ion sorption by zeolite increased to 81 6 by increasing the amount of sorbent from 0 2 to 2 g 55 the ni ii ion adsorption capacity and efficiency of ssh in ni ii removal from the solution are respectively presented against time in fig 9 c and d the initial concentration was changed from 10 to 35 mg l as shown in fig 9c by increasing the initial ni ii ion concentration from 10 to 35 mg l the residual ni ii ion concentration of the solution increased hence the efficiency of ni ii ion sorption decreased however the capacity of the adsorbent increased from 0 36 to 1 31 mg g by increasing the initial concentration of ni ii ions this can be due to increasing the driving force of ni ii ions in high concentration solutions 30 the ni ii ion uptake increased rapidly with time up to 35 min and then increased slowly according to the results the adsorption equilibrium time was 120 min cocaoba et al studied the effect of ni ii initial concentration on zeolite as a biosorbent in their study the initial concentration changed from 1 to 100 mg l the results showed that ni ii ion sorption rate was rapid for the first 10 min and thereafter it increased slowly to reach an equilibrium time of 80 min 55 3 8 adsorption isotherm the adsorption isotherm s purpose is to fit adsorption experimental data using prevalent isotherm models that represent the relationship between the adsorbed ion per unit of adsorbent and the concentration of an ion in the liquid phase at equilibrium time as demonstrated in fig 10 the amount of ni ii absorbed by the adsorbent increased sharply after the equilibrium starting concentration was increased and subsequently the trend went toward a plateau it could be owing to the energy of ion adsorption at varying concentrations in low concentrations of ni ii ion adsorption on active sites requires more energy to bind these sites while in high concentrations the opposite is true 56 langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were utilized to determine the interaction between ssh and ni ii ions the results are depicted in fig 11 within the ssh the langmuir isotherm model predicts monolayer adsorption of ni ions on a homogeneous surface adsorption of adsorbate on an adsorbent occurs on a heterogeneous surface by multilayer sorption in the freundlich model and the adsorption capacity can be improved by increasing the adsorbent dosage eq 5 gives a non linear freundlich isotherm model the n value in this equation denotes the favorability of the adsorption process while k f represents the adsorption capacity and intensity of the adsorbate the experimental isotherm data were fitted to the langmuir and freundlich models to distinguish between heterogeneous and homogeneous adsorption of the ni ii ion on ssh the parameters of these models are tabulated in table 1 the langmuir model could better predict the sorption process of ni ii ions on ssh the n values in equation 5 were found to be more than 1 despite the fact that the adsorption process did not match the freundlich model properly it indicates that ni ii ion sorption on ssh was favorable 57 58 from table 1 the equilibrium adsorption capacity of ssh was found to be 5 29 mg g under the optimized situations it may be concluded that the ssh can be applied to remove ni ii ions from aqueous solution hence the isotherm of ni ii sorption on zeolite was investigated and the results showed that sorption of ni ii on ssh by zeolite was fitted to the langmuir model and the sorption was also monolayer 59 60 3 9 thermodynamic parameters the effect of temperature on ni ii ion sorption onto ssh was investigated at five different temperatures 283 298 313 and 353 k based on the change in ion adsorption capacity when the temperature was varied equation 9 was used to calculate thermodynamic characteristics such as gibbs free energy g kj mol and standard gibbs free energy g kj mol enthalpy h kj mol and entropy s kj molk as tabulated in table 2 the values of h and s were calculated using the vant hoff plot see fig 12 61 63 the spontaneous nature of ni ii ion sorption on ssh is indicated by the negative values of g at all temperatures with increasing temperature the negative values indicate stronger adsorptive forces between ni ii ions and ssh the sorption process had an enthalpy value of 42 07 kj mol indicating that ni ii ion adsorption on ssh is exothermic negative s values indicate that the randomness of the solid solution interface is decreasing 64 argun et al investigated the effects of temperature and thermodynamic behavior on ni ion adsorption by zeolite they discovered that the adsorption process was spontaneous and that both the enthalpy and the entropy were negative 52 3 10 comparison the performance of ni ii ion sorption from an industrial effluent by ssh and a selected zeolite to study the industrial application of adsorbates effluents from two different companies pooshesh loab and rangin poosheh shiraz iran were collected ni ii ion concentrations in pooshesh loab and rangin pooshesh were 115 5 and 59 83 respectively due to the high concentration of ni ii in the effluents 5 g of adsorbent was used in each experiment and the results are shown in fig 13 the results show that the percentage of ni ii ion sorption by ssh in solutions with higher concentrations of ni ii ions was greater than their adsorption by zeolite the reason for this is the selective properties of zeolite since industrial effluents contain other heavy metal ions apart from ni ions the active sites on the surface of zeolite were saturated and the ni ii ion sorption was less probable 32 therefore it can be deduced that ni ii ion removal from industrial effluents is more efficient by ssh than zeolite 4 conclusions in this study ssh was used to adsorb ni ion at different contact times in three different sizes bulk 20 mm crushed 7 mm and milled powder 10 nm sem was used to examine the surface and morphology of different shapes and dls was used to determine particle sizes the concentration of ni ii ions was also measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy aas before and after the adsorption process ftir tests were used to determine the active groups on the adsorbent s surface before and after ni ii adsorption the sem micrographs show the bulk ssh surface s rough tubular and porous structure which is suitable for use as an absorbent the maximum absorbing rate for bulk ssh was 76 while zeolite absorption was 86 the effects of ph adsorbent dose initial ni ii ion concentration temperature and contact time were investigated the optimum adsorption of ni ii ions was observed at ph 6 5 20 g l adsorbents an initial ion concentration of 20 mg l and a contact time of 2 h in addition the langmuir isotherm model fit the experimental metal absorption values well the thermodynamic parameters analysis revealed that the process was

8727,due to the structural similarities sunflower seed husk ssh an agricultural low cost and eco friendly waste is employed interchangeably with zeolite to extract ni ii ions from model and real industrial wastewater in this work batch experiment adsorption was carried out to investigate the possibility of ni ii ion removal by adsorbents zeolite powder and ssh were used in three different

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction apart from being the most necessity of all living creatures in nature water is regarded as the most essential source of life water contamination and inadequacy are putting a major strain on the environment and its restricted supply is worsening as natural water sources are depleted consequently economic growth human sustenance and environmental development are all hampered 1 roughly 40 of the population faces water scarcity difficulties as a result of climatic change increased urbanization natural resource consumption and dietary requirements 2 freshwater utilization for industrial and agricultural needs is increasing resulting in a rise in water demand this issue can be addressed by using recovered wastewater which is a relatively new source of water 3 5 furthermore due to fast industrialization and manufacturing expansion a steady increase in industrial pollution and metal content has occurred in rivers and agricultural regions owing to the inappropriate dumping and disposal of industrialized waste products 6 heavy metals the primary component of the earth s crust are long lasting environmental pollutants that can merely be transferred into nontoxic forms without considering to biodegrade them purely 7 heavy metal pollution in aquatic systems is a worldwide concern because it is a threat to lives of living beings heavy metals like chromium cadmium ni ii lead zinc and copper are common metals present in industrial effluents that can be toxic and chronic even in low concentrations 8 ni ii is one of the heavy metals that is used in silver refineries electroplating and the battery industry which can cause health problems like disruption of the lungs extreme weakness and shortness of breath in high concentrations it can cause different cancers and even death dermatitis ni itch is the most common side effect of exposure to ni ii in some cases the signs of poisoning by ni were reported as severe headaches dizziness nausea and vomiting 9 heavy metals can be removed from aqueous solutions using a variety of techniques ion exchange electrodialysis precipitation flocculation membrane separation and sorption are common methods for heavy metal uptake from wastewaters 10 however each of the methods mentioned above has its own pros and cons 11 chemical precipitation is commonly employed in turkey 12 and thailand 13 to remediate electroplating effluent in china 14 and thailand 13 coagulation flocculation has been used to remove heavy metals from inorganic wastewater the extraction of non surface active metal ions from industrial wastewaters utilizing sorptive flotation has piqued interest in the us 15 and greece 16 ion exchange has gained attraction in spain 17 and italy 18 as one of the key technologies for treating heavy metal laden wastewaters lately adsorption has gained the attraction of many scientists as one of the alternative treatment strategies for removing heavy metals from wastewater 19 adsorption in its most basic form is a mass transfer procedure in which a material is transferred from the liquid phase to the solid s surface and gets bonded by physical chemical interactions 20 simple process and design sludge free environment and being cost effective are the superiorities of adsorption technique against the other methods 21 recently studies have been conducted to create novel adsorbents or improve existing adsorbents to find proper alternatives to common natural adsorbents like zeolite 22 since the earliest initiatives to purify water in the late nineteenth century zeolites as potential materials have been particularly appealing due to their low price and high efficiency for heavy metals 23 natural zeolites are extensively employed in adsorption construction catalysis soil remediation agriculture and energy with global use of natural zeolites reaching 5 5 mt in 2010 24 in accordance to previous studies numerous agricultural residues have been used to remove heavy metals e g coconut husk mango husk corncob and cornstalk tomato waste and green walnut shell 25 30 sunflower seed helianthus annuus is a kind of oil seed used in oil production industries and bakery crafts 31 these applications produce a large amount of ssh that have low density and thus need a large space to store therefore the goal of this research is to develop a cost effective adsorbent as well as test the effectiveness of modified ssh in removing ni ii from synthetic and industrial wastewater hence on a small scale of effluent or low metal ion contaminated industrial wastewater a novel affordable modified adsorbent made from agricultural waste might be used and practicable for metal ion removal aluminum silicate minerals like zeolite are used as commercial absorbers and catalysts the ability of selective ion exchange and its microporous structure make them efficient adsorbents for wastewater treatment 32 33 the mesoporous structure of zeolite is the same as that of ssh hence we used these two adsorbents to study the potential of ssh absorbability in comparison to zeolite 2 materials and methods 2 1 adsorbents the sunflower seeds were bought from a local market in shiraz iran and then dehulled to remove dust and other contaminants they were washed several times with distilled water then they were dried in an oven at 80 c for 24 h 34 to optimize the size three different sizes of ssh were utilized as adsorbents bulk crushed and milled powder see fig 1 the zeolite powders were supplied by afrand tooska company tehran iran 2 2 batch studies experiments were conducted in a 100 ml beaker containing a ni ii ion solution with a specified concentration the ni ion solutions were made from a stock solution of ni ii nitrate the solutions were stirred on a magnetic stirrer to make sure equilibrium was reached as a control sample sampling was performed from a solution containing ni ions before adding the adsorbent at predetermined periods after adding the adsorbent i e 10 15 20 30 45 60 80 100 and 120 min the concentration of ni ii ions remaining in the solution was measured 2 3 experimental apparatuses atomic adsorption spectroscopy aas was used to measure the ni ion concentration in the solution the spectrometer that was used in this study was the shimadzu a a 680 the wavelength was 232 nm and the slit width was 0 5 nm a fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer the avatar model made by thermo company was used to determine the functional groups of ssh before and after adsorption to study the morphology of adsorbents a cambridge s360 scanning electron microscope sem was used the size of powder particles was determined by a dynamic light scattering dls analyzer model sz 100 horiba japan to separate particles suspended in the solution were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min by a centrifuge machine model pc 15000 m the ph values of the solutions were measured by a metrohm ph meter 2 4 ion adsorption measurements a batch mode was used in all adsorption experiments on a magnetic stirrer with a rate of 90 rpm the adsorption phenomenon was studied by adding adsorbents to 100 ml of ni ii ion solution with the required initial concentrations at room temperature the percentage of adsorbed ions from solution was calculated using equation 1 35 1 o f m e t a l i o n r e m o v e d c 0 c e 100 c 0 the following equation was used to determine the adsorbent adsorption capacity 11 36 2 q c 0 c e v m where c 0 and c e are the concentrations of ni ii ions in the solution at the initial and equilibrium state respectively v is the adsorbent mass and m stands for the adsorbent mass 2 5 adsorption isotherm the goal of the adsorption isotherm is to fit experimental data to the common isotherm models such as langmuir and freundlich which represent the relationship between the adsorbed ion per unit of adsorbent and the concentration of an ion in the liquid phase at equilibrium time and are crucial in optimizing adsorbent usage equation 3 37 gives the expression for the applied non linear langmuir model 3 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e where c e is the equilibrium ion concentration remained in the solution mg l k l is the langmuir adsorption constant related to the capacity of adsorbent and adsorption energy and q m stands for the maximum adsorption capacity mg g the favorability of the adsorption process rl was obtained from the parameters of langmuir isotherm model it can be calculate from equation 4 38 4 r l 1 1 k l c 0 the value of r l specifies the state of the adsorption process with r l 1 indicating an unfavorable adsorption process r l between 0 and 1 indicating a favorable adsorption process r l 1 showing linear adsorption and r l 0 representing irreversible circumstances equation 5 39 also gives the freundlich isotherm model 5 q e k f c e 1 n the n value in this equation indicates that the adsorption process is favorable and k f represents the adsorbate s adsorption capacity and intensity 2 6 adsorption kinetics the time dependent experimental adsorption data are used for kinetic modeling 40 to estimate the removal kinetics of ni ii ion from an aqueous solution pseudo first order and pseudo second order models were used the pseudo first order model is given by equation 6 6 log q e q q e k 1 2 303 t where k1 is the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 qe is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium state mg g and qt denotes the amount of metal adsorbed at specific times mg g pseudo second order model was fitted according to equation 7 7 t q 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e the values of q e k 1 and k 2 were determined from the slopes and intercepts of the plot of t q against t 41 and k 2 is the pseudo second order constant rate min 1 2 7 thermodynamic studies the effect of temperature on the sorption of ni ii ion onto the adsorbent was carried out at different temperatures also thermodynamic parameters including gibbs free energy δg j mol enthalpy δh j mol and entropy δs j mol were calculated using the following equation 8 δ g δ g r t l n k l where kl is the langmuir constant r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j molk the values of δh and δs are defined using the vant hoff plot from equation 9 9 ln k l δ h r t δ s r δh and δs values were determined from the slope and intercept respectively based on the plot of ln k l against 1 t 42 43 2 8 pre equilibrium ph measurements to determine the pre equilibrium ph of ssh 1 g of biosorbent was added to 100 ml of distilled water the samples were agitated for 48 h and the ph of the solution was measured using a ph meter 2 9 point of zero charge a 50 ml solution of 1 m kno3 was prepared in multiple containers to determine the point of zero charges of the adsorbent by adding 0 1 m of hcl or 0 1 m of naoh solution to the kno3 solution the ph was changed from 2 to 12 after recording the initial ph of the solution phi 1 g of adsorbent was added to the solution and agitated at room temperature for 48 h on a stirrer the adsorbent solutions were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min and the ultimate ph of the solution phf was measured the intercept of the ph phi phf versus phi plot was used to determine the point of no charge 36 44 45 3 results and discussions 3 1 morphology studies fig 2 depicts the external and internal surfaces of bulk ssh at various magnifications determined from dls measurements the morphology of bulk external surface is smooth and nonporous but the interface of bulk size is rough and few small cavities are visible the inner surface was examined with higher magnification and it was shown in fig 3 as illustrated in fig 3 the mean size of pores is about 50 μm many pores were found in the cross section of ssh indicating that the adsorbent had a porous structure the smallest pore measured roughly 0 86 m in diameter the microstructure image processing software mip was employed and the porosity of the ssh bulk was estimated as 70 a dls analysis was also performed on ssh powder particles to determine the size distribution of the powders the powdered ssh particles have an average size of roughly 9 nm 3 2 ftir spectroscopy before and after the adsorption process the functional group composition of the ssh was analyzed using fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometry the ftir spectra of the adsorbent were recorded using an infrared spectrophotometer ft ir 5300 in the 400 4000 cm 1 range jasco corp tokyo japan before adsorption the bands at 3424 61 and 2922 26 cm 1 correspond to the alcohol group s o h stretching and the alkane s c h stretching respectively the values of these peaks remained unchanged after adsorption but the intensity of the peaks changed the peaks at 1729 5 1030 2 and 1244 9 cm 1 as shown in fig 4 correspond to the co stretching α β unsaturated ester so stretching sulfoxide and c n stretching amine respectively following adsorption these bands changed to 1733 74 cm 1 1028 96 cm 1 and 1242 85 cm 1 indicating a significant decrease in the intensity of these peaks after adsorption the peak at 827 53 cm 1 which belonged to the minerals slipped away 3 3 effects of adsorbent type on the ni ion adsorption efficiency to find out the capacity of adsorbents ssh and zeolite for ni ii removal from solution in the first step 3 ml solution containing ni ii ion ph 6 5 c0 20 mg l t 24c were taken to specify the total dissolved solution tds value of water after adding the adsorbent to the solution and calculate the percentage of ni ii ion removal by different adsorbents the tds value for distilled water was determined as 12 38 ppm and for the solutions containing different sizes of ssh i e powdered crushed and bulk and zeolite were measured as 111 10 137 50 71 12 and 118 25 ppm respectively ssh removed approximately 76 of ni ii ions in bulk and crushed forms powdered ssh and zeolite on the other hand could remove approximately 62 and 92 of the ni ii ions from the solution respectively the tds value is one of the factors used to assess water purification and quality 46 the diagram shows that the amount of tds in the crushed and powdered sizes of ssh as well as the zeolite powder was very high some other studies have generally claimed that powder samples have better sorption capacities when used to remove some kinds of ions from aqueous solutions due to their larger surface areas 47 however in the present study bulk samples were found to be better absorbents than powder samples in ni ii ion removal from aqueous solutions with no significant tds increase as a result bulk size ssh was used as an adsorbent in our experiments the percentage of ni ii ion removal by ssh and zeolite differed by almost 16 so the ability of ssh to absorb ni ii ions is comparable to that of an adsorbent such as zeolite 3 4 effect of contact time the rate of ion removal is one of the most important factors to predicting the required time for water treatment thus to estimate the needed time for ni ii ion removal by ssh and zeolite 2 g of ssh in three different forms and zeolite powder were added to 100 ml solution with the initial concentration of ni ii ion 20 mg l in separate containers initial ph 6 5 t 25c the rate of ni ii ion adsorption in the presence of zeolite and ssh with different sizes is shown in fig 5 the rapid ion removal rate by adsorbents in the first 15 min is seen in contact time plots and the required time to attain equilibrium was roughly 120 min and the rate of adsorption remained constant after equilibrium during the sorption process the sorbent surface has numerous binding sites therefore there is no competition amongst ions for sites at first but as time passes available sites are filled by other ions and there are insufficient sites for ion adsorption the repulsive forces between the adsorbed ions on the sorbent surface and the remaining ions in the solution on the other hand make the adsorption process more difficult than it was in the beginning as a result after attaining equilibrium the rate of adsorption decreased with time 3 5 effect of ph on the sorption process metal ion adsorption depends strongly on ph values ironically the ph of the system regulates the adsorption capacity by influencing the surface characteristics of the adsorbent and the ionic forms of ni ii in the solution 48 49 to investigate the effect of ph on ni ii ion removal by ssh four different ph values in the range of 1 5 9 4 were examined the batch studies were carried out under the aforementioned conditions adsorbent dosage 2 g ni ii ion concentration 20 mg l and t 25 c the results are presented in fig 6 before and after adding the adsorbent as the results show the maximum adsorption occurred at ph 3 5 and decreased gradually by increasing the ph to 9 4 this reduction was due to the precipitation of ni ii ions because of the formation of ni ii hydroxide complexes 50 to substantiate this conclusion the initial concentration of the batch was set to 20 mg l and then the ph range was changed from 1 5 to 9 4 without sorbent then at specified ph values the amounts of ni ii ions remained in the solution were determined after increasing ph to 9 5 the amount of initial ni ii concentration reduced indicating that complexation and precipitation occur at higher ph values the amount of adsorption was negligible at ph 1 5 this can be described in terms of pzc which is the electrical potential at an adsorbent s surface and was determined to be 1 8 in our case as shown in fig 7 the surface of the adsorbent is negatively charged at any ph higher than 1 8 hence the ratio of ni ii ions adsorption increases dramatically when the ph is changed from 3 5 to 6 5 conversely the ions should compete with h ions for active site adhesion below the pzc due to repulsive forces on the sorbent surface as a result at low ph values the adsorption percentage is negligible 51 for additional testing the optimum ph for ni ii ion removal by ssh was determined to be 6 5 argun observed that the highest rate of adsorption of ni ii ion by zeolite occurred at ph 7 52 for low and high values of ph the process of adsorption was the same as for ssh 3 6 effect of temperature on the sorption process 2 g of adsorbent were introduced to 100 ml of solution with an initial concentration of 20 mg l at ph 6 5 to investigate the influence of temperature on ni ii ion sorption by ssh the sorption effectiveness of ni ii ions increased by 67 5 when the temperature was reduced from 80 to 10 c with increasing temperature from 10 to 80 c the adsorbent capacity reduced from 0 877 to 0 183 mg g the increased adsorption of ni ii ions by ssh can be attributed to the lower energy of ni ii cations resulting in more interaction between metal ions and active sites on the adsorbent surface 53 the effect of temperature on the adsorption of ni ii ions is shown in fig 8 similarly hannachi et al investigated zeolite and their findings revealed that the sorption of ni ii ions by zeolite increased with increasing temperature 54 3 7 effect of adsorbent dosage and initial ni ii ion concentration on the sorption process fig 9 a and b shows the capacity and efficiency of ni ii ion adsorption by ssh as functions of the adsorbent respectively the effect of adsorbent dosage on the uptake of ni ii ion at ph 6 5 20 mg l initial ion concentration and at ambient temperature was examined the amount of sorbent varied between 1 and 4 g in a 100 ml solution as can be deduced from fig 9 b the increase in adsorbent dosage from 10 to 40 g l causes an increase in the adsorption of ni ii ions from 67 to 88 this substantial increase is because of the increased surface area of the adsorbent and more accessible active sites for the adsorption of ni ii ions to compare the dose of the adsorbent parameter by zeolite cocaoba et al conducted a similar study they reported the same

in fig 9c by increasing the initial ni ii ion concentration from 10 to 35 mg l the residual ni ii ion concentration of the solution increased hence the efficiency of ni ii ion sorption decreased however the capacity of the adsorbent increased from 0 36 to 1 31 mg g by increasing the initial concentration of ni ii ions this can be due to increasing the driving force of ni ii ions in high concentration solutions 30 the ni ii ion uptake increased rapidly with time up to 35 min and then increased slowly according to the results the adsorption equilibrium time was 120 min cocaoba et al

indicated by the negative values of g at all temperatures with increasing temperature the negative values indicate stronger adsorptive forces between ni ii ions and ssh the sorption process had an enthalpy value of 42 07 kj mol indicating that ni ii ion adsorption on ssh is exothermic negative s values indicate that the randomness of the solid solution interface is decreasing 64 argun et al investigated the effects of temperature and thermodynamic behavior on ni ion adsorption by zeolite they discovered that the adsorption process was spontaneous and that both the enthalpy and the entropy were negative 52 3 10 comparison the performance of ni ii ion sorption from an industrial effluent by ssh and a selected zeolite to study the industrial application of adsorbates effluents from two different companies pooshesh loab and rangin poosheh shiraz iran were collected ni ii ion concentrations in pooshesh loab and rangin pooshesh were 115 5 and 59 83 respectively due to the high concentration of ni ii in the effluents 5 g of adsorbent was used in each experiment and the results are shown in fig 13 the results show that the percentage of ni ii ion sorption by ssh in solutions with higher concentrations of ni ii ions was greater than their adsorption by zeolite the reason for this is the selective properties of zeolite since industrial effluents contain other heavy metal ions apart from ni ions the active sites on the surface of zeolite were saturated and the ni ii ion sorption was less probable 32 therefore it can be deduced that ni ii ion removal from industrial effluents is more efficient by ssh than zeolite 4 conclusions in this study ssh was used to adsorb ni ion at different contact times in three different sizes bulk 20 mm crushed 7 mm and milled powder 10 nm sem was used to examine the surface and morphology of different shapes and dls was used to determine particle sizes the concentration of ni ii ions was also measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy aas before and after the adsorption process ftir tests were used to determine the active groups on the adsorbent s surface before and after ni ii adsorption the sem micrographs show the bulk ssh surface s rough tubular and porous structure which is suitable for use as an absorbent the maximum absorbing rate for bulk ssh was 76 while zeolite absorption was 86 the effects of ph adsorbent dose initial ni ii ion concentration temperature and contact time were investigated the optimum adsorption of ni ii ions was observed at ph 6 5 20 g l adsorbents an initial ion concentration of 20 mg l and a contact time of 2 h in addition the langmuir isotherm model fit the experimental metal absorption values well the thermodynamic parameters analysis revealed that the process was spontaneous feasible and exothermic within the specified temperature range 10 80 c eventually waste bulk ssh can be used as a biodegradable organic material to absorb the ni ion from industrial

8728,this paper reports the development of a real time inline chemical oxygen demand cod detection technique in a beverage manufacturing plant in england and the evaluation of its capability for dynamic water footprint wf management the inline technique employed ultraviolet visible uv vis spectroscopy and moving window partial least squares mwpls which was then applied to calculating grey wf for the production activities in the plant referred to here as wfrt a traditional offline cod measurement method was also utilised for the grey wf calculation to act as the reference method referred to here as wftrad in a method comparison study bland altman plot the results showed that wfrt detected the order of magnitude variation of wftrad and wftrad was on average between 0 897 and 1 243 times wfrt with no systematic bias this indicates that wfrt may be used for both short time frame minutes to hours wf monitoring and long term weeks to months analysis of trends and the effect of wf

through the loughborough university data repository 1 introduction global water demand by 2050 is expected to be 1 57 times that of the year 2000 during which time the water demand of manufacturing industry is expected to increase by as much as 400 1 sharply increased water utilisation would lead to a more significant wastewater generation although there is limited data on the global amount of industrial wastewater generation and discharge it can be stated that in the eu industry is the leading polluter and that manufacturing is the single largest source of wastewater generation 2 nearly 80 of global wastewater from industry and municipal sources is directly discharged into the environment without any treatment and the situation is even worse in countries with underdeveloped economies 3 resulting in a considerable environmental burden and a hidden danger to human health as a significant water consumer and wastewater generator industry should be aware of its impact on the local environment and contribute to water sustainability a water footprint wf serves as an indicator to quantify the direct operational and indirect supply chain water consumption for a product a production process or a business it is subdivided into green wf blue wf and grey wf 4 green wf refers to the rainwater consumption during plant growth blue wf covers the volume of fresh surface water or groundwater consumed in human activities grey wf is defined as the freshwater volume required for assimilating the pollutant load in the wastewater to meet the local ambient water standards the grey wf attributed to a source is determined by the critical pollutant which is the pollutant requiring the largest degree of dilution among all pollutants in the wastewater 5 it is easier and more efficient for an industrial entity to start a water management programme by considering direct wf operational wf as they can directly control and manage the wf in their factories rather than supply chain wf operational wf is further divided into two categories wf directly related to the product production e g product ingredient cleaning heating or cooling and steaming and wf for overhead activities or facilities e g staff kitchen office transport toilet etc supporting product production wf has been widely employed as a metric to guide water management efforts in various industry sectors 5 10 however these wf studies have been carried out based on published databases and historical records consequently there will be a significant time lag between any changes made in response to the analysis and the water usage resulting in an extra but avoidable burden on local water resources one of the main obstacles to reducing this lag is that the data collection process is cumbersome to address this issue a cyber physical system cps architecture has been proposed to dynamically assess and monitor water sustainability related to manufacturing production 11 here dynamically is taken to mean the ability to measure and respond to changes on both short term and long term scales to achieve this real time measurement capability is required the proposed cps consists of the physical world production activities interfaces sensors and actuators the cyber world cloud storage cloud computing and wf monitoring and decision making support wf optimisation and water management plan smart water and wastewater sensors collect the required data directly from production activities and then automatically transmit the data to the cloud services for further classification storage wf calculation and sustainability evaluation the results from cloud computing can trigger an alarm if the calculated production wf falls out of the pre set wf range the cloud computing results are also transmitted to a real time dashboard visualisation to support visibility for management personnel of the water sustainability of operations the next step in developing the proposed cps is to identify and evaluate the feasibility of using inline technologies to act as the interfaces with the production system for instance real time data collection on the concentration of the pollutants required to calculate the grey wf such as biochemical oxygen demand bod or its proxy chemical oxygen demand cod relies on the availability of an appropriate inline sensor current practice is typically to measure cod for purposes of compliance with discharge permissions to a high degree of accuracy using sampling and offline laboratory measurement which is a time consuming procedure in principle one can obtain the grey wf variation with time by regular sampling offline chemical cod methods and data on flow volumes however this is not feasible in a real factory because of the effort involved the proposed method using an inline cod detection technique and simultaneous flow volume measurement is more viable but may be less accurate the question being addressed in this paper is whether a particular proposed inline cod technique produces sufficiently reliable results for grey wf management to answer this question comparison is made with traditional offline chemical cod measurement as the reference method using a bland altman b a plot the b a plot is a statistical method that was developed to handle this kind of question hence in this paper the development of a real time inline cod detection tool to support grey wf calculation and subsequent method comparison study based on the b a plot to evaluate its desired capability is reported this proposed inline sensing technique is expected to detect the order of magnitude variation for short time frame minutes to hours monitoring of wf and lack systematic bias in the measurement for long time frame weeks to months analysis of trends and the effect of wf reduction strategies the evaluation is carried out using samples from a beverage manufacturing plant 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the beverage manufacturing plant the selected beverage manufacturing plant for the study is located in the middle of england where various products are manufactured and bottled such as fruit cordials fruit juice sparkling drinks ginger beer etc production wastewater of this plant mainly comes from the processing room and production lines more specifically raw material washing cleaning for production hygiene and product quality checking all contribute to the production grey wf of the plant the processing room is designed to process raw materials and prepare ready to bottle beverages for the production lines processes include material washing infusion sugar dissolving syrup mixing and beverage refrigeration two production lines operate in the plant both of which contain four functional zones see fig 1 de pallet bottling pasteurisation and packing in addition checkpoints are located in the bottling pasteurisation and packing zones to guarantee product quality at each stage the bottling checkpoint procedure is to take at least one bottled beverage out of the production line every 15 min to examine its cap quality and tightness taste brix ph and temperature the pasteurisation checkpoint procedure is to take out any broken or defective bottles after pasteurisation all bottled products taken out from these two checkpoints are emptied into the drain which is the main source of high cod concentrations in the plant effluent the packing checkpoint aims to ensure that the label and package meet the requirements and no beverage waste is generated at this checkpoint in the selected plant most of the production effluent by volume comes from washing and cleaning to keep hygienic conditions for processing and production including use of clean in place cip cip is an automatic method to clean the internal surfaces of processing equipment without dismantling 12 including pre rinse caustic soda wash intermediate rinse peracetic acid paa wash and final rinse cip is utilised for cleaning tanks mixers filters and containers in the processing room and is also employed for the production lines just before the daily production begins or between the production runs of different types of products after the daily production is completed a 12 min water rinse is executed for the pipes tanks and fillers 2 2 research steps the study was conducted according to the procedures shown in fig 2 which comprised three steps 1 development of the real time inline cod detection technique 2 developed technique s application and grey wf computation and 3 method comparison study step 1 aimed to develop a real time cod detection tool by combining ultraviolet visible uv vis spectroscopy and partial least squares pls regression the employed uv vis spectroscopy refers to the absorption of radiation in the partial ultraviolet 190 nm 380 nm and visible regions 380 nm 780 nm of the electromagnetic spectrum 13 although the cod detection tool was developed with spectra obtained from offline samples in this study regression modelling with uv vis spectra is inline capable 14 15 and as such has been reported in many academic studies due to its environmentally friendly fast non destructive and reagent free nature 16 19 in this stage wastewater samples at fixed time intervals were collected from the effluent outlet of the beverage manufacturing plant the volume of wastewater generated during the periods between the times at which samples were collected was recorded simultaneously afterwards a traditional offline cod measurement and uv vis spectrum measurement for each collected sample were carried out some samples were reserved for step 2 and the remaining samples were utilised to establish regression models by pls after excluding outliers subsequently a variable selection tool moving window pls mwpls was employed to optimise the pls models then the most optimal model was selected for the next step the 2nd step was to obtain the reserved samples cod from the traditional offline chemical assay and the developed inline technique using the chosen pls model and then values of grey wf were calculated for each sample using cod values obtained from the traditional offline chemical assay and the developed inline technique and the measured wastewater volumes in step 3 a method comparison study based on the bland altman b a plot was conducted to study the agreement between the two sets of values for grey wf from step 2 a series of screening statistical tests were required before using the b a plot method which were a correlation study a normality test and a one sample t test the following sections 2 3 to 2 7 give a more detailed introduction and explanation of the methods used in the above steps 2 3 sampling and experimental procedures 2 3 1 sample collection and pre treatment all wastewater from the production lines and the processing room flows through an outlet into a buffer pit outside the plant when reaching a pre set level that triggers the pump operation the wastewater in the pit is automatically pumped out to a large storage tank onsite when the tank gets full a wastewater treatment company comes to collect it the sampling location was at the pit and the wastewater was collected from the outflow stream at the outlet mentioned above using a long probe with a receptacle attached to the end the collected samples were decanted into 350 ml pet bottles with pp caps the sample collection and transport followed the quality assurance and quality control procedures in accordance with iso 5667 14 20 and iso 5667 3 21 nine visits were made for sampling on specific production days between november 2020 and july 2021 on which elderflower cordial and elderflower sparkling drinks were bottled in production line 1 and line 2 respectively a total of 180 time series samples were collected at a time interval of 15 min a sample preservation treatment following the standard iso 15705 22 was applied to stabilise the samples once brought to the laboratory chloride test strips were utilised to test the concentration range of chloride ions cl in the samples which is required not to exceed 1000 mg l when using the iso 15705 st cod method 22 23 the results indicated that of the 180 samples the cl concentration of 158 were within 1000 mg l and 22 were over 1000 mg l the over range 22 samples were diluted by deionised water and retested for cl concentration the ph of samples was adjusted to be under 2 using sulfuric acid 5 mol l before being stored in a refrigerator at a temperature of between 2 c and 8 c 2 3 2 experimental set up and procedures the maximum turnaround time between sample collection and completion of all measurement procedures was 72 h the traditional offline cod measurement utilised commercial chemical test cuvettes lci400 hach based on iso 15705 a thermostat lt 200 hach and a portable vis spectrophotometer dr 1900 hach samples with cod exceeding the lci400 range of 1000 mg l were diluted by deionised water the actual cod values were calculated by multiplying the diluted sample cod value by its dilution factor the sample spectrum measurement was performed by a double beam uv vis spectrometer lambda 35 perkinelmer and uv winlab software perkinelmer in this study the spectral range was 190 nm 780 nm and the light path length was 10 mm 2 nm was used for the slit width the data interval of the spectrum was 1 nm and the scanning speed was 480 nm min the solution for baseline correction and reference utilised deionised water the dilution factor of the diluted samples can be set in uvwinlab software if the collected sample was diluted with a sample to water ratio of 1 20 the dilution factor of this sample was 21 then uvwinlab software provided the spectrum adjusted with the dilution factor i e the obtained spectrum was for the original sample without dilution 2 4 methods for development of real time cod detection technique 2 4 1 dataset division in principle samples used for pls regression should cover the full range of content likely to be seen in the plant effluent during regular operation as it was not feasible within the resource available to the study to carry out sufficient sampling to ensure this was the case sampling was carried out only on days when elderflower cordial and elderflower sparkling drinks were being bottled in an attempt to reduce variability in the samples the collected 180 samples were divided into two groups group a and b for different purposes samples in group a were used to develop the inline cod detection technique in step 1 as shown in fig 2 while samples in group b were reserved for grey wf calculation step 2 and the method comparison study step 3 the initial plan was to assign all 131 samples from visit 1 visit 7 to group a and all 49 samples from visit 8 visit 9 to group b however considering the content variation of wastewater samples in each visit the plan was adjusted as shown in fig 3 more detailed explanations for the content variation are provided in section 3 1 in addition to all samples in the first seven visits around 40 of samples in the last two visits i e 19 samples were added to group a to develop the tool in total 150 samples were in group a and 30 in group b in group a after removing 26 outliers the remaining 124 samples were further divided into a training dataset and a test dataset with a ratio of 70 30 i e 87 samples for model training and 37 samples for model test the training dataset was used to find the relationship between absorbance predictors and cod responses and generate a well fitted pls model with good predictive capability for new wastewater samples from the same source in this stage the number of latent variables lvs the employed variables spectral ranges and the coefficient matrix of the pls model were defined test datasets were held to assess the model s performance developed by the entire training dataset in group b 2 samples with cod values exceeding the range used for the tool s development were removed from the capability evaluation so 28 samples were finally used in the method comparison study 2 4 2 partial least squares pls in this study pls regression was applied to establish the relationship between cod and absorbance in the uv vis spectrum 190 nm 780 nm pls is a robust statistical tool correlating high dimensional predictor variables x and one or several response variables y it has been widely used in water quality measurement of river water groundwater coastal water and wastewater usually combined with different spectroscopy techniques e g uv vis spectroscopy near infrared nir spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy 24 to build the calibration a series of water samples are collected which should cover the range of variation of water contents from the source for each sample cod is measured from the hach st cod test and the relevant spectrum is obtained from the uv vis spectrometer pls regression is then applied this technique does not directly build the relationship between y and x but firstly extracts the latent variables lvs from y and x which are also called y scores u and x scores t respectively then t is used to predict u and then predicted u gives the predicted results for the related y the extracted t and u should respectively represent the most variation of x and y which means that the extracted t and u keep the information and structure of x and y to the greatest extent moreover the extracted t should have the best explanation of u i e t and u have the highest correlation 25 the pls regression model describes the relationship between y and x as shown in eq 1 1 y n m x n p b p m e n m where y n m is the response matrix with a size of n x m x n p is the predictor matrix with a size of n x p b p m is the coefficient matrix with a size of p x m and e n m is the error matrix with a size of n x m in this study each element of y is the cod value of a sample each row of x is the ordered set of absorbance measurements in the spectrum of a sample n is the number of samples utilised in the model m 1 and p is the number of spectral data points in the wavelength range used for the model matlab software was employed for the pls regression in which the wavelength range and number of lvs need to be identified the full spectrum 190 nm 780 nm was first used to establish the model global model and act as a baseline moving window pls mwpls was used for the variable selection the number of lvs was decided according to the root mean square error of cross validation rmsecv the model performance was evaluated by its correlation coefficient of training rtrn root mean square error of training rmsetrn correlation coefficient of test rtst and root mean square error of test rmsetst 2 4 3 moving window pls mwpls mwpls is an efficient variable selection tool for pls regression 26 in mwpls the wavelength window size needs to be defined which determines the number of spectral data points contained in the window then a series of pls models are successively established based on the spectral information in the window that moves from the beginning position to the end position of the whole spectrum 27 the most informative wavelength range is located according to the mwpls performance of cross validation in this study mwpls was performed by means of the algorithm contained in the itoolbox 28 and purpose written matlab code a total of 11 window sizes were investigated separately in which the window size increases sequentially from 21 to 121 at an interval of 10 there were 591 spectral points between 190 nm and 780 nm the window moved from the first point 190 nm to the last point 780 nm generating 591 spectral intervals and developing 591 models based on these intervals in the end a total of 6501 local mwpls models were developed this study used matlab code to automatically obtain the fitted local models with rmsecv better than the global model afterwards the models with rtrn or rtst below 0 7 were filtered out then the remaining models were sorted by rtst from largest to smallest finally a model was selected from the shortlist by considering rtst rmsetst and the absolute difference rmsetst rmsetrn as a percentage of rmsetrn simultaneously to find the best compromise in the mwpls function provided by itoolbox 28 it is worth noting that for the same window size the number of spectral points included in the moving window could be different which is because the window spectral range depends on the position where the moving window is with respect to the minimum or maximum wavelength in the complete spectral data set the relationship between the window size ws window s position wp and the selected spectral range in this study are described as follows for 1 w p w s 1 2 the spectral range is from the 1st spectral point to the number w p w s 1 2 point on the whole spectrum with 591 spectral points for w s 1 2 w p 591 w s 1 2 the spectral range covers the spectral points from w p w s 1 2 to w p w s 1 2 on the spectrum if 591 w s 1 2 w p 591 the spectral range selects from w p w s 1 2 to the 591st spectral point on the spectrum 2 5 method for grey wf accounting in the usual definition the wastewater in grey wf accounting refers to the effluents finally discharged into the environment which means that the grey wf can be assumed as zero if the effluents from production are adequately treated before draining into the natural water body however the grey wf calculated in this study is considered to be that of the wastewater directly from production activities before any treatment it is considered that wf calculated in this way from untreated sewage directly reflects the degree of water pollution created by production activities and consequently encourages manufacturers to find out how to decrease wastewater generation rather than rely on wastewater treatment 11 in addition wastewater treatment has an environmental burden associated with it which would increase the whole system wf if properly accounted for in this study the time interval of the grey wf of production is the same as the time interval of samples i e 15 min the grey wf with cod as the critical pollutant can be calculated by eq 2 4 2 g r e y w f l 15 m i n s c w w v w w c f w v f w c max c n a t l p c max c n a t where c w w mg l is the cod concentration of the production wastewater v w w l 15mins is the production wastewater volume generated in 15 min c f w mg l is the cod concentration of the freshwater used in production v f w l 15mins is the freshwater volume used for production in 15 min l p mg 15mins is the cod load generated from the production in 15 min c f w can be assumed as zero therefore c f w v f w can be ignored i e l p c w w v w w c max mg l is the maximum acceptable concentration of cod for the local ambient water according to the discharge limit for cod required by the uk government c max 125 mg l was used 29 c n a t mg l is the natural cod concentration in the local ambient water body generally the concentration of cod in unpolluted surface water is less than or equal to 20 mg l 30 thus c n a t 20 mg l was used for the following grey wf calculation in this study the volume of wastewater from the outlet v w w l 15mins was not directly available as no volume sensor was installed in the outlet and pit however the tank was equipped with a volume monitor sensor from which the wastewater volume in the tank can be read at every sampling event and after every pump operation then v w w l 15mins can be estimated based on the volume changes in the tank time intervals between pump operation and each sample collection and the pre set water volume that triggers pump operation the estimation premise was that the flow rate was uniform in the studied time unit the grey wf of the reserved time series samples from the last two visits were calculated based on the estimated v w w and cod from the two cod detection methods the traditional cod measurement and the developed real time cod detection method referred to as traditional grey wf wftrad and real time grey wf wfrt respectively 2 6 methods for the method comparison study bland altman b a plot the traditional methods used for performance evaluation such as correlation coefficient r and coefficient of determination r squared are not sufficient in this application 31 this is because r and r squared only indicate the correlation strength and common proportion of variance between two variables respectively thus the bland altman b a plot 32 also known as the tukey mean difference plot was employed for the method comparison study in the past decades the b a plot has been broadly applied to assess whether a new method or piece of equipment can replace a traditional one especially in the medical area 33 the classic b a method plots the difference between the two methods y axis against the average value of the two methods x axis 95 of limit of agreements loas including the upper loa and the lower loa serve as two reference lines on the y axis between which 95 of differences fall it is worth mentioning that the difference plotted on y axis in b a plot can be the absolute difference wftrad wfrt a ratio wftrad wfrt or a relative difference such as percentage difference eq 3 between the two methods 3 p e r c e n t a g e d i f f e r e n c e w f t r a d w f r t 1 2 w f t r a d w f r t 100 in this study either the ratio or percentage difference between wftrad and wfrt was considered to be more appropriate than the absolute difference for the b a plot this approach was chosen because the relative difference can provide a more objective evaluation than the absolute difference for this study where order of magnitudes variation in cod values can be expected for instance an absolute difference of 100 l 15mins between 200 l 15mins and 300 l 15mins is more striking than a difference of 100 l 15mins between 20 000 l 15mins and 20 100 l 15mins whether using the absolute difference ratio wftrad wfrt or percentage difference statistical screening tests must be applied prior to carrying out a b a plot to carry out the b a plot properly it is also necessary to check whether the difference absolute difference ratio or percentage difference changes with magnitude the averages of each measurement pair in this study spss statistics was used to conduct a linear regression on the difference and the average in which the p value coefficient and constant of the regression equation were calculated the p value is used to test the null hypothesis that there is no statistically significant difference between 0 and the coefficient of the regression line by comparing it with the default alpha level of 0 05 when the calculated p value is larger than 0 05 the null hypothesis is accepted i e the linear relationship between difference and average can be neglected in this case the b a plot uses the statistical parameters and equations eq 4 9 displayed in table 1 however if the null hypothesis is rejected i e the difference has a relationship with magnitude then logarithmic log transformations of both measurements should be subjected to regression analysis instead and then used in the b a plot if the null hypothesis can be accepted in the case where the log transformations fail a regression approach can be taken to calculate a new loa more details of this approach can be found in the literature 34 35 this study employed a more conservative eq 8 36 suggested by ludbrook 35 to calculate loas for the sample number n less than 60 instead of using eq 10 proposed by bland and altman 32 10 l o a s m e a n d i f f e r e n c e d 1 96 s t a n d a r d d e v i a t i o n s for the same reason this study applies eq 9 suggested by ludbrook 35 to calculate 95 tolerance limits tls with 95 confidence this equation includes the factor k7 obtained from the geigy scientific tables 35 36 which allows the size of n to be considered thus the 95 tls with 95 confidence for the population are adopted in this study as the preferred and most conservative parameters to indicate the interchangeability of the two methods the most significant advantage of the b a plot is simplicity and visualisation it clearly quantifies the difference distribution range and agreement degree between the two methods within the measured magnitudes at the beginning of this b a plot study a criterion was defined to determine whether the degree of agreement between wftrad and wfrt can be accepted this is that the calculated tls should imply that wfrt is able to detect at least the order of magnitude wf variation for a short time frame minutes to hours monitoring and produce a relatively accurate estimate of cumulative grey wf for long time frame weeks to months analysis of trends and the effect of wf optimisation strategies 2 7 methods for the screening analyses preparatory to the b a plot 2 7 1 correlation study the first assessment was to check how close the correlation was between wftrad and wfrt for this purpose the pearson correlation coefficient r for linear relationship strength was utilised which is defined as eq 11 37 11 r c o v x y σ x σ y where c o v x y is the covariance between two variables x and y σ x and σ y are the standard deviation of variable x and variable y respectively the range of r is between 1 and 1 if the absolute value of r equals 1 r 1 a perfect correlation between two variables is indicated i e x y r 0 reveals no correlation between the two variables 0 r 0 3 0 3 r 0 5 and 0 5 r 1 shows the correlation between the two variables is weak moderate and strong respectively 38 if r indicates a weak correlation between two variables there is no further need for an agreement study when r suggests a relatively strong correlation then performing an agreement study by the b a plot method can be considered in this study r was calculated between wftrad and wfrt by spss statistics software at the same time the p value was calculated to test the null hypothesis that the correlation between these two variables is not statistically significant when the calculated p value is larger than the chosen alpha level of 0 05 the null hypothesis is accepted i e the correlation is not statistically significant otherwise the null hypothesis is rejected i e the correlation is statistically significant 2 7 2 normality test to perform a b a plot the difference absolute difference or percentage difference or ratio between wftrad and wfrt needs to be normally distributed the well known shapiro wilk test 39 is a practical normality test for small sample sizes being applicable even for sample sizes of less than 20 it was employed in this study to check the normality of the difference using spss statistics software the null hypothesis for the test is that the tested data is from a normal distribution the objective is to accept or reject the null hypothesis by comparing the p value to the chosen alpha level of 0 05 when the calculated p value exceeds 0 05 the null hypothesis is accepted i e the tested data is from a normal distribution otherwise the null hypothesis is rejected in the case of rejection the test can be performed again for the difference between the natural logarithmic transformations of wftrad and wfrt i e ln wftrad and ln wfrt and if normality is found the natural logs would also be used for the one sample t test and b a plot 34 2 7 3 one sample t test when the difference values absolute difference or percentage difference or ratio are normally distributed the one sample t test is then performed using spss statistics software to examine the statistical significance between the mean value of difference and zero 40 41 the null hypothesis is that there is no statistical significance between them which is accepted when the p value is above 0 05 if the null hypothesis is rejected p value 0 05 it is unnecessary to use the b a plot method for the agreement study as the t test will have already indicated a fixed bias between wftrad and wfrt 3 results and discussion 3 1 uv vis spectrum measurement fig 4 shows the absorption spectra 190 nm 780 nm with dilution factors of the collected samples from every visit it can be clearly seen that the most striking absorbance variation always appears in the range of 190 nm 400 nm in all measured spectra in general cod detection utilises the wavelength range from 250 nm to 380 nm within which organic molecules absorb uv light 42 the absorbance abs range and spectrum shape vary from visit to visit which means these samples contain compounds of different types and concentrations this is because the production activities in the processing room are flexible vary daily and are not always related to the bottling schedule there could be preparation activities e g material washing infusion mixing etc for other products or cip operation for containers mixers tanks used for different solutions or other activities so that was why as stated in section 2 4 1 a portion of samples from visit 8 and visit 9 were included in group a to ensure the developed model covers the information of samples collected in the last two visits 3 2 cod experiment results table 2 summarises the essential statistical characteristics of the cod results of the training and test datasets they had similar ranges training 630 mg l 10988 mg l test 693 mg l 10659 mg l mean values training 4435 mg l test 4330 mg l and median values training 4221 mg l test 4158 mg l this indicates that the test datasets can provide an unbiased and reasonable assessment for the model fitted on the training dataset from the box plots fig 5 it is more apparent that the training dataset had a similar distribution to the test dataset the box plot shows that 75 of cod values fall in the range between the minimum and the third quartile q3 i e 630 mg l to 5943 mg l for training data and 693 mg l to 5917 mg l for test data while the remaining 25 of data falls into the whisker range between q3 and maximum i e 5943 mg l to 10988 mg l for the training dataset and 5917 mg l to 10659 mg l for the test dataset it is evident that for both datasets the cod values in the whisker range q3 to maximum have a more considerable variance than the rest of the data in the set i e the variance of the upper 25 of the data is as great as that of the other 75 for each set 3 3 pls regression results pls regression was first carried out on the full spectrum 190 nm 780 nm to establish a global model as a reference mwpls regression was then carried out from which a total of 1638 models with rmsecv better than the global model were preliminarily taken out using matlab codes only 9 out of the 1638 models produce rtrn and rtst above 0 7 finally the optimal mwpls model with 5 lvs and a spectral interval from 234 nm to 304 nm was selected based on the principle stated in section 2 4 3 this selected optimal mwpls was generated when the window window size 71 moved to the 80th window location as an illustration fig 6 displays the rmsecv of the 591 mwpls models generated for a window size of 71 the horizontal dotted line rmsecv 2406 mg l represents the rmsecv of the global model in this case there were 154 data points below the dotted line i e 154 mwpls models rmsecv were better than the global model the study did not directly select the model with the smallest rmsecv 1825 mg l at the 123rd window 277nmnm to 347 nm but further selection criteria for model stability were applied to avoid overfitting the effect of overfitting can be seen in table 3 showing that that the mwpls model based on the 123rd window had a test performance rtst 0 643 and rmsetst 2252 mg l far inferior to its training performance rtrn 0 813 and rmsetrn 1428 mg l and was therefore probably overfitted for the selected mwpls the test performances rtst 0 746 and rmsetst 1980 mg l were almost as good as that of the training rtrn 0 746 and rmsetrn 1630 mg l indicating that this model has a very low probability of overfitting and that its performance is relatively stable i e the model performance does not change significantly with different new input data it can also be seen that the chosen model has greatly improved performance compared to the global model employing the full measurement spectrum rtrn 0 274 and rtst 0 582 increased to 0 746 rmsetrn and rmsetst dropped around 31 and 8 5 to 1630 mg l and 1980 mg l separately fig 7 visualises the fitting performance of the model as a scatter plot 3 4 developed technique s application and grey wf computation the traditional offline method and the developed real time inline capable technique were used to measure the cod of the reserved 30 samples trial in group b the trial group s cod values by the traditional offline method ranged from 924 mg l to 14 847 mg l out of the range of the training dataset 630 mg l to 10 988 mg l and test dataset 693 mg l to 10 659 mg l used in developing the inline technique this is more apparent in fig 8 displaying overlapping histograms of the traditional cod of the three datasets two of the trial samples fall into the range of 13 000 mg l to 15 000 mg l which the training and test ranges do not cover accordingly these two samples were excluded from the method comparison study in section 3 5 moreover only relatively few samples of the training 8 samples and test 3 samples sets fall in the range of 8000 mg l to 11 000 mg l therefore the accuracy of the developed technique may not be guaranteed for the samples cod that fall into this range table 4 lists the wastewater volume changes δ v cod values obtained from the two methods and the calculated grey wf wftrad and wfrt the time variation of both grey wf values over the sampling period on the two visit dates is shown in fig 9 it can be seen qualitatively that the wfrt can be used to detect the general trend in wftrad the rising trend of grey wf from 13 00 on 02 07 2021 fig 9 a and 12 40 on 09 07 2021 fig 9 b was because production had finished and the water rinse cycle for the pipes tanks and fillers started in this stage the highly concentrated organic beverage that remained in the fillers and pipes was rinsed out utilising a large volume of water in fig 9 a the gaps between wftrad and wfrt at two consecutive time points 12 00 and 12 15 were unusually large where wfrt were much lower than the wftrad leading to the two methods providing an opposite wf trend between 11 45 and 12 15 it was because the developed inline technique underestimated the cod of 9912 mg l at 12 00 sample 2021 07 02 p21 and 8022 mg l at 12 15 sample 2021 07 02 p22 to be 3632 mg l and 4704 mg l respectively two possible reasons for the discrepancy can be identified as stated at the beginning of this section the samples used in the technique development were relatively few in the range of 8000 mg l to 11 000 mg l moreover the sampling day of 02 07 2021 was during the elderflower harvest season wastewater from elderflower infusion such as infusion tank rinsing around noon also contributed to the higher cod value however this operation was not covered in the previous sampling visits it can also be seen that wfrt was lower than the wftrad at 10 45 on 02 07 2021 sample 2021 07 02 p16 and 12 55 on 09 07 2021 sample 2021 07 09 p23 these are the samples which as previously stated have levels of cod outside of the training range and are excluded from the following comparison study 3 5 method comparison study for these two methods 3 5 1 screening tests preparatory to bland and altman b a plot correlation study calculation using spss statistics returned the result of the pearson correlation study for wftrad and wfrt in which r 0 661 and p value 0 001 as 0 5 r 1 this indicates that they have a strong correlation the p value was much lower than 0 05 so the null hypothesis that the correlation was not statistically significant was rejected i e the correlation between wftrad and wfrt was statistically significant thus the b a plot can be employed to explore the agreement between wftrad and wfrt further normality test as highlighted in section 2 6 the ratio wftrad wfrt or percentage difference between wftrad and wfrt was preferred for this b a plot study from fig 10 it is apparent that the ratio wftrad wfrt was not normally distributed but the percentage difference between wftrad and wfrt was normally distributed which was further verified by the shapiro wilk test the test result for the ratio wftrad wfrt showed that the p value was 0 001 i e far below 0 05 thus the null hypothesis of tested data was from a normal distribution was rejected by contrast the p value of the percentage difference was 0 565 exceeding 0 05 and then the null hypothesis in this case was accepted therefore the b a plot utilised the percentage difference between wftrad and wfrt referred to as diff although the ratio cannot be directly used in the b a plot eq 12 enables the conversion between the percentage difference diff and ratio wftrad wfrt 12 r a t i o 200 d i f f 200 d i f f one sample t test the results of the one sample t test for diff showed that the p value sig was 0 5 greater than 0 05 so the null hypothesis of no statistical significance between mean diff and zero was accepted in this case a b a plot can be carried out further to study the agreement between the two wf methods 3 5 2 bland and altman b a plot the average of each measurement pair for each trial sample i e wfrt wftrad referred to as avg was plotted on the x axis of the b a plot with diff of each pair plotted on the y axis spss was used to conduct linear regression for the plot to check whether there is a dependence of diff on avg the best fit line is described by eq 13 13 d i f f 16 229 0 001 a v g as the calculated p value of 0 168 was greater than 0 05 the null hypothesis that there is no statistically significant difference between 0 and the coefficient 0 001 was accepted i e the slope of the regression line can be taken to be 0 meaning that there is no systematic bias in diff therefore the statistical parameters required by the b a plot can be calculated using the equations shown in table 1 accordingly the calculated mean diff d 95 limits of agreement loas 95 confidence interval ci of d and 95 tolerance limits tls with 95 confidence are listed in table 5 in addition the corresponding ratios are also presented in the same table the implications of the b a plot fig 11 are discussed in the following paragraphs to give further insight into the relationship between the two methods the y axis values from the b a plot including the statistical parameters have been transformed to the ratio wftrad wfrt using eq 12 and plotted in fig 12 in fig 11 the first parameter to examine is the mean diff d 5 4 with 95 ci highlighted as the shaded areas with dark grey from 10 8 to 21 6 i e with 95 confidence that the true value of diff is between 10 8 and 21 6 the corresponding view in fig 12 shows that the mean ratio between wftrad and wfrt was 1 056 with on average the value of the ratio being between 0 897 and 1 243 importantly the line of equality diff 0 or ratio 1 was within the ci of d which also verified no statistical significance between mean diff and zero from the previous one sample t test if the ci of d does not include the line of equality the conclusion can be drawn that there is a systematic difference fixed bias between methods i e the measured value of one method is always higher or lower than that of the other method 31 the purpose of the b a plot is to visualise the relationship between the distribution of diff and the 95 loas the 95 loas are shown as the blue dash dot lines in fig 11 ranging from 82 0 lower loa to 92 8 upper loa within which 95 of values of diff should fall i e the diff between the two methods is expected to be within 82 0 92 8 in 95 of cases for the 28 trial samples in this study 27 diff values around 96 4 fell within the range the corresponding ratios in fig 12 show that the corresponding expectation for the ratio wftrad to wfrt is 0 418 2 731 as mentioned before the tls are the preferred and most conservative parameters to indicate the interchangeability of the two wf methods thus the 95 tls with 95 confidence for the population have a more extensive range than loas in fig 11 the tls are shown as two grey dash lines where the covered area is shaded by light grey ranging from 102 6 lower tl to 113 4 upper tl it indicates that there is 95 confidence that 95 of the value of diff for any future measurement of wfrt and wftrad will be between 102 6 and 113 4 this corresponds to wftrad being 0 322 to 3 621 times wfrt the implications of this conclusion for the suitability of the developed inline technique for measuring grey wf are discussed in section 4 4 implications of the method comparison study results for use of the developed inline technique the method comparison study results indicate that this real time method is suitable for use in two ways for water management and improving water sustainability short term minutes to hours monitoring and long term weeks to months optimisation 4 1 short term monitoring it is asserted that in selecting a technique suitable for wf management a high level of accuracy can be sacrificed for the advantages of dynamic measurement and that the ability to detect wf variations within an order of magnitude is sufficient for the short time frame minutes to hours management of wf the b a plot has shown that wf can be determined within a factor of 0 322 3 621 using the proposed inline technique this is sufficient to detect abnormal changes in wf such as the grey wf increasing sharply within a short time going far out of the pre determined range of acceptability of wf or staying at a high level for a long time abnormal changes in grey wf may reflect something going wrong in production one example is that the conductivity sensors installed in pipes of the cip system malfunction which can lead to a premature discharge of caustic soda or paa which should have been recycled and reused into the effluent system the associated abnormal change of grey wf would be detected and staff would be alerted to check find and address the root causes of the change another example in beverage manufacturing plants is when machine malfunctions lead to defective packaged beverages e g the fillers fail to fill the bottle to the pre set volume or cappers are damaged or fail to apply caps appropriately defective beverage products will be emptied and drained into the effluent system at the checkpoints which rapidly and considerably raises the cod concentration of the production wastewater leading to a sharply increased grey wf the frequency of abnormal changes that appears during the grey wf monitoring represents the malfunction rate of these machines providing a tool for process and machine health monitoring and water management 4 2 long term optimisation the lack of systematic bias seen in this developed real time method wfrt indicates that a relatively accurate estimate of cumulative grey wf can be obtained over the long term the grey wf obtained from wfrt will be within a factor of 0 897 1 243 times the real value that could be expected if a programme of frequent wet chemical method measurements of cod were to be possible and undertaken thus wfrt is suitable for a long time frame weeks to months analysis of trends and the effect of wf reduction strategies it s worth noting that the traditional grey wf accounting method is not suitable for this due to the limited sampling frequency and sample size and time consuming nature of laboratory analysis consequently it is unable to effectively sample the nature and volume of wastewater generated from a manufacturing plant the wastewater flow generally depends on production schedule and so may vary irregularly on time scales of hours to minutes especially where a plant produces various products and has multiple production lines dynamic wf monitoring can enable companies to comprehensively understand water utilisation and wastewater generation in their production then wf can be optimised by the pdca cycle plan do check adjust 44 moreover the pdca cycle can be combined with a simulation model of the production facility to test different what if scenarios allowing testing of strategies without disturbing the current manufacturing system significantly reducing the time cost and risk of the implementation of new strategies 44 45 wf optimisation strategies should consider reduction of town water usage wastewater generation reduction and pollutant reduction reduction of water usage can start with identifying opportunities for reduction in the water required for processes for water reuse and for water recycling 46 47 examples of water reduction are preventing over cleaning in the cip by employing real time monitoring sensor techniques 48 lowering the flow rate for floor cleaning avoiding high pressure water unless necessary and replacing an outdated machine that consumes overmuch water water reuse can involve employing the degraded water from bottle rinse or raw materials washing for other activities with low water quality requirements such as floor cleaning truck washing etc moreover water from bottle rinse or other processes can be recovered treated and then used for other purposes such as cooling towers hot wells pasteurisers etc all approaches used in water saving also lessen wastewater discharge in addition to the quantity reduction of water use and wastewater discharge decreasing pollutants in the wastewater from its source is also critical to grey wf optimisation the pollutant source and types vary by industry for the food and beverage manufacturing industry pollutants mainly are organic matters from remnant food or beverages on processing equipment or floors and remaining or spent detergent from all kinds of cleaning to maintain hygienic conditions resulting in a high concentration of bod and cod for instance changing food processing methods or ingredients in a food manufacturing plant may reduce the remaining food in a cooking tank resulting in less organic matter in the cleaning effluents minimising detergent amounts in the cleaning processes such as minor adjustments for the cip system in the initial rinse time detergent solution conductivity final rinse time and detergent recovery values can significantly reduce the water consumption detergent consumption and effluent discharge 49 4 3 research contributions as pointed out in the introduction conventional wf studies look at average wf value over a period of years by analysing data from published databases and historical records 6 8 9 as also pointed out this approach does not strongly support practical interventions by individual supply chain actors because of the time lags and effort involved in collecting the data this research has shown that the proposed cps system 11 using an optical detection method can support continuous wf monitoring and therefore provide the required practical tool for an active approach to wf reduction an additional contribution is related to the fact that in most wf studies 7 8 50 supply chain wf generally received more attention than operational wf these studies exemplify the general tendency in the literature to concentrate on supply chain wf rather than operational wf this tendency occurs because the former is much higher than the latter especially for the food and beverage manufacturing industry where the dominant wf is from the crop raising phase in agriculture while such studies are useful for identifying supply chain hot spots for wf generation they are less helpful in identifying potential operational changes to reduce wf by individual actors and resolving any effects of such changes within a reasonable time frame the optical detection method verified in this study can support the proposed cps system 11 to remedy this lack in operational wf studies reported in the literature 7 50 52 while the definition of grey wf used nominally quantifies the impacts caused by the effluents finally discharged into the environment the assumption is adopted that grey wf can be neglected on the grounds that the operational effluent would be treated to meet emission standards onsite or by a downstream wastewater treatment plant however no matter which wastewater treatment is employed they all have an invisible wf and burden on the environment due to the energy materials and water consumption during the treatment processes given that avoiding waste is better than treating it the lack of attention to this invisible environmental burden cannot help industrial actors trace the roots of pollution roots or encourage them to reduce the wf caused by wastewater at its source rather than rely on wastewater treatment this study addresses this gap by proposing a different view of attributing grey wf to wastewater at source and so providing data helpful in managing untreated wastewater directly from production related activities 4 4 research limitations and future work this study likely represents a worst performance of the method for real time monitoring of wf than might be achievable in practice this is due to the limitations of the study i e the real time cod detection tool and its performance in the method comparison study are limited by the relatively small number of samples used in the pls regression this in turn is a result of the amount of effort required to manually collect the samples better performance could be achieved if more samples were collected to cover as wide a range as possible of production conditions for elderflower cordial and elderflower sparkling future development of this industrial system would see the use of inline in situ optical sensor devices to measure the required uv vis spectra which could rapidly gather a much larger data set and permit improved regression models for better performance the conclusions reached in the present study warrant further and wider investigation of the potential of the method for real time wf monitoring for example the main pollutants and the most critical pollutant of effluent vary by industry for the beverage industry the main pollutants are types of organic matter the grey wf calculation in this study assumes that cod is the critical pollutant more water quality parameters related to organic matter such as total organic carbon toc could also be measured and used in the grey wf calculation then the final grey wf would be determined by the pollutant with the most significant grey wf among all pollutants in the wastewater 5 conclusion sharp global increases in industrial water demand and wastewater generation put an enormous burden on water sustainability in a previous study a proposed cps was described which could enable an industrial actor to dynamically manage water sustainability the system requires appropriate real time inline techniques to support data collection for wf monitoring and management this paper evaluated the capability of a real time inline capable cod monitoring technique to fulfil this role the inline tool was developed utilising pls regression applied to uv vis spectroscopy with samples of wastewater obtained from a beverage factory mwpls was employed to optimise the pls model by selecting the most effective and informative spectral interval the mwpls model selected has 5 lvs based on a spectral interval of 234 nm 304 nm of which the rtrn 0 746 rtst 0 746 rmsetrn 1630 mg l and rmsetst 1980 mg l the selected model serving as a cod detection tool was applied to calculate the grey wf associated with production activities in the beverage manufacturing plant the traditional offline cod measurement method was also employed for the grey wf calculation acting as a reference method then a method comparison study employing a bland and altman b a plot was carried out to check the agreement between wftrad reference method and wfrt developed method the results showed that wftrad was between 0 418 and 2 731 times wfrt in 95 of the cases for the 28 samples in the study following statistical analysis of the sampling error and variance in the underlying population it was calculated that there is 95 confidence that 95 of wftrad was between 0 322 and 3 621 times wfrt for both the current set and underlying population of samples it was argued that the ability of wfrt to detect the order of magnitude variation in grey wf is sufficient for short time frame minutes to hours monitoring of wf i e a high level of accuracy can be sacrificed for the advantages of real time measurement there was also observed to be no fixed bias between wftrad and wfrt and wftrad was on average between 0 897 and 1 243 times wfrt indicating a relatively accurate estimate of cumulative grey wf can be obtained over the long term it was considered that this is sufficient for a long time frame weeks to months analysis of trends and the effect of wf optimisation strategies it is concluded that this proposed inline cod technique is a promising candidate to support the previously proposed cps for dynamic grey wf management in the manufacturing industry production such a system would provide a practical tool for individual actors in a supply chain to address the impact of water use on the environment this contrasts with the current approach reported in the literature which is dependent on databases and surveys and tends to concentrate on supply chain related impact not operational impact in addition a modified grey wf

dynamic water footprint wf management the inline technique employed ultraviolet visible uv vis spectroscopy and moving window partial least squares mwpls which was then applied to calculating grey wf for the production activities in the plant referred to here as wfrt a traditional offline cod measurement method was also utilised for the grey wf calculation to act as the reference method referred to here as wftrad in a method comparison study bland altman plot the results showed that wfrt detected the order of magnitude variation of wftrad and wftrad was on average between 0 897 and 1 243

through the loughborough university data repository 1 introduction global water demand by 2050 is expected to be 1 57 times that of the year 2000 during which time the water demand of manufacturing industry is expected to increase by as much as 400 1 sharply increased water utilisation would lead to a more significant wastewater generation although there is limited data on the global amount of industrial wastewater generation and discharge it can be stated that in the eu industry is the leading polluter and that manufacturing is the single largest source of wastewater generation 2 nearly 80 of global wastewater from industry and municipal sources is directly discharged into the environment without any treatment and the situation is even worse in countries with underdeveloped economies 3 resulting in a considerable environmental burden and a hidden danger to human health as a significant water consumer and wastewater generator industry should be aware of its impact on the local environment and contribute to water sustainability a water footprint wf serves as an indicator to quantify the direct operational and indirect supply chain water consumption for a product a production process or a business it is subdivided into green wf blue wf and grey wf 4 green wf refers to the rainwater consumption during plant growth blue wf covers the volume of fresh surface water or groundwater consumed in human activities grey wf is defined as the freshwater volume required for assimilating the pollutant load in the wastewater to meet the local ambient water standards the grey wf attributed to a source is determined by the critical pollutant which is the pollutant requiring the largest degree of dilution among all pollutants in the wastewater 5 it is easier and more efficient for an industrial entity to start a water management programme by considering direct wf operational wf as they can directly control and manage the wf in their factories rather than supply chain wf operational wf is further divided into two categories wf directly related to the product production e g product ingredient cleaning heating or cooling and steaming and wf for overhead activities or facilities e g staff kitchen office transport toilet etc supporting product production wf has been widely employed as a metric to guide water management efforts in various industry sectors 5 10 however these wf studies have been carried out based on published databases and historical records consequently there will be a significant time lag between any changes made in response to the analysis and the water usage resulting in an extra but avoidable burden on local water resources one of the main obstacles to reducing this lag is that the data collection process is cumbersome to address this issue a cyber physical system cps architecture has been proposed to dynamically assess and monitor water sustainability related to manufacturing production 11 here dynamically is taken to mean the ability to measure and respond to changes on both short term and long term scales to achieve this real time measurement capability is required the proposed cps consists of the physical world production activities interfaces sensors and actuators the cyber world cloud storage cloud computing and wf monitoring and decision making support wf optimisation and water management plan smart water and wastewater sensors collect the required data directly from production activities and then automatically transmit the data to the cloud services for further classification storage wf calculation and sustainability evaluation the results from cloud computing can trigger an alarm if the calculated production wf falls out of the pre set wf range the cloud computing results are also transmitted to a real time dashboard visualisation to support visibility for management personnel of the water sustainability of operations the next step in developing the proposed cps is to identify and evaluate the feasibility of using inline technologies to act as the interfaces with the production system for instance real time data collection on the concentration of the pollutants required to calculate the grey wf such as biochemical oxygen demand bod or its proxy chemical oxygen demand cod relies on the availability of an appropriate inline sensor current practice is typically to measure cod for purposes of compliance with discharge permissions to a high degree of accuracy using sampling and offline laboratory measurement which is a time consuming procedure in principle one can obtain the grey wf variation with time by regular sampling offline chemical cod methods and data on flow volumes however this is not feasible in a real factory because of the effort involved the proposed method using an inline cod detection technique and simultaneous flow volume measurement is more viable but may be less accurate the question being addressed in this paper is whether a particular proposed inline cod technique produces sufficiently reliable results for grey wf management to answer this question comparison is made with traditional offline chemical cod measurement as the reference method using a bland altman b a plot the b a plot is a statistical method that was developed to handle this kind of question hence in this paper the development of a real time inline cod detection tool to support grey wf calculation and subsequent method comparison study based on the b a plot to evaluate its desired capability is reported this proposed inline sensing technique is expected to detect the order of magnitude variation for short time frame minutes to hours monitoring of wf and lack systematic bias in the measurement for long time frame weeks to months analysis of trends and the effect of wf reduction strategies the evaluation is carried out using samples from a beverage manufacturing plant 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the beverage manufacturing plant the selected beverage manufacturing plant for the study is located in the middle of england where various products are manufactured and bottled such as fruit cordials fruit juice sparkling drinks ginger beer etc production wastewater of this plant mainly comes from the processing room and production lines more specifically raw material washing cleaning for production hygiene and product quality checking all contribute to the production grey wf of the plant the processing room is designed to process raw materials and prepare ready to bottle beverages for the production lines processes include material washing infusion sugar dissolving syrup mixing and beverage refrigeration two production lines operate in the plant both of which contain four functional zones see fig 1 de pallet bottling pasteurisation and packing in addition checkpoints are located in the bottling pasteurisation and packing zones to guarantee product quality at each stage the bottling checkpoint procedure is to take at least one bottled beverage out of the production line every 15 min to examine its cap quality and tightness taste brix ph and temperature the pasteurisation checkpoint procedure is to take out any broken or defective bottles after pasteurisation all bottled products taken out from these two checkpoints are emptied into the drain which is the main source of high cod concentrations in the plant effluent the packing checkpoint aims to ensure that the label and package meet the requirements and no beverage waste is generated at this checkpoint in the selected plant most of the production effluent by volume comes from washing and cleaning to keep hygienic conditions for processing and production including use of clean in place cip cip is an automatic method to clean the internal surfaces of processing equipment without dismantling 12 including pre rinse caustic soda wash intermediate rinse peracetic acid paa wash and final rinse cip is utilised for cleaning tanks mixers filters and containers in the processing room and is also employed for the production lines just before the daily production begins or between the production runs of different types of products after the daily production is completed a 12 min water rinse is executed for the pipes tanks and fillers 2 2 research steps the study was conducted according to the procedures shown in fig 2 which comprised three steps 1 development of the real time inline cod detection technique 2 developed technique s application and grey wf computation and 3 method comparison study step 1 aimed to develop a real time cod detection tool by combining ultraviolet visible uv vis spectroscopy and partial least squares pls regression the employed uv vis spectroscopy refers to the absorption of radiation in the partial ultraviolet 190 nm 380 nm and visible regions 380 nm 780 nm of the electromagnetic spectrum 13 although the cod detection tool was developed with spectra obtained from offline samples in this study regression modelling with uv vis spectra is inline capable 14 15 and as such has been reported in many academic studies due to its environmentally friendly fast non destructive and reagent free nature 16 19 in this stage wastewater samples at fixed time intervals were collected from the effluent outlet of the beverage manufacturing plant the volume of wastewater generated during the periods between the times at which samples were collected was recorded simultaneously afterwards a traditional offline cod measurement and uv vis spectrum measurement for each collected sample were carried out some samples were reserved for step 2 and the remaining samples were utilised to establish regression models by pls after excluding outliers subsequently a variable selection tool moving window pls mwpls was employed to optimise the pls models then the most optimal model was selected for the next step the 2nd step was to obtain the reserved samples cod from the traditional offline chemical assay and the developed inline technique using the chosen pls model and then values of grey wf were calculated for each sample using cod values obtained from the traditional offline chemical assay and the developed inline technique and the measured wastewater volumes in step 3 a method comparison study based on the bland altman b a plot was conducted to study the agreement between the two sets of values for grey wf from step 2 a series of screening statistical tests were required before using the b a plot method which were a correlation study a normality test and a one sample t test the following sections 2 3 to 2 7 give a more detailed introduction and explanation of the methods used in the above steps 2 3 sampling and experimental procedures 2 3 1 sample collection and pre treatment all wastewater from the production lines and the processing room flows through an outlet into a buffer pit outside the plant when reaching a pre set level that triggers the pump operation the wastewater in the pit is automatically pumped out to a large storage tank onsite when the tank gets full a wastewater treatment company comes to collect it the sampling location was at the pit and the wastewater was collected from the outflow stream at the outlet mentioned above using a long probe with a receptacle attached to the end the collected samples were decanted into 350 ml pet bottles with pp caps the sample collection and transport followed the quality assurance and quality control procedures in accordance with iso 5667 14 20 and iso 5667 3 21 nine visits were made for sampling on specific production days between november 2020 and july 2021 on which elderflower cordial and elderflower sparkling drinks were bottled in production line 1 and line 2 respectively a total of 180 time series samples were collected at a time interval of 15 min a sample preservation treatment following the standard iso 15705 22 was applied to stabilise the samples once brought to the laboratory chloride test strips were utilised to test the concentration range of chloride ions cl in the samples which is required not to exceed 1000 mg l when using the iso 15705 st cod method 22 23 the results indicated that of the 180 samples the cl concentration of 158 were within 1000 mg l and 22 were over 1000 mg l the over range 22 samples were diluted by deionised water and retested for cl concentration the ph of samples was adjusted to be under 2 using sulfuric acid 5 mol l before being stored in a refrigerator at a temperature of between 2 c and 8 c 2 3 2 experimental set up and procedures the maximum turnaround time between sample collection and completion of all measurement procedures was 72 h the traditional offline cod measurement utilised commercial chemical test cuvettes lci400 hach based on iso 15705 a thermostat lt 200 hach and a portable vis spectrophotometer dr 1900 hach samples with cod exceeding the lci400 range of 1000 mg l were diluted by deionised water the actual cod values were calculated by multiplying the diluted sample cod value by its dilution factor the sample spectrum measurement was performed by a double beam uv vis spectrometer lambda 35 perkinelmer and uv winlab software perkinelmer in this study the spectral range was 190 nm 780 nm and the light path length was 10 mm 2 nm was used for the slit width the data interval of the spectrum was 1 nm and the scanning speed was 480 nm min the solution for baseline correction and reference utilised deionised water the dilution factor of the diluted samples can be set in uvwinlab software if the collected sample was diluted with a sample to water ratio of 1 20 the dilution factor of this sample was 21 then uvwinlab software provided the spectrum adjusted with the dilution factor i e the obtained spectrum was for the original sample without dilution 2 4 methods for development of real time cod detection technique 2 4 1 dataset division in principle samples used for pls regression should cover the full range of content likely to be seen in the plant effluent during regular operation as it was not feasible within the resource available to the study to carry out sufficient sampling to ensure this was the case sampling was carried out only on days when elderflower cordial and elderflower sparkling drinks were being bottled in an attempt to reduce variability in the samples the collected 180 samples were divided into two groups group a and b for different purposes samples in group a were used to develop the inline cod detection technique in step 1 as shown in fig 2 while samples in group b were reserved for grey wf calculation step 2 and the method comparison study step 3 the initial plan was to assign all 131 samples from visit 1 visit 7 to group a and all 49 samples from visit 8 visit 9 to group b however considering the content variation of wastewater samples in each visit the plan was adjusted as shown in fig 3 more detailed explanations for the content variation are provided in section 3 1 in addition to all samples in the first seven visits around 40 of samples in the last two visits i e 19 samples were added to group a to develop the tool in total 150 samples were in group a and 30 in group b in group a after removing 26 outliers the remaining 124 samples were further divided into a training dataset and a test dataset with a ratio of 70 30 i e 87 samples for model training and 37 samples for model test the training dataset was used to find the relationship between absorbance predictors and cod responses and generate a well fitted pls model with good predictive capability for new wastewater samples from the same source in this stage the number of latent variables lvs the employed variables spectral ranges and the coefficient matrix of the pls model were defined test datasets were held to assess the model s performance developed by the entire training dataset in group b 2 samples with cod values exceeding the range used for the tool s development were removed from the capability evaluation so 28 samples were finally used in the method comparison study 2 4 2 partial least squares pls in this study pls regression was applied to establish the relationship between cod and absorbance in the uv vis spectrum 190 nm 780 nm pls is a robust statistical tool correlating high dimensional predictor variables x and one or several response variables y it has been widely used in water quality measurement of river water groundwater coastal water and wastewater usually combined with different spectroscopy techniques e g uv vis spectroscopy near infrared nir spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy 24 to build the calibration a series of water samples are collected which should cover the range of variation of water contents from the source for each sample cod is measured from the hach st cod test and the relevant spectrum is obtained from the uv vis spectrometer pls regression is then applied this technique does not directly build the relationship between y and x but firstly extracts the latent variables lvs from y and x which are also called y scores u and x scores t respectively then t is used to predict u and then predicted u gives the predicted results for the related y the extracted t and u should respectively represent the most variation of x and y which means that the extracted t and u keep the information and structure of x and y to the greatest extent moreover the extracted t should have the best explanation of u i e t and u have the highest correlation 25 the pls regression model describes the relationship between y and x as shown in eq 1 1 y n m x n p b p m e n m where y n m is the response matrix with a size of n x m x n p is the predictor matrix with a size of n x p b p m is the coefficient matrix with a size of p x m and e n m is the error matrix with a size of n x m in this study each element of y is the cod value of a sample each row of x is the ordered set of absorbance measurements in the spectrum of a sample n is the number of samples utilised in the model m 1 and p is the number of spectral data points in the wavelength range used for the model matlab software was employed for the pls regression in which the wavelength range and number of lvs need to be identified the full spectrum 190 nm 780 nm was first used to establish the model global model and act as a baseline moving window pls mwpls was used for the variable selection the number of lvs was decided according to the root mean square error of cross validation rmsecv the model performance was evaluated by its correlation coefficient of training rtrn root mean square error of training rmsetrn correlation coefficient of test rtst and root mean square error of test rmsetst 2 4 3 moving window pls mwpls mwpls is an efficient variable selection tool for pls regression 26 in mwpls the wavelength window size needs to be defined which determines the number of spectral data points contained in the window then a series of pls models are successively established based on the spectral information in the window that moves from the beginning position to the end position of the whole spectrum 27 the most informative wavelength range is located according to the mwpls performance of cross validation in this study mwpls was performed by means of the algorithm contained in the itoolbox 28 and purpose written matlab code a total of 11 window sizes were investigated separately in which the window size increases sequentially from 21 to 121 at an interval of 10 there were 591 spectral points between 190 nm and 780 nm the window moved from the first point 190 nm to the last point 780 nm generating 591 spectral intervals and developing 591 models based on these intervals in the end a total of 6501 local mwpls models were developed this study used matlab code to automatically obtain the fitted local models with rmsecv better than the global model afterwards the models with rtrn or rtst below 0 7 were filtered out then the remaining models were sorted by rtst from largest to smallest finally a model was selected from the shortlist by considering rtst rmsetst and the absolute difference rmsetst rmsetrn as a percentage of rmsetrn simultaneously to find the best compromise in the mwpls function provided by itoolbox 28 it is worth noting that for the same window size the number of spectral points included in the moving window could be different which is because the window spectral range depends on the position where the moving window is with respect to the minimum or maximum wavelength in the complete spectral data set the relationship between the window size ws window s position wp and the selected spectral range in this study are described as follows for 1 w p w s 1 2 the spectral range is from the 1st spectral point to the number w p w s 1 2 point on the whole spectrum with 591 spectral points for w s 1 2 w p 591 w s 1 2 the spectral range covers the spectral points from w p w s 1 2 to w p w s 1 2 on the spectrum if 591 w s 1 2 w p 591 the spectral range selects from w p w s 1 2 to the 591st spectral point on the spectrum 2 5 method for grey wf accounting in the usual definition the wastewater in grey wf accounting refers to the effluents finally discharged into the environment which means that the grey wf can be assumed as zero if the effluents from production are adequately treated before draining into the natural water body however the grey wf calculated in this study is considered to be that of the wastewater directly from production activities before any treatment it is considered that wf calculated in this way from untreated sewage directly reflects the degree of water pollution created by production activities and consequently encourages manufacturers to find out how to decrease wastewater generation rather than rely on wastewater treatment 11 in addition wastewater treatment has an environmental burden associated with it which would increase the whole system wf if properly accounted for in this study the time interval of the grey wf of production is the same as the time interval of samples i e 15 min the grey wf with cod as the critical pollutant can be calculated by eq 2 4 2 g r e y w f l 15 m i n s c w w v w w c f w v f w c max c n a t l p c max c n a t where c w w mg l is the cod concentration of the production wastewater v w w l 15mins is the production wastewater volume generated in 15 min c f w mg l is the cod concentration of the freshwater used in production v f w l 15mins is the freshwater volume used for production in 15 min l p mg 15mins is the cod load generated from the production in 15 min c f w can be assumed as zero therefore c f w v f w can be ignored i e l p c w w v w w c max mg l is the maximum acceptable concentration of cod for the local ambient water according to the discharge limit for cod required by the uk government c max 125 mg l was used 29 c n a t mg l is the natural cod concentration in the local ambient water body generally the concentration of cod in unpolluted surface water is less than or equal to 20 mg l 30 thus c n a t 20 mg l was used for the following grey wf calculation in this study the volume of wastewater from the outlet v w w l 15mins was not directly available as no volume sensor was installed in the outlet and pit however the tank was equipped with a volume monitor sensor from which the wastewater volume in the tank can be read at every sampling event and after every pump operation then v w w l 15mins can be estimated based on the volume changes in the tank time intervals between pump operation and each sample collection and the pre set water volume that triggers pump operation the estimation premise was that the flow rate was uniform in the studied time unit the grey wf of the reserved time series samples from the last two visits were calculated based on the estimated v w w and cod from the two cod detection methods the traditional cod measurement and the developed real time cod detection method referred to as traditional grey wf wftrad and real time grey wf wfrt respectively 2 6 methods for the method comparison study bland altman b a plot the traditional methods used for performance evaluation such as correlation coefficient r and coefficient of determination r squared are not sufficient in this application 31 this is because r and r squared only indicate the correlation strength and common proportion of variance between two variables respectively thus the bland altman b a plot 32 also known as the tukey mean difference plot was employed for the method comparison study in the past decades the b a plot has been broadly applied to assess whether a new method or piece of equipment can replace a traditional one especially in the medical area 33 the classic b a method plots the difference between the two methods y axis against the average value of the two methods x axis 95 of limit of agreements loas including the upper loa and the lower loa serve as two reference lines on the y axis between which 95 of differences fall it is worth mentioning that the difference plotted on y axis in b a plot can be the absolute difference wftrad wfrt a ratio wftrad wfrt or a relative difference such as percentage difference eq 3 between the two methods 3 p e r c e n t a g e d i f f e r e n c e w f t r a d w f r t 1 2 w f t r a d w f r t 100 in this study either the ratio or percentage difference between wftrad and wfrt was considered to be more appropriate than the absolute difference for the b a plot this approach was chosen because the relative difference can provide a more objective evaluation than the absolute difference for this study where order of magnitudes variation in cod values can be expected for instance an absolute difference of 100 l 15mins between 200 l 15mins and 300 l 15mins is more striking than a difference of 100 l 15mins between 20 000 l 15mins and 20 100 l 15mins whether using the absolute difference ratio wftrad wfrt or percentage difference statistical screening tests must be applied prior to carrying out a b a plot to carry out the b a plot properly it is also necessary to check whether the difference absolute difference ratio or percentage difference changes with magnitude the averages of each measurement pair in this study spss statistics was used to conduct a linear regression on the difference and the average in which the p value coefficient and constant of the regression equation were calculated the p value is used to test the null hypothesis that there is no statistically significant difference between 0 and the coefficient of the regression line by comparing it with the default alpha level of 0 05 when the calculated p value is larger than 0 05 the null hypothesis is accepted i e the linear relationship between difference and average can be neglected in this case the b a plot uses the statistical parameters and equations eq 4 9 displayed in table 1 however if the null hypothesis is rejected i e the difference has a relationship with magnitude then logarithmic log transformations of both measurements should be subjected to regression analysis instead and then used in the b a plot if the null hypothesis can be accepted in the case where the log transformations fail a regression approach can be taken to calculate a new loa more details of this approach can be found in the literature 34 35 this study employed a more conservative eq 8 36 suggested by ludbrook 35 to calculate loas for the sample number n less than 60 instead of using eq 10 proposed by bland and altman 32 10 l o a s m e a n d i f f e r e n c e d 1 96 s t a n d a r d d e v i a t i o n s for the same reason this study applies eq 9 suggested by ludbrook 35 to calculate 95 tolerance limits tls with 95 confidence this equation includes the factor k7 obtained from the geigy scientific tables 35 36 which allows the size of n to be considered thus the 95 tls with 95 confidence for the population are adopted in this study as the preferred and most conservative parameters to indicate the interchangeability of the two methods the most significant advantage of the b a plot is simplicity and visualisation it clearly quantifies the difference distribution range and agreement degree between the two methods within the measured magnitudes at the beginning of this b a plot study a criterion was defined to determine whether the degree of agreement between wftrad and wfrt can be accepted this is that the calculated tls should imply that wfrt is able to detect at least the order of magnitude wf variation for a short time frame minutes to hours monitoring and produce a relatively accurate estimate of cumulative grey wf for long time frame weeks to months analysis of trends and the effect of wf optimisation strategies 2 7 methods for the screening analyses preparatory to the b a plot 2 7 1 correlation study the first assessment was to check how close the correlation was between wftrad and wfrt for this purpose the pearson correlation coefficient r for linear relationship strength was utilised which is defined as eq 11 37 11 r c o v x y σ x σ y where c o v x y is the covariance between two variables x and y σ x and σ y are the standard deviation of variable x and variable y respectively the range of r is between 1 and 1 if the absolute value of r equals 1 r 1 a perfect correlation between two variables is indicated i e x y r 0 reveals no correlation between the two variables 0 r 0 3 0 3 r 0 5 and 0 5 r 1 shows the correlation between the two variables is weak moderate and strong respectively 38 if r indicates a weak correlation between two variables there is no further need for an agreement study when r suggests a relatively strong correlation then performing an agreement study by the b a plot method can be considered in this study r was calculated between wftrad and wfrt by spss statistics software at the same time the p value was calculated to test the null hypothesis that the correlation between these two variables is not statistically significant when the calculated p value is larger than the chosen alpha level of 0 05 the null hypothesis is accepted i e the correlation is not statistically significant otherwise the null hypothesis is rejected i e the correlation is statistically significant 2 7 2 normality test to perform a b a plot the difference absolute difference or percentage difference or ratio between wftrad and wfrt needs to be normally distributed the well known shapiro wilk test 39 is a practical normality test for small sample sizes being applicable even for sample sizes of less than 20 it was employed in this study to check the normality of the difference using spss statistics software the null hypothesis for the test is that the tested data is from a normal distribution the objective is to accept or reject the null hypothesis by comparing the p value to the chosen alpha level of 0 05 when the calculated p value exceeds 0 05 the null hypothesis is accepted i e the tested data is from a normal distribution otherwise the null hypothesis is rejected in the case of rejection the test can be performed again for the difference between the natural logarithmic transformations of wftrad and wfrt i e ln wftrad and ln wfrt and if normality is found the natural logs would also be used for the one sample t test and b a plot 34 2 7 3 one sample t test when the difference values absolute difference or percentage difference or ratio are normally distributed the one sample t test is then performed using spss statistics software to examine the statistical significance between the mean value of difference and zero 40 41 the null hypothesis is that there is no statistical significance between them which is accepted when the p value is above 0 05 if the null hypothesis is rejected p value 0 05 it is unnecessary to use the b a plot method for the agreement study as the t test will have already indicated a fixed bias between wftrad and wfrt 3 results and discussion 3 1 uv vis spectrum measurement fig 4 shows the absorption spectra 190 nm 780 nm with dilution factors of the collected samples from every visit it can be clearly seen that the most striking absorbance variation always appears in the range of 190 nm 400 nm in all measured spectra in general cod detection utilises the wavelength range from 250 nm to 380 nm within which organic molecules absorb uv light 42 the absorbance abs range and spectrum shape vary from visit to visit which means these samples contain compounds of different types and concentrations this is because the production activities in the processing room are flexible vary daily and are not always related to the bottling schedule there could be preparation activities e g material washing infusion mixing etc for other products or cip operation for containers mixers tanks used for different solutions or other activities so that was why as stated in section 2 4 1 a portion of samples from visit 8 and visit 9 were included in group a to ensure the developed model covers the information of samples collected in the last two visits 3 2 cod experiment results table 2 summarises the essential statistical characteristics of the cod results of the training and test datasets they had similar ranges training 630 mg l 10988 mg l test 693 mg l 10659 mg l mean values training 4435 mg l test 4330 mg l and median values training 4221 mg l test 4158 mg l this indicates that the test datasets can provide an unbiased and reasonable assessment for the model fitted on the training dataset from the box plots fig 5 it is more apparent that the training dataset had a similar distribution to the test dataset the box plot shows that 75 of cod values fall in the range between the minimum and the third quartile q3 i e 630 mg l to 5943 mg l for training data and 693 mg l to 5917 mg l for test data while the remaining 25 of data falls into the whisker range between q3 and maximum i e 5943 mg l to 10988 mg l for the training dataset and 5917 mg l to 10659 mg l for the test dataset it is evident that for both datasets the cod values in the whisker range q3 to maximum have a more considerable variance than the rest of the data in the set i e the variance of the upper 25 of the data is as great as that of the other 75 for each set 3 3 pls regression results pls regression was first carried out on the full spectrum 190 nm 780 nm to establish a global model as a reference mwpls regression was then carried out from which a total of 1638 models with rmsecv better than the global model were preliminarily taken out using matlab codes only 9 out of the 1638 models produce rtrn and rtst above 0 7 finally the optimal mwpls model with 5 lvs and a spectral interval from 234 nm to 304 nm was selected based on the principle stated in section 2 4 3 this selected optimal mwpls was generated when the window window size 71 moved to the 80th window location as an illustration fig 6 displays the rmsecv of the 591 mwpls models generated for a window size of 71 the horizontal dotted line rmsecv 2406 mg l represents the rmsecv of the global model in this case there were 154 data points below the dotted line i e 154 mwpls models rmsecv were better than the global model the study did not directly select the model with the smallest rmsecv 1825 mg l at the 123rd window 277nmnm to 347 nm but further selection criteria for model stability were applied to avoid overfitting the effect of overfitting can be seen in table 3 showing that that the mwpls model based on the 123rd window had a test performance rtst 0 643 and rmsetst 2252 mg l far inferior to its training performance rtrn 0 813 and rmsetrn 1428 mg l and was therefore probably overfitted for the selected mwpls the test performances rtst 0 746 and rmsetst 1980 mg l were almost as good as that of the training rtrn 0 746 and rmsetrn 1630 mg l indicating that this model has a very low probability of overfitting and that its performance is relatively stable i e the model performance does not change significantly with different new input data it can also be seen that the chosen model has greatly improved performance compared to the global model employing the full measurement spectrum rtrn 0 274 and rtst 0 582 increased to 0 746 rmsetrn and rmsetst dropped around 31 and 8 5 to 1630 mg l and 1980 mg l separately fig 7 visualises the fitting performance of the model as a scatter plot 3 4 developed technique s application and grey wf computation the traditional offline method and the developed real time inline capable technique were used to measure the cod of the reserved 30 samples trial in group b the trial group s cod values by the traditional offline method ranged from 924 mg l to 14 847 mg l out of the range of the training dataset 630 mg l to 10 988 mg l and test dataset 693 mg l to 10 659 mg l used in developing the inline technique this is more apparent in fig 8 displaying overlapping histograms of the traditional cod of the three datasets two of the trial samples fall into the range of 13 000 mg l to 15 000 mg l which the training and test ranges do not cover accordingly these two samples were excluded from the method comparison study in section 3 5 moreover only relatively few samples of the training 8 samples and test 3 samples sets fall in the range of 8000 mg l to 11 000 mg l therefore the accuracy of the developed technique may not be guaranteed for the samples cod that fall into this range table 4 lists the wastewater volume changes δ v cod values obtained from the two methods and the calculated grey wf wftrad and wfrt the time variation of both grey wf values over the sampling period on the two visit dates is shown in fig 9 it can be seen qualitatively that the wfrt can be used to detect the general trend in wftrad the rising trend of grey wf from 13 00 on 02 07 2021 fig 9 a and 12 40 on 09 07 2021 fig 9 b was because production had finished and the water rinse cycle for the pipes tanks and fillers started in this stage the highly concentrated organic beverage that remained in the fillers and pipes was rinsed out utilising a large volume of water in fig 9 a the gaps between wftrad and wfrt at two consecutive time points 12 00 and 12 15 were unusually large where wfrt were much lower than the wftrad leading to the two methods providing an opposite wf trend between 11 45 and 12 15 it was because the developed inline technique underestimated the cod of 9912 mg l at 12 00 sample 2021 07 02 p21 and 8022 mg l at 12 15 sample 2021 07 02 p22 to be 3632 mg l and 4704 mg l respectively two possible reasons for the discrepancy can be identified as stated at the beginning of this section the samples used in the technique development were relatively few in the range of 8000 mg l to 11 000 mg l moreover the sampling day of 02 07 2021 was during the elderflower harvest season wastewater from elderflower infusion such as infusion tank rinsing around noon also contributed to the higher cod value however this operation was not covered in the previous sampling visits it can also be seen that wfrt was lower than the wftrad at 10 45 on 02 07 2021 sample 2021 07 02 p16 and 12 55 on 09 07 2021 sample 2021 07 09 p23 these are the samples which as previously stated have levels of cod outside of the training range and are excluded from the following comparison study 3 5 method comparison study for these two methods 3 5 1 screening tests preparatory to bland and altman b a plot correlation study calculation using spss statistics returned the result of the pearson correlation study for wftrad and wfrt in which r 0 661 and p value 0 001 as 0 5 r 1 this indicates that they have a strong correlation the p value was much lower than 0 05 so the null hypothesis that the correlation was not statistically significant was rejected i e the correlation between wftrad and wfrt was statistically significant thus the b a plot can be employed to explore the agreement between wftrad and wfrt further normality test as highlighted in section 2 6 the ratio wftrad wfrt or percentage difference between wftrad and wfrt was preferred for this b a plot study from fig 10 it is apparent that the ratio wftrad wfrt was not normally distributed but the percentage difference between wftrad and wfrt was normally distributed which was further verified by the shapiro wilk test the test result for the ratio wftrad wfrt showed that the p value was 0 001 i e far below 0 05 thus the null hypothesis of tested data was from a normal distribution was rejected by contrast the p value of the percentage difference was 0 565 exceeding 0 05 and then the null hypothesis in this case was accepted therefore the b a plot utilised the percentage difference between wftrad and wfrt referred to as diff although the ratio cannot be directly used in the b a plot eq 12 enables the conversion between the percentage difference diff and ratio wftrad wfrt 12 r a t i o 200 d i f f 200 d i f f one sample t test the results of the one sample t test for diff showed that the p value sig was 0 5 greater than 0 05 so the null hypothesis of no statistical significance between mean diff and zero was accepted in this case a b a plot can be carried out further to study the agreement between the two wf methods 3 5 2 bland and altman b a plot the average of each measurement pair for each trial sample i e wfrt wftrad referred to as avg was plotted on the x axis of the b a plot with diff of each pair plotted on the y axis spss was used to conduct linear regression for the plot to check whether there is a dependence of diff on avg the best fit line is described by eq 13 13 d i f f 16 229 0 001 a v g as the calculated p value of 0 168 was greater than 0 05 the null hypothesis that there is no statistically significant difference between 0 and the coefficient 0 001 was accepted i e the slope of the regression line can be taken to be 0 meaning that there is no systematic bias in diff therefore the statistical parameters required by the b a plot can be calculated using the equations shown in table 1 accordingly the calculated mean diff d 95 limits of agreement loas 95 confidence interval ci of d and 95 tolerance limits tls with 95 confidence are listed in table 5 in addition the corresponding ratios are also presented in the same table the implications of the b a plot fig 11 are discussed in the following paragraphs to give further insight into the relationship between the two methods the y axis values from the b a plot including the statistical parameters have been transformed to the ratio wftrad wfrt using eq 12 and plotted in fig 12 in fig 11 the first parameter to examine is the mean diff d 5 4 with 95 ci highlighted as the shaded areas with dark grey from 10 8 to 21 6 i e with 95 confidence that the true value of diff is between 10 8 and 21 6 the corresponding view in fig 12 shows that the mean ratio between wftrad and wfrt was 1 056 with on average the value of the ratio being between 0 897 and 1 243 importantly the line of equality diff 0 or ratio 1 was within the ci of d which also verified no statistical significance between mean diff and zero from the previous one sample t test if the ci of d does not include the line of equality the conclusion can be drawn that there is a systematic difference fixed bias between methods i e the measured value of one method is always higher or lower than that of the other method 31 the purpose of the b a plot is to visualise the relationship between the distribution of diff and the 95 loas the 95 loas are shown as the blue dash dot lines in fig 11 ranging from 82 0 lower loa to 92 8 upper loa within which 95 of values of diff should fall i e the diff between the two methods is expected to be within 82 0 92 8 in 95 of cases for the 28 trial samples in this study 27 diff values around 96 4 fell within the range the corresponding ratios in fig 12 show that the corresponding expectation for the ratio wftrad to wfrt is 0 418 2 731 as mentioned before the tls are the preferred and most conservative parameters to indicate the interchangeability of the two wf methods thus the 95 tls with 95 confidence for the population have a more extensive range than loas in fig 11 the tls are shown as two grey dash lines where the covered area is shaded by light grey ranging from 102 6 lower tl to 113 4 upper tl it indicates that there is 95 confidence that 95 of the value of diff for any future measurement of wfrt and wftrad will be between 102 6 and 113 4 this corresponds to wftrad being 0 322 to 3 621 times wfrt the implications of this conclusion for the suitability of the developed inline technique for measuring grey wf are discussed in section 4 4 implications of the method comparison study results for use of the developed inline technique the method comparison study results indicate that this real time method is suitable for use in two ways for water management and improving water sustainability short term minutes to hours monitoring and long term weeks to months optimisation 4 1 short term monitoring it is asserted that in selecting a technique suitable for wf management a high level of accuracy can be sacrificed for the advantages of dynamic measurement and that the ability to detect wf variations within an order of magnitude is sufficient for the short time frame minutes to hours management of wf the b a plot has shown that wf can be determined within a factor of 0 322 3 621 using the proposed inline technique this is sufficient to detect abnormal changes in wf such as the grey wf increasing sharply within a short time going far out of the pre determined range of acceptability of wf or staying at a high level for a long time abnormal changes in grey wf may reflect something going wrong in production one example is that the conductivity sensors installed in pipes of the cip system malfunction which can lead to a premature discharge of caustic soda or paa which should have been recycled and reused into the effluent system the associated abnormal change of grey wf would be detected and staff would be alerted to check find and address the root causes of the change another example in beverage manufacturing plants is when machine malfunctions lead to defective packaged beverages e g the fillers fail to fill the bottle to the pre set volume or cappers are damaged or fail to apply caps appropriately defective beverage products will be emptied and drained into the effluent system at the checkpoints which rapidly and considerably raises the cod concentration of the production wastewater leading to a sharply increased grey wf the frequency of abnormal changes that appears during the grey wf monitoring represents the malfunction rate of these machines providing a tool for process and machine health monitoring and water management 4 2 long term optimisation the lack of systematic bias seen in this developed real time method wfrt indicates that a relatively accurate estimate of cumulative grey wf can be obtained over the long term the grey wf obtained from wfrt will be within a factor of 0 897 1 243 times the real value that could be expected if a programme of frequent wet chemical method measurements of cod were to be possible and undertaken thus wfrt is suitable for a long time frame weeks to months analysis of trends and the effect of wf reduction strategies it s worth noting that the traditional grey wf accounting method is not suitable for this due to the limited sampling frequency and sample size and time consuming nature of laboratory analysis consequently it is unable to effectively sample the nature and volume of wastewater generated from a manufacturing plant the wastewater flow generally depends on production schedule and so may vary irregularly on time scales of hours to minutes especially where a plant produces various products and has multiple production lines dynamic wf monitoring can enable companies to comprehensively understand water utilisation and wastewater generation in their production then wf can be optimised by the pdca cycle plan do check adjust 44 moreover the pdca cycle can be combined with a simulation model of the production facility to test different what if scenarios allowing testing of strategies without disturbing the current manufacturing system significantly reducing the time cost and risk of the implementation of new strategies 44 45 wf optimisation strategies should consider reduction of town water usage wastewater generation reduction and pollutant reduction reduction of water usage can start with identifying opportunities for reduction in the water required for processes for water reuse and for water recycling 46 47 examples of water reduction are preventing over cleaning in the cip by employing real time monitoring sensor techniques 48 lowering the flow rate for floor cleaning avoiding high pressure water unless necessary and replacing an outdated machine that consumes overmuch water water reuse can involve employing the degraded water from bottle rinse or raw materials washing for other activities with low water quality requirements such as floor cleaning truck washing etc moreover water from bottle rinse or other processes can be recovered treated and then used for other purposes such as cooling towers hot wells pasteurisers etc all approaches used in water saving also lessen wastewater discharge in addition to the quantity reduction of water use and wastewater discharge decreasing pollutants in the wastewater from its source is also critical to grey wf optimisation the pollutant source and types vary by industry for the food and beverage manufacturing industry pollutants mainly are organic matters from remnant food or beverages on processing equipment or floors and remaining or spent detergent from all kinds of cleaning to maintain hygienic conditions resulting in a high concentration of bod and cod for instance changing food processing methods or ingredients in a food manufacturing plant may reduce the remaining food in a cooking tank resulting in less organic matter in the cleaning effluents minimising detergent amounts in the cleaning processes such as minor adjustments for the cip system in the initial rinse time detergent solution conductivity final rinse time and detergent recovery values can significantly reduce the water consumption detergent consumption and effluent discharge 49 4 3 research contributions as pointed out in the introduction conventional wf studies look at average wf value over a period of years by analysing data from published databases and historical records 6 8 9 as also pointed out this approach does not strongly support practical interventions by individual supply chain actors because of the time lags and effort involved in collecting the data this research has shown that the proposed cps system 11 using an optical detection method can support continuous wf monitoring and therefore provide the required practical tool for an active approach to wf reduction an additional contribution is related to the fact that in most wf studies 7 8 50 supply chain wf generally received more attention than operational wf these studies exemplify the general tendency in the literature to concentrate on supply chain wf rather than operational wf this tendency occurs because the former is much higher than the latter especially for the food and beverage manufacturing industry where the dominant wf is from the crop raising phase in agriculture while such studies are useful for identifying supply chain hot spots for wf generation they are less helpful in identifying potential operational changes to reduce wf by individual actors and resolving any effects of such changes within a reasonable time frame the optical detection method verified in this study can support the proposed cps system 11 to remedy this lack in operational wf studies reported in the literature 7 50 52 while the definition of grey wf used nominally quantifies the impacts caused by the effluents finally discharged into the environment the assumption is adopted that grey wf can be neglected on the grounds that the operational effluent would be treated to meet emission standards onsite or by a downstream wastewater treatment plant however no matter which wastewater treatment is employed they all have an invisible wf and burden on the environment due to the energy materials and water consumption during the treatment processes given that avoiding waste is better than treating it the lack of attention to this invisible environmental burden cannot help industrial actors trace the roots of pollution roots or encourage them to reduce the wf caused by wastewater at its source rather than rely on wastewater treatment this study addresses this gap by proposing a different view of attributing grey wf to wastewater at source and so providing data helpful in managing untreated wastewater directly from production related activities 4 4 research limitations and future work this study likely represents a worst performance of the method for real time monitoring of wf than might be achievable in practice this is due to the limitations of the study i e the real time cod detection tool and its performance in the method comparison study are limited by the relatively small number of samples used in the pls regression this in turn is a result of the amount of effort required to manually collect the samples better performance could be achieved if more samples were collected to cover as wide a range as possible of production conditions for elderflower cordial and elderflower sparkling future development of this industrial system would see the use of inline in situ optical sensor devices to measure the required uv vis spectra which could rapidly gather a much larger data set and permit improved regression models for better performance the conclusions reached in the present study warrant further and wider investigation of the potential of the method for real time wf monitoring for example the main pollutants and the most critical pollutant of effluent vary by industry for the beverage industry the main pollutants are types of organic matter the grey wf calculation in this study assumes that cod is the critical pollutant more water quality parameters related to organic matter such as total organic carbon toc could also be measured and used in the grey wf calculation then the final grey wf would be determined by the pollutant with the most significant grey wf among all pollutants in the wastewater 5 conclusion sharp global increases in industrial water demand and wastewater generation put an enormous burden on water sustainability in a previous study a proposed cps was described which could enable an industrial actor to dynamically manage water sustainability the system requires appropriate real time inline techniques to support data collection for wf monitoring and management this paper evaluated the capability of a real time inline capable cod monitoring technique to fulfil this role the inline tool was developed utilising pls regression applied to uv vis spectroscopy with samples of wastewater obtained from a beverage factory mwpls was employed to optimise the pls model by selecting the most effective and informative spectral interval the mwpls model selected has 5 lvs based on a spectral interval of 234 nm 304 nm of which the rtrn 0 746 rtst 0 746 rmsetrn 1630 mg l and rmsetst 1980 mg l the selected model serving as a cod detection tool was applied to calculate the grey wf associated with production activities in the beverage manufacturing plant the traditional offline cod measurement method was also employed for the grey wf calculation acting as a reference method then a method comparison study employing a bland and altman b a plot was carried out to check the agreement between wftrad reference method and wfrt developed method the results showed that wftrad was between 0 418 and 2 731 times wfrt in 95 of the cases for the 28 samples in the study following statistical analysis of the sampling error and variance in the underlying population it was calculated that there is 95 confidence that 95 of wftrad was between 0 322 and 3 621 times wfrt for both the current set and underlying population of samples it was argued that the ability of wfrt to detect the order of magnitude variation in grey wf is sufficient for short time frame minutes to hours monitoring of wf i e a high level of accuracy can be sacrificed for the advantages of real time measurement there was also observed to be no fixed bias between wftrad and wfrt and wftrad was on average between 0 897 and 1 243 times wfrt indicating a relatively accurate estimate of cumulative grey wf can be obtained over the long term it was considered that this is sufficient for a long time frame weeks to months analysis of trends and the effect of wf optimisation strategies it is concluded that this proposed inline cod technique is a promising candidate to support the previously proposed cps for dynamic grey wf management in the manufacturing industry production such a system would provide a practical tool for individual actors in a supply chain to address the impact of water use on the environment this contrasts with the current approach reported in the literature which is dependent on databases and surveys and tends to concentrate on supply chain related impact not operational impact in addition a modified grey wf

funding acquisition project administration 1 introduction water resources are of utmost importance in a world facing challenges such as the population growth the climate change and the increasing need for water in agriculture and industry however the disposal of contaminants and the scarce effectiveness of water treatment to eliminate a number of harmful substances can result in reduced water quality and damage to aquatic environment but also to humans the removal of highly toxic pollutants such as dyes phenolic compounds metals pesticides and drugs detected not only in wastewaters but also in surface and even drinking water is a challenge since the conventional methods used in treatment plants do not allow their elimination 1 the textile industry faces a serious environmental concern the amount and the chemical load of water discharged water is used as the principal medium for removing impurities applying dyes and finishing agents although dyestuffs do not represent a significant load compared to other substances used in the process they cause the colour of the effluent and this poses environmental concerns since high doses may reduce light exposure to aquatic photosynthetic organisms besides the textile sector the use of dyes has been incorporated to many industrial processes around 20 of global water pollution comes from dyeing and finishing textile products 2 anthraquinone and phthalocyanine dyes are widely employed as the primary or secondary compounds in commercial trichromatic dyeing formulations 3 nevertheless there is significantly less research devoted to the treatment of anthraquinones compared to azo compounds 4 acid blue 80 ab80 an anionic anthraquinone dye with two sulfonate groups has special relevance because of its widespread use besides textile industry it is used in paper chemicals and dyes inks and toners leather treatment products polymers cosmetics and personal care products washing and cleaning products biocides among others this substance is registered under the reach regulation and the manufactured or imported volume to europe is in the range 10 100 tonnes per annum 5 this compound due to its multi ring aromatic structure is rather stable which can potentially lead to accumulations in the environment and cause long lasting harmful effects to aquatic life concentrations of 10 100 mg l may cause acute toxicity to aquatic organisms 6 that is why it is critical to develop methods to remove this compound from wastewaters there is intensive research in the topic of dye removal which includes a wide variety of methods ranging from more conventional approaches like filtration precipitation coagulation or adsorption to more sophisticated ones like photooxidation ozonation or biological treatments 7 8 all these methods applied to textile wastewaters have their own advantages and disadvantages chemical ones like oxidation or ozonation are very specific but give rise to by products such as sludges caused by chemical coagulation biological ones not adequate for most textile wastewaters may not be effective for all dyes and require elaborate enzymatic productions and physicochemical ones show good removal but tend to be expensive and the materials are often difficult to regenerate 7 adsorption stands out because of its efficient ability to cut down hazardous pollutants present in effluents 9 with this method compounds from a liquid or gaseous phase can be extracted by adhesion to the solid surface of the adsorbent this adhesion can occur via electrostatic van der waals or chemical interactions among the main advantages it requires a relatively simple operating procedure while offering a broad range of applicability for many pollutants like heavy metals or dyes 10 that is why in the textile industry it is common practice to use for example commercial activated carbon as an adsorbent however ongoing work intends to find environmentally friendly substitutes that optimize the cost while maintaining efficiency employing biomass substrates or agricultural and industrial byproducts 11 15 this approach would allow improving solid waste management one of the present issues to be addressed in preserving a healthy environment 10 combination of different methods is usually needed to address the treatment of textile wastewaters owing to the high variability of the effluent characteristics and the chemical nature of the different colourants for example the adsorption process can be combined with membrane systems such as nanofiltration 7 metallic catalysts have been employed to provide an adsorption surface where the dyes can be degraded photochemically 16 indeed the demand for simpler and greener adsorbents keeps rising that is the case of chitosan a natural adsorbent that is a cheap and eco friendly alternative 8 17 this abundant polymer is being widely studied as a biosupport to synthesize adsorbent materials the large number of protonated amine nh3 and deprotonated hydroxyl o functional groups along the linear cationic polysaccharide provide high availability of active sites hence it has an excellent adsorption ability and also a tuneable structure promoting physical chemical and or electrostatic bonds and allowing modifications that could improve the adsorption properties a variety of additives have been used to modify chitosan and form composites or hybrid materials and more recently an increasing number of papers deal with combining chitosan with carbon based materials 1 up to date scarce studies describe the combination of chitosan with deep eutectic solvents dess in the preparation of new materials for dye adsorption dess are chemicals resulting from the combination of two or more compounds in their pure states a compound acting as hydrogen bond donor hbd and other compound as hydrogen bond acceptor hba mixed in specific molar ratios that lead to the formation of hydrogen bonds and van der waals interactions between them and resulting in a decrease in their respective melting temperature thus obtaining a solvent in liquid state at wide temperature ranges 18 dess are simple to synthesize and offer benefits such as cost effectiveness most of them are non toxic and biodegradable and could be the substitutes for ionic liquids ils and organic sovents in extraction processes 19 but have been scarcely used for dyes removal 18 combinations of des with polymers offer a promising alternative to obtain eco friendly adsorbents with enhanced capacity to remove dyes and other pollutants from wastewaters 19 22 in this study we have developed alternative adsorbents by modifying chitosan beads through impregnation with a des choline chloride urea in a molar ratio 1 2 to improve adsorption capacity of chitosan our objective was to modify the chitosan surface by attaching different functional groups acting as chelating sites such as carbonyl functional groups and provide a better performance as a dye adsorbent as well as recovery and reutilization we have prepared characterized and assayed three chitosan based adsorbents unmodified chitosan beads un ch des modified chitosan feo beads ch feo des following a procedure already described 23 and des modified chitosan beads ch des as new sorbent and we have compared the removal of the colourant acid blue 80 obtained by the different adsorbents at the same experimental conditions further optimization was carried out focused on the best adsorption efficiencies the effects of contact time adsorbent dose initial dye concentration adsorption

unmodified chitosan beads unmodified chitosan beads un ch were prepared by ionic cross linking procedure between opposite charges as described by others 23 chitosan was dissolved in acetic acid 2 v v in the proportion 40 g l and it was mixed for at least 24 h at 60 c until a homogenous gel was formed beads were obtained by dropping the gel solution into a volume of naoh 2 5 m with a glass syringe the beads stayed in the naoh solution overnight and were exhaustively washed with tap water to eliminate excess of naoh and rinsed with distilled water until ph was in the range 6 7 finally they were dried at room temperature 2 2 2 des modified chitosan beads des preparation choline chloride urea in molar ratio 1 2 were mixed and heated at 80 c under constant stirring until a clear liquid was formed the liquid was left to cool at room temperature des modified chitosan beads ch des were prepared as follows the same procedure was followed to elaborate the chitosan beads and soon after washing step water was removed with filter paper and immediately beads were mixed with freshly prepared des in a proportion 1 1 w w and stirred under vacuum at 60 c overnight and let stay 24 h then they were washed and dried at room temperature 2 2 3 des modified chitosan feo beads the chitosan gel was prepared as described above a procedure of synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles by co precipitation was applied as described by patiño ruiz et al 2020 23 in brief about 250 ml of fecl3 6h2o 0 52 m and fecl2 4h2o 0 26 m were mixed and heated 80 c under continuous stirring 120 rpm and ph was adjusted to 10 by adding naoh 1 m dropwise then it was stirred for 1 h the black precipitate was collected and washed several times with distilled water and finally with ethanol and dried at 70 c for 24 h the magnetic feo particles were added to chitosan gel 1 2 mass ratio mixed for 1 h and sonicated for 30 min at room temperature the beads of chitosan feo were formed as described above and to prepare des modified chitosan feo beads ch feo des after washing excess water was removed with filter paper and beads were mixed with freshly prepared des proportion 1 1 w w vacuum was applied

range 3 11 the samples were shaken for 16 h and final ph were registered the point of zero charges were obtained from the plot of δph against initial ph 2 4 adsorption experiments dye solutions were prepared by weight in the range 25 250 mg l the solutions were used without modification of ph the experiment series testing the ph effect required previous ph adjustment and the solutions were adjusted to ph 3 5 6 8 and 10 with naoh 0 1 m or hcl 0 1 m alternatively batch adsorption experiments were carried out varying the different conditions adsorbent dosage 0 005 0 035 g initial dye

carried out at various conditions of adsorbent dosage initial dye concentration ph and temperature as indicated in table 1 the ph of all the solutions was measured at the beginning of the experiment and at the end with a ph meter hanna model hi5221 the volume of the solutions was maintained at 5 ml in all the experiments the variation in the dye concentration was determined by absorbance data obtained at a wavelength of 626 nm using a uv vis spectrometer jasco v 750 a preliminary screening of the three adsorbents with ab80 dye was carried out at the following conditions ratio adsorbent mass dye solution volume was fixed at 5 g l the initial dye concentration was 100 mg l the temperature was 25 c and the contact time 6 h the best adsorbent was selected for further study of adsorption

components used to elaborate them chitosan as raw material and chitosan beads un ch beads exhibit broad bands at 3352 and 3294 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of n h and oh functional groups at 2875 2920 cm 1 the bands correspond to stretching vibration of c h bonds in ch ch2 and ch3 groups the bands around 1025 and 1059 cm 1 are attributed to c o c and c oh stretching vibrations respectively associated with the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups in the chitosan structure the characteristic bands observed at 1645 and 1592 cm 1 indicating stretching vibration of co and bending of n h in amide groups are representative of primary amine of highly deacetylated chitosan for amide i conh2 and ii n h respectively the appearance of amide i groups has been mainly attributed to the cross linking process in the formation of ionic interactions and hydrogen bonding with the acetic acid 23 regarding choline chloride characteristic bands observed are the corresponding to stretching vitrations of n h bonds at 3219 3006 3026 cm 1 the bands at 1413 1481 cm 1 that may be assigned to alkyl groups bending of aliphatic c h groups or n h vibrations in quaternary ammonium groups bands within the range of 1480 1390 cm 1 36 bands within the range 1200 880 cm 1 especially the band at 953 cm 1 corresponding to asymmetric c n stretching vibration and bands 2854 2951 cm 1 assigned to alkyl groups stretching vibrations of c h bond in ch2 and ch3 urea shows the main bands at 3425 3326 cm 1 assigned to asymmetric n h stretching vibration of nh2 groups at 3228 3254 cm 1 assigned to symmetric n h stretching vibration of nh2 groups at 1674 cm 1 assigned to stretching vibration of co in amide group conh2 amide i band 1587 cm 1 assigned to bending of n h bond in nh2 groups amide ii band and finally 1459 and 1147 assigned to asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration of n c n bonds respectively 37 concerning deep eutectic solvent chcl urea 1 2 a broadening of the bands in the 3500 3000 cm 1 region is observed probably caused by the formation of hydrogen bonds between hydrogen bond acceptor hba and hydrogen bond donnor hbd then bands at 3388 and 3314 cm 1 can be assigned to stretching vibration of n h and o h bonds and at 3256 and 3187 cm 1 can be assigned to stretching vibration of n h in addition co stretching vibration band of amide group conh has shifted to lower frequencies 1660 cm 1 compared to urea at 1674 cm 1 similar findings have been reported by jakubowska et al 2020 for des chcl malonic acid 1 1 36 then the interaction between the components in des causing the decrease in melting point of the mixture chcl urea can be confirmed by the changes in ftir spectra results from ftir analysis show spectral differences between des modified chitosan beads and unmodified chitosan beads fig 2 indicating possible attachment of the functional groups chitosan showed two bands in the region 1500 1700 cm 1 where the stretching vibration of co and bending of n h bonds of amide occur present in urea and also in chitosan in this region 3 bands can be clearly observed now in des modified chitosan beads a band at 1550 cm 1 arises with high intensity and this new band together with the 1600 cm 1 band are more intense as des concentrations increase in des modified beads data not shown this new band at 1550 cm 1 and the band at 1600 cm 1 could be also assigned to bending of n h bonds of amide and nh2 groups in addition the band at 1646 cm 1 in the chitosan beads stretching vibration of co of amide i group slightly shifts to 1649 cm 1 in chitosan des beads and a significant increase in the area under this peak can be observed in ch des beads compared to ch beads indicating that this band is being contributed by other co band corresponding to urea from the des this change confirms the attaching of des molecules to chitosan beads since the intensity of the bands would reflect a rise of n h and co groups coming from the urea in des a new peak at around 1750 cm 1 can be observed although it is a small band and may correspond to co stretching vibration in carboxylic groups characteristic of hbd urea this band was also observed in mixtures of chitosan with des chcl malonic acid 1 1 36 other regions that might show a change in the intensity or shape of the spectral bands are the region 1400 1500 cm 1 bending of aliphatic c h bonds and asymmetric stretching vibration of c n bond in urea and to a lower extent in the region 850 770 cm 1 symmetric stretching vibration of c n bonds in chcl there s also a change in the band around 3200 cm 1 more defined in des modified adsorbents and assigned to stretching vibration of n h the spectra of des modified chitosan feo ch feo des beads reflects changes in the same bands as described above for ch des beads however these changes occur at a lower intensity the typical bands described for magnetite fe3o4 at 531 cm 1 corresponding to stretching vibration of fe o are observed in our feo particles however it is not detected in the ch feo des beads and only a very slight increase in the intensity was registered in the adsorbent then feo particles incorporated in the ch feo des beads were negligible in the adsorbent surface 3 1 2 scanning electron microscopy sem fig 3 shows the morphology of the adsorbents un ch ch des and ch feo des obtained by scanning electron microscopy sem the beads are spherical ovoid in all cases fig s2 the average diameter size was 965 7 948 5 and 1088 6 μm respectively un ch shows a smooth area with some minor cavities on the surface by contrast ch des shows areas with smooth surface and areas with rougher surface exhibiting more cavities and small pores ch feo des shows protuberances distributed along the beads smooth surface and the feo nanoparticles are visible only on those particular spots 3 1 3 brunauer emmett teller bet and barrett joyner halenda bjh analysis the surface area volume and pore size of the beads were determined by the brunauer emmett teller bet and barrett joyner halenda bjh analysis results are shown in table 2 the porosity was very low in the three adsorbents the small pore volume and pore size of the beads used in our work were similar to the chitosan beads prepared by others 23 or slightly higher 20 as well as the size of the beads slightly higher values of pore volume and pore size were observed in ch feo des beads probably owing to the presence of feo nanoparticles however their distribution on the beads surface seems to be restricted to scarce single spots as commented above fig 3 3 2 preliminary screening and selection of the best adsorbent dye fig 4 shows the ab80 adsorption data obtained after testing the three different adsorbents at an initial ab80 concentration of 100 mg l and ratio adsorbent mass dye solution volume of 5 g l the ch des beads adsorb the dye ab80 at a relatively high rate in comparison with the remaining tested beads a sharp increase in the adsorption during the first 30 min of the experiment is exhibited in contrast to the smoother adsorbance increase shown by un ch and ch feo des afterwards ch des adsorption continues to increase more moderately until the adsorption capacity achieves 19 6 mg g at 120 min with 95 9 removal from water from this moment after a slight increase in removal up to the maximum values 99 3 removal from water the ch des adsorption process reaches the equilibrium state the sharp increase in the removal rate and adsorption capacities during the initial stage of the experiment could be due to the fast diffusion on the surface and formation of a film onto the ch des beads with a higher number of binding sites functional groups attached during des modification of chitosan beads than the other assayed adsorbents un ch and ch feo des show a similar adsorption rate with a faster adsorption by ch feo des beads reaching the maximum capacity and the equilibrium state at 300 min with a removal rate of 91 5 and adsorption of 18 2 mg g and later at 360 min in the adsorbent un ch with similar removal and adsorption values 89 7 and 17 7 mg g respectively the ch des beads adsorption capacity at equilibrium reaches a maximum value 19 6 mg g higher than ch des feo and un ch 18 2 and 17 7 mg g respectively and faster at 120 min compared to 300 and 360 min respectively when used with the dye ab80 then the more efficient ab80 adsorbent ch des was selected for further study of adsorption equilibrium and kinetics 3 3 factors affecting the adsorption process 3 3 1 adsorbent dose the adsorbent dosage effect on the removal percentage and adsorption of ab80 in aqueous solution was tested to obtain the optimal dosage providing the best performance at the lowest adsorbent spent fig 5 shows the results obtained at increasing doses of adsorbent ch des beads more removal rate is obtained while the adsorption capacity per unit weight adsorbent decreases the surface area of adsorbent increases when higher adsorbent quantity is used so the availability of active binding sites on the adsorbent allows a higher removal efficiency the most efficient dose to our objectives was 0 015 g of adsorbent per 5 ml of ab80 solution of an initial concentration of 100 mg l since the removal achieves the maximum value and the equilibrium state at higher adsorbent doses there was no further increase in the dye removal this finding can be attributed to a screening effect at increasing adsorbent doses due to accumulation of adsorbent particles and the decrease in the distance between them binding sites for ab80 molecules might be hidden by coacervates on the adsorbent surface furthermore adsorbent overlap leads to competition among ab80 molecules for a limited number of available binding sites and increased diffusion path length resulting in a decrease in the adsorption rate 38 40 3 3 2 initial dye concentration and contact time the effect of contact time and initial concentrations of ab80 on the removal efficiency of ch des beads are shown in fig 6 it can be seen that during the first step of the adsorption process the adsorption was very fast and then it continued to increase more gradually during a second step to finally achieve an equilibrium state where no more adsorption takes place the duration of each stage and the dye elimination rate is dependent on the initial ab80 concentration of the solutions at the lowest ab80 concentration 25 mg l the elimination rate is very sharp during the first 60 min and it continues to increase at a lower rate the next 30 min until equilibrium is reached within the first 90 min at increasing concentrations the rate of dye elimination is especially sharp the first 60 min and the subsequent increase in the removal is more moderate the higher the dye initial concentration the lower the dye removal rate fig 6 consistently the equilibrium state is reached at different times and the dye removal achieves different efficiencies depending on the initial concentration the more ab80 initial concentration the more duration of the process until the equilibrium is achieved and the lower the removal efficiency the ab80 removal percentage reached 98 100 at initial concentrations of 25 100 mg l within 5 h more time was needed at higher initial concentrations about 8 h to reach 93 150 mg l 80 200 mg l and up to 10 15h to reach 71 250 mg l the rapid removal rate at the beginning of the process could be explained by the high availability of active adsorption sites on the beads surface the surface diffusion of the dye molecules onto the adsorbent through the solution that occurs at the first stage is influenced by the concentration of the dye solution and the agitation and time 41 the lower removal at higher initial dye concentrations may be explained by the mass transfer resistance between the adsorbate and adsorbent caused by the increase in the concentration gradient the sites become occupied by the dye molecules and cause an increase in the time of contact between adsorbate and adsorbent and repulsion forces increase between the adsorbed dye and the dye molecules in the liquid phase 42 the adsorption capacity increased very fast at the beginning of the process the higher the initial ab80 concentration the faster the increase and the higher the adsorption value achieved fig s3 this may be explained by the concentration gradient increase with the increasing dye concentration that would compensate the mass transfer resistance between the adsorbate and adsorbent 42 the adsorption capacity values found were 8 25 16 80 33 95 46 39 52 91 and 58 39 mg g for ab80 concentrations of 25 50 100 150 200 and 250 mg l respectively at 25 c and ph 7 3 3 3 temperature the influence of the temperature on the removal of ab80 by ch des beads was tested the adsorption experiments were carried out at 25 35 and 45 c a slight increase in dye removal up to 2 can be observed when the temperature rises from 25 to 35 c probably due to an increase in the diffusion rate by contrast a decrease was registered when the temperature rises from 35 to 45 c when the initial dye concentrations were 150 200 and 250 mg l fig s4 a removal decrease of around 10 was observed at 45 c in the mentioned solutions the decrease in dye removal at increasing temperatures indicates that the adsorption process is exothermic these observations could be explained by the desorption of the adsorbed ab80 molecules caused by the destruction of adsorption forces that were responsable for the elimination of adsorption interactions between active sites of the beads and the dye molecules 42 as a consequence the best temperature for adsorption in this case is 25 c 3 3 4 ph the binding of dye molecules onto adsorbents is affected by the ph since the degree of dissociation and or ionization of dye molecules and the adsorbent surface is influenced by this parameter the functional groups occurring in the adsorbent such as amine and hydroxyl groups are affected by the ph of the dye solution as reported 43 fig s5 shows the influence of the initial ph value on the removal of ab80 by ch des beads the ph effect was tested at a ph range of 3 5 10 the initial concentration of ab80 was 100 mg l and the dye removal was tested at 219 min the removal percentage was higher at lower ph at ph 3 5 100 of ab80 was removed while at the highest ph tested ph 10 the removal was the lowest 83 at intermediate ph values lower than 7 the removal was higher than 95 the adsorption of ab80 onto the ch des beads was affected by ph with a decrease above ph 7 this observation agrees with the obtained point of zero charge phpzc 6 98 for ch des beads fig s6 at ph lower than phpzc the adsorbent is positively charged then at acidic conditions amine groups of adsorbent were protonated and the negative sulfonate ions of ab80 were probably adsorbed by electrostatic attraction explaining the highest removal efficiency at ph 3 5 43 the decrease in removal with increasing ph from 3 5 to 7 might be due to the reduction in the amount of protonated amino groups on the adsorbent leading to a decreasing electrostatic attraction between the dye molecules and the ch des beads at phs higher than 6 98 ch des beads are negatively charged so the adsorption capacity decreases at a higher rate owing to repulsions between the anionic dye and the adsorbent surface it has been reported that the ph of the dyeing discharge from textile industry generally ranges from 9 to 11 44 although lower the ch des beads efficiency was significant at ph 10 83 ab80 removal 3 4 adsorption kinetic models adsorption kinetics brings information to understand the adsorption process the potential controlling steps and the adsorption mechanism the literature provides a lot of studies applying different adsorption kinetic models for removal of dyes molecules using chitosan based adsorbents such as first order kinetic pseudo second order kinetic intraparticle diffusion and elovich 8 the adsorption of ab80 on ch des beads was studied under different initial concentrations to investigate the most appropriate adsorption kinetics model the pseudo second order fig 7 pseudo first order elovich and intraparticle diffusion weber morris model figs s7 s9 kinetics linear graphs were represented linear plots of ln qe qt vs t t qt vs t qt vs ln t and qt vs t1 2 respectively were used to obtain the values table 3 shows the adsorption kinetic parameters k1 k2 k3 qe i β and α corresponding to the different models calculated using the linear plots together with the parameter r2 the linear fit and regression coefficient values obtained for the studied kinetic models point at the pseudo second order fig 7 as the more suitable model throughout all the ab80 concentrations there is also good agreement between the values of calculated qe pseudo second order and the experimental qe exp although the model obtains higher qe values about 25 on average when the concentration of ab80 was higher than 100 mg l table 3 at these higher ab80 concentrations a better agreement between the calculated qe by the pseudo first order model and the experimental qe were obtained fig s7 the value of the pseudo second order rate constant k2 was inversely proportional to the dye concentration tested as reported in different studies 42 the rate of adsorption of ab80 onto ch des beads is a function of the number of sites available for adsorption and also the concentration of dye molecules in the solution as the pseudo second order model assumes surface adsorption is the dominating process 8 the rate limiting step would be determined by the chemical adsorption depending on the electrostatic forces through the electrons exchange 23 description of the adsorption mechanism using the intraparticle diffusion model the adsorption of ab80 at low concentrations 25 100 mg l would take place in two steps figs s10a c the first indicates the formation of a film onto the adsorbent with fast diffusion on the surface the second a decrease in the particle adsorption since most of the dye molecules were already adsorbed by contrast at higher ab80 concentrations 150 250 mg l the process can be divided in three stages figs s10d f the first with the fast diffusion on the surface and formation of a film onto the adsorbent the second with a slow particle diffusion between the ab80 films that were formed during the first stage and the third stage with a decrease in the adsorption rate owing to the absence of available active sites at higher concentrations especially at 250 mg l the pseudo first model would partially explain the experimental data during the initial stage the kinetics is governed by the rate of surface reactions and when the system approaches equilibrium there is a change in the predominant mechanism from surface reactions to intraparticle diffusion 45 3 5 adsorption isotherms the isotherm of dyes adsorption was studied at three different temperatures 25 35 and 45 c fig 8 the adsorption data was used to construct the linear plots of ce qe vs ce log qe vs log ce qe vs ln ce ln qe vs ε 2 and ln qe ce vs qe and the correlation coefficient r2 was used to fit the data to the langmuir fig 9 freundlich temkin dubinin radushkevich and elovich isotherm models figs s11a d the values of kl kf kt β ke qm n b were calculated from the linear plots and are shown on table s2 from the obtained results we can conclude that the experimental data of ab80 adsorption onto ch des beads fitted with langmuir isotherm model with r2 0 99 at all the temperatures tested suggesting the adsorption process takes place by the formation of a monolayer of colourant molecules on uniform distribution of sorption sites in the adsorbent without interactions among adsorbed molecules 23 when the process reaches the equilibrium state the saturation of the monolayer would be complete 20 the separation factor constant rl estimating the degree of suitability of adsorbent to dye increased at increasing temperatures but the obtained values around 0 01 table s2 indicated that the adsorption process is very favorable 0 rl 1 35 in our conditions our results also fit well with temkin isotherm at the lowest temperature tested 25 c r2 0 99 and also at 35 and 45 c r2 0 97 the parameter b related to the heat of adsorption decreases with increasing temperature from 7 36 25 c to 4 82 j mol 45 c the temkin isotherm constant kt increases with increasing temperature from a value of 0 14 25 c to 0 99 l g 45 c table s2 the temkin adsorption model describes the interaction between the adsorbate adsorbent and indirect effects in adsorption isotherms temkin equation introduces the influence of temperature on the adsorption based on langmuir model therefore we can conclude that ab80 adsorbs onto ch des beads uniformly on a monolayer and the heat of adsorption of molecules in the layer decreases linearly as a result of increase surface coverage 35 the mean energy of adsorption may be deduced from the dubinin radushkevich isotherm the low positive value of e 0 3 0 5 kj mol indicates a low potential barrier suggesting a physical nature of the adsorption process 46 3 6 thermodynamic study thermodynamic parameters were calculated from the linear plots of ln kc and 1 t kc qe ce fig s12 and are summarized on table s3 negative values obtained for the parameter δg at all temperatures and dye concentrations except the highest 250 mg l of ab80 and the concentration 200 mg l when temperature was 45 c indicate that the adsorption process is spontaneous except at the previously mentioned conditions at increasing ab80 concentrations and at increasing temperatures the δg values shift to more positive values meaning that the adsorption process becomes less favorable a similar trend was described for the adsorption of metanil yellow dye on a chitosan based adsorbent 47 by contrast at the lowest ab80 concentrations tested 25 and 50 mg l the δg values shift to more negative values at increasing temperatures table s3 the δh values negative when the concentrations of dye were above 100 mg l confirm the exothermic nature of the adsorption process at those conditions then we can conclude that at lower concentration of the ab80 molecules in the solution the process is endothermic so the increase in temperature helps adsorption on the contrary at higher concentration of ab80 molecules the process is exothermic so the adsorption is favoured at lower temperatures the values of δg obtained are in the range 20 to 0 kj mol generally described for physisorption 46 the negative values of the enthalpy change in the range 13 9 to 42 6 kj mol would indicate that the adsorption involves weak forces of attraction of physical nature and the process exothermic at values of dye concentration above 100 mg l is energetically stable 46 the negative δs values at the mentioned range of dye concentrations reflected the decreased randomness at the solid liquid interface during the adsorption of dye onto adsorbent 3 7 reusability of the adsorbent the results obtained during reuse of untreated not desorbed ch des beads after each adsorption process is shown on fig 10 the adsorbent partially maintains the adsorption capacity and continues eliminating the dye ab80 from the aqueous solution at a lower rate after the first use 66 8 and with a further decrease around 40 ater the next uses it is even capable of removing 33 6 of ab80 from the solution after 5 uses 3 7 1 desorption the results of desorption experiments using naoh 0 1 m and h2so4 0 1 m and applying the same experimental conditions as for adsorption tests are shown on fig 11 three desorption cycles were performed and as it can be seen the desorption percentage was very high when naoh was used in the range 80 99 but it was notably lower from 30 to 6 when h2so4 was used two cycles of treatment with naoh were very effective to desorb the dye ab80 from the ch des beads it was also shown that at increasing initial dye concentration used during the adsorption the percentage of desorption with naoh also increased however the opposite was observed when h2so4 was used during naoh treatment a competition between the oh ions and the anionic dye molecules adsorbed to ch des beads might be responsable for the elution of ab80 as described by others 47 48 afterwards the adsorbents treated by both methods were tested for reuse fig 12 shows the obtained results when naoh 0 1 m was used to desorb the beads there was a decrease in the removal of ab80 from the solution from 98 to 43 therefore the desorption process with naoh was not practical for application when the material was intended for reuse but it could be a very effective way to recover the dye concerning the adsorbent treated with h2so4 0 1 m the results obtained when it was reused for ab80 adsorption are shown on fig 13 although ab80 desorption was negligible the ch des beads were still capable of eliminating ca 100 of the dye ab80 from a 100 mg l solution even after 5 successive uses in addition the adsorption capacity after each use remains at the same value this result suggests that the ch des beads have increased their adsorption capacity after the acid treatment probably due to protonation of the amine groups of chitosan and therefore improving the electrostatic interaction with the anionic dyes and facilitating their removal as reported by others 49 3 8 possible adsorption mechanism the ftir spectra of ch des beads after ab80 adsorption shows the ch des beads typical bands together with the characteristic bands of the dye ab80 fig s13 some differences are observed in the beads after adsorption compared to the beads before use in the stretching vibration of c h groups between 2848 and 2963 cm 1 as well as the stretching vibration of o h and n h groups around 3300 cm 1 indicating that the dye ab80 was incorporated to the ch des beads additionally several peaks not present in the adsorbent before use are observed in the ch des ab80 adsorbed and come from the dye in the region from 400 to 2000 cm 1 the bands at 1594 1576 1491 1451 1364 1075 994 841 820 801 726 673 625 579 555 512 and 470 cm 1 no obvious new peak was detected and peaks in the region 1790 1284 cm 1 decreased after adsorption this would mean that the interaction adsorbent pollutant is mainly of physical nature 48 the adsorption and desorption behavior of ab80 on the studied adsorbent ch des beads was possibly affected by the electrostatic interactions when the oh ions were present they would replace the anionic dye molecules adsorbed to ch des beads and eluted them from the adsorbent and conversely when protonation of the amine groups of chitosan takes place by addition of acid enhancement of the electrostatic interaction with the anionic dye molecules would improve their adsorption to the ch des surface overall the adsorption behavior at lower ab80 concentrations appeared to be dominated by chemisorption depending on the electrostatic attraction onto ch des beads surface with a rapid diffusion from the solution to the adsorbent favoured by increasing temperature however at higher ab80 concentrations the process seemed also ruled by physisorption with an initial rapid diffusion from the solution to the adsorbent followed by a slow particle diffusion caused by mass transfer resistance and increased repulsion forces between the dye molecules in the adsorbent and the liquid phase and finally a saturation of available active sites besides at the higher ab80 concentration range the process was exothermic and hence the increase in temperature induced a decreased adsorption in addition the free energy change became less favorable at increasing ab80 concentrations 3 9 comparison of ch des adsorption capacities with other adsorbents the adsorption capacity values qm in the literature showed differences among different adsorbent materials lower values compared with our adsorbent were obtained for ab80 when a cutio2 composite was used 22 23 mg g 16 other adsorbents were reported to reach higher capacities such as activated carbon from vegetal residues with values in the range 88 03 294 7 mg g 50 51 chemical modified bentonites with 126 201 mg g 52 52 53 and al based metal organic framework mof with 200 mg g 53 4 conclusions this work envisages an opportunity to obtain alternative adsorbents based on chitosan modification with deep eutectic solvents dess that offered enhanced adsorption capacity compared to the starting materials the sorbents could be easily recovered and reused and eventual recovery of the dye by desorption was possible successful modification of chitosan beads using a deep eutectic solvent of choline chloride urea allowed to improve substantially the capacity of chitosan itself to adsorb the dye acid blue 80 below dye concentrations of 100 mg l the removal percentages were as high as 98 100 and for 250 mg l the highest concentration tested they were still around 71 the adsorption process could be described with the pseudo second order kinetic model and the monolayer langmuir isotherm sorbent recovery and reuse was feasible with an extremely high efficiency 100 dye removal during several cycles after acid treatment of the beads the adsorption process required mild operating conditions at temperature lower than 35 c the adsorption was optimum and spontaneous and worked for a wide ph range which makes it applicable to typical effluents discharged from the textile industry it can also be extended to other anionic dyes e g azo type and its industrial application could contribute to the development of alternative green and sustainable

funding acquisition project administration 1 introduction water resources are of utmost importance in a world facing challenges such as the population growth the climate change and the increasing need for water in agriculture and industry however the disposal of contaminants and the scarce effectiveness of water treatment to eliminate a number of harmful substances can result in reduced water quality and damage to aquatic environment but also to humans the removal of highly toxic pollutants such as dyes phenolic compounds metals pesticides and drugs detected not only in wastewaters but also in surface and even drinking water is a challenge since the conventional methods used in treatment plants do not allow their elimination 1 the textile industry faces a serious environmental concern the amount and the chemical load of water discharged water is used as the principal medium for removing impurities applying dyes and finishing agents although dyestuffs do not represent a significant load compared to other substances used in the process they cause the colour of the effluent and this poses environmental concerns since high doses may reduce light exposure to aquatic photosynthetic organisms besides the textile sector the use of dyes has been incorporated to many industrial processes around 20 of global water pollution comes from dyeing and finishing textile products 2 anthraquinone and phthalocyanine dyes are widely employed as the primary or secondary compounds in commercial trichromatic dyeing formulations 3 nevertheless there is significantly less research devoted to the treatment of anthraquinones compared to azo compounds 4 acid blue 80 ab80 an anionic anthraquinone dye with two sulfonate groups has special relevance because of its widespread use besides textile industry it is used in paper chemicals and dyes inks and toners leather treatment products polymers cosmetics and personal care products washing and cleaning products biocides among others this substance is registered under the reach regulation and the manufactured or imported volume to europe is in the range 10 100 tonnes per annum 5 this compound due to its multi ring aromatic structure is rather stable which can potentially lead to accumulations in the environment and cause long lasting harmful effects to aquatic life concentrations of 10 100 mg l may cause acute toxicity to aquatic organisms 6 that is why it is critical to develop methods to remove this compound from wastewaters there is intensive research in the topic of dye removal which includes a wide variety of methods ranging from more conventional approaches like filtration precipitation coagulation or adsorption to more sophisticated ones like photooxidation ozonation or biological treatments 7 8 all these methods applied to textile wastewaters have their own advantages and disadvantages chemical ones like oxidation or ozonation are very specific but give rise to by products such as sludges caused by chemical coagulation biological ones not adequate for most textile wastewaters may not be effective for all dyes and require elaborate enzymatic productions and physicochemical ones show good removal but tend to be expensive and the materials are often difficult to regenerate 7 adsorption stands out because of its efficient ability to cut down hazardous pollutants present in effluents 9 with this method compounds from a liquid or gaseous phase can be extracted by adhesion to the solid surface of the adsorbent this adhesion can occur via electrostatic van der waals or chemical interactions among the main advantages it requires a relatively simple operating procedure while offering a broad range of applicability for many pollutants like heavy metals or dyes 10 that is why in the textile industry it is common practice to use for example commercial activated carbon as an adsorbent however ongoing work intends to find environmentally friendly substitutes that optimize the cost while maintaining efficiency employing biomass substrates or agricultural and industrial byproducts 11 15 this approach would allow improving solid waste management one of the present issues to be addressed in preserving a healthy environment 10 combination of different methods is usually needed to address the treatment of textile wastewaters owing to the high variability of the effluent characteristics and the chemical nature of the different colourants for example the adsorption process can be combined with membrane systems such as nanofiltration 7 metallic catalysts have been employed to provide an adsorption surface where the dyes can be degraded photochemically 16 indeed the demand for simpler and greener adsorbents keeps rising that is the case of chitosan a natural adsorbent that is a cheap and eco friendly alternative 8 17 this abundant polymer is being widely studied as a biosupport to synthesize adsorbent materials the large number of protonated amine nh3 and deprotonated hydroxyl o functional groups along the linear cationic polysaccharide provide high availability of active sites hence it has an excellent adsorption ability and also a tuneable structure promoting physical chemical and or electrostatic bonds and allowing modifications that could improve the adsorption properties a variety of additives have been used to modify chitosan and form composites or hybrid materials and more recently an increasing number of papers deal with combining chitosan with carbon based materials 1 up to date scarce studies describe the combination of chitosan with deep eutectic solvents dess in the preparation of new materials for dye adsorption dess are chemicals resulting from the combination of two or more compounds in their pure states a compound acting as hydrogen bond donor hbd and other compound as hydrogen bond acceptor hba mixed in specific molar ratios that lead to the formation of hydrogen bonds and van der waals interactions between them and resulting in a decrease in their respective melting temperature thus obtaining a solvent in liquid state at wide temperature ranges 18 dess are simple to synthesize and offer benefits such as cost effectiveness most of them are non toxic and biodegradable and could be the substitutes for ionic liquids ils and organic sovents in extraction processes 19 but have been scarcely used for dyes removal 18 combinations of des with polymers offer a promising alternative to obtain eco friendly adsorbents with enhanced capacity to remove dyes and other pollutants from wastewaters 19 22 in this study we have developed alternative adsorbents by modifying chitosan beads through impregnation with a des choline chloride urea in a molar ratio 1 2 to improve adsorption capacity of chitosan our objective was to modify the chitosan surface by attaching different functional groups acting as chelating sites such as carbonyl functional groups and provide a better performance as a dye adsorbent as well as recovery and reutilization we have prepared characterized and assayed three chitosan based adsorbents unmodified chitosan beads un ch des modified chitosan feo beads ch feo des

tests desorption experiments and reusability tests were also done using naoh 0 1 m and h2so4 0 1 m and applying the same experimental conditions as for adsorption tests three desorption cycles were performed then the adsorbent was tested for reuse additionally the reusability of untreated adsorbent was examined 5 times using 0 015 g of adsorbent 5 ml 100 mg l initial ab80 concentration for 360 min contact time at 25 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbent characterizations 3 1 1 fourier transform infrared ftir spectrum fig 1 shows the ftir spectra of the adsorbents and individual components used to elaborate them chitosan as raw material and chitosan beads un ch beads exhibit broad bands at 3352 and 3294 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of n h and oh functional groups at 2875 2920 cm 1 the bands correspond to stretching vibration of c h bonds in ch ch2 and ch3 groups the bands around 1025 and 1059 cm 1 are attributed to c o c and c oh stretching vibrations respectively associated with the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups in the chitosan structure the characteristic bands observed at 1645 and 1592 cm 1 indicating stretching vibration of co and bending of n h in amide groups are representative of primary amine of highly deacetylated chitosan for amide i conh2 and ii n h respectively the appearance of amide i groups has been mainly attributed to the cross linking process in the formation of ionic interactions and hydrogen bonding with the acetic acid 23 regarding choline chloride characteristic bands observed are the corresponding to stretching vitrations of n h bonds at 3219 3006 3026 cm 1 the bands at 1413 1481 cm 1 that may be assigned to alkyl groups bending of aliphatic c h groups or n h vibrations in quaternary ammonium groups bands within the range of 1480 1390 cm 1 36 bands within the range 1200 880 cm 1 especially the band at 953 cm 1 corresponding to asymmetric c n stretching vibration and bands 2854 2951 cm 1 assigned to alkyl groups stretching vibrations of c h bond in ch2 and ch3 urea shows the main bands at 3425 3326 cm 1 assigned to asymmetric n h stretching vibration of nh2 groups at 3228 3254 cm 1 assigned to symmetric n h stretching vibration of nh2 groups at 1674 cm 1 assigned to stretching vibration of co in amide group conh2 amide i band 1587 cm 1 assigned to bending of n h bond in nh2 groups amide ii band and finally 1459 and 1147 assigned to asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration of n c n bonds respectively 37 concerning deep eutectic solvent chcl urea 1 2 a broadening of the bands in the 3500 3000 cm 1 region is observed probably caused by the formation of hydrogen bonds between hydrogen bond acceptor hba and hydrogen bond donnor hbd then bands at 3388 and 3314 cm 1 can be assigned to stretching vibration of n h and o h bonds and at 3256 and 3187 cm 1 can be assigned to stretching vibration of n h in addition co stretching vibration band of amide group conh has shifted to lower frequencies 1660 cm 1 compared to urea at 1674 cm 1 similar findings have been reported by jakubowska et al 2020 for des chcl malonic acid 1 1 36 then the interaction between the components in des causing the decrease in melting point of the mixture chcl urea can be confirmed by the changes in ftir spectra results from ftir analysis show spectral differences between des modified chitosan beads and unmodified chitosan beads fig 2 indicating possible attachment of the functional groups chitosan showed two bands in the region 1500 1700 cm 1 where the stretching vibration of co and bending of n h bonds of amide occur present in urea and also in chitosan in this region 3 bands can be clearly observed now in des modified chitosan beads a band at 1550 cm 1 arises with high intensity and this new band together with the 1600 cm 1 band are more intense as des concentrations increase in des modified beads data not shown this new band at 1550 cm 1 and the band at 1600 cm 1 could be also assigned to bending of n h bonds of amide and nh2 groups in addition the band at 1646 cm 1 in the chitosan beads stretching vibration of co of amide i group slightly shifts to 1649 cm 1 in chitosan des beads and a significant increase in the area under this peak can be observed in ch des beads compared to ch beads indicating that this band is being contributed by other co band corresponding to urea from the des this change confirms the attaching of des molecules to chitosan beads since the intensity of the bands would reflect a rise of n h and co groups coming from the urea in des a new peak at around 1750 cm 1 can be observed although it is a small band and may correspond to co stretching vibration in carboxylic groups characteristic of hbd urea this band was also observed in mixtures of chitosan with des chcl malonic acid 1 1 36 other regions that might show a change in the intensity or shape of the spectral bands are the region 1400 1500 cm 1 bending of aliphatic c h bonds and asymmetric stretching vibration of c n bond in urea and to a lower extent in the region 850 770 cm 1 symmetric stretching vibration of c n bonds in chcl there s also a change in the band around 3200 cm 1 more defined in des modified adsorbents and assigned to stretching vibration of n h the spectra of des modified chitosan feo ch feo des beads reflects changes in the same bands as described above for ch des beads however these changes occur at a lower intensity the typical bands described for magnetite fe3o4 at 531 cm 1 corresponding to stretching vibration of fe o are observed in our feo particles however it is not detected in the ch feo des beads and only a very slight increase in the intensity was registered in the adsorbent then feo particles incorporated in the ch feo des beads were negligible in the adsorbent surface 3 1 2 scanning electron microscopy sem fig 3 shows the morphology of the adsorbents un ch ch des and ch feo des obtained by scanning electron microscopy sem the beads are spherical ovoid in all cases fig s2 the average diameter size was 965 7 948 5 and 1088 6 μm respectively un ch shows a smooth area with some minor cavities on the surface by contrast ch des shows areas with smooth surface and areas with rougher surface exhibiting more cavities and small pores ch feo des shows protuberances distributed along the beads smooth surface and the feo nanoparticles are visible only on those particular spots 3 1 3 brunauer emmett teller bet and barrett joyner halenda bjh analysis the surface area volume and pore size of the beads were determined by the brunauer emmett teller bet and barrett joyner halenda bjh analysis results are shown in table 2 the porosity was very low in the three adsorbents the small pore volume and pore size of the beads used in our work were similar to the chitosan beads prepared by others 23 or slightly higher 20 as well as the size of the beads slightly higher values of pore volume and pore size were observed in ch feo des beads probably owing to the presence of feo nanoparticles however their distribution on the beads surface seems to be restricted to scarce single spots as commented above fig 3 3 2 preliminary screening and selection of the best adsorbent dye fig 4 shows the ab80 adsorption data obtained after testing the three different adsorbents at an initial ab80 concentration of 100 mg l and ratio adsorbent mass dye solution volume of 5 g l the ch des beads adsorb the dye ab80 at a relatively high rate in comparison with the remaining tested beads a sharp increase in the adsorption during the first 30 min of the experiment is exhibited in contrast to the smoother adsorbance increase shown by un ch and ch feo des afterwards ch des adsorption continues to increase more moderately until the adsorption capacity achieves 19 6 mg g at 120 min with 95 9 removal from water from this moment after a slight increase in removal up to the maximum values 99 3 removal from water the ch des adsorption process reaches the equilibrium state the sharp increase in the removal rate and adsorption capacities during the initial stage of the experiment could be due to the fast diffusion on the surface and formation of a film onto the ch des beads with a higher number of binding sites functional groups attached during des modification of chitosan beads than the other assayed adsorbents un ch and ch feo des show a similar adsorption rate with a faster adsorption by ch feo des beads reaching the maximum capacity and the equilibrium state at 300 min with a removal rate of 91 5 and adsorption of 18 2 mg g and later at 360 min in the adsorbent un ch with similar removal and adsorption values 89 7 and 17 7 mg g respectively the ch des beads adsorption capacity at equilibrium reaches a maximum value 19 6 mg g higher than ch des feo and un ch 18 2 and 17 7 mg g respectively and faster at 120 min compared to 300 and 360 min respectively when used with the dye ab80 then the more efficient ab80 adsorbent ch des was selected for further study of adsorption equilibrium and kinetics 3 3 factors affecting the adsorption process 3 3 1 adsorbent dose the adsorbent dosage effect on the removal percentage and adsorption of ab80 in aqueous solution was tested to obtain the optimal dosage providing the best performance at the lowest adsorbent spent fig 5 shows the results obtained at increasing doses of adsorbent ch des beads more removal rate is obtained while the adsorption capacity per unit weight adsorbent decreases the surface area of adsorbent increases when higher adsorbent quantity is used so the availability of active binding sites on the adsorbent allows a higher removal efficiency the most efficient dose to our objectives was 0 015 g of adsorbent per 5 ml of ab80 solution of an initial concentration of 100 mg l since the removal achieves the maximum value and the equilibrium state at higher adsorbent doses there was no further increase in the dye removal this finding can be attributed to a screening effect at increasing adsorbent doses due to accumulation of adsorbent particles and the decrease in the distance between them binding sites for ab80 molecules might be hidden by coacervates on the adsorbent surface furthermore adsorbent overlap leads to competition among ab80 molecules for a limited number of available binding sites and increased diffusion path length resulting in a decrease in the adsorption rate 38 40 3 3 2 initial dye concentration and contact time the effect of contact time and initial concentrations of ab80 on the removal efficiency of ch des beads are shown in fig 6 it can be seen that during the first step of the adsorption process the adsorption was very fast and then it continued to increase more gradually during a second step to finally achieve an equilibrium state where no more adsorption takes place the duration of each stage and the dye elimination rate is dependent on the initial ab80 concentration of the solutions at the lowest ab80 concentration 25 mg l the elimination rate is very sharp during the first 60 min and it continues to increase at a lower rate the next 30 min until equilibrium is reached within the first 90 min at increasing concentrations the rate of dye elimination is especially sharp the first 60 min and the subsequent increase in the removal is more moderate the higher the dye initial concentration the lower the dye removal rate fig 6 consistently the equilibrium state is reached at different times and the dye removal achieves different efficiencies depending on the initial concentration the more ab80 initial concentration the more duration of the process until the equilibrium is achieved and the lower the removal efficiency the ab80 removal percentage reached 98 100 at initial concentrations of 25 100 mg l within 5 h more time was needed at higher initial concentrations about 8 h to reach 93 150 mg l 80 200 mg l and up to 10 15h to reach 71 250 mg l the rapid removal rate at the beginning of the process could be explained by the high availability of active adsorption sites on the beads surface the surface diffusion of the dye molecules onto the adsorbent through the solution that occurs at the first stage is influenced by the concentration of the dye solution and the agitation and time 41 the lower removal at higher initial dye concentrations may be explained by the mass transfer resistance between the adsorbate and adsorbent caused by the increase in the concentration gradient the sites become occupied by the dye molecules and cause an increase in the time of contact between adsorbate and adsorbent and repulsion forces increase between the adsorbed dye and the dye molecules in the liquid phase 42 the adsorption capacity increased very fast at the beginning of the process the higher the initial ab80 concentration the faster the increase and the higher the adsorption value achieved fig s3 this may be explained by the concentration gradient increase with the increasing dye concentration that would compensate the mass transfer resistance between the adsorbate and adsorbent 42 the adsorption capacity values found were 8 25 16 80 33 95 46 39 52 91 and 58 39 mg g for ab80 concentrations of 25 50 100 150 200 and 250 mg l respectively at 25 c and ph 7 3 3 3 temperature the influence of the temperature on the removal of ab80 by ch des beads was tested the adsorption experiments were carried out at 25 35 and 45 c a slight increase in dye removal up to 2 can be observed when the temperature rises from 25 to 35 c probably due to an increase in the diffusion rate by contrast a decrease was registered when the temperature rises from 35 to 45 c when the initial dye concentrations were 150 200 and 250 mg l fig s4 a removal decrease of around 10 was observed at 45 c in the mentioned solutions the decrease in dye removal at increasing temperatures indicates that the adsorption process is exothermic these observations could be explained by the desorption of the adsorbed ab80 molecules caused by the destruction of adsorption forces that were responsable for the elimination of adsorption interactions between active sites of the beads and the dye molecules 42 as a consequence the best temperature for adsorption in this case is 25 c 3 3 4 ph the binding of dye molecules onto adsorbents is affected by the ph since the degree of dissociation and or ionization of dye molecules and the adsorbent surface is influenced by this parameter the functional groups occurring in the adsorbent such as amine and hydroxyl groups are affected by the ph of the dye solution as reported 43 fig s5 shows the influence of the initial ph value on the removal of ab80 by ch des beads the ph effect was tested at a ph range of 3 5 10 the initial concentration of ab80 was 100 mg l and the dye removal was tested at 219 min the removal percentage was higher at lower ph at ph 3 5 100 of ab80 was removed while at the highest ph tested ph 10 the removal was the lowest 83 at intermediate ph values lower than 7 the removal was higher than 95 the adsorption of ab80 onto the ch des beads was affected by ph with a decrease above ph 7 this observation agrees with the obtained point of zero charge phpzc 6 98 for ch des beads fig s6 at ph lower than phpzc the adsorbent is positively charged then at acidic conditions amine groups of adsorbent were protonated and the negative sulfonate ions of ab80 were probably adsorbed by electrostatic attraction explaining the highest removal efficiency at ph 3 5 43 the decrease in removal with increasing ph from 3 5 to 7 might be due to the reduction in the amount of protonated amino groups on the adsorbent leading to a decreasing electrostatic attraction between the dye molecules and the ch des beads at phs higher than 6 98 ch des beads are negatively charged so the adsorption capacity decreases at a higher rate owing to repulsions between the anionic dye and the adsorbent surface it has been reported that the ph of the dyeing discharge from textile industry generally ranges from 9 to 11 44 although lower the ch des beads efficiency was significant at ph 10 83 ab80 removal 3 4 adsorption kinetic models adsorption kinetics brings information to understand the adsorption process the potential controlling steps and the adsorption mechanism the literature provides a lot of studies applying different adsorption kinetic models for removal of dyes molecules using chitosan based adsorbents such as first order kinetic pseudo second order kinetic intraparticle diffusion and elovich 8 the adsorption of ab80 on ch des beads was studied under different initial concentrations to investigate the most appropriate adsorption kinetics model the pseudo second order fig 7 pseudo first order elovich and intraparticle diffusion weber morris model figs s7 s9 kinetics linear graphs were represented linear plots of ln qe qt vs t t qt vs t qt vs ln t and qt vs t1 2 respectively were used to obtain the values table 3 shows the adsorption kinetic parameters k1 k2 k3 qe i β and α corresponding to the different models calculated using the linear plots together with the parameter r2 the linear fit and regression coefficient values obtained for the studied kinetic models point at the pseudo second order fig 7 as the more suitable model throughout all the ab80 concentrations there is also good agreement between the values of calculated qe pseudo second order and the experimental qe exp although the model obtains higher qe values about 25 on average when the concentration of ab80 was higher than 100 mg l table 3 at these higher ab80 concentrations a better agreement between the calculated qe by the pseudo first order model and the experimental qe were obtained fig s7 the value of the pseudo second order rate constant k2 was inversely proportional to the dye concentration tested as reported in different studies 42 the rate of adsorption of ab80 onto ch des beads is a function of the number of sites available for adsorption and also the concentration of dye molecules in the solution as the pseudo second order model assumes surface adsorption is the dominating process 8 the rate limiting step would be determined by the chemical adsorption depending on the electrostatic forces through the electrons exchange 23 description of the adsorption mechanism using the intraparticle diffusion model the adsorption of ab80 at low concentrations 25 100 mg l would take place in two steps figs s10a c the first indicates the formation of a film onto the adsorbent with fast diffusion on the surface the second a decrease in the particle adsorption since most of the dye molecules were already adsorbed by contrast at higher ab80 concentrations 150 250 mg l the process can be divided in three stages figs s10d f the first with the fast diffusion on the surface and formation of a film onto the adsorbent the second with a slow particle diffusion between the ab80 films that were formed during the first stage and the third stage with a decrease in the adsorption rate owing to the absence of available active sites at higher concentrations especially at 250 mg l the pseudo first model would partially explain the experimental data during the initial stage the kinetics is governed by the rate of surface reactions and when the system approaches equilibrium there is a change in the predominant mechanism from surface reactions to intraparticle diffusion 45 3 5 adsorption isotherms the isotherm of dyes adsorption was studied at three different temperatures 25 35 and 45 c fig 8 the adsorption data was used to construct the linear plots of ce qe vs ce log qe vs log ce qe vs ln ce ln qe vs ε 2 and ln qe ce vs qe and the correlation coefficient r2 was used to fit the data to the langmuir fig 9 freundlich temkin dubinin radushkevich and elovich isotherm models figs s11a d the values of kl kf kt β ke qm n b were calculated from the linear plots and are shown on table s2 from the obtained results we can conclude that the experimental data of ab80 adsorption onto ch des beads fitted with langmuir isotherm model with r2 0 99 at all the temperatures tested suggesting the adsorption process takes place by the formation of a monolayer of colourant molecules on uniform distribution of sorption sites in the adsorbent without interactions among adsorbed molecules 23 when the process reaches the equilibrium state the saturation of the monolayer would be complete 20 the separation factor constant rl estimating the degree of suitability of adsorbent to dye increased at increasing temperatures but the obtained values around 0 01 table s2 indicated that the adsorption process is very favorable 0 rl 1 35 in our conditions our results also fit well with temkin isotherm at the lowest temperature tested 25 c r2 0 99 and also at 35 and 45 c r2 0 97 the parameter b related to the heat of adsorption decreases with increasing temperature from 7 36 25 c to 4 82 j mol 45 c the temkin isotherm constant kt increases with increasing temperature from a value of 0 14 25 c to 0 99 l g 45 c table s2 the temkin adsorption model describes the interaction between the adsorbate adsorbent and indirect effects in adsorption isotherms temkin equation introduces the influence of temperature on the adsorption based on langmuir model therefore we can conclude that ab80 adsorbs onto ch des beads uniformly on a monolayer and the heat of adsorption of molecules in the layer decreases linearly as a result of increase surface coverage 35 the mean energy of adsorption may be deduced from the dubinin radushkevich isotherm the low positive value of e 0 3 0 5 kj mol indicates a low potential barrier suggesting a physical nature of the adsorption process 46 3 6 thermodynamic study thermodynamic parameters were calculated from the linear plots of ln kc and 1 t kc qe ce fig s12 and are summarized on table s3 negative values obtained for the parameter δg at all temperatures and dye concentrations except the highest 250 mg l of ab80 and the concentration 200 mg l when temperature was 45 c indicate that the adsorption process is spontaneous except at the previously mentioned conditions at increasing ab80 concentrations and at increasing temperatures the δg values shift to more positive values meaning that the adsorption process becomes less favorable a similar trend was described for the adsorption of metanil yellow dye on a chitosan based adsorbent 47 by contrast at the lowest ab80 concentrations tested 25 and 50 mg l the δg values shift to more negative values at increasing temperatures table s3 the δh values negative when the concentrations of dye were above 100 mg l confirm the exothermic nature of the adsorption process at those conditions then we can conclude that at lower concentration of the ab80 molecules in the solution the process is endothermic so the increase in temperature helps adsorption on the contrary at higher concentration of ab80 molecules the process is exothermic so the adsorption is favoured at lower temperatures the values of δg obtained are in the range 20 to 0 kj mol generally described for physisorption 46 the negative values of the enthalpy change in the range 13 9 to 42 6 kj mol would indicate that the adsorption involves weak forces of attraction of physical nature and the process exothermic at values of dye concentration above 100 mg l is energetically stable 46 the negative δs values at the mentioned range of dye concentrations reflected the decreased randomness at the solid liquid interface during the adsorption of dye onto adsorbent 3 7 reusability of the adsorbent the results obtained during reuse of untreated not desorbed ch des beads after each adsorption process is shown on fig 10 the adsorbent partially maintains the adsorption capacity and continues eliminating the dye ab80 from the aqueous solution at a lower rate after the first use 66 8 and with a further decrease around 40 ater the next uses it is even capable of removing 33 6 of ab80 from the solution after 5 uses 3 7 1 desorption the results of desorption experiments using naoh 0 1 m and h2so4 0 1 m and applying the same experimental conditions as for adsorption tests are shown on fig 11 three desorption cycles were performed and as it can be seen the desorption percentage was very high when naoh was used in the range 80 99 but it was notably lower from 30 to 6 when h2so4 was used two cycles of treatment with naoh were very effective to desorb the dye ab80 from the ch des beads it was also shown that at increasing initial dye concentration used during the adsorption the percentage of desorption with naoh also increased however the opposite was observed when h2so4 was used during naoh treatment a competition between the oh ions and the anionic dye molecules adsorbed to ch des beads might be responsable for the elution of ab80 as described by others 47 48 afterwards the adsorbents treated by both methods were tested for reuse fig 12 shows the obtained results when naoh 0 1 m was used to desorb the beads there was a decrease in the removal of ab80 from the solution from 98 to 43 therefore the desorption process with naoh was not practical for application when the material was intended for reuse but it could be a very effective way to recover the dye concerning the adsorbent treated with h2so4 0 1 m the results obtained when it was reused for ab80 adsorption are shown on fig 13 although ab80 desorption was negligible the ch des beads were still capable of eliminating ca 100 of the dye ab80 from a 100 mg l solution even after 5 successive uses in addition the adsorption capacity after each use remains at the same value this result suggests that the ch des beads have increased their adsorption capacity after the acid treatment probably due to protonation of the amine groups of chitosan and therefore improving the electrostatic interaction with the anionic dyes and facilitating their removal as reported by others 49 3 8 possible adsorption mechanism the ftir spectra of ch des beads after ab80 adsorption shows the ch des beads typical bands together with the characteristic bands of the dye ab80 fig s13 some differences are observed in the beads after adsorption compared to the beads before use in the stretching vibration of c h groups between 2848 and 2963 cm 1 as well as the stretching vibration of o h and n h groups around 3300 cm 1 indicating that the dye ab80 was incorporated to the ch des beads additionally several peaks not present in the adsorbent before use are observed in the ch des ab80 adsorbed and come from the dye in the region from 400 to 2000 cm 1 the bands at 1594 1576 1491 1451 1364 1075 994 841 820 801 726 673 625 579 555 512 and 470 cm 1 no obvious new peak was detected and peaks in the region 1790 1284 cm 1 decreased after adsorption this would mean that the interaction adsorbent pollutant is mainly of physical nature 48 the adsorption and desorption behavior of ab80 on the studied adsorbent ch des beads was possibly affected by the electrostatic interactions when the oh ions were present they would replace the anionic dye molecules adsorbed to ch des beads and eluted them from the adsorbent and conversely when protonation of the amine groups of chitosan takes place by addition of acid enhancement of the electrostatic interaction with the anionic dye molecules would improve their adsorption to the ch des surface overall the adsorption behavior at lower ab80 concentrations appeared to be dominated by chemisorption depending on the electrostatic attraction onto ch des beads surface with a rapid diffusion from the solution to the adsorbent favoured by increasing temperature however at higher ab80 concentrations the process seemed also ruled by physisorption with an initial rapid diffusion from the solution to the adsorbent followed by a slow particle diffusion caused by mass transfer resistance and increased repulsion forces between the dye molecules in the adsorbent and the liquid phase and finally a saturation of available active sites besides at the higher ab80 concentration range the process was exothermic and hence the increase in temperature induced a decreased adsorption in addition the free energy change became less favorable at increasing ab80 concentrations 3 9 comparison of ch des adsorption capacities with other adsorbents the adsorption capacity values qm in the literature showed differences among different adsorbent materials lower values compared with our adsorbent were obtained for ab80 when a cutio2 composite was used 22 23 mg g 16 other adsorbents were reported to reach higher capacities such as activated carbon from vegetal residues with values in the range 88 03 294 7 mg g 50 51 chemical modified bentonites with 126 201 mg g 52 52 53 and al based metal organic framework mof with 200 mg g 53 4 conclusions this work envisages an opportunity to obtain alternative adsorbents based on chitosan modification with deep eutectic solvents dess that offered enhanced adsorption capacity compared to the starting materials the sorbents could be easily recovered and reused and eventual recovery of the dye by desorption was possible successful modification of chitosan beads using a deep eutectic solvent of choline chloride urea allowed to improve substantially the capacity of chitosan itself to adsorb the dye acid blue 80 below dye concentrations of 100 mg l the removal percentages were as high as 98 100 and for 250 mg l the highest concentration tested they were still around 71 the adsorption process could be described with the pseudo second order kinetic model and the monolayer langmuir isotherm sorbent recovery and reuse was feasible with an extremely high efficiency 100 dye removal during several cycles after acid treatment of the beads the adsorption process required mild operating conditions at temperature lower than 35 c the adsorption was optimum and spontaneous and worked for a wide ph range which makes it applicable to typical effluents discharged from the textile industry it can also be extended to other anionic dyes e g azo type and its industrial application could contribute to the development of alternative green and sustainable
