9530,the integrated structure actor water framework isaw was used to develop a set of indicators to select an irrigation system according to its sustainability impact on agriculture the analysis hierarchical process ahp was used to explore the views of 60 agricultural water stakeholders such as specialists extension experts agricultural ngo staff and farmers across ardabil province in iran participants were selected using the snowball method and interviewed using a 42 item questionnaire to measure the relative importance of nine indicators for choosing the best irrigation system the results reveal that i all groups of stakeholders preferred pressurized irrigation systems piss 69 with respect to agricultural sustainability ii indicators of employment and income had a relative weight of 26 productivity 20 improved quality of life 16 and agricultural expansion 14 when it comes to making decisions regarding irrigation systems and iii with the exception of specialists the other participants farmers ngo staff and extension experts made similar decisions when choosing the best irrigation systems the results show the usefulness of isaw as a decision making framework and the proposed methodological approach to decision making concerning water issues in highlighting the socio economic aspects that must be closely coordinated in order to meet sustainability objectives for the irrigated agriculture sector keywords sustainability impact irrigation systems agriculture multicriteria social ecological framework 1 introduction water scarcity is now one of the greatest challenges humanity is facing around the world it describes a condition of imbalance between availability and demand where demand for water surpasses availability rosa et al 2020 this problem will continue to escalate as world populations grow with estimates suggesting humans will number 9 billion by 2050 this continued growth will further increase demands on global food production and consequently on water supplies falkenmark 2013 xu et al 2020 because about 40 of the world s agricultural production uses irrigation approximately 20 of total planted area and dryland systems produce 60 of total production from about 80 of total planted area irrigation is the epicenter of agricultural water management needs and is critical to water and food security darzi naftchali et al 2020 water management is even more important in developing countries where rural livelihoods rely heavily on agriculture and 90 of water withdrawals are for agricultural systems samian et al 2015 zarei et al 2020 water scarcity results mostly from a basic lack of water i e physical water scarcity it may also however stem from the lack of a suitable infrastructure to provide access despite sufficient available resources this is referred to as economic water scarcity or ews bond 2019 grecksch 2021 water scarcity is generally considered from the perspectives of both physical constrictions and economic determinants physical water scarcity means an insufficient amount of freshwater available to meet human needs rijsberman 2006 liu et al 2017 while economic water scarcity refers to the condition in which water resources are physically available but there is a lack of economic and institutional capacity that hinders the ability to make use of that water rosa et al 2020 water comes from either aquifers bws blue water scarcity or soil moisture gws green water scarcity gws is a condition where rainfall cannot meet crop water needs rosa et al 2020 economic water scarcity ews refers to the lack or inefficiency of irrigation due to insufficient investment in infrastructure and institutions and poor water governance in areas where water would otherwise be physically available vallino et al 2020 ews highlights the need to upgrade water development programs to be able to use freshwater resources seckler et al 1999 the technocratic hydraulic engineering approach that led to the hydraulic mission of the 20th century considered infrastructural development as the main factor of water development molle et al 2009 hence the lack of infrastructural development has been at the center of the conceptualization of ews brown et al 2011 this old water governance approach however has been criticized for its inability to deal with socio hydrological dynamics and is often panned for its adverse impacts to the environment and society developing research agendas on adaptive water governance pahl wostl et al 2008 the political ecology of water johnston 2003 water justice sultana 2018 and community governance ostrom 1994 led to a debate on how the relationship between access and restriction ownership and dispossession of water resources are determined by institutional political and power dynamics to understand ews therefore a variety of sociopolitical factors that interact across various scales must be considered ignorance and misleading information about these factors have created a fundamental gap in the way the notion of ews has been integrated into agricultural development to date zarei et al 2020 the efficiency of irrigation systems for example is significantly low in most developed countries fao 2016 and evaporation and percolation are reasons large portions of scarce water end up wasted zarei et al 2020 consequently no one size fits all solution exists that is appropriate for all developing countries in this context there is an emerging consensus that engaging various scientific disciplines plus the active social discourse of the diverse stakeholders are critical for the flexible management of water and agricultural systems frantzeskaki and kabisch 2016 rosa et al 2020 in agreement with this grecksch 2021 indicated that water scarcity management options should be addressed more strongly in collaboration and negotiation among water stakeholders located in the northwest of iran ardabil province has total water resources of about 3407 million m3 of which 3132 million m3 is surface water and 275 million m3 is underground water rahmani et al 2017 while this region has an abundant source of renewable blue water underground water is being used excessively in wasteful ways accordingly it was hypothesized that water issues are rooted in socio economic problems economic water security needs to address the socio economic factors of water management including the environment participation of institutions management instruments and financing vallino et al 2020 when planning measures for sustainable irrigation management and when selecting the best irrigation system drawing on this argument the present study aims to i develop a holistic multicriteria framework that applies the structure actor water framework isaw in combination with the application of the analytical hierarchy process ahp frantzeskaki and kabisch 2016 to develop a boundary object and depict the complex and intertwined aspects of water issues regarding the sustainability impact of different irrigation systems ii explore their implementation by identifying and proposing the most suitable indicators for selecting an irrigation system in the yamchi watershed in ardabil iran and iii assess the reliability of the obtained results with respect to the variation of the criteria weights using sensitivity analysis the article is structured as follows the theoretical framework section describes the chosen conceptual framework and ahp for mapping and considering socioeconomic factors in the decision process in the context of sustainable water management the methodology section provides the step by step procedure followed to undertake the yamchi watershed case study in ardabil province iran the results section shows the outcome of indicators and irrigation systems for each group of participants discussion takes a broad look at the findings and the study as a whole in the context of sustainable water management conclusions and implications provides a summary of the results outlines the limitations and challenges of this study and presents recommendations for future research 2 theoretical framework 2 1 a framework of impact in the sustainable water irrigation systems to embed socioeconomic ecological and physical factors in agricultural water management scholars have developed a great number of models and frameworks such as the social ecological systems framework sesf godden and ison 2019 and the management and transition framework pahl wostl et al 2010 as well as the water food energy nexus ecohydrology socio hydrology sivapalan et al 2012 and economic and hydrologic models to depict the complex and intertwined aspects of water issues among these the sesf is the most inclusive conceptual framework for diagnosing interactions and outcomes in a wide variety of empirical contexts such as food production systems aquaculture systems terrestrial conservation rangeland management watershed management marine conservation marine ecosystem management coastal development irrigation systems energy systems and pollution management partelow 2018 colding and barthel 2019 despite the popularity of sesf critical methodological questions have arisen regarding how the framework can be applied empirically partelow et al 2018 nabavi 2017 addressed these problems as an ontological gap and indicated that the goal of sesf beyond merely identifying social actors is to integrate human and non human actors such as humans other species institutions infrastructure concepts and documents so that they are dynamically networking together in this context hale et al 2015 used the idea of an actor network latour 2007 in addressing this ontological gap in sustainability studies for water systems as a socio ecological system hale et al 2015 developed the practice based model isaw integrating structure actors and water to depict the dynamic interactions between human social and natural components within socio hydrological models isaw postulates that two components work in structured contexts and the three main components of structure natural built and social link the human actors individual and organizational and water system outcomes quality and quantity across different temporal and spatial scales in isaw there are six linkages among two main components i ecological hydrological processes ii ecosystem geomorphic feedback iii planning design and policy iv perceptions information and experience v resource access and risk and vi operational water use and management table 1 roy et al 2008 and van de meene et al 2011 described how changes to the built structure demand changes to the social structure i e organizational and power structures the development of new procedures and protocols and sharing responsibilities that distribute the costs and benefits within society they have also asserted that the construction of the environment natural built and social influences actors attitudes experiences and information and affects their access to resources and risks haeffner et al 2018 according to isaw irrigation systems as infrastructure and built components mediate water system characteristics quantity and quality and water related human well being outcomes and affect other structural components on the practical side scholars have employed various techniques and platforms e g multi stage fuzzy stochastic programming multi level and multi objective water allocation models multi criteria decision making methods co engineering participatory gis swot strengths weaknesses opportunities and challenges and or pestle political economic social technological legal and environmental analyses etc to make possible the sharing of knowledge to support water management planning and decision making zhang et al 2020 warner 2006 daniell 2012 liu et al 2017 nazari et al 2018 multiple criteria analysis mca is one promising technique for evaluating options against multiple criteria for water resource management decisions that has attracted massive attention voogd 1982 a large body of literature has acknowledged that mca an effective tool for water management adds structure auditability transparency and rigor to decision making dunning et al 2000 flug et al 2000 nayak and panda 2001 van cauwenbergh et al 2007 huang et al 2011 neissi et al 2020 in this context weistroffer et al 2005 has articulated 79 mca techniques and software packages for structuring problems for multi criteria decision analysis for sustainable water management in practice freitas and magrini 2013 saaty s analytic hierarchy process ahp is one of the most promising multi criteria tools that decision makers have to capture both physical objective and socio economic subjective measures and criteria to assess different alternatives with a minimum of bias gavade 2014 ahp was selected in this study because of its potential to simplify complex and unstructured problems in water management by splitting them into several evaluations of lesser importance without ignoring or losing their components in the decision das et al 2010 to pursue multi criteria decisions for selecting alternative irrigation systems using the analytic hierarchy process this study i describes and analyzes the process of ahp ii identifies the criteria contributing to the selection of irrigation systems among farmers in ardabil iran and iii explains the most relevant results and concluding remarks 2 2 the analytic hierarchy process ahp is typically applied for a multi criteria decision making method that includes structuring multiple choice criteria into a hierarchy evaluating the comparative importance of these criteria comparing options for each criterion and ranking the options gosling and reith 2020 ahp is a technique for running a quantitative comparison to choose the optimum choice by comparing project options in terms of their comparative performance on the criteria of interest after considering the decision makers relative preference or weighting of these criteria ahp forms a single objective function by adding different aspects of the decision problem a comparison is then run between the importance and preference of the decision elements in a pair wise manner in terms of the elements prior to them in the hierarchy evaluators use a nine point scale to show the intensity of a preference for one criterion against another to decrease the complex decision cycle significantly ahp arranges and evaluates the alternatives against a hierarchy of multifaceted objectives ahp minimizes common drawbacks of decision making processes such as lack of focus planning contribution or ownership which over time are costly interruptions that make reaching the right choice difficult naturally ahp can be used to formulate and analyze decisions easily the process was devised to tackle a particular group of problems that prioritize different likely solutions byun 2001 the approach has four main components wind and saaty 1980 1 ahp first separates a complex problem into a hierarchy each level has some controllable elements and each element is further divided into another set of elements the process goes on until the most basic elements of the problem are achieved normally the lowest level of the hierarchy shows the specific course of action e g alternative irrigation systems fig 1 no single general hierarchical structure exists and flexibility is one of the major characteristics of the ahp provided for decision makers 2 to set the priority of elements within each layer of the hierarchy a measurement methodology is applied by asking the decision makers farmer expert to assess each set of elements in a pairwise fashion considering each of the elements in a higher stratum thus the framework is achieved for collecting data and the ahp analysis in terms of structure the hierarchy is divided into a series of paired comparison matrices and participants are asked to assess the off diagonal relationship in one half of each matrix the pairwise comparison uses a nine point scale that is normally used in ahp analysis table 2 each of the comparison matrices assumes the form 1 a a 11 a 12 a z 1 n a 21 a 22 a 2 n a n 1 c y a nn in this matrix aij refers to the pairwise comparison rating for attribute i and attribute j given the mutual property of the matrix if a ij x then a ji 1 x where x 0 only n n 1 2 actual pairwise comparisons are required for an n n comparison matrix saaty 1991 the hierarchy and consistency of the judgmental data of the participants was ranked using a measurement theory at this stage the priorities wind and saaty 1980 quaddus and siddique 2001 and consistency should be determined to prioritize the pairwise comparison of various elements residing at the same level should be made regarding an element from the upper level of the hierarchy a consistency ratio is determined to verify the consistency of judgments based on the properties of reciprocal matrices saaty 1991 confirmed that the largest eigenvalue λmax of a reciprocal matrix is always greater than or equal to n number of rows or columns if there are no inconsistencies in pairwise comparisons then λmax n the more consistent the comparisons are the nearer to n the λmax values will be the quantity λmax n measures the degree of inconsistency within the n n matrix gosling and reith 2020 the consistency index ci that measures the inconsistencies of pairwise comparisons is given by the equation 2 consistency index ci λ max n n 1 inconsistencies are likely to arise when decision makers make careless errors or overstated judgments during the process of pairwise comparison ahp determines a consistency ratio cr by comparing the consistency index ci of the matrix in question the one with our judgments against the consistency index of a random like matrix ri 3 consistency ratio cr ci ri saaty 2013 reported that a consistency ratio cr of 0 10 or less is satisfactory to keep the ahp analysis going if the consistency ratio is greater than 0 10 the judgments should be revised to detect the source of the inconsistency and resolve it then a consistency ratio of 0 1 is considered the satisfactory upper limit hafeez et al 2002 3 collection of individual priorities after the individual priorities of elements of different levels in the previous step have been determined they are totaled to get the overall priorities of the options for this purpose the ahp employs the values entered in the second step to define the top choice for a specific goal after constructing the pairwise comparison matrix the table undergoes normalization by dividing each number in a column of the pairwise comparison matrix by its column sum 3 materials and methods 3 1 characteristics of the study area the study area in this research was yamchi watershed in ardabil province located in the northwest of iran and geographically extending from 37 51 53 to 38 14 33 n and 47 46 26 to 48 05 34 e from mount sabalan in the north to bozghoosh mountains in the south of the study area fig 2 the mean annual precipitation in the main basin of this province is approximately 292 mm year in this watershed the yamchi dam has an effective capacity of 80 million cubic meters mcm and was constructed on the balikhli chay river in the dareh rud river basin imani et al 2014 the total surface of the watershed is 562 7 km2 approximately 71 5 or 402 38 km2 of the area is located in ardabil province and 28 5 or 160 32 km2 is located in east azarbaijan province rangelands make up 51 and agriculture makes up 46 of the total area these are the most common land use types across the entire study area farzadkia et al 2015 in this study data was collected from farmers in the villages of yamchi bala in the upper reaches of the dam yamchi sofla in the lower reaches of the dam and from hemnavar and hamlabad villages in the northwest of ardabil these areas were selected using the snowball technique extension experts agricultural water specialists and representatives from agricultural ngos at the watershed level were also considered for data collection 3 2 methodology this research was conducted in ardabil province iran to collect data several steps were performed fig 3 first 31 indicators of the sustainability impact of irrigation on agriculture were identified according to an inclusive literature review wade 1988 dougherty and hall 1995 cai et al 2003 khan et al 2006 wu et al 2020 calzadilla et al 2011 megersa and abdulahi 2015 rahmani et al 2017 berbel et al 2018 lópez felices et al 2020 table 3 factor analysis was then performed to detect a smaller number of factors explaining most of the variance embedded in the 31 variables next a questionnaire consisting of 31 items measured attitudes toward the impacts of irrigation systems using a seven point scale strongly disagree disagree tend to disagree neutral tend to agree agree strongly agree appendix 1 the maximum weight was given for strongly agree in the case of a favorable attitude and for strongly disagree in the case of an unfavorable attitude snowball sampling a non probability sampling technique was conducted to choose a survey with a sample of 72 extension experts and specialists in sustainable agricultural water development development policymakers academic researchers and state supervisors in the area of sustainable development evaluated the instrument in terms of content and face validity to assure the comprehension of the respondents concerning the sustainability impacts of irrigation systems the reliability of the instrument was tested and resulted in 0 85 which according to hair et al 2010 fell within the acceptable range therefore the current data is relatively reliable to measure participant comprehension of the sustainability impacts of irrigation systems the questionnaire however was modified slightly for further clarity and internal consistency spss software was applied to process the data factor analysis was run to analyze the data that indicated hidden reductions behind the variables as indicators of sustainable agriculture a 0 4 level of significance was set the following results are according to the responses to the survey bartlett s test of sphericity bts was applied to assess the data in terms of suitability for factor analysis according to the results nine factors indicators of sustainability impact of irrigation systems accounted for 73 14 of the total variance during interviews with four groups of participants comprising 15 elite farmers 15 agricultural water specialists 15 extension experts and 15 people from agricultural ngos respondents were asked to determine the relative importance of these indicators impacts while keeping the overall goal in mind a questionnaire with 42 items was used to collect data on nine indicators each question contains a pairwise comparison of two indicators the alternatives pressurized low pressure pipe hydroflume and traditional irrigation systems were then compared with respect to each indicator in a consensus manner after that the decision making software expert choice was applied to analyze the data in this vein the geometric means of the irrigation systems were computed based on their respective sustainability impacts in agriculture the comparison matrix was also entered into expert choice to have the local weights at each level of the hierarchy the results were mixed by an additive value model to reach a set of weights or priorities for the alternatives ultimately the sensitivity analysis was run to specify the effects of changes in the weights of importance of the decision criteria and the measures of performance of the alternatives regarding a single decision criterion at a time on the final ranking of the alternatives veisi et al 2016 singh et al 2020 3 3 irrigation systems modernizing irrigation systems to increase productivity profit and product performance and reduce water consumption have not only become a global trend playán and mateos 2006 but also a necessity irrigation technologies have a lot of potential for increasing water use efficiency for agricultural production especially in the arid and semi arid regions of iran golabi et al 2020 iran has over 40 years of experience in implementing modern irrigation systems e g pressurized sprinkler and drip systems globally many irrigation systems are used and herein they have been divided into three classes conventional surface irrigation systems low pressure irrigation pipe systems hydroflume and pressurized irrigation systems rahmani et al 2017 in dealing with the complexity of the social economic and ecological issues of these systems it is important to make proper decisions regarding new irrigation systems according to the conditions of each region karami 2006 in this research three types of systems i e conventional surface low pressure pipe hydroflume and pressurized sprinkler and drip irrigation systems were considered for dominant crops in the study area cereal potato rotation traditional irrigation is carried out in various ways in iran such as using furrows and flooding these methods entail significant water loss currently with the occurrence of drought in iran and the lack of water resources broad efforts have been implemented to improve water use and its productivity iran now has over 1 5 million ha of irrigated lands equipped with low and pressurized irrigation systems in the study area ardabil province over 221 000 ha of irrigated farms are equipped with low pressure pipe systems and pressurized irrigation systems rahmani et al 2017 4 results 4 1 stage one development of decision hierarchy model the first step of the ahp is achieving a hierarchical network to represent the problem with the overall goal at the top the criteria in the middle and alternatives at the bottom the main aim of this paper is to show which irrigation system pressurized low pressure pipe or hydroflume or traditional would be best for sustainable water management in agricultural systems the overall goal selection of the best irrigation system for sustainable water management was placed at the top level of the analytic hierarchy shown in fig 2 the key criteria for assessing the objective were then identified in the first step nine key criteria were identified resources sustainable management improvement of population profile agricultural development better quality of life productivity mechanization employment and income environmental impact and institutional trust and development finally three alternatives pressurized low pressure pipe hydroflume and traditional irrigation systems were placed at the bottom of the ahp model 4 2 stage two pairwise comparison of criteria at this stage the following four groups were involved in a pairwise comparison of the nine criteria 4 2 1 pairwise comparisons at this step the following four groups participated in a pairwise comparison of the nine criteria as one of the fundamental prerequisites for the achievement of sustainable development is engaging stakeholders in the decision making process unced 1992 their viewpoints had to be considered furthermore a comparison of different irrigation systems based on sustainability components in irrigation projects was also investigated by isolating the studied groups with sensitivity analysis charts in this research the studied groups compared and determined the relative importance of effective factors on the sustainability of irrigation projects in line with the general purpose of explaining and selecting the appropriate irrigation system for sustainable development of the area all participants were first acquainted with the ahp technique and the scoring system their judgments were based on a scale of 1 9 the normalized weights and ranks for the nine criteria regarding the overall goal in every four groups and together are shown in table 4 the results of pairwise comparisons of criteria by the four groups and the overall comparison all participants are shown in performance sensitivity graph where results for each of the three irrigation systems is shown with a different color fig 4 on the x axis the nine criteria used in the model are presented and on the right hand side y axis the contribution of criteria to overall scores of all the irrigation systems alternatives and gradient sensitivity analysis are shown 4 3 elite farmers the results showed that employment and income 0 279 productivity 224 0 and agricultural development 150 0 had the highest impact on decisions regarding irrigation projects from an elite farmer s perspective sustainable management of resources 0 024 institutional trust and development 0 023 and environmental impact 0 022 had the lowest relative weights table 4 in other words employment and income in the region as well as productivity and administrative costs at the level of the agro ecosystem that comes from creating irrigation projects were the most important components for farmers it is also noteworthy that the quality of life component ranked fifth along with income and employment indicating a lack of coordination in the development of rural facilities that could lead to the transfer of capital out of the village to the city and migration because of increased revenues as shown in table 5 pressurized irrigation low pressure pipe systems and traditional irrigation had weights of 0 722 0 187 and 0 091 respectively pressurized irrigation among elite farmers was most important fig 4a the incompatibility ratio for this group was 0 04 which is acceptable 4 3 1 non governmental agricultural organizations the results showed that employment and income 0 225 better quality of life 0 198 and productivity 0 195 had the highest relative weights the lowest relative weights were for environmental impact 0 027 institutional trust and development 0 025 and sustainable resource management 0 025 table 4 in addition based on the results of table 5 pressurized irrigation low pressure pipe systems and traditional methods had weights of 0 689 0 200 and 0 112 respectively therefore pressurized irrigation was chosen as the best irrigation system fig 4b the incompatibility ratio for this group was 0 07 4 3 2 agricultural water specialists in this study agricultural water specialists ais such as academic researchers and advisers provided technical support assistance and advice to farmers on soil and water issues and on managing and operating on farm irrigation systems i e understanding surface irrigation systems and pressurized irrigation systems including micro irrigation and sprinklers based on the results productivity 0 132 improved quality of life 0 193 and employment and income 0 192 had the highest relative weights sustainable resource management 0 025 environmental impact 0 028 and institutional trust and development 0 035 had the lowest relative weights table 4 in other words water specialists held that increasing productivity was the most important criterion for selecting an irrigation system for sustainable water development in agriculture the results showed that pressurized irrigation systems with a weight of 64 7 was the best option among water specialists table 5 however the weight of pressurized irrigation was lower in this group than in other groups and the weight of a low pressure pipe system hydroflume was higher in this group than in other groups this suggests that agricultural water specialists prefer to use low pressure systems hydro flume fig 4c the incompatibility ratio for this group was 0 06 4 3 3 extension experts extension experts or specialists present research based information and solutions in the areas of agriculture food and nutrition environmental sciences and water issues and human development based on the results table 4 employment and income 0 251 improved quality of life 0 205 and productivity 0 192 had the highest impact on decisions regarding irrigation projects conversely environmental impact 0 303 sustainable management of resources 0 026 and institutional trust and development 0 024 carried the lowest weights when it came to decisions about the development of irrigation systems this group had the most weight assigned in terms of the pressurized system 0 708 low pressure pipe system hydroflume 0 190 and traditional irrigation 0 101 table 4 these priorities are shown in fig 4d therefore the pressure driven irrigation system was chosen as a suitable alternative for sustainable agricultural development fig 6 the incompatibility ratio for this group was 0 07 4 3 4 overall groups a sensitivity analysis was accomplished for the four groups of decision makers as a whole the results also determine how stable the decisions for selecting irrigation systems would remain if the weightings of criteria were to be consequently altered blattert et al 2016 an overall analysis of the selection of irrigation systems for the four groups indicated that the pressurized irrigation system 0 695 was the best option for sustainable water management development in agriculture the low pressure irrigation pipe hydroflume with 0 20 and the traditional irrigation system with 0 105 were the second and third choices respectively table 5 the results additionally showed that employment and income 0 246 had the most impact on irrigation decisions productivity 0 209 and improved quality of life 0 165 had the highest weights environmental impact 0 027 institutional trust and development 0 027 and sustainable resource management 0 025 had the lowest weights affecting decisions 5 discussion in this study the ahp technique was applied to assess the views of elite farmers agricultural water specialists extension experts and agricultural non governmental organizations about three irrigation systems in respect to nine indicators for selecting the best irrigation system the results showed that all groups believed that pressurized irrigation systems are the best system this result is consistent with the findings of rahmani et al 2017 that a pressurized irrigation system can be effective technology to improve production by reducing water consumption by as much as 17 and enhancing the return on input a possible explanation for this result is that stakeholders mostly consider water scarcity as a physical and technological issue arising from some ecological exogenous factors such as climate variability and extreme events floods drought and heat waves and thus new technology can ensure future water quantity and quality madani 2014 alizadeh and keshavarz 2005 asserted that this common perception has led to the iranian government helping develop pressurized irrigation systems on farms to manage water consumption and increase irrigation efficiency ghorbani et al 2014 the results of this study also suggest that indicators including employment and income productivity improved quality of life and agricultural expansion had higher relative weights 0 26 0 20 0 16 and 0 14 respectively for the studied groups these findings support previous conclusions that irrigation systems can enhance water efficiency productivity economic advantage and farmer welfare and increase land use and farm ownership raju and pillai 1999 playán and mateos 2006 levidow et al 2014 tal 2016 rahmani et al 2017 a possible argument for this result is that natural and social structures become millstones when it comes to selecting irrigation systems according to isaw in line with this argument hale et al 2018 stated that built structures alter the balance of these processes through the explicit engineering of new paths e g new arable lands as well as by converting land to arable land the current results led to the conclusion that for elite farmers agricultural ngos and extension experts indicators of employment and income are most affected by decisions on irrigation systems agricultural water specialists felt that productivity is the key indicator when choosing the best irrigation system this result is consistent with findings from raju and pillai 1999 implying the priority of productivity by specialists the current results also acknowledge that ahp is a proper tool for making complex decisions about water issues such as selection of alternatives of piss moreover ahp in conjunction with other tools like topsis and sowt can surpass its limitations in depicting important interrelationships among indicators to help make decisions regarding irrigation systems for instance topsis contributes to selecting the best alternatives when results highlight different options zavadskas et al 2016 ahp also can contribute to the formation of participatory platforms like coproduction of knowledge for managing water issues that according to mauser et al 2013 zarei et al 2020 and madani 2014 provide unique opportunities for the transition to a more sustainable management paradigm by improving interactions with local stakeholders and taking their co productive capacity into consideration this process can also fulfill the gaps of epistemology among stakeholders regarding the selection criteria of the irrigation systems reported in this study mauser et al 2013 and zarei et al 2020 indicated that this type of participatory method can increase water productivity improve farm and family livelihood and identify key opportunities to enhance resiliency when facing water scarcity in this sense future research catalyzed by this study may act as a springboard for agencies and researchers to learn how to incorporate stakeholder engagement in their projects as well as deploy other frameworks such as the water food energy nexus hydro economic systems ecohydrology and management and transition the present research however had certain limitations that need to be addressed in future research 1 the current results have only represented the perception of stakeholders and could be advanced with field trials that were physically and financially beyond the scope of this study 2 the present study spans three irrigation systems caution should be taken when using results for the selection of other systems 3 this study considered the perspectives of four groups involved in irrigation projects when evaluating perspectives however it is equally important to know the perspective of other stakeholders such as scientists from different disciplines and stakeholders from the private sector and civil society 6 conclusions given the complexity of water and irrigation issues developing a sophisticated agenda and framework for decision making is critical this article accommodated isaw as a coherent approach based on multi criteria decision analysis for sustainable water management in practice its application and benefits were demonstrated on a case study of the selection of irrigation systems among farmers in ardabil province iran based on the current results it has been concluded that the isaw framework can provide a comprehensive framework when choosing piss and includes all four dimensions of sustainable development in the water sector indicated by pires et al 2017 social economic environmental and institutional in this context isaw reveals how the selection of piss is 0 69 affected by different indicators in the social and natural sub structures i e energy consumption employment and income actors quality of life as well as water

continue to escalate as world populations grow with estimates suggesting humans will number 9 billion by 2050 this continued growth will further increase demands on global food production and consequently on water supplies falkenmark 2013 xu et al 2020 because about 40 of the world s agricultural production uses irrigation approximately 20 of total planted area and dryland systems produce 60 of total production from about 80 of total planted area irrigation is the epicenter of agricultural water management needs and is critical to water and food security darzi naftchali et al 2020 water management is even more important in developing countries where rural livelihoods rely heavily on agriculture and 90 of water withdrawals are for agricultural systems samian et al 2015 zarei et al 2020 water scarcity results mostly from a basic lack of water i e physical water scarcity it may also however stem from the lack of a suitable infrastructure to provide access despite sufficient available resources this is referred to as economic water scarcity or ews bond 2019 grecksch 2021 water scarcity is generally considered from the perspectives of both physical constrictions and economic determinants physical water scarcity means an insufficient amount of freshwater available to meet human needs rijsberman 2006 liu et al 2017 while economic water scarcity refers to the condition in which water resources are physically available but there is a lack of economic and institutional capacity that hinders the ability to make use of that water rosa et al 2020 water comes from either aquifers bws blue water scarcity or soil moisture gws green water scarcity gws is a condition where rainfall cannot meet crop water needs rosa et al 2020 economic water scarcity ews refers to the lack or inefficiency of irrigation due to insufficient investment in infrastructure and institutions and poor water governance in areas where water would otherwise be physically available vallino et al 2020 ews highlights the need to upgrade water development programs to be able to use freshwater resources seckler et al 1999 the technocratic hydraulic engineering approach that led to the hydraulic mission of the 20th century considered infrastructural development as the main factor of water development molle et al 2009 hence the lack of infrastructural development has been at the center of the conceptualization of ews brown et al 2011 this old water governance approach however has been criticized for its inability to deal with socio hydrological dynamics and is often panned for its adverse impacts to the environment and society developing research agendas on adaptive water governance pahl wostl et al 2008 the political ecology of water johnston 2003 water justice sultana 2018 and community governance ostrom 1994 led to a debate on how the relationship between access and restriction ownership and dispossession of water resources are determined by institutional political and power dynamics to understand ews therefore a variety of sociopolitical factors that interact across various scales must be considered ignorance and misleading information about these factors have created a fundamental gap in the way the notion of ews has been integrated into agricultural development to date zarei et al 2020 the efficiency of irrigation systems for example is significantly low in most developed countries fao 2016 and evaporation and percolation are reasons large portions of scarce water end up wasted zarei et al 2020 consequently no one size fits all solution exists that is appropriate for all developing countries in this context there is an emerging consensus that engaging various scientific disciplines plus the active social discourse of the diverse stakeholders are critical for the flexible management of water and agricultural systems frantzeskaki and kabisch 2016 rosa et al 2020 in agreement with this grecksch 2021 indicated that water scarcity management options should be addressed more strongly in collaboration and negotiation among water stakeholders located in the northwest of iran ardabil province has total water resources of about 3407 million m3 of which 3132 million m3 is surface water and 275 million m3 is underground water rahmani et al 2017 while this region has an abundant source of renewable blue water underground water is being used excessively in wasteful ways accordingly it was hypothesized that water issues are rooted in socio economic problems economic water security needs to address the socio economic factors of water management including the environment participation of institutions management instruments and financing vallino et al 2020 when planning measures for sustainable irrigation management and when selecting the best irrigation system drawing on this argument the present study aims to i develop a holistic multicriteria framework that applies the structure actor water framework isaw in combination with the application of the analytical hierarchy process ahp frantzeskaki and kabisch 2016 to develop a boundary object and depict the complex and intertwined aspects of water issues regarding the sustainability impact of different irrigation systems ii explore their implementation by identifying and proposing the most suitable indicators for selecting an irrigation system in the yamchi watershed in ardabil iran and iii assess the reliability of the obtained results with respect to the variation of the criteria weights using sensitivity analysis the article is structured as follows the theoretical framework section describes the chosen conceptual framework and ahp for mapping and considering socioeconomic factors in the decision process in the context of sustainable water management the methodology section provides the step by step procedure followed to undertake the yamchi watershed case study in ardabil province iran the results section shows the outcome of indicators and irrigation systems for each group of participants discussion takes a broad look at the findings and the study as a whole in the context of sustainable water management conclusions and implications provides a summary of the results outlines the limitations and challenges of this study and presents recommendations for future research 2 theoretical framework 2 1 a framework of impact in the sustainable water irrigation systems to embed socioeconomic ecological and physical factors in agricultural water management scholars have developed a great number of models and frameworks such as the social ecological systems framework sesf godden and ison 2019 and the management and transition framework pahl wostl et al 2010 as well as the water food energy nexus ecohydrology socio hydrology sivapalan et al 2012 and economic and hydrologic models to depict the complex and intertwined aspects of water issues among these the sesf is the most inclusive conceptual framework for diagnosing interactions and outcomes in a wide variety of empirical contexts such as food production systems aquaculture systems terrestrial conservation rangeland management watershed management marine conservation marine ecosystem management coastal development irrigation systems energy systems and pollution management partelow 2018 colding and barthel 2019 despite the popularity of sesf critical methodological questions have arisen regarding how the framework can be applied empirically partelow et al 2018 nabavi 2017 addressed these problems as an ontological gap and indicated that the goal of sesf beyond merely identifying social actors is to integrate human and non human actors such as humans other species institutions infrastructure concepts and documents so that they are dynamically networking together in this context hale et al 2015 used the idea of an actor network latour 2007 in addressing this ontological gap in sustainability studies for water systems as a socio ecological system hale et al 2015 developed the practice based model isaw integrating structure actors and water to depict the dynamic interactions between human social and natural components within socio hydrological models isaw postulates that two components work in structured contexts and the three main components of structure natural built and social link the human actors individual and organizational and water system outcomes quality and quantity across different temporal and spatial scales in isaw there are six linkages among two main components i ecological hydrological processes ii ecosystem geomorphic feedback iii planning design and policy iv perceptions information and experience v resource access and risk and vi operational water use and management table 1 roy et al 2008 and van de meene et al 2011 described how changes to the built structure demand changes to the social structure i e organizational and power structures the development of new procedures and protocols and sharing responsibilities that distribute the costs and benefits within society they have also asserted that the construction of the environment natural built and social influences actors attitudes experiences and information and affects their access to resources and risks haeffner et al 2018 according to isaw irrigation systems as infrastructure and built components mediate water system characteristics quantity and quality and water related human well being outcomes and affect other structural components on the practical side scholars have employed various techniques and platforms e g multi stage fuzzy stochastic programming multi level and multi objective water allocation models multi criteria decision making methods co engineering participatory gis swot strengths weaknesses opportunities and challenges and or pestle political economic social technological legal and environmental analyses etc to make possible the sharing of knowledge to support water management planning and decision making zhang et al 2020 warner 2006 daniell 2012 liu et al 2017 nazari et al 2018 multiple criteria analysis mca is one promising technique for evaluating options against multiple criteria for water resource management decisions that has attracted massive attention voogd 1982 a large body of literature has acknowledged that mca an effective tool for water management adds structure auditability transparency and rigor to decision making dunning et al 2000 flug et al 2000 nayak and panda 2001 van cauwenbergh et al 2007 huang et al 2011 neissi et al 2020 in this context weistroffer et al 2005 has articulated 79 mca techniques and software packages for structuring problems for multi criteria decision analysis for sustainable water management in practice freitas and magrini 2013 saaty s analytic hierarchy process ahp is one of the most promising multi criteria tools that decision makers have to capture both physical objective and socio economic subjective measures and criteria to assess different alternatives with a minimum of bias gavade 2014 ahp was selected in this study because of its potential to simplify complex and unstructured problems in water management by splitting them into several evaluations of lesser importance without ignoring or losing their components in the decision das et al 2010 to pursue multi criteria decisions for selecting alternative irrigation systems using the analytic hierarchy process this study i describes and analyzes the process of ahp ii identifies the criteria contributing to the selection of irrigation systems among farmers in ardabil iran and iii explains the most relevant results and concluding remarks 2 2 the analytic hierarchy process ahp is typically applied for a multi criteria decision making method that includes structuring multiple choice criteria into a hierarchy evaluating the comparative importance of these criteria comparing options for each criterion and ranking the options gosling and reith 2020 ahp is a technique for running a quantitative comparison to choose the optimum choice by comparing project options in terms of their comparative performance on the criteria of interest after considering the decision makers relative preference or weighting of these criteria ahp forms a single objective function by adding different aspects of the decision problem a comparison is then run between the importance and preference of the decision elements in a pair wise manner in terms of the elements prior to them in the hierarchy evaluators use a nine point scale to show the intensity of a preference for one criterion against another to decrease the complex decision cycle significantly ahp arranges and evaluates the alternatives against a hierarchy of multifaceted objectives ahp minimizes common drawbacks of decision making processes such as lack of focus planning contribution or ownership which over time are costly interruptions that make reaching the right choice difficult naturally ahp can be used to formulate and analyze decisions easily the process was devised to tackle a particular group of problems that prioritize different likely solutions byun 2001 the approach has four main components wind and saaty 1980 1 ahp first separates a complex problem into a hierarchy each level has some controllable elements and each element is further divided into another set of elements the process goes on until the most basic elements of the problem are achieved normally the lowest level of the hierarchy shows the specific course of action e g alternative irrigation systems fig 1 no single general hierarchical structure exists and flexibility is one of the major characteristics of the ahp provided for decision makers 2 to set the priority of elements within each layer of the hierarchy a measurement methodology is applied by asking the decision makers farmer expert to assess each set of elements in a pairwise fashion considering each of the elements in a higher stratum thus the framework is achieved for collecting data and the ahp analysis in terms of structure the hierarchy is divided into a series of paired comparison matrices and participants are asked to assess the off diagonal relationship in one half of each matrix the pairwise comparison uses a nine point scale that is normally used in ahp analysis table 2 each of the comparison matrices assumes the form 1 a a 11 a 12 a z 1 n a 21 a 22 a 2 n a n 1 c y a nn in this matrix aij refers to the pairwise comparison rating for attribute i and attribute j given the mutual property of the matrix if a ij x then a ji 1 x where x 0 only n n 1 2 actual pairwise comparisons are required for an n n comparison matrix saaty 1991 the hierarchy and consistency of the judgmental data of the participants was ranked using a measurement theory at this stage the priorities wind and saaty 1980 quaddus and siddique 2001 and consistency should be determined to prioritize the pairwise comparison of various elements residing at the same level should be made regarding an element from the upper level of the hierarchy a consistency ratio is determined to verify the consistency of judgments based on the properties of reciprocal matrices saaty 1991 confirmed that the largest eigenvalue λmax of a reciprocal matrix is always greater than or equal to n number of rows or columns if there are no inconsistencies in pairwise comparisons then λmax n the more consistent the comparisons are the nearer to n the λmax values will be the quantity λmax n measures the degree of inconsistency within the n n matrix gosling and reith 2020 the consistency index ci that measures the inconsistencies of pairwise comparisons is given by the equation 2 consistency index ci λ max n n 1 inconsistencies are likely to arise when decision makers make careless errors or overstated judgments during the process of pairwise comparison ahp determines a consistency ratio cr by comparing the consistency index ci of the matrix in question the one with our judgments against the consistency index of a random like matrix ri 3 consistency ratio cr ci ri saaty 2013 reported that a consistency ratio cr of 0 10 or less is satisfactory to keep the ahp analysis going if the consistency ratio is greater than 0 10 the judgments should be revised to detect the source of the inconsistency and resolve it then a consistency ratio of 0 1 is considered the satisfactory upper limit hafeez et al 2002 3 collection of individual priorities after the individual priorities of elements of different levels in the previous step have been determined they are totaled to get the overall priorities of the options for this purpose the ahp employs the values entered in the second step to define the top choice for a specific goal after constructing the pairwise comparison matrix the table undergoes normalization by dividing each number in a column of the pairwise comparison matrix by its column sum 3 materials and methods 3 1 characteristics of the study area the study area in this research was yamchi watershed in ardabil province located in the northwest of iran and geographically extending from 37 51 53 to 38 14 33 n and 47 46 26 to 48 05 34 e from mount sabalan in the north to bozghoosh mountains in the south of the study area fig 2 the mean annual precipitation in the main basin of this province is approximately 292 mm year in this watershed the yamchi dam has an effective capacity of 80 million cubic meters mcm and was constructed on the balikhli chay river in the dareh rud river basin imani et al 2014 the total surface of the watershed is 562 7 km2 approximately 71 5 or 402 38 km2 of the area is located in ardabil province and 28 5 or 160 32 km2 is located in east azarbaijan province rangelands make up 51 and agriculture makes up 46 of the total area these are the most common land use types across the entire study area farzadkia et al 2015 in this study data was collected from farmers in the villages of yamchi bala in the upper reaches of the dam yamchi sofla in the lower reaches of the dam and from hemnavar and hamlabad villages in the northwest of ardabil these areas were selected using the snowball technique extension experts agricultural water specialists and representatives from agricultural ngos at the watershed level were also considered for data collection 3 2 methodology this research was conducted in ardabil province iran to collect data several steps were performed fig 3 first 31 indicators of the sustainability impact of irrigation on agriculture were identified according to an inclusive literature review wade 1988 dougherty and hall 1995 cai et al 2003 khan et al 2006 wu et al 2020 calzadilla et al 2011 megersa and abdulahi 2015 rahmani et al 2017 berbel et al 2018 lópez felices et al 2020 table 3 factor analysis was then performed to detect a smaller number of factors explaining most of the variance embedded in the 31 variables next a questionnaire consisting of 31 items measured attitudes toward the impacts of irrigation systems using a seven point scale strongly disagree disagree tend to disagree neutral tend to agree agree strongly agree appendix 1 the maximum weight was given for strongly agree in the case of a favorable attitude and for strongly disagree in the case of an unfavorable attitude snowball sampling a non probability sampling technique was conducted to choose a survey with a sample of 72 extension experts and specialists in sustainable agricultural water development development policymakers academic researchers and state supervisors in the area of sustainable development evaluated the instrument in terms of content and face validity to assure the comprehension of the respondents concerning the sustainability impacts of irrigation systems the reliability of the instrument was tested and resulted in 0 85 which according to hair et al 2010 fell within the acceptable range therefore the current data is relatively reliable to measure participant comprehension of the sustainability impacts of irrigation systems the questionnaire however was modified slightly for further clarity and internal consistency spss software was applied to process the data factor analysis was run to analyze the data that indicated hidden reductions behind the variables as indicators of sustainable agriculture a 0 4 level of significance was set the following results are according to the responses to the survey bartlett s test of sphericity bts was applied to assess the data in terms of suitability for factor analysis according to the results nine factors indicators of sustainability impact of irrigation systems accounted for 73 14 of the total variance during interviews with four groups of participants comprising 15 elite farmers 15 agricultural water specialists 15 extension experts and 15 people from agricultural ngos respondents were asked to determine the relative importance of these indicators impacts while keeping the overall goal in mind a questionnaire with 42 items was used to collect data on nine indicators each question contains a pairwise comparison of two indicators the alternatives pressurized low pressure pipe hydroflume and traditional irrigation systems were then compared with respect to each indicator in a consensus manner after that the decision making software expert choice was applied to analyze the data in this vein the geometric means of the irrigation systems were computed based on their respective sustainability impacts in agriculture the comparison matrix was also entered into expert choice to have the local weights at each level of the hierarchy the results were mixed by an additive value model to reach a set of weights or priorities for the alternatives ultimately the sensitivity analysis was run to specify the effects of changes in the weights of importance of the decision criteria and the measures of performance of the alternatives regarding a single decision criterion at a time on the final ranking of the alternatives veisi et al 2016 singh et al 2020 3 3 irrigation systems modernizing irrigation systems to increase productivity profit and product performance and reduce water consumption have not only become a global trend playán and mateos 2006 but also a necessity irrigation technologies have a lot of potential for increasing water use efficiency for agricultural production especially in the arid and semi arid regions of iran golabi et al 2020 iran has over 40 years of experience in implementing modern irrigation systems e g pressurized sprinkler and drip systems globally many irrigation systems are used and herein they have been divided into three classes conventional surface irrigation systems low pressure irrigation pipe systems hydroflume and pressurized irrigation systems rahmani et al 2017 in dealing with the complexity of the social economic and ecological issues of these systems it is important to make proper decisions regarding new irrigation systems according to the conditions of each region karami 2006 in this research three types of systems i e conventional surface low pressure pipe hydroflume and pressurized sprinkler and drip irrigation systems were considered for dominant crops in the study area cereal potato rotation traditional irrigation is carried out in various ways in iran such as using furrows and flooding these methods entail significant water loss currently with the occurrence of drought in iran and the lack of water resources broad efforts have been implemented to improve water use and its productivity iran now has over 1 5 million ha of irrigated lands equipped with low and pressurized irrigation systems in the study area ardabil province over 221 000 ha of irrigated farms are equipped with low pressure pipe systems and pressurized irrigation systems rahmani et al 2017 4 results 4 1 stage one development of decision hierarchy model the first step of the ahp is achieving a hierarchical network to represent the problem with the overall goal at the top the criteria in the middle and alternatives at the bottom the main aim of this paper is to show which irrigation system pressurized low pressure pipe or hydroflume or traditional would be best for sustainable water management in agricultural systems the overall goal selection of the best irrigation system for sustainable water management was placed at the top level of the analytic hierarchy shown in fig 2 the key criteria for assessing the objective were then identified in the first step nine key criteria were identified resources sustainable management improvement of population profile agricultural development better quality of life productivity mechanization employment and income environmental impact and institutional trust and development finally three alternatives pressurized low pressure pipe hydroflume and traditional irrigation systems were placed at the bottom of the ahp model 4 2 stage two pairwise comparison of criteria at this stage the following four groups were involved in a pairwise comparison of the nine criteria 4 2 1 pairwise comparisons at this step the following four groups participated in a pairwise comparison of the nine criteria as one of the fundamental prerequisites for the achievement of sustainable development is engaging stakeholders in the decision making process unced 1992 their viewpoints had to be considered furthermore a comparison of different irrigation systems based on sustainability components in irrigation projects was also investigated by isolating the studied groups with sensitivity analysis charts in this research the studied groups compared and determined the relative importance of effective factors on the sustainability of irrigation projects in line with the general purpose of explaining and selecting the appropriate irrigation system for sustainable development of the area all participants were first acquainted with the ahp technique and the scoring system their judgments were based on a scale of 1 9 the normalized weights and ranks for the nine criteria regarding the overall goal in every four groups and together are shown in table 4 the results of pairwise comparisons of criteria by the four groups and the overall comparison all participants are shown in performance sensitivity graph where results for each of the three irrigation systems is shown with a different color fig 4 on the x axis the nine criteria used in the model are presented and on the right hand side y axis the contribution of criteria to overall scores of all the irrigation systems alternatives and gradient sensitivity analysis are shown 4 3 elite farmers the results showed that employment and income 0 279 productivity 224 0 and agricultural development 150 0 had the highest impact on decisions regarding irrigation projects from an elite farmer s perspective sustainable management of resources 0 024 institutional trust and development 0 023 and environmental impact 0 022 had the lowest relative weights table 4 in other words employment and income in the region as well as productivity and administrative costs at the level of the agro ecosystem that comes from creating irrigation projects were the most important components for farmers it is also noteworthy that the quality of life component ranked fifth along with income and employment indicating a lack of coordination in the development of rural facilities that could lead to the transfer of capital out of the village to the city and migration because of increased revenues as shown in table 5 pressurized irrigation low pressure pipe systems and traditional irrigation had weights of 0 722 0 187 and 0 091 respectively pressurized irrigation among elite farmers was most important fig 4a the incompatibility ratio for this group was 0 04 which is acceptable 4 3 1 non governmental agricultural organizations the results showed that employment and income 0 225 better quality of life 0 198 and productivity 0 195 had the highest relative weights the lowest relative weights were for environmental impact 0 027 institutional trust and development 0 025 and sustainable resource management 0 025 table 4 in addition based on the results of table 5 pressurized irrigation low pressure pipe systems and traditional methods had weights of 0 689 0 200 and 0 112 respectively therefore pressurized irrigation was chosen as the best irrigation system fig 4b the incompatibility ratio for this group was 0 07 4 3 2 agricultural water specialists in this study agricultural water specialists ais such as academic researchers and advisers provided technical support assistance and advice to farmers on soil and water issues and on managing and operating on farm irrigation systems i e understanding surface irrigation systems and pressurized irrigation systems including micro irrigation and sprinklers based on the results productivity 0 132 improved quality of life 0 193 and employment and income 0 192 had the highest relative weights sustainable resource management 0 025 environmental impact 0 028 and institutional trust and development 0 035 had the lowest relative weights table 4 in other words water specialists held that increasing productivity was the most important criterion for selecting an irrigation system for sustainable water development in agriculture the results showed that pressurized irrigation systems with a weight of 64 7 was the best option among water specialists table 5 however the weight of pressurized irrigation was lower in this group than in other groups and the weight of a low pressure pipe system hydroflume was higher in this group than in other groups this suggests that agricultural water specialists prefer to use low pressure systems hydro flume fig 4c the incompatibility ratio for this group was 0 06 4 3 3 extension experts extension experts or specialists present research based information and solutions in the areas of agriculture food and nutrition environmental sciences and water issues and human development based on the results table 4 employment and income 0 251 improved quality of life 0 205 and productivity 0 192 had the highest impact on decisions regarding irrigation projects conversely environmental impact 0 303 sustainable management of resources 0 026 and institutional trust and development 0 024 carried the lowest weights when it came to decisions about the development of irrigation systems this group had the most weight assigned in terms of the pressurized system 0 708 low pressure pipe system hydroflume 0 190 and traditional irrigation 0 101 table 4 these priorities are shown in fig 4d therefore the pressure driven irrigation system was chosen as a suitable alternative for sustainable agricultural development fig 6 the incompatibility ratio for this group was 0 07 4 3 4 overall groups a sensitivity analysis was accomplished for the four groups of decision makers as a whole the results also determine how stable the decisions for selecting irrigation systems would remain if the weightings of criteria were to be consequently altered blattert et al 2016 an overall analysis of the selection of irrigation systems for the four groups indicated that the pressurized irrigation system 0 695 was the best option for sustainable water management development in agriculture the low pressure irrigation pipe hydroflume with 0 20 and the traditional irrigation system with 0 105 were the second and third choices respectively table 5 the results additionally showed that employment and income 0 246 had the most impact on irrigation decisions productivity 0 209 and improved quality of life 0 165 had the highest weights environmental impact 0 027 institutional trust and development 0 027 and sustainable resource management 0 025 had the lowest weights affecting decisions 5 discussion in this study the ahp technique was applied to assess the views of elite farmers agricultural water specialists extension experts and agricultural non governmental organizations about three irrigation systems in respect to nine indicators for selecting the best irrigation system the results showed that all groups believed that pressurized irrigation systems are the best system this result is consistent with the findings of rahmani et al 2017 that a pressurized irrigation system can be effective technology to improve production by reducing water consumption by as much as 17 and enhancing the return on input a possible explanation for this result is that stakeholders mostly consider water scarcity as a physical and technological issue arising from some ecological exogenous factors such as climate variability and extreme events floods drought and heat waves and thus new technology can ensure future water quantity and quality madani 2014 alizadeh and keshavarz 2005 asserted that this common perception has led to the iranian government helping develop pressurized irrigation systems on farms to manage water consumption and increase irrigation efficiency ghorbani et al 2014 the results of this study also suggest that indicators including employment and income productivity improved quality of life and agricultural expansion had higher relative weights 0 26 0 20 0 16 and 0 14 respectively for the studied groups these findings support previous conclusions that irrigation systems can enhance water efficiency productivity economic advantage and farmer welfare and increase land use and farm ownership raju and pillai 1999 playán and mateos 2006 levidow et al 2014 tal 2016 rahmani et al 2017 a possible argument for this result is that natural and social structures become millstones when it comes to selecting irrigation systems according to isaw in line with this argument hale et al 2018 stated that built structures alter the balance of these processes through the explicit engineering of new paths e g new arable lands as well as by converting land to arable land the current results led to the conclusion that for elite farmers agricultural ngos and extension experts indicators of employment and income are most affected by decisions on irrigation systems agricultural water specialists felt that productivity is the key indicator when choosing the best irrigation system this result is consistent with findings from raju and pillai 1999 implying the priority of productivity by specialists the current results also acknowledge that ahp is a proper tool for making complex decisions about water issues such as selection of alternatives of piss moreover ahp in conjunction with other tools like topsis and sowt can surpass its limitations in depicting important interrelationships among indicators to help make decisions regarding irrigation systems for instance topsis contributes to selecting the best alternatives when results highlight different options zavadskas et al 2016 ahp also can contribute to the formation of participatory platforms like coproduction of knowledge for managing water issues that according to mauser et al 2013 zarei et al 2020 and madani 2014 provide unique opportunities for the transition to a more sustainable management paradigm by improving interactions with local stakeholders and taking their co productive capacity into consideration this process can also fulfill the gaps of epistemology among stakeholders regarding the selection criteria of the irrigation systems reported in this study mauser et al 2013 and zarei et al 2020 indicated that this type of participatory method can increase water productivity improve farm and family livelihood and identify key opportunities to enhance resiliency when facing water scarcity in this sense future research catalyzed by this study may act as a springboard for agencies and researchers to learn how to incorporate stakeholder engagement in their projects as well as deploy other frameworks such as the water food energy nexus hydro economic systems ecohydrology and management and transition the present research however had certain limitations that need to be addressed in future research 1 the current results have only represented the perception of stakeholders and could be advanced with field trials that were physically and financially beyond the scope of this study 2 the present study spans three irrigation systems caution should be taken when using results for the selection of other systems 3 this study considered the perspectives of four groups involved in irrigation projects when evaluating perspectives however it is equally important to know the perspective of other stakeholders such as scientists from different disciplines and stakeholders from the private sector and civil society 6 conclusions given the complexity of water and irrigation issues developing a sophisticated agenda and framework for decision making is critical this article accommodated isaw as a coherent approach based on multi criteria decision analysis for sustainable water management in practice its application and benefits were demonstrated on a case study of the selection of irrigation systems among farmers in ardabil province iran based on the current results it has been concluded that the isaw framework can provide a comprehensive framework when choosing piss and includes all four dimensions of sustainable development in the water sector indicated by pires et al 2017 social economic environmental and institutional in this context isaw reveals how the selection of piss is 0 69 affected by different indicators in the social and natural sub structures i e energy consumption employment and income actors quality of life as well as water

9531,developing water saving agriculture must balance the interests of stakeholders in terms of economic benefits food and ecological security objectives the production based water footprint pwf the energy based water footprint ewf and the net benefits based water footprint nbwf including grey water footprint gwf can be used to evaluate food and ecological security water use efficiency and benefits objectives however little attention is paid to the multi dimensional evaluation of water consumption in agriculture this study quantified the annual pwf ewf and nbwf of grain crops cash crops and feed crops in the hetao irrigation district hid over 1995 2017 and analyzed their spatiotemporal evolution characteristics and comparative advantages then clarified the implications of the three types of water footprints for stakeholders in the hid for crop planning the results showed the water use efficiency was decreasing and the benefits were increasing the gwf deserves more attention as it contributed 35 40 of the total water footprint the comparative advantages of the three water footprints revealed that the current crop distribution in the hid only favors benefits considering the crop distribution issues in the hid the adjustment objectives can be determined by combining the connotations of the three types of water footprints gwf pwfblue green ewfblue green and nbwfblue green corresponding to stakeholders environmental and social economic interests this study could provide basic guidance for crop planning and agricultural water management in the hid and similar areas

focused on the water footprint of crop production including the production based water footprint m3 kg the energy based water footprint m3 kcal and the benefits based water footprint m3 usd which are the amount of water consumed to produce unit production unit energy and unit economic benefits of agricultural products respectively hoekstra et al 2011 research on the water footprint of crop production includes research scales and methods sustainability assessment and developing response strategies the research methods are mainly divided into the life cycle assessment method lca and the water footprint network wfn vanham and bidoglio 2013 based on the wfn hoekstra et al 2011 considered the water footprint as a volumetric approach that focused on water productivity the water footprint of an individual community or enterprise is defined as the total volume of freshwater used to produce commodities and services consumed by the individual or community or produced by the enterprise in parallel the lca approach based on the international standard for water footprint iso 14046 defined the water footprint as an indicator that quantifies the potential environmental impacts associated with water bayart et al 2010 iso 14046 2014 in conclusion the ultimate results with the lca approach presented are potential impacts rather than water consumption boulay et al 2013 vanham 2016 pfister et al 2017 therefore the wfn approach was applied in this study as it was necessary to quantify crop water consumption during the growth stage the sustainability evaluation of agricultural production mainly concentrates on three fields first the sustainability of regional water resources was evaluated by using the water scarcity index to explain whether the regional blue water consumption exceeds the blue water available in the region when the blue water consumption exceeded the regional available blue water it was unsustainable joseph et al 2020 zhao et al 2011 2018 second the pwf was combined with other social indicators population education level etc economic indicators gdp and ecological indicators greenhouse gas emissions fertilizer consumption etc to assess the sustainability of regional agricultural production carvalho et al 2021 ma et al 2021 third the pwf and nbwf were combined for evaluating the sustainability of regional agricultural production yang et al 2021 calculated the pwf and nbwf of major crops in china and proposed the synergy index of those water footprints the study found that the efficiency and benefits of development in the arid regions of northwest china were unbalanced in arid and water scarce areas blue water was often prioritized for crops with high economic value chouchane et al 2015 schyns and hoekstra 2014 the economic benefits are one of the factors that dominate the allocation of freshwater resources to evaluate the rationality of water use efficiency and benefits some scholars evaluated pwf and nbwf with red jujube date palms wheat grape and almond in arid and water scarce areas and provided a reference for decision makers to formulate appropriate sustainable development strategies bazrafshan et al 2020 fulton et al 2019 miglietta et al 2018 sun et al 2016 yu et al 2020 crop structure adjustment can improve water productivity water use efficiency and energy efficiency kahramanoğlu et al 2020 nouri et al 2020 which can achieve water reallocation in space time therefore scholars have suggested that sustainable development of the agricultural crop industry can be realized by adjusting the crop structure chouchane et al 2020 sun et al 2014 water footprint includes green blue and grey water footprint gwf the gwf quantifies the total freshwater resources required to dilute pollutants to maintain water quality standards which can quantitatively describe the extent of water pollution and reflect the ecological aspects of sustainable development studies have shown that the gwf of crops accounted for three quarters of the global gwf lovarelli et al 2016 china consumed nearly one third of global nitrogen fertilizer huang et al 2017 and gwf has gradually increased zhang et al 2019 however the ability of the natural freshwater system to absorb pollutants decreased annually and the natural environment has deteriorated therefore gwf should be emphasized in the research currently comprehensive research on pwf nbwf and ewf are missing gwf is frequently not considered in such research however the connotation and evaluation objectives of ewf pwf and nbwf are different agricultural production has comprehensive social economic ecological benefits and a single index evaluation is insufficient combining the three water footprints and gwf can comprehensively evaluate the characteristics of water utilization in agricultural production providing the indicator basis for decision makers to formulate feasible measures to realize sustainable agricultural development in this study the aquacrop model is used to quantify pwf ewf and nbwf of 14 crops in the hid from 1995 to 2017 the temporal variation trend of the three types of water footprints is analyzed by the m k test the comparative advantage index is proposed to evaluate the advantage of the water footprints of the crops according to the sustainable development interests of stakeholders in the hid the significance of pwfbg ewfbg nbwfbg and gwf to stakeholders is clarified 2 methods and data 2 1 study area the hid is located in the hetao plain of the yellow river in northern china which is an important part of the ecological boundary in northern china and includes five areas dengkou hangjinhouqi linhe wuyuan and wulateqianqi fig 1a the hid is an important commodity grain and oil production district of china and the inner mongolia autonomous region the main irrigation method in the hid is surface irrigation and the yellow river is the major water source for agriculture irrigation from 1995 2017 the hid withdrew 4 74 billion m3 of water annually from the yellow river of which 4 45 billion m3 was used for agricultural irrigation accounting for 93 9 of the total water diversion while crops consumed only 40 of the irrigation water during the growth stage sun et al 2016 by 2017 the water diversion decreased by 7 while the planting area increased by 59 the hid has low precipitation and high evaporation with an average annual precipitation of 140 230 mm and average annual evaporation of 2400 mm fig 1b the hid is a typical region where there is no agriculture without irrigation in 2017 44 of the cultivated areas were grain crops 55 cash crops and 1 feed crops the main crops planted in the hid are spring wheat maize and sunflower which account for 25 3 27 7 and 26 6 of the total sown area respectively tomato a specialty crop of the hid is mainly used to produce tomato paste that is exported to other countries and its planted area accounts for 3 3 from 1995 2017 the application amount of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer in the hid increased almost by 60 fig 1c while the bayannaoer government website https nmj bynr gov cn showed that the utilization rate of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer in bayannaoer city was only 35 and 22 5 respectively the leaching of chemical fertilizers and pesticides led to groundwater quality deterioration 2 2 calculation of production based water footprint the aquacrop model is a water driven crop water productivity model developed by fao steduto et al 2009 the aquacrop model achieves a balance between simplicity accuracy and robustness with few explicit parameters and intuitive input variables it has been applied extensively for water footprint calculations chouchane et al 2018 davis et al 2017b li et al 2021 lu et al 2016 mao et al 2021 the aquacrop model was used to simulate daily soil water balance and yield the soil water balance of the aquacrop model was expressed as 1 s t s t 1 p r t i r r t c r t e t t r o t d p t where s t is the soil water content on day t mm p r t is the rainfall on day t mm i r r t is the irrigation on day t mm c r t is the capillary rise from groundwater on day t mm e t t is the actual evapotranspiration on day t mm r o t is the surface runoff on day t mm d p t is the deep percolation on day t mm it depends on soil drainage capacity when the soil water content is below or equal to the field capacity the deep percolation is equal to 0 raes et al 2018 r o t was obtained through soil conservation service curve number methodology rallison 1980 2 r o t p r t 0 2 s 2 p r t s 0 2 s where s is the potential maximum storage mm the aquacrop model can distinguish the inflow and outflow of soil moisture in the root zone boundary and divide the soil moisture in the root zone into blue and green fractions chukalla et al 2015 3 s g r e e n t s g r e e n t 1 p r t r o t p r t p r t i r r t d p t e t t s g r e e n t 1 s t 1 4 s b l u e i t s b l u e i t 1 i r r t r o t i r r t p r t i r r t d p

end of day t from rainfall mm s b l u e i t and s b l u e c t are the blue water content at the end of day t from irrigation and groundwater respectively mm the blue and green water components of the crop growth stage are obtained from the accumulation of daily soil water content respectively the green and blue water in the evapotranspiration during the growth stage were calculated as 7 c w u g r

phosphate fertilizer kg ha c max is the maximum acceptable concentration of the nutrient in the receiving water body c min is the natural background concentration of the receiving water body according to the surface water environmental quality standard gb 3838 2002 for class iii water the c max for n was 1 mg l for p was 0 05 mg l pwf consists of three parts 12 p w f p w f g r e e n p w f b l u e p w f g r e y the crops include grain crops spring wheat maize sorghum soybean mixed bean cash crops sunflower tomato seed melon vegetable sugar beet muskmelon watermelon flaxseed and feed crops forage the period of crop yield simulation with aquacrop 6 0 was from december 1 1994 to december 31 2017 considering that the autumn and spring irrigation in the hid replenishes the soil water content in time we assumed that the soil water content was at field capacity on december 1 1994 feng et al 2003 nouri et al 2019 therefore the initial proportion of blue and green water was the ratio of autumn irrigation to the rainfall at this time the model was calibrated using the yield data from 1995 to 2005 based on the qi county scale and the yield data from 2006 to 2017 was used to verify the accuracy of the model calibration the root mean square error was used to quantify the error between the model simulation results and the actual yield for evaluating the simulation accuracy and the model applicability 2 3 calculation of energy and net benefits based water footprint based on hoekstra et al 2011 ewf and nbwf were calculated as 13 e w f p w f u e 14 n b w f p w f u b where ue is the energy per unit yield of the crop kcal kg ub is the net benefits per unit yield of the crop usd kg in conclusion the steps to calculate the pwf ewf and nbwf are shown in fig 2 2 4 calculation of comparative advantage index the comparative advantage index reflects the water footprint of different crops relative to the weighted average water footprint of 14 crops in the hid expressed as the ratio of the water footprint of different crops to the total water footprint 15 a i p p w f i i 1 14 p w f i p r o d u c t i o n i p r o d u c t i o n i 16 a i e e w f i i 1 14 e w f i p r o d u c t i

pwf ewf and nbwf respectively production is the total yield ton the number of crop species is i when the comparative advantage index is below 1 the crop has a comparative advantage otherwise it has no comparative advantage 2 5 data sources the meteorological data daily rainfall daily average humidity daily average wind speed duration of sunshine daily minimum temperature and maximum temperature were derived from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn the time and maximum root depth of each growth stage were obtained from the bayannaoer agriculture and animal husbandry network http nmyj bynr gov cn and field surveys the soil texture was obtained from nachtergaele et al 2009 the harvest index was derived from xie et al 2011 crop yield crop planting area production and agriculture input pesticide usage and fertilizer application amount were obtained from hetao irrigation district statistical data nbsc 1995 the yield calculation methods in the yearbook used were beans were calculated as dry beans for potatoes as fresh production with high water content including sweet potatoes and potatoes excluding taro and cassava 5 kg was converted to 1 kg of grain potatoes used as vegetables were counted as fresh products the energy per 100 g of crops were obtained from the usda nutrient database gebhardt et al 2006 the net benefits were calculated based on the total revenue from crop acquisition minus the total input cost of the means of production and then converted to usd the exchange rate was derived from chinamoney 2021 the index of agricultural products purchase prices and the price index of agricultural means of production were all converted into prices based on 1995 the index of agricultural products purchase prices the price index of agricultural means of production the crop purchase price and the price of production materials in 1995 were derived from hetao irrigation district statistical data nbsc 1995 3 results 3 1 temporal and spatial evolution of pwf 3 1 1 interannual variation of pwf of major crops spring wheat maize and sunflower are the main crops and tomato is the specialty crop therefore these four crops were selected to analyze their interannual variation the pwf of spring wheat and maize showed an upward trend from 1995 to 2016 with a significant p 0 05 upward trend in the pwf of maize fig 3a fig 3b during this period the pwf of spring wheat and maize increased by 0 9 and 15 9 respectively due to heavy rainfall and hailstorms in 2017 yields of spring wheat and maize decreased by 25 1 and 30 1 respectively compared to 2016 the reduced crop yields in 2017 resulted in a 42 5 increase in pwf for spring wheat and a 38 0 increase for maize the pwf of sunflower and tomato increased significantly from 1995 to 2017 p 0 05 fig 3c fig 3d pwf increased by 89 8 as the sunflower yield decreased by 36 1 the pwf of tomato fluctuated greatly due to inclement weather with an increasing trend from 2000 to 2012 and a decreasing trend after 2012 in general the water use efficiency of major crops in the hid decreased during the study period the hid has low rainfall and pwfgreen accounts for a relatively low proportion of the total water footprint the average pwfgreen share of these four crops was 7 4 10 2 pwfblue accounted for 55 1 59 2 and pwfgrey accounted for 33 2 36 2 decreasing the blue water footprint and grey water footprint plays a major role in water conservation in the hid 3 1 2 patiotemporal evolution of pwf of grain cash and feed crops from 1995 2016 pwf pwfgreen pwfblue and pwfgrey of the grain crop all showed a downward trend and reached a significant level except for pwfgrey p 0 05 fig 4a in 2017 grain crop yields were only 73 2 of that in 2016 and thus pwf increased by 37 3 year on year the pwf of cash crops went through three stages 1995 1999 1999 2008 and 2008 2017 fig 4b in these three stages pwfgreen pwfblue and pwfgrey of feed crops showed a trend of increasing decreasing and then increasing during 2004 2014 the government was actively supporting the tomato industry while due to the large tomato production and low water footprint the pwf of cash crops was at a lower level in this stage the pwf pwfgreen pwfblue and pwfgrey of feed crops showed an upward trend from 2001 to 2017 and the trend of pwf and pwfgrey reached a significant level p 0 05 fig 4c in terms of spatial distribution the area with the highest pwf for grain crops was wuyuan and the lowest area was linhe fig 4d the average pwf for cash crops in wulateqianqi was the highest and the lowest in hangjinhouqi fig 4e the average pwf of feed crops was the highest in dengkou and lowest in hangjinhouqi fig 4f the most abundant rainfall during the study period in wulateqianqi resulted in the largest proportion of pwfgreen the pwfgreen accounted for the largest proportion of cash crops at 11 6 fig 4e the average grey water footprint of grain cash and feed crops in the hid was about 35 0 3 2 temporal and spatial evolution of ewf 3 2 1 interannual variation of ewf of major crops the trend of ewf was similar to that of pwf the pwf of spring wheat and maize showed an upward trend from 1995 to 2016 and the ewf of maize also had a significant upward trend p 0 05 the ewf of spring wheat increased by 0 9 and the ewf of maize increased by 15 8 fig 5a fig 5b in 2017 the ewf of spring wheat and maize increased by 42 5 and 38 year on year respectively the ewf of sunflower increased by 78 4 fig 5c and the ewf of tomato increased by 0 1 between 1995 and 2017 fig 5d similarly lower tomato yields due to heavy rainfall and flooding resulted in larger ewf for tomato in 2006 2007 and 2012 fig 5d in terms of water footprint composition tomato had the largest ewfblue among the four crops accounting for 58 8 of the total ewf while tomato also had a smaller ewfgreen accounting for 7 7 the ewfgrey accounted for the largest proportion of the ewf of maize at 36 2 although the trends of pwf and ewf were the same pwf and ewf varied for the same crop higher pwf did not mean higher ewf sunflower had the largest pwf while spring wheat had the largest ewf 3 2 2 spatiotemporal evolution of ewf of grain cash and feed crops similarly the trends of ewf for grain crops cash crops and feed crops were the same as pwf fig 6 from 1995 2016 the ewf ewfgreen ewfblue and ewfgrey of grain crops all showed a downward trend except for ewfgrey and the downward trend reached a significant level p 0 05 fig 6a the trend of ewf of cash crops also experienced an upward downward and then upward trend fig 6b similarly the low level of ewf from 2004 to 2012 was associated with the increase in the tomato planting area ewf ewfgreen ewfblue and ewfgrey of feed crops showed an upward trend from 2001 to 2017 and ewf ewfgrey reached a significant level p 0 05 fig 6c in terms of spatial distribution wuyuan had the largest ewf for grain crops fig 6d wulateqianqi had the largest ewf for cash crops fig 6e and dengkou had the largest ewf for feed crops fig 6f in terms of water footprint composition the average proportion of ewfgreen in wulateqianqi was the highest 10 3 and hangjinhouqi was the lowest 7 9 the highest average proportion of ewfblue was in linhe 56 2 and lowest in dengkou 52 and the highest average proportion of ewfgrey was 39 6 in dengkou fig 6d fig 6e fig 6f 3 3 temporal and spatial evolution of nbwf 3 3 1 interannual variation of nbwf of major crops the nbwf of spring wheat maize and tomato showed a significant downward trend during 1995 2017 while that of sunflower showed a significant upward trend p 0 05 fig 7 except for tomato the nbwf of the remaining three crops fluctuated significantly with the net benefits of spring wheat decreased by 33 9 and its nbwf reached a maximum in 2001 the nbwf of spring wheat reached its minimum in 2014 after a more than two fold increase in net benefits from 2001 to 2014 fig 7a fig 7d net benefits from maize increased by 111 3 by 2014 when the nbwf for maize dropped to its lowest point fig 7b the nbwf for sunflower fluctuated greatly and went through three stages an upward trend from 1995 to 2004 2015 2017 and a downward trend from 2004 to 2015 fig 7c among the four crops spring wheat has the highest nbwfgreen nbwfblue and nbwfgrey and tomato has the lowest value 3 3 2 spatiotemporal evolution of nbwf of grain cash and feed crops during 1995 2017 nbwf nbwfgreen nbwfblue and nbwfgrey of grain crops cash crops and feed crops all showed a significant downward trend p 0 05 fig 8 as the net benefits increased 44 58 for grain crops 22 9 for cash crops 77 5 for feed crops the nbwf decreased by 9 3 for grain crops fig 8 a 14 7 for cash crops fig 8 b and 15 2 for feed crops fig 8c the changes in both grain crops and cash crops experienced an upward and then downward trend followed by an upward trend feed crops showed a downward trend from 2001 to 2013 and an upward trend after 2013 the average nbwf was largest for grain crops and lowest for feed crops in terms of spatial distribution the highest nbwf for grain crops and cash crops was located in wulateqianqi and the lowest was located in hangjinhouqi fig 8d fig 8e the nbwf of feed crops was the largest in wuyuan and the lowest in hangjinhouqi fig 8f in terms of water footprint composition the areas with the largest proportion of nbwfgreen for grain crops cash crops and feed crops were all located in wulateqianqi accounting for 9 2 11 6 and 10 6 respectively fig 8d fig 8e fig 8f the higher green water percentage in wulateqianqi was mainly due to the abundant precipitation linhe had less precipitation so the nbwfgreen was relatively low with an nbwfgreen of less than 8 for all three crops the areas with the highest nbwfgrey for both grain crops and cash crops were located in wuyuan 36 0 and 31 3 respectively and the region with the highest nbwfgrey for feed crops was dengkou 38 6 fig 8d fig 8e fig 8f 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of the results with other methods in this research the aquacrop model was applied to quantify the water footprint at the field scale the field scale water footprint consists of transpiration and evaporation based on the soil water balance principle transpiration and evaporation were derived from precipitation irrigation and groundwater during the growth stage the aquacrop model has the advantage of distinguishing blue and green water from evaporation and transpiration and considering the stress of environmental conditions upon crop growth allowing for more accurate daily blue and green water footprints the cropwat model calculates the crop blue and green water from evaporation and transpiration by the empirical formula while the swat model is a hydrological model which needs to be combined with a crop model to accurately simulate the water required for crop growth furthermore the aquacrop model is calculated with a daily time step which can display the impact of daily water deficit during the crop growth stage in general the aquacrop model provides a more reasonable calculation of actual water consumption during the growth stage compared to the swat and cropwat models the suitable groundwater depth for crop growth in the hid is 1 5 2 m xu et al 2010 and the average depth of groundwater in the hid is 2 m during the study period indicating that groundwater is also part of the blue water footprint while the cropwat model cannot take groundwater recharge into account table 1 compares the results of this study with previous studies luan et al 2018 quantified the water footprints of spring wheat maize and sunflower in the hid including irrigation canal losses field seepage and drainage based on a regional scale using the swat model sun 2013 adopted the cropwat model to calculate the water footprints of spring wheat maize sunflower tomato vegetable coarse grain and sugar beet at a regional scale mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 applied the cropwat model to quantify the global water footprint of crop production at a field scale their result showed that the water footprint decreased from 1996 to 2002 while our study period was 1995 2017 it is reasonable that our results are lower than theirs nevertheless the results of this study differ from those of other studies due to geographical location climatic conditions and caculation methods overall the results of the present study appear to be reliable 4 2 necessity of considering grey water footprint the average annual proportion of pwfgrey was 35 both ewfgrey and nbwfgrey accounted for approximately 40 of the total water footprint non point source pollution in crop production was becoming more pronounced during the study period the main effects are ecological degradation of irrigation water receding from farmland domestic wastewater and industrial wastewater in the tolerance zone wuliangsuhai lake quan et al 2020 tian et al 2016 yong et al 2017 however the additional water required to improve the natural environment was imposing pressure on the limited water allocation in the hid the pressure on agricultural production in the hid caused by the annual reduction of water diversions from the yellow river needs to be clarified according to the water based land policy proposed in the 2019 ecological management policy for the yellow river basin developed in china suitable planting areas were determined by available blue water and comprehensive irrigation quota 18 s o w n a r e a a v a i l a b l e b l u e w a t e r c o m p r e h e n s i v e g r o s s i r r i g a t i o n q u a t o irrigation water delivery losses should be integrated into irrigation water consumption therefore we divided the total amount of blue water comprehensive net irrigation quota by the irrigation water use efficiency to obtain the comprehensive gross irrigation quota the suitable sown areas changes when crop irrigation quota including the grey water footprint for the hid in 2017 are shown in table 2 the grey water footprint had a substantial impact on the suitable planting area for the hid when grey water footprint was taken into account the suitable planting area was 41 1 less than that without considering and the suitable planting area was slightly less than the actual planting area in addition gross irrigation water requirement increased by 69 6 this indicated that the available irrigation water in 2017 was insufficient to meet the irrigation demand of crops in the hid as the water diversion from the yellow river decreased annually the shortfall of available irrigation water in the hid was getting worse and was unable to meet the irrigation demand of crops which had a negative impact on crop yields considering that the grey water footprint had a significant influence on the suitable planting area reducing the grey water footprint was the top priority 4 3 comparative advantages of crops the trends of pwf and ewf were the same even though they had different meanings the pwf focused on the water use per unit of yield while the ewf focused on the water use per unit of energy with the development of china s economy and social development residents living standards have improved and they focus on diversification and rationalization of diet in terms of food consumption using limited water resources to ensure scientific energy supply is more appropriate for their dietary needs than ensuring food production therefore the ewf was quantified in this research crop yield was divided into fresh weight and dry weight tomato vegetable sugar beet muskmelon and watermelon were counted as fresh weight spring wheat maize sunflower seed melon sorghum and forage were counted as dry weight in terms of pwf high yielding crops with a lower water footprint than the average value of hid had a strong comparative advantage watermelon had the strongest comparative advantage followed by tomato vegetable muskmelon and sugar beet in general cash crops had the strongest comparative advantages in pwf the comparative advantage of ewf was not only affected by pwf but also related to the energy that crops could provide the crops with high yield were fruit and vegetable which provided lower energy values and they have fewer comparative advantages than maize and spring wheat in this regard grain crops had the strongest comparative advantage in terms of nbwf vegetable tomato watermelon forage muskmelon maize sunflower spring wheat and sorghum had comparative advantages the gwf represented the ecological aspects of water utilization in this aspect only maize sunflower and spring wheat did not have a comparative advantage these three crops had the largest planting area and applied large amounts of fertilizer resulting in their high gwf a comprehensive analysis of these water footprints showed that sorghum tomato vegetable and watermelon all had comparative advantages fig 9a spring wheat maize sunflower and tomato are the main crops planted in the hid the proportion of spring wheat decreased by 42 3 maize increased by 17 7 and sunflower increased by 27 1 fig 9b which was effective in improving the water use efficiency of the hid with the salinization of soils aggravated in the hid the proportion of sunflower planting area has increased which has reduced the water use efficiency and aggravated pollution of non point sources in the hid therefore improving the soil conditions and providing suitable conditions for crop cultivation were the main duties of the hid administration the hid administration supported the tomato industry because it is a special crop for the hid resulting in a 1 1 increase in tomato planting area fig 9b the increased tomato planting area was beneficial to the hid in terms of water use efficiency and natural environment but tomato planting area was influenced by the market and the planting ratio fluctuates to stabilize the tomato planting area it was necessary for the hid administration to give subsidies to farmers and set suitable purchase protection price to increase the risk resistance of farmers 4 4 relationship between different water footprint indexes and stakeholders interest demands in agriculture in water scarce areas water resources have become a constraint for agricultural production pwfbg ewfbg nbwfbg and gwf correspond to the interests of different stakeholders in planting structure table 3 the government according to the 14th five year plan determined the key objectives of the government both central and local governments as food and water security followed by ecological and environmental protection achieving green agricultural development promoting industrial integration and increasing farmers incomes the hid administration is the manager of the hid in addition to ensuring national food security objectives the hid administration also charges water fees to maintain operation which has both the public welfare and commercial nature of agricultural irrigation and drainage alizadeh et al 2017 wang 2013 farmers are self managed self financed self developed and rational microeconomic entities with independent economic interests maximizing net agricultural income through multi element input is their demand qu 2018 according to the definitions of pwf ewf and nbwf they represent water use efficiency in terms of production energy and net benefits respectively the production and energy perspectives are closely related to food security the total water consumption affects the production costs of farmers thus relating to the net benefits the gwf indicates the amount of water required to treat agricultural non point source pollution in the hid which is related to ecological security improving water use efficiency and reducing water intensive crops are essential approaches to water conservation in the hid however stakeholders in crop production rely on their interests to make decisions for achieving sustainable agriculture therefore rational adjustment measures can only be taken once the demands of the various stakeholders in crop production are clarified when adjusting the planting structure according to the stakeholders attention to the three types of water footprint and gwf it is also necessary to note that the optimization and crop structure adjustment is a multi objective decision making problem different objectives should be given different weights and the weight of each objective will change according to the actual situation the weight of the ewf target should be increased when food security is at risk when income increase for farmers becomes an urgent issue the weight of the nbwf target should be higher and the gwf target should be higher when ecological problems arise 5 conclusions a comprehensive evaluation based on the water footprint of production energy and net benefits in the hetao irrigation district and considering the grey water footprint is beneficial to balancing the interests of stakeholders in agriculture production and realizing sustainable agricultural development in the hid the main conclusions of this study are as follows during 1995 2017 water use efficiency and benefits for grain crops cash crops and feed crops were promoted by yield energy net benefits crop species and planting structure the grey water footprint among the three types of water footprints was relatively large therefore the grey water footprint must be considered the three types of water footprints corresponded to the objectives of the decision makers in crop structure adjustment the ewfbg and pwfbg corresponded to the government s main objectives for food and water security respectively the hid administration focused on economic benefits in addition to food security which corresponded to ewfbg pwfbg and nbwfbg farmers were most concerned about their net benefits from agriculture which corresponded to nbwfbg it should be noted that crop structure adjustment is a multi objective issue and the greatest weight should be given to the prioritized problems that exist in the hid according to the research crops with strong comprehensive advantages could be selected for cultivation to balance the efficiency socio economic and ecological benefits of water utilization which has contributed to the sustainable utilization of water resources in agricultural production however specific sustainable development strategies should be developed by using a multi objective optimization approach to further research on how to fully utilize the three

9531,developing water saving agriculture must balance the interests of stakeholders in terms of economic benefits food and ecological security objectives the production based water footprint pwf the energy based water footprint ewf and the net benefits based water footprint nbwf including grey water footprint gwf can be used to evaluate food and ecological security water use efficiency and benefits objectives however little attention is paid to the multi dimensional evaluation of water consumption in agriculture this study quantified the annual pwf ewf and nbwf of grain crops cash crops and feed crops in the hetao irrigation district hid over 1995 2017 and analyzed their spatiotemporal evolution characteristics and comparative advantages then clarified the implications of the three types of water footprints for stakeholders in the hid for crop planning the results showed the water use efficiency was decreasing and the benefits were increasing the gwf deserves more attention as it contributed 35 40 of the total water footprint the comparative advantages of the three water footprints revealed that the current crop distribution in the hid only favors benefits considering the crop distribution issues in the hid the adjustment objectives can be determined by combining the connotations of the three types of water footprints gwf pwfblue green ewfblue green and nbwfblue green corresponding to stakeholders environmental and social economic interests this study could provide basic guidance for crop planning and agricultural water management in the hid and similar areas graphical abstract ga1 keywords water footprint aquacrop economic benefits energy benefits stakeholders 1 introduction freshwater scarcity is a major concern for governments institutions policy makers and water users around the planet in water scarce regions water resources have become a major constraint in agricultural production davis et al 2017a kummu et al 2016 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 accurately assessing the potential relationship between water resources and agricultural production for decision makers is essential which assists in formulating rational agricultural development policies and realizing sustainable agricultural production accurately evaluating the water use efficiency of agricultural production is a prerequisite of achieving water saving goals for sustainable agriculture saccon 2018 traditional indicators of agriculture water use efficiency include irrigation efficiency water use efficiency water productivity and irrigation water use efficiency these indictors only consider irrigation water while the efficient use of green water resources also has a great impact on reducing irrigation water use and improving irrigation water use efficiency luo et al 2022 water footprint proposed by hoekstra et al 2011 can be used to describe and evaluate the amount of water required for agricultural production in a region for a certain time and includes blue water green water and grey water the water footprint theory provides a new index system for regional agricultural water management and evaluation in the research water footprint of crops has mainly focused on the water footprint of crop production including the production based water footprint m3 kg the energy based water footprint m3 kcal and the benefits based water footprint m3 usd which are the amount of water consumed to produce unit production unit energy and unit economic benefits of agricultural products respectively hoekstra et al 2011 research on the water footprint of crop production includes research scales and methods sustainability assessment and developing response strategies the research methods are mainly divided into the life cycle assessment method lca and the water footprint network wfn vanham and bidoglio 2013 based on the wfn hoekstra et al 2011 considered the water footprint as a volumetric approach that focused on water productivity the water footprint of an individual community or enterprise is defined as the total volume of freshwater used to produce commodities and services consumed by the individual or community or produced by the enterprise in parallel the lca approach based on the international standard for water footprint iso 14046 defined the water footprint as an indicator that quantifies the potential environmental impacts associated with water bayart et al 2010 iso 14046 2014 in conclusion the ultimate results with the lca approach presented are potential impacts rather than water consumption boulay et al 2013 vanham 2016 pfister et al 2017 therefore the wfn approach was applied in this study as it was necessary to quantify crop water consumption during the growth stage the sustainability evaluation of agricultural production mainly concentrates on three fields first the sustainability of regional water resources was evaluated by using the water scarcity index to explain whether the regional blue water consumption exceeds the blue water available in the region when the blue water consumption exceeded the regional available blue water it was unsustainable joseph et al 2020 zhao et al 2011 2018 second the pwf was combined with other social indicators population education level etc economic indicators gdp and ecological indicators greenhouse gas emissions fertilizer consumption etc to assess the sustainability of regional agricultural production carvalho et al 2021 ma et al 2021 third the pwf and nbwf were combined for evaluating the sustainability of regional agricultural production yang et al 2021 calculated the pwf and nbwf of major crops in china and proposed the synergy index of those water footprints the study found that the efficiency and benefits of development in the arid regions of northwest china were unbalanced in arid and water scarce areas blue water was often prioritized for crops with high economic value chouchane et al 2015 schyns and hoekstra 2014 the economic benefits are one of the factors that dominate the allocation of freshwater resources to evaluate the rationality of water use efficiency and benefits some scholars evaluated pwf and nbwf with red jujube date palms wheat grape and almond in arid and water scarce areas and provided a reference for decision makers to formulate appropriate sustainable development strategies bazrafshan et al 2020 fulton et al 2019 miglietta et al 2018 sun et al 2016 yu et al 2020 crop structure adjustment can improve water productivity water use efficiency and energy efficiency kahramanoğlu et al 2020 nouri et al 2020 which can achieve water reallocation in space time therefore scholars have suggested that sustainable development of the agricultural crop industry can be realized by adjusting the crop structure chouchane et al 2020 sun et al 2014 water footprint includes green blue and grey water footprint gwf the gwf quantifies the total freshwater resources required to dilute pollutants to maintain water quality standards which can quantitatively describe the extent of water pollution and reflect the ecological aspects of sustainable development studies have shown that the gwf of crops accounted for three quarters of the global gwf lovarelli et al 2016 china consumed nearly one third of global nitrogen fertilizer huang et al 2017 and gwf has gradually increased zhang et al 2019 however the ability of the natural freshwater system to absorb pollutants decreased annually and the natural environment has deteriorated therefore gwf should be emphasized in the research currently comprehensive research on pwf nbwf and ewf are missing gwf is frequently not considered in such research however the connotation and evaluation objectives of ewf pwf and nbwf are different agricultural production has comprehensive social economic ecological benefits and a single index evaluation is insufficient combining the three water footprints and gwf can comprehensively evaluate the characteristics of water utilization in agricultural production providing the indicator basis for decision makers to formulate feasible measures to realize sustainable agricultural development in this study the aquacrop model is used to quantify pwf ewf and nbwf of 14 crops in the hid from 1995 to 2017 the temporal variation trend of the three types of water footprints is analyzed by the m k test the comparative advantage index is proposed to evaluate the advantage of the water footprints of the crops according to the sustainable development interests of stakeholders in the hid the significance of pwfbg ewfbg nbwfbg and gwf to stakeholders is clarified 2 methods and data 2 1 study area the hid is located in the hetao plain of the yellow river in northern china which is an important part of the ecological boundary in northern china and includes five areas dengkou hangjinhouqi linhe wuyuan and wulateqianqi fig 1a the hid is an important commodity grain and oil production district of china and the inner mongolia autonomous region the main irrigation method in the hid is surface irrigation and the yellow river is the major water source for agriculture irrigation from 1995 2017 the hid withdrew 4 74 billion m3 of water annually from the yellow river of which 4 45 billion m3 was used for agricultural irrigation accounting for 93 9 of the total water diversion while crops consumed only 40 of the irrigation water during the growth stage sun et al 2016 by 2017 the water diversion decreased by 7 while the planting area increased by 59 the hid has low precipitation and high evaporation with an average annual precipitation of 140 230 mm and average annual evaporation of 2400 mm fig 1b the hid is a typical region where there is no agriculture without irrigation in 2017 44 of the cultivated areas were grain crops 55 cash crops and 1 feed crops the main crops planted in the hid are spring wheat maize and sunflower which account for 25 3 27 7 and 26 6 of the total sown area respectively tomato a specialty crop of the hid is mainly used to produce tomato paste that is exported to other countries and its planted area accounts for 3 3 from 1995 2017 the application amount of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer in the hid increased almost by 60 fig 1c while the bayannaoer government website https nmj bynr gov cn showed that the utilization rate of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer in bayannaoer city was only 35 and 22 5 respectively the leaching of chemical fertilizers and pesticides led to groundwater quality deterioration 2 2 calculation of production based water footprint the aquacrop model is a water driven crop water productivity model developed by fao steduto et al 2009 the aquacrop model achieves a balance between simplicity accuracy and robustness with few explicit parameters and intuitive input variables it has been applied extensively for water footprint calculations chouchane et al 2018 davis et al 2017b li et al 2021 lu et al 2016 mao et al 2021 the aquacrop model was used to simulate daily soil water balance and yield the soil water balance of the aquacrop model was expressed as 1 s t s t 1 p r t i r r t c r t e t t r o t d p t where s t is the soil water content on day t mm p r t is the rainfall on day t mm i r r t is the irrigation on day t mm c r t is the capillary rise from groundwater on day t mm e t t is the actual evapotranspiration on day t mm r o t is the surface runoff on day t mm d p t is the deep percolation on day t mm it depends on soil drainage capacity when the soil water content is below or equal to the field capacity the deep percolation is equal to 0 raes et al 2018 r o t was obtained through soil conservation service curve number methodology rallison 1980 2 r o t p r t 0 2 s 2 p r t s 0 2 s where s is the potential maximum storage mm the aquacrop model can distinguish the inflow and outflow of soil moisture in the root zone boundary and divide the soil moisture in the root zone into blue and green fractions chukalla et al 2015 3 s g r e e n t s g r e e n t 1 p r t r o t p r t p r t i r r t d p t e t t s g r e e n t 1 s t 1 4 s b l u e i t s b l u e i t 1 i r r t r o t i r r t p r t i r r t d p

end of day t from rainfall mm s b l u e i t and s b l u e c t are the blue water content at the end of day t from irrigation and groundwater respectively mm the blue and green water components of the crop growth stage are obtained from the accumulation of daily soil water content respectively the green and blue water in the evapotranspiration during the growth stage were calculated as 7 c w u g r

phosphate fertilizer kg ha c max is the maximum acceptable concentration of the nutrient in the receiving water body c min is the natural background concentration of the receiving water body according to the surface water environmental quality standard gb 3838 2002 for class iii water the c max for n was 1 mg l for p was 0 05 mg l pwf consists of three parts 12 p w f p w f g r e e n p w f b l u e p w f g r e y the crops include grain crops spring wheat maize sorghum soybean mixed bean cash crops sunflower tomato seed melon vegetable sugar beet muskmelon watermelon flaxseed and feed crops forage the period of crop yield simulation with aquacrop 6 0 was from december 1 1994 to december 31 2017 considering that the autumn and spring irrigation in the hid replenishes the soil water content in time we assumed that the soil water content was at field capacity on december 1 1994 feng et al 2003 nouri et al 2019 therefore the initial proportion of blue and green water was the ratio of autumn irrigation to the rainfall at this time the model was calibrated using the yield data from 1995 to 2005 based on the qi county scale and the yield data from 2006 to 2017 was used to verify the accuracy of the model calibration the root mean square error was used to quantify the error between the model simulation results and the actual yield for evaluating the simulation accuracy and the model applicability 2 3 calculation of energy and net benefits based water footprint based on hoekstra et al 2011 ewf and nbwf were calculated as 13 e w f p w f u e 14 n b w f p w f u b where ue is the energy per unit yield of the crop kcal kg ub is the net benefits per unit yield of the crop usd kg in conclusion the steps to calculate the pwf ewf and nbwf are shown in fig 2 2 4 calculation of comparative advantage index the comparative advantage index reflects the water footprint of different crops relative to the weighted average water footprint of 14 crops in the hid expressed as the ratio of the water footprint of different crops to the total water footprint 15 a i p p w f i i 1 14 p w f i p r o d u c t i o n i p r o d u c t i o n i 16 a i e e w f i i 1 14 e w f i p r o d u c t i

pwf ewf and nbwf respectively production is the total yield ton the number of crop species is i when the comparative advantage index is below 1 the crop has a comparative advantage otherwise it has no comparative advantage 2 5 data sources the meteorological data daily rainfall daily average humidity daily average wind speed duration of sunshine daily minimum temperature and maximum temperature were derived from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn the time and maximum root depth of each growth stage were obtained from the bayannaoer agriculture and animal husbandry network http nmyj bynr gov cn and field surveys the soil texture was obtained from nachtergaele et al 2009 the harvest index was derived from xie et al 2011 crop yield crop planting area production and agriculture input pesticide usage and fertilizer application amount were obtained from hetao irrigation district statistical data nbsc 1995 the yield calculation methods in the yearbook used were beans were calculated as dry beans for potatoes as fresh production with high water content including sweet potatoes and potatoes excluding taro and cassava 5 kg was converted to 1 kg of grain potatoes used as vegetables were counted as fresh products the energy per 100 g of crops were obtained from the usda nutrient database gebhardt et al 2006 the net benefits were calculated based on the total revenue from crop acquisition minus the total input cost of the means of production and then converted to usd the exchange rate was derived from chinamoney 2021 the index of agricultural products purchase prices and the price index of agricultural means of production were all converted into prices based on 1995 the index of agricultural products purchase prices the price index of agricultural means of production the crop purchase price and the price of production materials in 1995 were derived from hetao irrigation district statistical data nbsc 1995 3 results 3 1 temporal and spatial evolution of pwf 3 1 1 interannual variation of pwf of major crops spring wheat maize and sunflower are the main crops and tomato is the specialty crop therefore these four crops were selected to analyze their interannual variation the pwf of spring wheat and maize showed an upward trend from 1995 to 2016 with a significant p 0 05 upward trend in the pwf of maize fig 3a fig 3b during this period the pwf of spring wheat and maize increased by 0 9 and 15 9 respectively due to heavy rainfall and hailstorms in 2017 yields of spring wheat and maize decreased by 25 1 and 30 1 respectively compared to 2016 the reduced crop yields in 2017 resulted in a 42 5 increase in pwf for spring wheat and a 38 0 increase for maize the pwf of sunflower and tomato increased significantly from 1995 to 2017 p 0 05 fig 3c fig 3d pwf increased by 89 8 as the sunflower yield decreased by 36 1 the pwf of tomato fluctuated greatly due to inclement weather with an increasing trend from 2000 to 2012 and a decreasing trend after 2012 in general the water use efficiency of major crops in the hid decreased during the study period the hid has low rainfall and pwfgreen accounts for a relatively low proportion of the total water footprint the average pwfgreen share of these four crops was 7 4 10 2 pwfblue accounted for 55 1 59 2 and pwfgrey accounted for 33 2 36 2 decreasing the blue water footprint and grey water footprint plays a major role in water conservation in the hid 3 1 2 patiotemporal evolution of pwf of grain cash and feed crops from 1995 2016 pwf pwfgreen pwfblue and pwfgrey of the grain crop all showed a downward trend and reached a significant level except for pwfgrey p 0 05 fig 4a in 2017 grain crop yields were only 73 2 of that in 2016 and thus pwf increased by 37 3 year on year the pwf of cash crops went through three stages 1995 1999 1999 2008 and 2008 2017 fig 4b in these three stages pwfgreen pwfblue and pwfgrey of feed crops showed a trend of increasing decreasing and then increasing during 2004 2014 the government was actively supporting the tomato industry while due to the large tomato production and low water footprint the pwf of cash crops was at a lower level in this stage the pwf pwfgreen pwfblue and pwfgrey of feed crops showed an upward trend from 2001 to 2017 and the trend of pwf and pwfgrey reached a significant level p 0 05 fig 4c in terms of spatial distribution the area with the highest pwf for grain crops was wuyuan and the lowest area was linhe fig 4d the average pwf for cash crops in wulateqianqi was the highest and the lowest in hangjinhouqi fig 4e the average pwf of feed crops was the highest in dengkou and lowest in hangjinhouqi fig 4f the most abundant rainfall during the study period in wulateqianqi resulted in the largest proportion of pwfgreen the pwfgreen accounted for the largest proportion of cash crops at 11 6 fig 4e the average grey water footprint of grain cash and feed crops in the hid was about 35 0 3 2 temporal and spatial evolution of ewf 3 2 1 interannual variation of ewf of major crops the trend of ewf was similar to that of pwf the pwf of spring wheat and maize showed an upward trend from 1995 to 2016 and the ewf of maize also had a significant upward trend p 0 05 the ewf of spring wheat increased by 0 9 and the ewf of maize increased by 15 8 fig 5a fig 5b in 2017 the ewf of spring wheat and maize increased by 42 5 and 38 year on year respectively the ewf of sunflower increased by 78 4 fig 5c and the ewf of tomato increased by 0 1 between 1995 and 2017 fig 5d similarly lower tomato yields due to heavy rainfall and flooding resulted in larger ewf for tomato in 2006 2007 and 2012 fig 5d in terms of water footprint composition tomato had the largest ewfblue among the four crops accounting for 58 8 of the total ewf while tomato also had a smaller ewfgreen accounting for 7 7 the ewfgrey accounted for the largest proportion of the ewf of maize at 36 2 although the trends of pwf and ewf were the same pwf and ewf varied for the same crop higher pwf did not mean higher ewf sunflower had the largest pwf while spring wheat had the largest ewf 3 2 2 spatiotemporal evolution of ewf of grain cash and feed crops similarly the trends of ewf for grain crops cash crops and feed crops were the same as pwf fig 6 from 1995 2016 the ewf ewfgreen ewfblue and ewfgrey of grain crops all showed a downward trend except for ewfgrey and the downward trend reached a significant level p 0 05 fig 6a the trend of ewf of cash crops also experienced an upward downward and then upward trend fig 6b similarly the low level of ewf from 2004 to 2012 was associated with the increase in the tomato planting area ewf ewfgreen ewfblue and ewfgrey of feed crops showed an upward trend from 2001 to 2017 and ewf ewfgrey reached a significant level p 0 05 fig 6c in terms of spatial distribution wuyuan had the largest ewf for grain crops fig 6d wulateqianqi had the largest ewf for cash crops fig 6e and dengkou had the largest ewf for feed crops fig 6f in terms of water footprint composition the average proportion of ewfgreen in wulateqianqi was the highest 10 3 and hangjinhouqi was the lowest 7 9 the highest average proportion of ewfblue was in linhe 56 2 and lowest in dengkou 52 and the highest average proportion of ewfgrey was 39 6 in dengkou fig 6d fig 6e fig 6f 3 3 temporal and spatial evolution of nbwf 3 3 1 interannual variation of nbwf of major crops the nbwf of spring wheat maize and tomato showed a significant downward trend during 1995 2017 while that of sunflower showed a significant upward trend p 0 05 fig 7 except for tomato the nbwf of the remaining three crops fluctuated significantly with the net benefits of spring wheat decreased by 33 9 and its nbwf reached a maximum in 2001 the nbwf of spring wheat reached its minimum in 2014 after a more than two fold increase in net benefits from 2001 to 2014 fig 7a fig 7d net benefits from maize increased by 111 3 by 2014 when the nbwf for maize dropped to its lowest point fig 7b the nbwf for sunflower fluctuated greatly and went through three stages an upward trend from 1995 to 2004 2015 2017 and a downward trend from 2004 to 2015 fig 7c among the four crops spring wheat has the highest nbwfgreen nbwfblue and nbwfgrey and tomato has the lowest value 3 3 2 spatiotemporal evolution of nbwf of grain cash and feed crops during 1995 2017 nbwf nbwfgreen nbwfblue and nbwfgrey of grain crops cash crops and feed crops all showed a significant downward trend p 0 05 fig 8 as the net benefits increased 44 58 for grain crops 22 9 for cash crops 77 5 for feed crops the nbwf decreased by 9 3 for grain crops fig 8 a 14 7 for cash crops fig 8 b and 15 2 for feed crops fig 8c the changes in both grain crops and cash crops experienced an upward and then downward trend followed by an upward trend feed crops showed a downward trend from 2001 to 2013 and an upward trend after 2013 the average nbwf was largest for grain crops and lowest for feed crops in terms of spatial distribution the highest nbwf for grain crops and cash crops was located in wulateqianqi and the lowest was located in hangjinhouqi fig 8d fig 8e the nbwf of feed crops was the largest in wuyuan and the lowest in hangjinhouqi fig 8f in terms of water footprint composition the areas with the largest proportion of nbwfgreen for grain crops cash crops and feed crops were all located in wulateqianqi accounting for 9 2 11 6 and 10 6 respectively fig 8d fig 8e fig 8f the higher green water percentage in wulateqianqi was mainly due to the abundant precipitation linhe had less precipitation so the nbwfgreen was relatively low with an nbwfgreen of less than 8 for all three crops the areas with the highest nbwfgrey for both grain crops and cash crops were located in wuyuan 36 0 and 31 3 respectively and the region with the highest nbwfgrey for feed crops was dengkou 38 6 fig 8d fig 8e fig 8f 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of the results with other methods in this research the aquacrop model was applied to quantify the water footprint at the field scale the field scale water footprint consists of transpiration and evaporation based on the soil water balance principle transpiration and evaporation were derived from precipitation irrigation and groundwater during the growth stage the aquacrop model has the advantage of distinguishing blue and green water from evaporation and transpiration and considering the stress of environmental conditions upon crop growth allowing for more accurate daily blue and green water footprints the cropwat model calculates the crop blue and green water from evaporation and transpiration by the empirical formula while the swat model is a hydrological model which needs to be combined with a crop model to accurately simulate the water required for crop growth furthermore the aquacrop model is calculated with a daily time step which can display the impact of daily water deficit during the crop growth stage in general the aquacrop model provides a more reasonable calculation of actual water consumption during the growth stage compared to the swat and cropwat models the suitable groundwater depth for crop growth in the hid is 1 5 2 m xu et al 2010 and the average depth of groundwater in the hid is 2 m during the study period indicating that groundwater is also part of the blue water footprint while the cropwat model cannot take groundwater recharge into account table 1 compares the results of this study with previous studies luan et al 2018 quantified the water footprints of spring wheat maize and sunflower in the hid including irrigation canal losses field seepage and drainage based on a regional scale using the swat model sun 2013 adopted the cropwat model to calculate the water footprints of spring wheat maize sunflower tomato vegetable coarse grain and sugar beet at a regional scale mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 applied the cropwat model to quantify the global water footprint of crop production at a field scale their result showed that the water footprint decreased from 1996 to 2002 while our study period was 1995 2017 it is reasonable that our results are lower than theirs nevertheless the results of this study differ from those of other studies due to geographical location climatic conditions and caculation methods overall the results of the present study appear to be reliable 4 2 necessity of considering grey water footprint the average annual proportion of pwfgrey was 35 both ewfgrey and nbwfgrey accounted for approximately 40 of the total water footprint non point source pollution in crop production was becoming more pronounced during the study period the main effects are ecological degradation of irrigation water receding from farmland domestic wastewater and industrial wastewater in the tolerance zone wuliangsuhai lake quan et al 2020 tian et al 2016 yong et al 2017 however the additional water required to improve the natural environment was imposing pressure on the limited water allocation in the hid the pressure on agricultural production in the hid caused by the annual reduction of water diversions from the yellow river needs to be clarified according to the water based land policy proposed in the 2019 ecological management policy for the yellow river basin developed in china suitable planting areas were determined by available blue water and comprehensive irrigation quota 18 s o w n a r e a a v a i l a b l e b l u e w a t e r c o m p r e h e n s i v e g r o s s i r r i g a t i o n q u a t o irrigation water delivery losses should be integrated into irrigation water consumption therefore we divided the total amount of blue water comprehensive net irrigation quota by the irrigation water use efficiency to obtain the comprehensive gross irrigation quota the suitable sown areas changes when crop irrigation quota including the grey water footprint for the hid in 2017 are shown in table 2 the grey water footprint had a substantial impact on the suitable planting area for the hid when grey water footprint was taken into account the suitable planting area was 41 1 less than that without considering and the suitable planting area was slightly less than the actual planting area in addition gross irrigation water requirement increased by 69 6 this indicated that the available irrigation water in 2017 was insufficient to meet the irrigation demand of crops in the hid as the water diversion from the yellow river decreased annually the shortfall of available irrigation water in the hid was getting worse and was unable to meet the irrigation demand of crops which had a negative impact on crop yields considering that the grey water footprint had a significant influence on the suitable planting area reducing the grey water footprint was the top priority 4 3 comparative advantages of crops the trends of pwf and ewf were the same even though they had different meanings the pwf focused on the water use per unit of yield while the ewf focused on the water use per unit of energy with the development of china s economy and social development residents living standards have improved and they focus on diversification and rationalization of diet in terms of food consumption using limited water resources to ensure scientific energy supply is more appropriate for their dietary needs than ensuring food production therefore the ewf was quantified in this research crop yield was divided into fresh weight and dry weight tomato vegetable sugar beet muskmelon and watermelon were counted as fresh weight spring wheat maize sunflower seed melon sorghum and forage were counted as dry weight in terms of pwf high yielding crops with a lower water footprint than the average value of hid had a strong comparative advantage watermelon had the strongest comparative advantage followed by tomato vegetable muskmelon and sugar beet in general cash crops had the strongest comparative advantages in pwf the comparative advantage of ewf was not only affected by pwf but also related to the energy that crops could provide the crops with high yield were fruit and vegetable which provided lower energy values and they have fewer comparative advantages than maize and spring wheat in this regard grain crops had the strongest comparative advantage in terms of nbwf vegetable tomato watermelon forage muskmelon maize sunflower spring wheat and sorghum had comparative advantages the gwf represented the ecological aspects of water utilization in this aspect only maize sunflower and spring wheat did not have a comparative advantage these three crops had the largest planting area and applied large amounts of fertilizer resulting in their high gwf a comprehensive analysis of these water footprints showed that sorghum tomato vegetable and watermelon all had comparative advantages fig 9a spring wheat maize sunflower and tomato are the main crops planted in the hid the proportion of spring wheat decreased by 42 3 maize increased by 17 7 and sunflower increased by 27 1 fig 9b which was effective in improving the water use efficiency of the hid with the salinization of soils aggravated in the hid the proportion of sunflower planting area has increased which has reduced the water use efficiency and aggravated pollution of non point sources in the hid therefore improving the soil conditions and providing suitable conditions for crop cultivation were the main duties of the hid administration the hid administration supported the tomato industry because it is a special crop for the hid resulting in a 1 1 increase in tomato planting area fig 9b the increased tomato planting area was beneficial to the hid in terms of water use efficiency and natural environment but tomato planting area was influenced by the market and the planting ratio fluctuates to stabilize the tomato planting area it was necessary for the hid administration to give subsidies to farmers and set suitable purchase protection price to increase the risk resistance of farmers 4 4 relationship between different water footprint indexes and stakeholders interest demands in agriculture in water scarce areas water resources have become a constraint for agricultural production pwfbg ewfbg nbwfbg and gwf correspond to the interests of different stakeholders in planting structure table 3 the government according to the 14th five year plan determined the key objectives of the government both central and local governments as food and water security followed by ecological and environmental protection achieving green agricultural development promoting industrial integration and increasing farmers incomes the hid administration is the manager of the hid in addition to ensuring national food security objectives the hid administration also charges water fees to maintain operation which has both the public welfare and commercial nature of agricultural irrigation and drainage alizadeh et al 2017 wang 2013 farmers are self managed self financed self developed and rational microeconomic entities with independent economic interests maximizing net agricultural income through multi element input is their demand qu 2018 according to the definitions of pwf ewf and nbwf they represent water use efficiency in terms of production energy and net benefits respectively the production and energy perspectives are closely related to food security the total water consumption affects the production costs of farmers thus relating to the net benefits the gwf indicates the amount of water required to treat agricultural non point source pollution in the hid which is related to ecological security improving water use efficiency and reducing water intensive crops are essential approaches to water conservation in the hid however stakeholders in crop production rely on their interests to make decisions for achieving sustainable agriculture therefore rational adjustment measures can only be taken once the demands of the various stakeholders in crop production are clarified when adjusting the planting structure according to the stakeholders attention to the three types of water footprint and gwf it is also necessary to note that the optimization and crop structure adjustment is a multi objective decision making problem different objectives should be given different weights and the weight of each objective will change according to the actual situation the weight of the ewf target should be increased when food security is at risk when income increase for farmers becomes an urgent issue the weight of the nbwf target should be higher and the gwf target should be higher when ecological problems arise 5 conclusions a comprehensive evaluation based on the water footprint of production energy and net benefits in the hetao irrigation district and considering the grey water footprint is beneficial to balancing the interests of stakeholders in agriculture production and realizing sustainable agricultural development in the hid the main conclusions of this study are as follows during 1995 2017 water use efficiency and benefits for grain crops cash crops and feed crops were promoted by yield energy net benefits crop species and planting structure the grey water footprint among the three types of water footprints was relatively large therefore the grey water footprint must be considered the three types of water footprints corresponded to the objectives of the decision makers in crop structure adjustment the ewfbg and pwfbg corresponded to the government s main objectives for food and water security respectively the hid administration focused on economic benefits in addition to food security which corresponded to ewfbg pwfbg and nbwfbg farmers were most concerned about their net benefits from agriculture which corresponded to nbwfbg it should be noted that crop structure adjustment is a multi objective issue and the greatest weight should be given to the prioritized problems that exist in the hid according to the research crops with strong comprehensive advantages could be selected for cultivation to balance the efficiency socio economic and ecological benefits of water utilization which has contributed to the sustainable utilization of water resources in agricultural production however specific sustainable development strategies should be developed by using a multi objective optimization approach to further research on how to fully utilize the three types of water footprint in agricultural production and its comparative advantages among stakeholders declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this work was jointly supported by the national natural science foundation of

9532,understanding the agro hydrological processes and water productivity of canal and well irrigated systems is vital for agricultural water management in arid regions in this study the agro hydrological chemical and crop systems simulator ahc was used in a distributed manner to evaluate the agro hydrological processes and to assess water productivity under the conditions of canal and well irrigated systems with the heji irrigation system heji located in the arid upper yellow river basin northwest china as the case study area the ahc was calibrated and validated by the field observation data of 2018 and 2019 then the model was used in a distributed manner for the entire heji results showed that there were significant differences in the agro hydrological processes and water productivity between canal and well irrigated areas the spatially averaged actual evapotranspiration was larger in canal irrigated areas and the cumulative net bottom water and salt fluxes were mainly downward in well irrigated areas the applied water was used more efficiently with higher equivalent water productivity of water applied ewp ip in canal irrigated areas however the total water consumption evapotranspiration was in higher efficient utilization with higher equivalent water productivity of water consumption ewp et in well irrigated areas these findings can provide implications for regional irrigation water management and salinity control in the arid areas keywords conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater water management salinity control irrigation district canal irrigation well irrigation 1 introduction the rapid growth of the world s population has led to an increase in food demand tilman et al 2011 and agricultural water requirements grafton et al 2015 which has further aggravated the contradiction between the supply and demand of water resources especially in the arid and semi arid regions the agricultural production is highly dependent on irrigation in these regions irrigation on one hand guarantees the water demand for crop growth on the other hand improper irrigation e g flood irrigation may also cause soil salinization and water loss which may significantly decrease agricultural productivity raeisi et al 2019 wichelns and qadir 2015 xu et al 2013 to meet crop water requirements and to control soil salinity conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater i e canal irrigation and well irrigation has become an optional alternative for crop production worldwide li et al 2018 singh 2014 it was reported that nearly 40 of the irrigated areas in the world used surface and ground water conjunctively thenkabail et al 2009 such as the middle and upper yellow river basin in china mao et al 2017 the singkarak ombilin river basin in indonesia peranginangin et al 2004 and the yaqui river basin in mexico schoups et al 2006 the catchment with some parts irrigated by surface water and another parts irrigated by groundwater can be divided into canal and well irrigated areas the agro hydrological processes in canal and well irrigated areas are significantly different for example in the hetao irrigation district at upper yellow river basin of northwest china groundwater table in canal irrigated areas is usually very shallow and capillary rise is strong ren et al 2016 which not only replenishes water in root zone but also carries salt to this zone the groundwater table in well irrigated areas is generally deep below the land surface and capillary rise is weak which leads to relatively large deep percolation and efficient salt leaching singh 2021 in addition pumping groundwater for irrigation may reuse the seepage and percolated water from canal irrigated areas to some extent by groundwater exchange between canal and well irrigated areas bejranonda et al 2013 therefore the agro hydrological processes are quite complicated under the conditions of canal and well irrigated systems previous studies mostly focused on groundwater exchange between canal and well irrigated areas yang et al 2021 and the management strategies about water allocation safavi and esmikhani 2013 wu et al 2015 however for the catchment under the conditions of canal and well irrigated systems the agro hydrological processes of root zone have not been well studied or have been over simplified for example the root zone was simplified as one layer and different management practices such as plant structure mulch treatments soil heterogeneities in fields were not considered in the model mao et al 2017 this may cause the biased estimation of water and salt balance in root zone moreover few researches were concentrated on water productivity wp at multiple scales in catchment under the conditions of canal and well irrigated systems field experiments and model simulations are two major approaches used to analyze agro hydrological processes and water productivity field experiments can obtain various information about hydrological processes in aquifer soil plant atmosphere systems and plant growth under different irrigation and management practices however they are always costly and time consuming model simulations can efficiently and conveniently obtain continuous information and have been widely used at multiple scales in general model simulations are performed in a distributed manner due to the heterogeneity of soil groundwater cropping pattern as well as water application in relatively large scales e g the scale of canal command area and the scale of irrigation district to perform the distributed simulation one can use either the regional scale integrated models or the gis based one dimensional models the regional scale integrated models e g swat arnold et al 1998 swat modflow sophocleous et al 1999 hydrogeosphere brunner and simmons 2012 swat ag xiong et al 2019 gsflow markstrom et al 2008 and riwp xue et al 2020 usually treat the target area as the aggregation of hydrological response units hru and each hru has the similar soil poperties land use surface slope and field management practices etc this kind of models always simplifies the root zone water and salt transport processes which may greatly affect the plant growth and water productivity the gis based one dimensional models are generally established by coupling gis with one dimensional models e g swap van dam et al 1997 aquacrop raes et al 2009 swap epic xu et al 2013 hydrus dualkc ren et al 2016 and ahc xu et al 2018 for example droogers et al 2000 used swap in a distributed manner to reveal all the terms of the water banlance of an irrigation system in western turkey lorite et al 2013 developed the software of aquadata and aquagis to extend the application of aquacrop to regional scale compared with the regional scale integrated models the gis based one dimensional models can describe the vertical water flow in aquifer soil plant atmosphere systems of root zone under different management practices in more details while without considering the horizontal groundwater movement in aquifers however the applicability of these models has not been well tested in catchment under the conditions of canal and well irrigated systems in addition among the one dimensional models the ahc model showed its ability to describe the complicated interactions between the agro hydrological processes and crop growth huang et al 2020 liu et al 2020 thereby the gis based ahc was selected as the tool to analyze agro hydrological processes in root zone and water productivity in our current study the patterns of wp in irrigation systems are usually important for developing water saving strategies in general wp defined as the yield obtained by per unit of water consumption molden et al 2010 has been used to assess agricultural water production the previous assessments of wp were always concentrated on a single crop at field scale sun et al 2017 or simply accumulates the yields of different crops to evaluate wp at regional scale huang and li 2010 jiang et al 2015 such a treatment might result in biased estimation of wp in these regions with fragmented land covers at regional scale due to the different physiological characteristics of different crops and plants to meet the knowledge gaps mentioned before ren et al 2021 proposed an approach to evaluate wp at regional scale by unifying the yield of different crops and plants however in their study the selection of the potential maximum yield of each crop was highly dependent on the survey data obtained which might bring uncertainties thereby further research are still required in this study the heji irrigation system heji in the upper yellow river basin northwest china under conditions of the canal and well irrigated systems was selected as the case study area the main objectives are 1 to analyze the agro hydrological processes of root zone in canal and well irrigated areas 2 to comprehensively analyze wp in canal and well irrigated areas and 3 to provide implications for wp improvements in the catchment under the conditions of canal and well irrigated systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the heji irrigation system heji 40º40 40º57 n 107º12 107º24 e located in the western part of hetao irrigation district hid was taken as the case study area which covers an area about 17 900 ha the terrain of hid is very flat gradually decreasing from south to north xiao et al 2021 the study area has a typical arid climate with average annual temperature of 7 average annual sunshine duration of 3100 3300 h and mean frost free days over 150 d liu et al 2021 average annual precipitation and reference evapotranspiration et o is about 140 mm ren et al 2019a and 800 1200 mm li et al 2022 respectively thereby irrigation is very important to maintain the agricultural production there are five land use types in heji fig 1 including croplands wastelands residential lands sand dunes and waterbodies which cover 64 43 12 10 20 67 1 33 1 46 of the region respectively small farmer production is very popular in hid due to the farmland policy so called household responsibility contract system farmers always make their own decisions about what to plant according to the land quality salinization and fertility level of soils irrigation water supply capacity and market price hence the crop pattern is highly fragmented and randomly distributed ren et al 2019a for the past few years maize and sunflower occupied 70 of the croplands while the rest lands were planted with wheat and vegetables e g tomato pepper cucurbit some salt tolerant plants grow in the natural lands inlaid in the cropland such as reed tamarix chinensis elymus dauricus etc as a result the landscape is divided into a mosaic of mixed crop fields and natural vegetation patches heji has a complete canal network consisting of a main canal 6 sub main canals numerous secondary canals field canals and terminal canals fig 1 the drainage system including one main ditch one sub main ditch 8 secondary ditches and some field ditches collects the return water of irrigation and discharges drainage water fig 1 the drainage effluent was not reused for irrigation or disposed in the irrigated area the main ditch and sub main ditch form the east and northwest boundary of heji respectively in addition a sub main canal forms the southwest boundary fig 1 the ditch depth is generally 3 5 4 m hence heji can be regarded as a relatively closed basin with less connectivity to neighboring areas hundreds of pumping wells are distributed around the urban and planted areas of cash crops according to the distribution of pumping wells and water diversion of each canal the study area is divided into canal and well irrigated areas fig 2 normally there are 5 6 water diversions in canal irrigated areas during the growing season based on water supply capacity of yellow river groundwater irrigation is timely and adequate in well irrigated areas only a few natural patches are irrigated once and croplands are irrigated several times during the growing season flood irrigation is the major irrigation method in heji the average groundwater depth in well irrigated areas is about 4 m and that is about 2 m in canal irrigated areas 2 2 observations measurements and data collections field observations were carried out in heji during the growing season of 2018 and 2019 sixteen observation points were selected to obtain the time information of soil water soil salinity and crop growth fig 2 the observation points were arranged based on the map of land use planting structure and distribution of canal and well irrigated areas soil samplings were conducted every 10 15 days by using a soil auger to measure soil water content and soil salt concentration the soil moisture was measured in six layers to a depth of 100 cm every 10 cm in the top 0 20 cm layer and every 20 cm increments below the top layer by oven drying method the salt content of the soil solution csw g l 1 was determined by the electrical conductivity of the 1 5 soil water extract using the calculation method suggested by xu et al 2013 leaf area index lai and crop height ch were also measured every 10 15 days by using accupar lp80 decagon devices usa and steel tape respectively the development stages of main crops including natural vegetation planting density and plastic film mulching ratios of maize sunflower and vegetables were recorded crop yields were measured after harvest the dry above ground biomass d agb was additionally measured in 2019 by oven drying to constant mass at 75 the soil textures in the profile to a depth of 200 cm at the sixteen observation points were measured using a laser particle size analyzer master sizer 2000 malvern england while soil textures in the profile to a depth of 40 cm at other 109 points were obtained from hua et al 2018 see fig 3d sixteen monitoring wells were installed at the places near the soil sampling points to monitor the groundwater depth hourly by water level loggers hobo u20 usa and groundwater electrical conductivity ec gw was measured with samples by an electric conductivity meter ddsj 308a china every 10 15 days then the groundwater electrical conductivity ec gw was converted to tds total dissolved solids g l 1 using the empirical relationship tds 0 69ecgw ms cm 1 ren et al 2016 in addition the groundwater depth and groundwater tds of other 40 observation wells were collected from hua et al 2018 and the local administration bureau fig 2 to identify the spatial distribution of initial soil water content and soil salinity before the growing season an extra soil sampling covered the whole heji was performed in late april of 2019 2019 4 20 2019 4 25 and the distance between two adjacent sampling points was about 1 5 km in total the initial soil water content and salinity in the profile to a depth of 40 cm at 85 sampling points were obtained soil water and salt contents were measured by using the aforementioned methods finally the distribution maps of average soil water and salt content within 0 40 cm soil profile were obtained by using the inverse distance weighting idw interpolation method fig 3 e f the information of water conveyance in the main 6 sub main and some secondary canals was collected from the local administration bureau canal lining ratio canal section shape and ditch section shape were obtained by field investigation the salt concentration of irrigation water was observed once every round of irrigation topographic map soil map satellite images of sentinel and high resolution google earth images were also collected for further analysis the daily meteorological data on rainfall temperature humidity wind speed and sunshine duration of linhe national meteorological data monitoring site were downloaded through the china meteorological data sharing network http data cma cn since heji is not so large the climate conditions can be treated as the same in addition atmospheric pressure for adjusting water level loggers was collected hourly by small automatic recording weather station hobo usa within study area the daily groundwater depths at typical observation points in canal and well irrigated areas are shown in fig 4 2 3 distributed modeling 2 3 1 the ahc model in distributed manner the ahc agro hydrological chemical and crop systems simulator is a one dimensional kinetic model developed by xu et al 2018 including agroecosystem simulation aesim process global sensitivity analysis gsa process global parameter estimation gpe process and graphical user interface gui the aesim process is the core of the model which inherited and modified from swap epic xu et al 2013 and other modules were developed to assist users to use the model more conveniently the aesim process can simulate the soil water flow soil solute transport and transformation heat transport and crop growth the model uses 1 d richard s equation and convective dispersion equation to describe soil water and solute transport respectively the upper boundary condition is determined by irrigation rainfall evaporation and transpiration for the estimation of actual evaporation e a and actual transpiration t a firstly the potential evapotranspiration et p was calculated by penman monteith equation monteith 1965 secondly et p is partitioned into potential soil evaporation e p and potential plant transpiration t p based on leaf area index lai then e a and t a were obtained as a function of available soil water in the surface soil and root zone respectively the lower boundary is mainly related to the depth of groundwater table the source and sink items consider the root water extracting and drainage crop growth is governed by accumulated temperature process and affected by light interception plant radiation use efficiency water stress temperature stress and salt stress simultaneously the model has a friendly operation interface and a convenient data dealing platform in addition the ahc model has been closely coupled with gis software to apply at regional scale a more detailed description of ahc model can be found in xu et al 2018 2 3 2 spatial data processing and aggregation dividing the study area into a group of homogeneous simulation units properly is important to conduct the distributed simulation and further analyze the agro hydrologic processes the daily meteorological data form linhe weather station was used for the entire heji region then planting structure irrigation depth soil texture and groundwater depth were considered to generate homogeneous simulation units these data were mainly obtained by field experiments remote sensing images and surveyed data high resolution google earth images 1 8 m resolution were used to generate the planting structure and land use map in 2018 by the methods provided by feng et al 2020 the planting structure and land use map in 2019 were obtained from the local meteorological bureau based on 10 m resolution sentinel 2a 1b remote sensing images since the width and length of each field within study area are generally longer than 10 m the map of planting structure and land use map generated were reliable as shown in fig 3a a total of 5 vegetation cover types maize sunflower wheat vegetables and natural vegetation were classified for model simulation in the study area wheat sunflower and wheat vegetables rotation were few and neglected pepper which was the most widely planted vegetable was chosen as representative crops for vegetable fields since reed covered most of the natural land it was taken as the representative vegetation for natural land cover the irrigation depths of different fields were quite different due to different water supply capacities and water requirements the calculations of irrigation depths in canal irrigated area were as follows firstly the total volume of water diverted was calculated according to the information provided by the local administration bureau secondly the canal seepage and surface runoff i e excess irrigation water directly released to drainage ditches were taken off the canal seepage was determined by seepage coefficient of canal referring to previous studies qu et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 and the surface runoff was determined by excess irrigation coefficient referring to ren et al 2019b thirdly the rest water was reasonably allocated to each crop field based on the planting structure map the reference irrigation depths of each crop from other researches ren et al 2016 li et al 2020 and survey data from local farmers the irrigation depths in well irrigated areas were mainly determined by survey data from local farmers and administration bureau finally the spatial distribution of irrigation depth during the growing season was obtained fig 3c in addition combining the water diversions time provided by the local administration bureau with the survey data from local farmers the irrigation time for different kinds of crops both in canal and well irrigated areas were eventually obtained table 1 60 and 30 of the soil samples from field observations of our and other experiments hua et al 2018 can be classified as silt loam and sandy loam respectively indicating that the vertical and horizontal heterogeneity of soil are not so obvious in our study area therefore heji was divided into three subareas based on the three different clay content intervals i e with clay content smaller than 12 in a range of 12 18 and larger than 18 of surface soil obtained from soilgrids database https soilgrids org to describe the soil heterogeneities according to the all things are related but nearby things are more related than distant things principle tobler s first law of geography tfl the soil data in each simulation unit was further elaborated based on the information from field observation points in or near it the initial groundwater levels of each observation well were generated by subtracting the surface elevation from the groundwater depth observed in late april the surface elevation of each observation well was extracted from the high resolution dem data then the groundwater level map was obtained by ordinary kinging ok interpolation method after that the groundwater depth map in late april was obtained by subtracting groundwater level map from the dem using the raster calculator tool finally the groundwater depth of the study area was divided into five levels fig 3b the average groundwater depth of well irrigated areas in late april was generally deeper than 3 m due to frequent groundwater extraction for irrigation eventually the heji was divided into 172 and 169 simulation units in 2018 and 2019 respectively by overlaying the maps of planting structure irrigation depth soil texture and groundwater depth the areas of each simulation unit ranged from 0 01 to 5 0 km2 and the largest was natural land each simulation units had the same hydrologic conditions soil properties and one single kind of plant 2 3 3 model set up calibration and validation due to the groundwater level of each simulation unit was treated as the lower boundary conditions in ahc and the runoff hardly happened the simulation of each unit could be conducted independently all land covers maize sunflower wheat vegetable and natural land were considered in simulation the initial crop plant parameters were referenced to other similar researches jiang et al 2015 the simulated soil profile was 300 cm in depth and simplified to four layers according to the soil texture of the calibrated observation points table 2 the vertical one dimensional soil domain was discretized into 40 nodes with 4 kinds of space steps 1 cm 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm the space step of adjacent nodes coarsened from top to bottom gradually the initial soil hydraulic parameters of calibrated and validated points were obtained by the rosetta software schaap et al 2001 based on percentages of sand silt and clay the initial soil water content and salinity concentration for each simulation unit were derived from fig 3e and fig 3f respectively for water flow the upper boundary conditions were set as the flux boundary determined by rainfall evapotranspiration and irrigation for all simulation units the lower boundary conditions were set as the variable head boundary by providing daily groundwater depth gwd the daily groundwater depth of each simulation unit was obtained by three steps firstly the spatially averaged gwds in the late april of each simulation units were derived from fig 3b secondly the difference between the spatially averaged gwds obtained in first step and observed gwds of the nearest observation well was calculated on the same day thirdly the daily gwd of each simulation units were obtained by subtracting or add the difference obtained in second step from the daily observed gwd of the same observation well used in second step for solute transport the upper boundary conditions were set as a concentration flux boundary determined by the solute concentration of irrigation water the canal irrigation was 0 44 g l 1 and the well irrigation was 1 2 g l 1 the lower boundary conditions were set as the constant concentration boundary determined by the solute concentration of groundwater 1 2 g l 1 in the canal irrigated areas 1 8 g l 1 in the well irrigated areas the observed soil water contents soil salinity concentrations plant physiological indicators lai ch d agb in 2019 3 maize points 2 sunflower points 2 wheat points 3 vegetable points 2 natural land points with longer observation period and 2018 4 maize points 3 sunflower points 2 vegetables points 2 natural land points were used to calibrate and validate model respectively the simulation period was from april 1st to september 30th for wheat and from may 1st to september 30th for other crops or natural plants respectively covering the whole growing season of different crops or natural plants for the unit without monitoring points the parameters in a nearest calibrated unit were applied three indicators including the determination r2 the root mean square error rmse and the nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse were chosen to evaluate the model performance 2 4 water productivity calculation different expressions of water productivity kg m 3 have been proposed for various purposes over the past few years fernandez et al 2020 at field scale among them the ratio between the yield and evapotranspiration wp et the ratio between the yield and the total water applied by irrigation and precipitation wp ip and the ratio between the yield and the irrigation wp i were mostly used to evaluate the water productivity at field scale 1 w p e t y a e t a 2 w p i p y a i p 3 w p i y a i where y a is the actual yield kg ha 1 i e crop yield for cropland and aboveground dry matter for natural land et a is the actual evapotranspiration mm i is the irrigation depth mm p is the rainfall mm the calculation period of et a was from may 1st to september 30th which included the main growing periods of all crops except for wheat in this study the potential maximum yield y m of each crop was considered as the yield only under temperature stress and calculated by the method provided by epic operation manual then the methods proposed by ren et al 2021 were further used to calculate the equivalent water productivity ewp at regional scale defined as ewp et and ew ip corresponding to the definitions of eqn 1 and eqn 2 respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 model performance a total of 12 observation points in 2019 and 11 observation points in 2018 were used to calibrate and validate soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters the simulated soil water content and salinity concentrations in different soil layers of various land covers were in agreement with the observed results during the calibration and validation periods as shown in fig 5 during the calibration period the observed and simulated soil moisture content were distributed around the 1 1 line and the rmse values ranged from 0 039 to 0 048 cm3 cm 3 the r2 values were about 0 66 0 93 and the nse values were in a range of 0 64 0 93 during the validation period the range of rmse values was 0 033 0 048 cm3 cm 3 the r2 values changed between 0 73 and 0 95 and the variation range of nse was 0 71 0 93 the comparisons between the observed and simulated soil salinity concentrations during the calibration and validation period are shown in fig 6 during the calibration period the rmse values varied from 0 89 g l 1 to 3 17 g l 1 the r2 values were about 0 65 0 80 and the nse values were in a range of 0 61 0 80 while during the validation period the variation range of rmse values was 0 78 2 70 g l 1 the r2 values changed from 0 60 to 0 87 and nse values were about 0 55 0 86 a total of 10 observation points in 2019 3 maize points 2 sunflower points 2 wheat points 1 pepper point 2 reed points and 6 observation points in 2018 4 maize points 2 sunflower points were used to calibrate and validate the crop growth and water salt stress parameters as shown in table 3 the simulated crop indicators matched well with observed results during the calibration period the rmse nse r2 for lai varied from 0 24 to 0 66 m2 m 2 0 53 0 78 and 0 82 0 95 respectively the rmse nse r2 for ch varied from 6 8 to 27 cm 0 82 0 93 and 0 82 0 99 respectively the rmse nse r2 for above ground dry biomass d agb varied from 1 3 to 3 5 t ha 1 0 63 0 92 and 0 74 0 94 respectively during the validation period the goodness of fit indicators for lai rmse 0 9 m2 m 2 nse 0 75 r2 0 89 and ch rmse 21 1 cm nse 0 80 r2 0 91 of maize were quite reasonable and those for lai rmse 0 59 m2 m 2 nse 0 85 r2 0 88 and ch rmse 31 5 cm nse 0 85 r2 0 93 of sunflower were also acceptable the simulated lai and d agb developing process of main crops at typical observation points were in good agreement with the observed results during the calibration period fig 7 especially for maize the simulated and observed yields or cumulative d agb of different crops or plants were listed in table 4 the simulated yields of maize sunflower and wheat matched well with observed results both in 2018 and 2019 but the simulated cumulative d agb of reed were just acceptable in 2019 assuming that the crop traits among cultivars were similar and the cultivar improvements between the two years were small in this study area the crop parameters could be cross calibrated and validated in one year at different observation points although the observed crop growth data used to validate the model 2018 was less the data used to calibrate 2019 was relatively abundant therefore the calibration and validation for crop parameters was sufficient based on the two year experiments the calibrated crop growth and root water uptake parameters are listed in table 5 and table 6 which are generally close to other studies at the same latitude zones jiang et al 2015 hao et al 2015 ren et al 2016 chen et al 2019 rossetto et al 2019 xiong et al 2021 table 7 the soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters are presented in table 2 which are close to other studies in hid yu et al 2013 ren et al 2016 sun et al 2019 zhuang et al 2020 table 7 in summary the simulated results matched the observed data acceptably indicating the distributed ahc model could describe the agro hydrological process and crop growth process reasonably the simulation results were further used to analyze the agro hydrological processes and water productivity at field and regional scales 3 2 water and salt balance and yields 3 2 1 water balance the gis based ahc model described the spatial variation of actual evapotranspiration et a during the main growing season from may 1st to september 30th in detail as shown in fig 8 the spatial distribution of et a varied significantly ranging from 52 to 788 mm during the growing season the results were in consistent with those reported by yu et al 2019 and ren et al 2019a for example yu et al 2019 used the remote sensing method to evaluate et a for different land covers during the growing season and they found that et a in hid ranged from 55 mm to 705 mm ren et al 2019a used a distributed model to simulate the agro hydrological processes in a canal command area of hid and they found that et a was in a range of 162 567 mm during the growing season of 2013 a dry year the et a in canal irrigated areas was generally higher than that in well irrigated areas taking the year of 2018 as an example the spatially averaged et a in canal irrigated areas was 474 mm which was higher than that in well irrigated areas with the value of 420 mm the reason for this might be that the actual soil evaporation e a in canal irrigated areas was larger than that in well irrigated areas for all land covers due to the shallow groundwater depth table 8 in addition both in canal irrigated areas and in well irrigated areas the spatially averaged et a of maize was generally higher than other land covers due to the longest growth period and the largest transpiration while that of the natural land was the lowest the cumulative net bottom water flux n w i e the net amount of water recharging positive or leaving negative the root zone through the bottom the cumulative upward bottom water flux u w i e the total amount of water recharging the root zone through the bottom and the cumulative downward bottom water flux d w i e the total amount of water leaving the root zone through the bottom of root zone 0 90 cm during the main growing season from may 1st to september 30th of 2019 are shown in fig 9 a c results showed that d w was slightly smaller in well irrigated areas than that in canal irrigated areas fig 9c taking the year of 2019 as an example d w in well irrigated areas ranged from 0 mm to 427 mm and spatially averaged 174 mm while that in canal irrigated areas was in a range of 0 590 mm and spatially averaged 248 mm table 8 this might be attributed to groundwater discharged by drainage ditches and groundwater exchange between different landscapes ren et al 2019a in addition among different lands d w in maize fields was the largest due to the largest irrigation depth in both canal irrigated areas and well irrigated areas consistent with d w u w was obviously higher in canal irrigated areas than that in well irrigated areas for all land covers due to the shallow groundwater table depth fig 9b table 8 for instance the spatially averaged u w in canal irrigated areas was 278 mm during the growing season of 2019 which was significantly higher than that in well irrigated areas with the value of 50 mm besides the cumulative upward bottom water flux of sunflower fields was the largest among different land covers both in canal irrigated areas and in well irrigated areas table 8 u w and d w were both greater in canal irrigated areas than those in well irrigated areas fig 9b and c indicating that the water exchanged between the root zone and deep soil layer more frequently in canal irrigated areas than that in well irrigated areas in general the cumulative net bottom water flow direction was mostly upward in canal irrigated areas with spatially averaged n w of 30 mm in 2019 while that was mainly downward in well irrigated areas with spatially averaged n w of 124 mm fig 9a furthermore both in canal irrigated areas and in well irrigated areas the cumulative net bottom water flow direction of natural lands and wheat fields were mostly upward table 8 3 2 2 salt balance the spatial distribution trend of cumulative net bottom salt flux n s i e the net amount of salt brought to positive or leached out of negative the root zone through the bottom upward bottom salt flux u s i e the amount of salt brought to the root zone through the bottom and downward bottom salt flux d s i e the amount of salt leached out of the root zone of root zone during the main growing season of 2019 are shown in fig 9 d f results showed that d s was slightly greater in canal irrigated areas than that in well irrigated areas fig 9f for example in 2019 the spatially averaged d s in canal irrigated areas was 735 g m 2 which was slightly larger than the value of 668 g m 2 in well irrigated areas moreover both in canal irrigated areas and in well irrigated areas d s of maize fields was the largest due to the largest irrigation depth while that of natural lands was the lowest table 8 consistent with d s u s was obviously larger in canal irrigated areas than that in well irrigated areas for all land covers fig 9e indicating that the risk of soil salinization in canal irrigated areas was greater than that in well irrigated areas taking maize as an example the spatially averaged u s in canal irrigated areas was 624 g m 2 during the growing season of 2019 which was six times as large as that in well irrigated areas 104 g m 2 furthermore both in canal irrigated areas and in well irrigated areas the largest upward bottom salt flux of root zone in sunflower fields was consistent to its largest bottom upward water flux of root zone as shown in fig 9d the cumulative net bottom salt flux of root zone was generally downward in well irrigated areas n s 0 while the cumulative net bottom salt flux of root zone in canal irrigated areas was complicated both downward and upward and the net salt leached out of the root zone n s 0 was larger in well irrigated areas than that in canal irrigated areas for example the spatially averaged salt leached out of the root zone in well irrigated areas was 545 g m 2 during the growing season of 2019 which was quite larger than that in canal irrigated areas with the value of 159 g m 2 the spatial distribution trend of salt accumulation or desalinization s in root zone 0 90 cm during the main growing season from may 1st to september 30th of 2018 and 2019 are shown in fig 10 comparing the results of the two years the area showing salt accumulation during the growing season of 2018 51 12 km2 was smaller than that of 2019 57 60 km2 indicating that the risk of salt accumulation in root zone was higher in the dry year 2019 in addition the salt accumulation in canal irrigated areas was more serious than that in well irrigated areas for example during the growing season of 2019 there was approximately 50 of the land in canal irrigated areas showing salt accumulation while that was approximately 27 in well irrigated areas besides both in canal irrigated areas and in well irrigated areas the salt accumulation in wheat fields was the largest due to the high soil evaporation while desalinization in maize fields was the most significant one due to the largest irrigation depth table 8 therefore the autumn irrigation is necessary for wheat fields to control the soil salinity 3 2 3 crops and natural vegetation yields the potential maximum yields or cumulative d agb y m the spatially averaged actual yields or cumulative d agb y a and the salt water stress index α ws of different land covers are shown in table 9 comparing the results of the two years y m of all land covers was higher in 2018 implying that climate conditions had impacts on the potential maximum yields or cumulative d agb of crops natural vegetation compared with previous studies in the nearby area y m of sunflower 4 82 4 97 t ha 1 and wheat 7 52 7 71 t ha 1 in our study was close to the result of ren et al 2021 sunflower 4 5 t ha 1 wheat 7 5 t ha 1 while y m of maize 15 08 15 28 t ha 1 in our study was close to the largest yield reported by li et al 2020 15 5 t ha 1 as for y a the spatially averaged y a of maize wheat and sunflower were slightly higher in canal irrigated areas than those in well irrigated areas while the spatially averaged y a of vegetables was higher in well irrigated areas than that in canal irrigated areas due to less water salt stress experienced the α ws which reflects the water salt stress on crop or natural vegetation growth was defined as the ratio between y a and y m assuming that there was no water and salt stress for all crops by conducting several management measures the yields might reach up to the potential maximum value and this potentiality can be quantified by 100 subtracting α ws in percentage in canal irrigated areas the yields of sunflower might be improved most with a range of 0 34 and averaged 5 while that of maize might be improved least with a range of 0 24 and averaged 3 in well irrigated areas the yields of sunflower might be increased most range of 0 18 14 on average while the yields of vegetables in well irrigated areas have the lowest improving potentiality range of 0 2 1 on average indicating that the irrigation met the water required by vegetables and salt stress was very low in this region y e reflects the growth conditions of different crops natural vegetation and the higher the y e is the better growth conditions the crop natural vegetation has ren et al 2021 y e of natural lands was obviously lower than that of croplands due to the higher water salt stress which is similar to the result of ren et al 2021 for croplands y e was obviously low in southernmost parts with high soil salinity fig 3f indicating that soil salinity affects crop growth greatly except for the southernmost parts y e of croplands in canal irrigated areas was slightly higher than other parts in well irrigated areas fig 11a 3 3 water productivity at field scale the spatially averaged wp et wp ip and wp i for different land covers in canal and well irrigated areas are shown in table 10 the spatially averaged wp et of vegetables sunflower and maize in canal irrigated areas was similar with that in well irrigated areas however the spatially averaged wp et of wheat and natural vegetation in canal irrigated areas was lower than that in well irrigated areas the reason might be that the actual soil evaporation in wheat fields and natural lands was obviously lower in well irrigated areas than that in canal irrigated areas table 8 while there was no significant difference in yields of wheat and natural vegetation between canal and well irrigated areas table 9 compared with previous studies the wp et of maize spatially averaged 2 61 2 75 kg m 3 and wheat spatially averaged 1 32 1 73 kg m 3 were close to the values reported by li et al 2020 maize 2 45 2 63 kg m 3 and zhang et al 2013 wheat 1 10 1 76 kg m 3 in nearby areas using border irrigation method respectively wp et of sunflower spatially averaged 0 94 1 13 kg m 3 was generally lower than a study with drip irrigation 1 22 1 78 kg m 3 li et al 2015 different with wp et the spatially averaged wp ip of all land covers was higher in canal irrigated areas than that in well irrigated areas for example the spatially averaged wp ip of vegetables in canal irrigated areas was 1 05 kg m 3 during the growing season of 2019 which was about twice as that in well irrigated areas consistent with wp ip the spatially averaged wp i of all crops was generally higher in canal irrigated areas than that in well irrigated areas especially for maize and wheat taking maize as an example the spatially averaged wp i in canal irrigated areas was 3 21 kg m 3 during the growing season of 2019 which is approximately 30 higher than that 2 39 kg m 3 in well irrigated areas at regional scale the spatial distribution of ewp et and ewp ip during the growing season of 2019 is shown in fig 11 b c ewp et was slightly higher in well irrigated areas with the spatially averaged value of 3 74 kg m 3 in 2019 than that in canal irrigated areas with the spatially averaged value of 3 29 kg m 3 in 2019 the spatial distribution trend of ewp ip fig 11c decreased with the irrigation depth increase fig 3c therefore in contrast to ewp et ewp ip was obviously lower in well irrigated areas spatially averaged value of 3 63 kg m 3 than that in canal irrigated areas spatially averaged value of 4 61 kg m 3 due to the larger irrigation depth implying that water applied in well irrigated areas was used less efficiently than that in canal irrigated areas 3 4 strategies for improving water productivity the water productivity could be improved both at field and regional scales van halsema and vincent 2012 in canal irrigated areas at regional scale the regional water productivity can be improved by optimally allocating irrigation water in the relevant areas for example to improve ewp ip water allocated in the middle part of the canal irrigated areas of heji should be reduced while water distributed in the southern and northern parts of the canal irrigated areas of heji should be increased moreover water for irrigation is better used directly rather than reused by capillary rise direct usage can enhance salt leaching while water reused by capillary rise may cause salt accumulation and crop loss huang et al 2018 ren et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 and then reduces the ewp et therefore canal lining is also an efficient approach to improve ewp et due to that it can reduce water conveyance loss through canal seepage which is always reused by capillary rise at field scale water productivity can be improved by adopting the optimized irrigation scheduling efficient irrigation technologies and efficient drainage systems in general with the optimized irrigation scheduling water can be applied timely and efficiently in terms of the rainfall events to meet the requirement of crop growth and leach salt out of the root zone application of the efficient irrigation technologies e g furrow irrigation dong et al 2018 deficit irrigation gao et al 2017 and drip irrigation li et al 2020 has been proved to be valuable practices to improve water productivity in hid implementation of efficient drainage for maintaining appropriate groundwater table depth is beneficial to increase the direct water utilization and reduce water reuse by capillary rise especially in salt affected area in well irrigated areas both at regional and field scales water productivity can be improved by adopting the optimized irrigation scheduling and efficient irrigation technologies with the optimized irrigation scheduling irrigation water can be appropriately applied according to rainfall events to guarantee crop growth and to avoid the deep percolation loss using the efficient irrigation technologies such as furrow irrigation drip irrigation and deficit irrigation can not only satisfy crop water requirement but also does not cause soil salinity in these areas if an appropriate leaching requirement is considered 4 conclusions in this study the agro hydrological chemical and crop systems simulator ahc was used in a distributed manner with the assistance of gis the model was applied successfully with acceptable results of goodness of fit indicators for soil water content soil salt concentration and crop growth agro hydrological processes and water productivity of the canal and well irrigated areas were investigated based on model simulation results several conclusions can be drawn from the current research 1 significant differences were found in the agro hydrological processes between canal and well irrigated areas the spatially averaged actual evapotranspiration et a in canal irrigated areas was generally higher than that in well irrigated areas the cumulative net bottom water flux of root zone was mostly upward in canal irrigated areas while that was mainly downward in well irrigated areas the cumulative net bottom salt flux of root zone in well irrigated areas was generally downward and the salt accumulation was more serious in canal irrigated areas than that in well irrigated areas 2 water productivity in canal irrigated areas was different from that in well irrigated areas the applied water including irrigation and rainfall was in higher efficient utilization with higher ewp ip in canal irrigated areas than that in well irrigated areas however the total water consumption evapotranspiration was in lower efficient utilization with lower ewp et in canal irrigated areas than that in well irrigated areas 3 in canal irrigated areas optimizing irrigation scheduling applying efficient irrigation technologies and adopting efficient drainage systems are useful methods to improve water productivity at field scale while canal lining and optimal water allocation are beneficial for the improvement of water productivity at regional scale in well irrigated areas adopting optimized irrigation scheduling and efficient irrigation technologies are crucial to improve water productivity both at regional and field scales declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9532,understanding the agro hydrological processes and water productivity of canal and well irrigated systems is vital for agricultural water management in arid regions in this study the agro hydrological chemical and crop systems simulator ahc was used in a distributed manner to evaluate the agro hydrological processes and to assess water productivity under the conditions of canal and well irrigated systems with the heji irrigation system heji located in the arid upper yellow river basin northwest china as the case study area the ahc was calibrated and validated by the field observation data of 2018 and 2019 then the model was used in a distributed manner for the entire heji results showed that there were significant differences in the agro hydrological processes and water productivity between canal and well irrigated areas the spatially averaged actual evapotranspiration was larger in canal irrigated areas and the cumulative net bottom water and salt fluxes were mainly downward in well irrigated areas the applied water was used more efficiently with higher equivalent water productivity of water applied ewp ip in canal irrigated areas however the total water consumption evapotranspiration was in higher efficient utilization with higher equivalent water productivity of water consumption ewp et in well irrigated areas these findings can provide implications for regional irrigation water management and salinity control in the arid areas keywords conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater water management salinity control irrigation district canal irrigation well irrigation 1 introduction the rapid growth of the world s population has led to an increase in food demand tilman et al 2011 and agricultural water requirements grafton et al 2015 which has further aggravated the contradiction between the supply and demand of water resources especially in the arid and semi arid regions the agricultural production is highly dependent on irrigation in these regions irrigation on one hand guarantees the water demand for crop growth on the other hand improper irrigation e g flood irrigation may also cause soil salinization and water loss which may significantly decrease agricultural productivity raeisi et al 2019 wichelns and qadir 2015 xu et al 2013 to meet crop water requirements and to control soil salinity conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater i e canal irrigation and well irrigation has become an optional alternative for crop production worldwide li et al 2018 singh 2014 it was reported that nearly 40 of the irrigated areas in the world used surface and ground water conjunctively thenkabail et al 2009 such as the middle and upper yellow river basin in china mao et al 2017 the singkarak ombilin river basin in indonesia peranginangin et al 2004 and the yaqui river basin in mexico schoups et al 2006 the catchment with some parts irrigated by surface water and another parts irrigated by groundwater can be divided into canal and well irrigated areas the agro hydrological processes in canal and well irrigated areas are significantly different for example in the hetao irrigation district at upper yellow river basin of northwest china groundwater table in canal irrigated areas is usually very shallow and capillary rise is strong ren et al 2016 which not only replenishes water in root zone but also carries salt to this zone the groundwater table in well irrigated areas is generally deep below the land surface and capillary rise is weak which leads to relatively large deep percolation and efficient salt leaching singh 2021 in addition pumping groundwater for irrigation may reuse the seepage and percolated water from canal irrigated areas to some extent by groundwater exchange between canal and well irrigated areas bejranonda et al 2013 therefore the agro hydrological processes are quite complicated under the conditions of canal and well irrigated systems previous studies mostly focused on groundwater exchange between canal and well irrigated areas yang et al 2021 and the management strategies about water allocation safavi and esmikhani 2013 wu et al 2015 however for the catchment under the conditions of canal and well irrigated systems the agro hydrological processes of root zone have not been well studied or have been over simplified for example the root zone was simplified as one layer and different management practices such as plant structure mulch treatments soil heterogeneities in fields were not considered in the model mao et al 2017 this may cause the biased estimation of water and salt balance in root zone moreover few researches were concentrated on water productivity wp at multiple scales in catchment under the conditions of canal and well irrigated systems field experiments and model simulations are two major approaches used to analyze agro hydrological processes and water productivity field experiments can obtain various information about hydrological processes in aquifer soil plant atmosphere systems and plant growth under different irrigation and management practices however they are always costly and time consuming model simulations can efficiently and conveniently obtain continuous information and have been widely used at multiple scales in general model simulations are performed in a distributed manner due to the heterogeneity of soil groundwater cropping pattern as well as water application in relatively large scales e g the scale of canal command area and the scale of irrigation district to perform the distributed simulation one can use either the regional scale integrated models or the gis based one dimensional models the regional scale integrated models e g swat arnold et al 1998 swat modflow sophocleous et al 1999 hydrogeosphere brunner and simmons 2012 swat ag xiong et al 2019 gsflow markstrom et al 2008 and riwp xue et al 2020 usually treat the target area as the aggregation of hydrological response units hru and each hru has the similar soil poperties land use surface slope and field management practices etc this kind of models always simplifies the root zone water and salt transport processes which may greatly affect the plant growth and water productivity the gis based one dimensional models are generally established by coupling gis with one dimensional models e g swap van dam et al 1997 aquacrop raes et al 2009 swap epic xu et al 2013 hydrus dualkc ren et al 2016 and ahc xu et al 2018 for example droogers et al 2000 used swap in a distributed manner to reveal all the terms of the water banlance of an irrigation system in western turkey lorite et al 2013 developed the software of aquadata and aquagis to extend the application of aquacrop to regional scale compared with the regional scale integrated models the gis based one dimensional models can describe the vertical water flow in aquifer soil plant atmosphere systems of root zone under different management practices in more details while without considering the horizontal groundwater movement in aquifers however the applicability of these models has not been well tested in catchment under the conditions of canal and well irrigated systems in addition among the one dimensional models the ahc model showed its ability to describe the complicated interactions between the agro hydrological processes and crop growth huang et al 2020 liu et al 2020 thereby the gis based ahc was selected as the tool to analyze agro hydrological processes in root zone and water productivity in our current study the patterns of wp in irrigation systems are usually important for developing water saving strategies in general wp defined as the yield obtained by per unit of water consumption molden et al 2010 has been used to assess agricultural water production the previous assessments of wp were always concentrated on a single crop at field scale sun et al 2017 or simply accumulates the yields of different crops to evaluate wp at regional scale huang and li 2010 jiang et al 2015 such a treatment might result in biased estimation of wp in these regions with fragmented land covers at regional scale due to the different physiological characteristics of different crops and plants to meet the knowledge gaps mentioned before ren et al 2021 proposed an approach to evaluate wp at regional scale by unifying the yield of different crops and plants however in their study the selection of the potential maximum yield of each crop was highly dependent on the survey data obtained which might bring uncertainties thereby further research are still required in this study the heji irrigation system heji in the upper yellow river basin northwest china under conditions of the canal and well irrigated systems was selected as the case study area the main objectives are 1 to analyze the agro hydrological processes of root zone in canal and well irrigated areas 2 to comprehensively analyze wp in canal and well irrigated areas and 3 to provide implications for wp improvements in the catchment under the conditions of canal and well irrigated systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the heji irrigation system heji 40º40 40º57 n 107º12 107º24 e located in the western part of hetao irrigation district hid was taken as the case study area which covers an area about 17 900 ha the terrain of hid is very flat gradually decreasing from south to north xiao et al 2021 the study area has a typical arid climate with average annual temperature of 7 average annual sunshine duration of 3100 3300 h and mean frost free days over 150 d liu et al 2021 average annual precipitation and reference evapotranspiration et o is about 140 mm ren et al 2019a and 800 1200 mm li et al 2022 respectively thereby irrigation is very important to maintain the agricultural production there are five land use types in heji fig 1 including croplands wastelands residential lands sand dunes and waterbodies which cover 64 43 12 10 20 67 1 33 1 46 of the region respectively small farmer production is very popular in hid due to the farmland policy so called household responsibility contract system farmers always make their own decisions about what to plant according to the land quality salinization and fertility level of soils irrigation water supply capacity and market price hence the crop pattern is highly fragmented and randomly distributed ren et al 2019a for the past few years maize and sunflower occupied 70 of the croplands while the rest lands were planted with wheat and vegetables e g tomato pepper cucurbit some salt tolerant plants grow in the natural lands inlaid in the cropland such as reed tamarix chinensis elymus dauricus etc as a result the landscape is divided into a mosaic of mixed crop fields and natural vegetation patches heji has a complete canal network consisting of a main canal 6 sub main canals numerous secondary canals field canals and terminal canals fig 1 the drainage system including one main ditch one sub main ditch 8 secondary ditches and some field ditches collects the return water of irrigation and discharges drainage water fig 1 the drainage effluent was not reused for irrigation or disposed in the irrigated area the main ditch and sub main ditch form the east and northwest boundary of heji respectively in addition a sub main canal forms the southwest boundary fig 1 the ditch depth is generally 3 5 4 m hence heji can be regarded as a relatively closed basin with less connectivity to neighboring areas hundreds of pumping wells are distributed around the urban and planted areas of cash crops according to the distribution of pumping wells and water diversion of each canal the study area is divided into canal and well irrigated areas fig 2 normally there are 5 6 water diversions in canal irrigated areas during the growing season based on water supply capacity of yellow river groundwater irrigation is timely and adequate in well irrigated areas only a few natural patches are irrigated once and croplands are irrigated several times during the growing season flood irrigation is the major irrigation method in heji the average groundwater depth in well irrigated areas is about 4 m and that is about 2 m in canal irrigated areas 2 2 observations measurements and data collections field observations were carried out in heji during the growing season of 2018 and 2019 sixteen observation points were selected to obtain the time information of soil water soil salinity and crop growth fig 2 the observation points were arranged based on the map of land use planting structure and distribution of canal and well irrigated areas soil samplings were conducted every 10 15 days by using a soil auger to measure soil water content and soil salt concentration the soil moisture was measured in six layers to a depth of 100 cm every 10 cm in the top 0 20 cm layer and every 20 cm increments below the top layer by oven drying method the salt content of the soil solution csw g l 1 was determined by the electrical conductivity of the 1 5 soil water extract using the calculation method suggested by xu et al 2013 leaf area index lai and crop height ch were also measured every 10 15 days by using accupar lp80 decagon devices usa and steel tape respectively the development stages of main crops including natural vegetation planting density and plastic film mulching ratios of maize sunflower and vegetables were recorded crop yields were measured after harvest the dry above ground biomass d agb was additionally measured in 2019 by oven drying to constant mass at 75 the soil textures in the profile to a depth of 200 cm at the sixteen observation points were measured using a laser particle size analyzer master sizer 2000 malvern england while soil textures in the profile to a depth of 40 cm at other 109 points were obtained from hua et al 2018 see fig 3d sixteen monitoring wells were installed at the places near the soil sampling points to monitor the groundwater depth hourly by water level loggers hobo u20 usa and groundwater electrical conductivity ec gw was measured with samples by an electric conductivity meter ddsj 308a china every 10 15 days then the groundwater electrical conductivity ec gw was converted to tds total dissolved solids g l 1 using the empirical relationship tds 0 69ecgw ms cm 1 ren et al 2016 in addition the groundwater depth and groundwater tds of other 40 observation wells were collected from hua et al 2018 and the local administration bureau fig 2 to identify the spatial distribution of initial soil water content and soil salinity before the growing season an extra soil sampling covered the whole heji was performed in late april of 2019 2019 4 20 2019 4 25 and the distance between two adjacent sampling points was about 1 5 km in total the initial soil water content and salinity in the profile to a depth of 40 cm at 85 sampling points were obtained soil water and salt contents were measured by using the aforementioned methods finally the distribution maps of average soil water and salt content within 0 40 cm soil profile were obtained by using the inverse distance weighting idw interpolation method fig 3 e f the information of water conveyance in the main 6 sub main and some secondary canals was collected from the local administration bureau canal lining ratio canal section shape and ditch section shape were obtained by field investigation the salt concentration of irrigation water was observed once every round of irrigation topographic map soil map satellite images of sentinel and high resolution google earth images were also collected for further analysis the daily meteorological data on rainfall temperature humidity wind speed and sunshine duration of linhe national meteorological data monitoring site were downloaded through the china meteorological data sharing network http data cma cn since heji is not so large the climate conditions can be treated as the same in addition atmospheric pressure for adjusting water level loggers was collected hourly by small automatic recording weather station hobo usa within study area the daily groundwater depths at typical observation points in canal and well irrigated areas are shown in fig 4 2 3 distributed modeling 2 3 1 the ahc model in distributed manner the ahc agro hydrological chemical and crop systems simulator is a one dimensional kinetic model developed by xu et al 2018 including agroecosystem simulation aesim process global sensitivity analysis gsa process global parameter estimation gpe process and graphical user interface gui the aesim process is the core of the model which inherited and modified from swap epic xu et al 2013 and other modules were developed to assist users to use the model more conveniently the aesim process can simulate the soil water flow soil solute transport and transformation heat transport and crop growth the model uses 1 d richard s equation and convective dispersion equation to describe soil water and solute transport respectively the upper boundary condition is determined by irrigation rainfall evaporation and transpiration for the estimation of actual evaporation e a and actual transpiration t a firstly the potential evapotranspiration et p was calculated by penman monteith equation monteith 1965 secondly et p is partitioned into potential soil evaporation e p and potential plant transpiration t p based on leaf area index lai then e a and t a were obtained as a function of available soil water in the surface soil and root zone respectively the lower boundary is mainly related to the depth of groundwater table the source and sink items consider the root water extracting and drainage crop growth is governed by accumulated temperature process and affected by light interception plant radiation use efficiency water stress temperature stress and salt stress simultaneously the model has a friendly operation interface and a convenient data dealing platform in addition the ahc model has been closely coupled with gis software to apply at regional scale a more detailed description of ahc model can be found in xu et al 2018 2 3 2 spatial data processing and aggregation dividing the study area into a group of homogeneous simulation units properly is important to conduct the distributed simulation and further analyze the agro hydrologic processes the daily meteorological data form linhe weather station was used for the entire heji region then planting structure irrigation depth soil texture and groundwater depth were considered to generate homogeneous simulation units these data were mainly obtained by field experiments remote sensing images and surveyed data high resolution google earth images 1 8 m resolution were used to generate the planting structure and land use map in 2018 by the methods provided by feng et al 2020 the planting structure and land use map in 2019 were obtained from the local meteorological bureau based on 10 m resolution sentinel 2a 1b remote sensing images since the width and length of each field within study area are generally longer than 10 m the map of planting structure and land use map generated were reliable as shown in fig 3a a total of 5 vegetation cover types maize sunflower wheat vegetables and natural vegetation were classified for model simulation in the study area wheat sunflower and wheat vegetables rotation were few and neglected pepper which was the most widely planted vegetable was chosen as representative crops for vegetable fields since reed covered most of the natural land it was taken as the representative vegetation for natural land cover the irrigation depths of different fields were quite different due to different water supply capacities and water requirements the calculations of irrigation depths in canal irrigated area were as follows firstly the total volume of water diverted was calculated according to the information provided by the local administration bureau secondly the canal seepage and surface runoff i e excess irrigation water directly released to drainage ditches were taken off the canal seepage was determined by seepage coefficient of canal referring to previous studies qu et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 and the surface runoff was determined by excess irrigation coefficient referring to ren et al 2019b thirdly the rest water was reasonably allocated to each crop field based on the planting structure map the reference irrigation depths of each crop from other researches ren et al 2016 li et al 2020 and survey data from local farmers the irrigation depths in well irrigated areas were mainly determined by survey data from local farmers and administration bureau finally the spatial distribution of irrigation depth during the growing season was obtained fig 3c in addition combining the water diversions time provided by the local administration bureau with the survey data from local farmers the irrigation time for different kinds of crops both in canal and well irrigated areas were eventually obtained table 1 60 and 30 of the soil samples from field observations of our and other experiments hua et al 2018 can be classified as silt loam and sandy loam respectively indicating that the vertical and horizontal heterogeneity of soil are not so obvious in our study area therefore heji was divided into three subareas based on the three different clay content intervals i e with clay content smaller than 12 in a range of 12 18 and larger than 18 of surface soil obtained from soilgrids database https soilgrids org to describe the soil heterogeneities according to the all things are related but nearby things are more related than distant things principle tobler s first law of geography tfl the soil data in each simulation unit was further elaborated based on the information from field observation points in or near it the initial groundwater levels of each observation well were generated by subtracting the surface elevation from the groundwater depth observed in late april the surface elevation of each observation well was extracted from the high resolution dem data then the groundwater level map was obtained by ordinary kinging ok interpolation method after that the groundwater depth map in late april was obtained by subtracting groundwater level map from the dem using the raster calculator tool finally the groundwater depth of the study area was divided into five levels fig 3b the average groundwater depth of well irrigated areas in late april was generally deeper than 3 m due to frequent groundwater extraction for irrigation eventually the heji was divided into 172 and 169 simulation units in 2018 and 2019 respectively by overlaying the maps of planting structure irrigation depth soil texture and groundwater depth the areas of each simulation unit ranged from 0 01 to 5 0 km2 and the largest was natural land each simulation units had the same hydrologic conditions soil properties and one single kind of plant 2 3 3 model set up calibration and validation due to the groundwater level of each simulation unit was treated as the lower boundary conditions in ahc and the runoff hardly happened the simulation of each unit could be conducted independently all land covers maize sunflower wheat vegetable and natural land were considered in simulation the initial crop plant parameters were referenced to other similar researches jiang et al 2015 the simulated soil profile was 300 cm in depth and simplified to four layers according to the soil texture of the calibrated observation points table 2 the vertical one dimensional soil domain was discretized into 40 nodes with 4 kinds of space steps 1 cm 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm the space step of adjacent nodes coarsened from top to bottom gradually the initial soil hydraulic parameters of calibrated and validated points were obtained by the rosetta software schaap et al 2001 based on percentages of sand silt and clay the initial soil water content and salinity concentration for each simulation unit were derived from fig 3e and fig 3f respectively for water flow the upper boundary conditions were set as the flux boundary determined by rainfall evapotranspiration and irrigation for all simulation units the lower boundary conditions were set as the variable head boundary by providing daily groundwater depth gwd the daily groundwater depth of each simulation unit was obtained by three steps firstly the spatially averaged gwds in the late april of each simulation units were derived from fig 3b secondly the difference between the spatially averaged gwds obtained in first step and observed gwds of the nearest observation well was calculated on the same day thirdly the daily gwd of each simulation units were obtained by subtracting or add the difference obtained in second step from the daily observed gwd of the same observation well used in second step for solute transport the upper boundary conditions were set as a concentration flux boundary determined by the solute concentration of irrigation water the canal irrigation was 0 44 g l 1 and the well irrigation was 1 2 g l 1 the lower boundary conditions were set as the constant concentration boundary determined by the solute concentration of groundwater 1 2 g l 1 in the canal irrigated areas 1 8 g l 1 in the well irrigated areas the observed soil water contents soil salinity concentrations plant physiological indicators lai ch d agb in 2019 3 maize points 2 sunflower points 2 wheat points 3 vegetable points 2 natural land points with longer observation period and 2018 4 maize points 3 sunflower points 2 vegetables points 2 natural land points were used to calibrate and validate model respectively the simulation period was from april 1st to september 30th for wheat and from may 1st to september 30th for other crops or natural plants respectively covering the whole growing season of different crops or natural plants for the unit without monitoring points the parameters in a nearest calibrated unit were applied three indicators including the determination r2 the root mean square error rmse and the nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse were chosen to evaluate the model performance 2 4 water productivity calculation different expressions of water productivity kg m 3 have been proposed for various purposes over the past few years fernandez et al 2020 at field scale among them the ratio between the yield and evapotranspiration wp et the ratio between the yield and the total water applied by irrigation and precipitation wp ip and the ratio between the yield and the irrigation wp i were mostly used to evaluate the water productivity at field scale 1 w p e t y a e t a 2 w p i p y a i p 3 w p i y a i where y a is the actual yield kg ha 1 i e crop yield for cropland and aboveground dry matter for natural land et a is the actual evapotranspiration mm i is the irrigation depth mm p is the rainfall mm the calculation period of et a was from may 1st to september 30th which included the main growing periods of all crops except for wheat in this study the potential maximum yield y m of each crop was considered as the yield only under temperature stress and calculated by the method provided by epic operation manual then the methods proposed by ren et al 2021 were further used to calculate the equivalent water productivity ewp at regional scale defined as ewp et and ew ip corresponding to the definitions of eqn 1 and eqn 2 respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 model performance a total of 12 observation points in 2019 and 11 observation points in 2018 were used to calibrate and validate soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters the simulated soil water content and salinity concentrations in different soil layers of various land covers were in agreement with the observed results during the calibration and validation periods as shown in fig 5 during the calibration period the observed and simulated soil moisture content were distributed around the 1 1 line and the rmse values ranged from 0 039 to 0 048 cm3 cm 3 the r2 values were about 0 66 0 93 and the nse values were in a range of 0 64 0 93 during the validation period the range of rmse values was 0 033 0 048 cm3 cm 3 the r2 values changed between 0 73 and 0 95 and the variation range of nse was 0 71 0 93 the comparisons between the observed and simulated soil salinity concentrations during the calibration and validation period are shown in fig 6 during the calibration period the rmse values varied from 0 89 g l 1 to 3 17 g l 1 the r2 values were about 0 65 0 80 and the nse values were in a range of 0 61 0 80 while during the validation period the variation range of rmse values was 0 78 2 70 g l 1 the r2 values changed from 0 60 to 0 87 and nse values were about 0 55 0 86 a total of 10 observation points in 2019 3 maize points 2 sunflower points 2 wheat points 1 pepper point 2 reed points and 6 observation points in 2018 4 maize points 2 sunflower points were used to calibrate and validate the crop growth and water salt stress parameters as shown in table 3 the simulated crop indicators matched well with observed results during the calibration period the rmse nse r2 for lai varied from 0 24 to 0 66 m2 m 2 0 53 0 78 and 0 82 0 95 respectively the rmse nse r2 for ch varied from 6 8 to 27 cm 0 82 0 93 and 0 82 0 99 respectively the rmse nse r2 for above ground dry biomass d agb varied from 1 3 to 3 5 t ha 1 0 63 0 92 and 0 74 0 94 respectively during the validation period the goodness of fit indicators for lai rmse 0 9 m2 m 2 nse 0 75 r2 0 89 and ch rmse 21 1 cm nse 0 80 r2 0 91 of maize were quite reasonable and those for lai rmse 0 59 m2 m 2 nse 0 85 r2 0 88 and ch rmse 31 5 cm nse 0 85 r2 0 93 of sunflower were also acceptable the simulated lai and d agb developing process of main crops at typical observation points were in good agreement with the observed results during the calibration period fig 7 especially for maize the simulated and observed yields or cumulative d agb of different crops or plants were listed in table 4 the simulated yields of maize sunflower and wheat matched well with observed results both in 2018 and 2019 but the simulated cumulative d agb of reed were just acceptable in 2019 assuming that the crop traits among cultivars were similar and the cultivar improvements between the two years were small in this study area the crop parameters could be cross calibrated and validated in one year at different observation points although the observed crop growth data used to validate the model 2018 was less the data used to calibrate 2019 was relatively abundant therefore the calibration and validation for crop parameters was sufficient based on the two year experiments the calibrated crop growth and root water uptake parameters are listed in table 5 and table 6 which are generally close to other studies at the same latitude zones jiang et al 2015 hao et al 2015 ren et al 2016 chen et al 2019 rossetto et al 2019 xiong et al 2021 table 7 the soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters are presented in table 2 which are close to other studies in hid yu et al 2013 ren et al 2016 sun et al 2019 zhuang et al 2020 table 7 in summary the simulated results matched the observed data acceptably indicating the distributed ahc model could describe the agro hydrological process and crop growth process reasonably the simulation results were further used to analyze the agro hydrological processes and water productivity at field and regional scales 3 2 water and salt balance and yields 3 2 1 water balance the gis based ahc model described the spatial variation of actual evapotranspiration et a during the main growing season from may 1st to september 30th in detail as shown in fig 8 the spatial distribution of et a varied significantly ranging from 52 to 788 mm during the growing season the results were in consistent with those reported by yu et al 2019 and ren et al 2019a for example yu et al 2019 used the remote sensing method to evaluate et a for different land covers during the growing season and they found that et a in hid ranged from 55 mm to 705 mm ren et al 2019a used a distributed model to simulate the agro hydrological processes in a canal command area of hid and they found that et a was in a range of 162 567 mm during the growing season of 2013 a dry year the et a in canal irrigated areas was generally higher than that in well irrigated areas taking the year of 2018 as an example the spatially averaged et a in canal irrigated areas was 474 mm which was higher than that in well irrigated areas with the value of 420 mm the reason for this might be that the actual soil evaporation e a in canal irrigated areas was larger than that in well irrigated areas for all land covers due to the shallow groundwater depth table 8 in addition both in canal irrigated areas and in well irrigated areas the spatially averaged et a of maize was generally higher than other land covers due to the longest growth period and the largest transpiration while that of the natural land was the lowest the cumulative net bottom water flux n w i e the net amount of water recharging positive or leaving negative the root zone through the bottom the cumulative upward bottom water flux u w i e the total amount of water recharging the root zone through the bottom and the cumulative downward bottom water flux d w i e the total amount of water leaving the root zone through the bottom of root zone 0 90 cm during the main growing season from may 1st to september 30th of 2019 are shown in fig 9 a c results showed that d w was slightly smaller in well irrigated areas than that in canal irrigated areas fig 9c taking the year of 2019 as an example d w in well irrigated areas ranged from 0 mm to 427 mm and spatially averaged 174 mm while that in canal irrigated areas was in a range of 0 590 mm and spatially averaged 248 mm table 8 this might be attributed to groundwater discharged by drainage ditches and groundwater exchange between different landscapes ren et al 2019a in addition among different lands d w in maize fields was the largest due to the largest irrigation depth in both canal irrigated areas and well irrigated areas consistent with d w u w was obviously higher in canal irrigated areas than that in well irrigated areas for all land covers due to the shallow groundwater table depth fig 9b table 8 for instance the spatially averaged u w in canal irrigated areas was 278 mm during the growing season of 2019 which was significantly higher than that in well irrigated areas with the value of 50 mm besides the cumulative upward bottom water flux of sunflower fields was the largest among different land covers both in canal irrigated areas and in well irrigated areas table 8 u w and d w were both greater in canal irrigated areas than those in well irrigated areas fig 9b and c indicating that the water exchanged between the root zone and deep soil layer more frequently in canal irrigated areas than that in well irrigated areas in general the cumulative net bottom water flow direction was mostly upward in canal irrigated areas with spatially averaged n w of 30 mm in 2019 while that was mainly downward in well irrigated areas with spatially averaged n w of 124 mm fig 9a furthermore both in canal irrigated areas and in well irrigated areas the cumulative net bottom water flow direction of natural lands and wheat fields were mostly upward table 8 3 2 2 salt balance the spatial distribution trend of cumulative net bottom salt flux n s i e the net amount of salt brought to positive or leached out of negative the root zone through the bottom upward bottom salt flux u s i e the amount of salt brought to the root zone through the bottom and downward bottom salt flux d s i e the amount of salt leached out of the root zone of root zone during the main growing season of 2019 are shown in fig 9 d f results showed that d s was slightly greater in canal irrigated areas than that in well irrigated areas fig 9f for example in 2019 the spatially averaged d s in canal irrigated areas was 735 g m 2 which was slightly larger than the value of 668 g m 2 in well irrigated areas moreover both in canal irrigated areas and in well irrigated areas d s of maize fields was the largest due to the largest irrigation depth while that of natural lands was the lowest table 8 consistent with d s u s was obviously larger in canal irrigated areas than that in well irrigated areas for all land covers fig 9e indicating that the risk of soil salinization in canal irrigated areas was greater than that in well irrigated areas taking maize as an example the spatially averaged u s in canal irrigated areas was 624 g m 2 during the growing season of 2019 which was six times as large as that in well irrigated areas 104 g m 2 furthermore both in canal irrigated areas and in well irrigated areas the largest upward bottom salt flux of root zone in sunflower fields was consistent to its largest bottom upward water flux of root zone as shown in fig 9d the cumulative net bottom salt flux of root zone was generally downward in well irrigated areas n s 0 while the cumulative net bottom salt flux of root zone in canal irrigated areas was complicated both downward and upward and the net salt leached out of the root zone n s 0 was larger in well irrigated areas than that in canal irrigated areas for example the spatially averaged salt leached out of the root zone in well irrigated areas was 545 g m 2 during the growing season of 2019 which was quite larger than that in canal irrigated areas with the value of 159 g m 2 the spatial distribution trend of salt accumulation or desalinization s in root zone 0 90 cm during the main growing season from may 1st to september 30th of 2018 and 2019 are shown in fig 10 comparing the results of the two years the area showing salt accumulation during the growing season of 2018 51 12 km2 was smaller than that of 2019 57 60 km2 indicating that the risk of salt accumulation in root zone was higher in the dry year 2019 in addition the salt accumulation in canal irrigated areas was more serious than that in well irrigated areas for example during the growing season of 2019 there was approximately 50 of the land in canal irrigated areas showing salt accumulation while that was approximately 27 in well irrigated areas besides both in canal irrigated areas and in well irrigated areas the salt accumulation in wheat fields was the largest due to the high soil evaporation while desalinization in maize fields was the most significant one due to the largest irrigation depth table 8 therefore the autumn irrigation is necessary for wheat fields to control the soil salinity 3 2 3 crops and natural vegetation yields the potential maximum yields or cumulative d agb y m the spatially averaged actual yields or cumulative d agb y a and the salt water stress index α ws of different land covers are shown in table 9 comparing the results of the two years y m of all land covers was higher in 2018 implying that climate conditions had impacts on the potential maximum yields or cumulative d agb of crops natural vegetation compared with previous studies in the nearby area y m of sunflower 4 82 4 97 t ha 1 and wheat 7 52 7 71 t ha 1 in our study was close to the result of ren et al 2021 sunflower 4 5 t ha 1 wheat 7 5 t ha 1 while y m of maize 15 08 15 28 t ha 1 in our study was close to the largest yield reported by li et al 2020 15 5 t ha 1 as for y a the spatially averaged y a of maize wheat and sunflower were slightly higher in canal irrigated areas than those in well irrigated areas while the spatially averaged y a of vegetables was higher in well irrigated areas than that in canal irrigated areas due to less water salt stress experienced the α ws which reflects the water salt stress on crop or natural vegetation growth was defined as the ratio between y a and y m assuming that there was no water and salt stress for all crops by conducting several management measures the yields might reach up to the potential maximum value and this potentiality can be quantified by 100 subtracting α ws in percentage in canal irrigated areas the yields of sunflower might be improved most with a range of 0 34 and averaged 5 while that of maize might be improved least with a range of 0 24 and averaged 3 in well irrigated areas the yields of sunflower might be increased most range of 0 18 14 on average while the yields of vegetables in well irrigated areas have the lowest improving potentiality range of 0 2 1 on average indicating that the irrigation met the water required by vegetables and salt stress was very low in this region y e reflects the growth conditions of different crops natural vegetation and the higher the y e is the better growth conditions the crop natural vegetation has ren et al 2021 y e of natural lands was obviously lower than that of croplands due to the higher water salt stress which is similar to the result of ren et al 2021 for croplands y e was obviously low in southernmost parts with high soil salinity fig 3f indicating that soil salinity affects crop growth greatly except for the southernmost parts y e of croplands in canal irrigated areas was slightly higher than other parts in well irrigated areas fig 11a 3 3 water productivity at field scale the spatially averaged wp et wp ip and wp i for different land covers in canal and well irrigated areas are shown in table 10 the spatially averaged wp et of vegetables sunflower and maize in canal irrigated areas was similar with that in well irrigated areas however the spatially averaged wp et of wheat and natural vegetation in canal irrigated areas was lower than that in well irrigated areas the reason might be that the actual soil evaporation in wheat fields and natural lands was obviously lower in well irrigated areas than that in canal irrigated areas table 8 while there was no significant difference in yields of wheat and natural vegetation between canal and well irrigated areas table 9 compared with previous studies the wp et of maize spatially averaged 2 61 2 75 kg m 3 and wheat spatially averaged 1 32 1 73 kg m 3 were close to the values reported by li et al 2020 maize 2 45 2 63 kg m 3 and zhang et al 2013 wheat 1 10 1 76 kg m 3 in nearby areas using border irrigation method respectively wp et of sunflower spatially averaged 0 94 1 13 kg m 3 was generally lower than a study with drip irrigation 1 22 1 78 kg m 3 li et al 2015 different with wp et the spatially averaged wp ip of all land covers was higher in canal irrigated areas than that in well irrigated areas for example the spatially averaged wp ip of vegetables in canal irrigated areas was 1 05 kg m 3 during the growing season of 2019 which was about twice as that in well irrigated areas consistent with wp ip the spatially averaged wp i of all crops was generally higher in canal irrigated areas than that in well irrigated areas especially for maize and wheat taking maize as an example the spatially averaged wp i in canal irrigated areas was 3 21 kg m 3 during the growing season of 2019 which is approximately 30 higher than that 2 39 kg m 3 in well irrigated areas at regional scale the spatial distribution of ewp et and ewp ip during the growing season of 2019 is shown in fig 11 b c ewp et was slightly higher in well irrigated areas with the spatially averaged value of 3 74 kg m 3 in 2019 than that in canal irrigated areas with the spatially averaged value of 3 29 kg m 3 in 2019 the spatial distribution trend of ewp ip fig 11c decreased with the irrigation depth increase fig 3c therefore in contrast to ewp et ewp ip was obviously lower in well irrigated areas spatially averaged value of 3 63 kg m 3 than that in canal irrigated areas spatially averaged value of 4 61 kg m 3 due to the larger irrigation depth implying that water applied in well irrigated areas was used less efficiently than that in canal irrigated areas 3 4 strategies for improving water productivity the water productivity could be improved both at field and regional scales van halsema and vincent 2012 in canal irrigated areas at regional scale the regional water productivity can be improved by optimally allocating irrigation water in the relevant areas for example to improve ewp ip water allocated in the middle part of the canal irrigated areas of heji should be reduced while water distributed in the southern and northern parts of the canal irrigated areas of heji should be increased moreover water for irrigation is better used directly rather than reused by capillary rise direct usage can enhance salt leaching while water reused by capillary rise may cause salt accumulation and crop loss huang et al 2018 ren et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 and then reduces the ewp et therefore canal lining is also an efficient approach to improve ewp et due to that it can reduce water conveyance loss through canal seepage which is always reused by capillary rise at field scale water productivity can be improved by adopting the optimized irrigation scheduling efficient irrigation technologies and efficient drainage systems in general with the optimized irrigation scheduling water can be applied timely and efficiently in terms of the rainfall events to meet the requirement of crop growth and leach salt out of the root zone application of the efficient irrigation technologies e g furrow irrigation dong et al 2018 deficit irrigation gao et al 2017 and drip irrigation li et al 2020 has been proved to be valuable practices to improve water productivity in hid implementation of efficient drainage for maintaining appropriate groundwater table depth is beneficial to increase the direct water utilization and reduce water reuse by capillary rise especially in salt affected area in well irrigated areas both at regional and field scales water productivity can be improved by adopting the optimized irrigation scheduling and efficient irrigation technologies with the optimized irrigation scheduling irrigation water can be appropriately applied according to rainfall events to guarantee crop growth and to avoid the deep percolation loss using the efficient irrigation technologies such as furrow irrigation drip irrigation and deficit irrigation can not only satisfy crop water requirement but also does not cause soil salinity in these areas if an appropriate leaching requirement is considered 4 conclusions in this study the agro hydrological chemical and crop systems simulator ahc was used in a distributed manner with the assistance of gis the model was applied successfully with acceptable results of goodness of fit indicators for soil water content soil salt concentration and crop growth agro hydrological processes and water productivity of the canal and well irrigated areas were investigated based on model simulation results several conclusions can be drawn from the current research 1 significant differences were found in the agro hydrological processes between canal and well irrigated areas the spatially averaged actual evapotranspiration et a in canal irrigated areas was generally higher than that in well irrigated areas the cumulative net bottom water flux of root zone was mostly upward in canal irrigated areas while that was mainly downward in well irrigated areas the cumulative net bottom salt flux of root zone in well irrigated areas was generally downward and the salt accumulation was more serious in canal irrigated areas than that in well irrigated areas 2 water productivity in canal irrigated areas was different from that in well irrigated areas the applied water including irrigation and rainfall was in higher efficient utilization with higher ewp ip in canal irrigated areas than that in well irrigated areas however the total water consumption evapotranspiration was in lower efficient utilization with lower ewp et in canal irrigated areas than that in well irrigated areas 3 in canal irrigated areas optimizing irrigation scheduling applying efficient irrigation technologies and adopting efficient drainage systems are useful methods to improve water productivity at field scale while canal lining and optimal water allocation are beneficial for the improvement of water productivity at regional scale in well irrigated areas adopting optimized irrigation scheduling and efficient irrigation technologies are crucial to improve water productivity both at regional and field scales declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9533,plastic film mulch fm can significantly improve crop yield and water use efficiency wue but the interaction between water supply pre sowing soil water season and fm has not been clearly elucidated in this study a four year field experiment was conducted on the loess plateau of china to investigate the interactive effects of pre sowing soil water season and mulch fm and bare ground ck on winter wheat yield water use and wue the yield of wheat ranged from 1646 to 7955 kg ha 1 evapotranspiration et was from 193 and 405 mm and wue varied from 8 5 to 19 9 kg ha 1 mm 1 in relation to bare ground plastic mulch increased yield by 19 and wue by 26 the interaction between water supply and fm significantly affected et but not yield and wue besides conserving more water increases in yield and wue under fm were ascribed to the increase in soil temperatures at 10 50 cm soil layers by 0 28 0 53 c on average during the wheat growing period which promoted root growth enhanced the use of soil water at deep layers increased post anthesis et and total et especially in average and dry seasons biodegradable films are needed to avoid the environmental impact of residual plastic mulch with current materials keywords evapotranspiration loess soil soil temperature wheat root 1 introduction about 40 of the world s total land area is drylands with a regional range from about 20 90 fao 2008 grain production in drylands must be improved to meet the requirements of a growing world population urbanization and the transition to meat rich diets a major contribution to this improvement will be the capture and use of a greater portion of the limited and highly variable precipitation in dryland areas where annual precipitation varies from less than half of average in a dry year to more than twice average fao 2008 several approaches of soil and water conservation such as terracing conservation tillage various mulching improving soil properties and optimal cropping system etc can increase wue thus increasing yields and reducing the likelihood of crop failure lal and stewart 2012 plastic film mulch fm has been proven to be the most effective measure to improve crop yield and wue in comparison to the other mulching measures in the loess plateau of china zhang et al 2013 2014 moreover partial film mulch obtains equal gains as full film mulch in yield and wue with reduced environmental impact lei et al 2021 however the yield change of wheat and maize under fm varies from minus 20 150 depending on rainfall and other factors zhang et al 2013 2014 to take full advantage of fm to improve crop productivity it is paramount to clearly understand the interaction between water supply and fm winter wheat is a major staple food crop in drylands its yield depends on both in season precipitation and the amount of soil water stored in the soil before the growing season nielsen et al 2002 schillinger et al 2008 zhang et al 2013 previous work has indicated that pre sowing soil water is as important as in season precipitation for wheat yield zhang et al 2013 to our knowledge no study has systematically addressed the interactions between soil management mulch vs conventional stored soil water before sowing and in season precipitation on wheat yield water use and wue thus our objectives were to address the interactions between fm pre sowing soil water sw and season on soil water depletion soil temperature in the profile root growth pre and post anthesis evapotranspiration wheat yield and water use efficiency 2 materials and method 2 1 soil and climate field experiments were conducted from sep 2017 to jun 2021 for four years at yujiagong village 34 43 n 108 10 e yongshou county shaanxi province in the loess plateau the soil was a silt loam texture developed from loess deposits soil properties 0 20 cm before experiment establishment in 2017 were soil organic matter of 16 62 g kg 1 total nitrogen of 0 093 available phosphorus olsen p of 21 2 mg kg 1 available potassium of 164 8 mg kg 1 and soil ph of 8 64 the long term average annual precipitation is 574 mm the precipitation is mainly concentrated from june to september the annual average temperature is 10 8 the annual mean frost free period is 210 days the groundwater level of the experimental site is deeper than 60 m and the crops cannot use the groundwater the precipitation during the wheat growth period was 285 mm 130 mm 193 mm and 266 mm for the 2017 18 2018 19 2019 20 and 2020 21 seasons wheat was exposed to frost from april 4th to 8th 2018 and april 12th to 16th 2018 and the lowest temperature on april 6th 2018 was 1 c frost severely affected the normal heading of wheat especially under fm in other seasons wheat flowered about 2 3 days earlier under fm than under ck 2 2 experiment design and management the study included two factors pre sowing soil water sw level and mulch there were three sw levels i e wet average and dry fallow seasons mulch had two levels control bare ground ck and fm fm 30 cm wide ridge covered with plastic film and 30 cm wide bare furrow totally there were 6 treatments and each one with four replicates plot size was 31 35 m2 5 7 5 5 m including 28 rows spaced at 20 cm for ck plots and 20 rows spaced at 30 cm for fm plots the sw levels were set according to dang et al 1991 who classified available soil water in 0 200 cm profile into three categories i e 200 mm 200 250 mm and 250 mm representing dry fallow average fallow and wet fallow respectively the dry fallow was created by planting crops bean in the first fallow and maize in other fallows in the fallow period mid june to the beginning of september the medium fallow was the conventional bare fallow and the wet fallow was generated by supplemental irrigation of bare fallow before wheat sowing in the 2020 21 season the precipitation in the fallow period was 435 mm the designed dry fallow became the average fallow and the average fallow met the wet fallow thus the 2020 21 season only contained two sw levels average fallow and wet fallow wheat crops cv tongmai 6 were sown by hand on 1st of october 2017 30th of september 2018 29th of september 2019 and 26th of september 2020 and harvested on 13th of june 2018 7th of july 2019 13th of july 2020 and 22th of june 2021 the recommended seeding rate 270 seeds m 2 was adopted for both ck and fm treatments the fertilizer application rate was based on the local recommendations with 135 kg n ha 1 and 39 kg p ha 1 the nitrogen fertilizer was urea and the phosphorous fertilizer was superphosphate 16 p2o5 fertilizers were incorporated into the soil by a rotary tiller the fm was set up with the machine then manually sowed two rows of wheat in the furrow irrigation was not carried out during the growth period of winter wheat control of diseases pests and weeds followed local recommended practices 2 3 sampling and measurements soil temperature was recorded daily with a temperature sensor ds1921g wadison china during the wheat growing period the sensor was installed at 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm and 50 cm soil depths between wheat rows for fm and ck treatments at the average fallow condition with three replicated plots the temperature readings were automatically collected every 2 h on which the daily soil temperature calculation was based root samples were collected at an anthesis at 20 cm intervals down to 200 cm with an auger 8 cm in diameter root samples were soaked overnight in a pail of water containing a small amount of sodium hexametaphosphate then washed scanned epson perfection v700 photo and analyzed with the software winrhizo version v2013e patel et al 2020 the root length density was calculated as explained elsewhere qin et al 2006 mosaddeghi et al 2009 li et al 2010 soil moisture content was measured gravimetrically before wheat sowing at flowering and after harvest at 20 cm intervals down to 300 cm at harvest grain yield and its components were measured the estimation of grain yield was based on an area of 4 6 m2 the number of ears was counted based on an area of 1 m2 the number of kernels per ear was counted from randomly selected 10 20 ears in each plot additionally thousand kernel weight was measured 2 4 data processing and statistical analysis root length density rld was calculated as 1 rld rl v where rld cm cm 3 is root length density per unit volume rl cm is root length v is the soil volume cm3 soil water storage was calculated by the following formula 2 w ρ h w 10 where w is soil water storage mm ρ is soil bulk density g cm 3 h is the soil depth cm and ω is gravimetric water content soil bulk density was measured before the experiment setting up by the core method wheat evapotranspiration et was estimated by the water balance

fm and environment had a significant impact on the soil temperature during the wheat growth at tested five depths fig 1 the interaction soil temperature was 17 9 at 10 cm depth 26 9 at 20 cm depth 30 3 at 30 cm depth 27 8 at 40 cm depth and 18 5 at 50 cm depth respectively fm increased the soil temperature by about 0 6 at 10 cm depth 0 8 at 20 cm depth 0 6 at 30 cm depth 0 6 at 40 cm depth and 0 8 at 50 cm depth respectively relative to ck when the soil temperature was less than the interaction temperatures while the soil temperature was greater than the interaction temperature fm lowered the soil temperature accordingly during most of the wheat growth period the soil temperature under fm was higher than that under ck 3 2 root length density plotting the rld with fm against ck showed the slope deviated from y x the intercept 0 which indicated the interaction between fm and environment had a significant impact on the rld in 0 40 cm soil layer fig 2a compared with ck the rld under fm increased by about 0 9 cm cm 3 at maximum when the rld under ck was 2 59 cm cm 3 while the rld under ck was 2 59 cm cm 3 the rld under fm was smaller fig 2a fm also increased the rld in 40 200 cm soil layer relative to the ck although this was not statistically significant fig 2b 3 3 soil water use in the four year experiment the visible depth of soil water used by wheat was from 100 cm to 240 cm fig 3 the depth of soil water use in fm and ck plots were similar except for the second season 2018 19 in which the depth of soil water use in fm plots 200 cm was 0 6 m deeper than that in ck plots 140 cm the amount of soil water use w soil water difference between sowing and harvest was 51 191 mm under ck and 76 190 mm under fm fig 3 anova indicated that season and sw level significantly affected w but the effect of fm was not significant in addition there were two sources of variation that affected w season sw level interaction and season fm interaction the interaction was because w was markedly higher under fm than that under ck in the dry season 2018 19 while it was the opposite in the wet season 2020 21 and the other two seasons were similar 3 4 evapotranspiration total et ranged from 193 to 405 mm pre anthesis et ranged from 83 to 296 mm and post anthesis et ranged from 82 to 131 mm during four experimental seasons table 1 anova indicated that season and sw level significantly affected pre anthesis et post anthesis et and total et but the effect of fm was not significant table 1 in addition season sw level interaction also significantly affected pre anthesis

and its interaction with the environment plotting et in four or three seasons removed frost damage season of 2017 18 with fm against ck fig 4 showed that the pre anthesis et between fm and ck was similar across four seasons fig 4a but fm significantly increased post anthesis et in three seasons 2018 21 by about 29 mm when et 163 mm fig 4b the slope deviated from y x and the intercept 0 which indicated the interaction between fm and environment also had a significant impact on the total et fig 4c compared with ck fm increased the total et by about 49 mm when the total et 340 mm while the total et 340 mm fm lowered the et fig 4c 3 5 wheat yield yield components and water use efficiency 3 5 1 wheat yield and yield components wheat yield ranged from 1646 to 7955 kg ha 1 during four experimental seasons table 2 anova indicated significant seasonal effects on grain yield as follows 2020 21 2019 20 2017 18 2018 19 sw level also significantly affected wheat yield as follows wet average dry the effect of fm on wheat yield reached the level of p 0 1 p 0 083 with an average yield increase of 12 across four years additionally season sw level interaction season fm interaction sw level fm interaction also significantly affected wheat yield table 2 plotting yield of wheat in four or three seasons with fm against ck fig 5a showed fm significantly increased wheat yield by 1237 kg ha 1 or 19 fm did not significantly affect yield components table 2 season and sw level significantly affected yield components grain yield was more closely related to spike number r2 0 68 p 0 001 and grain number per spike r2 0 62 p 0 001 than thousand grain weight r2 0 33 p 0 001 3 5 2 water use efficiency wue ranged from 8 5 to 19 9 kg ha 1 mm 1 during four experimental seasons table 1 six sources of variation affected water use efficiency season sw level fm season sw level interaction season fm interaction and sw level fm interaction plotting wue with fm against ck showed that fm significantly increased wheat wue especially in the last three seasons by 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 at maximum fig 5b 4 discussion 4 1 effect of plastic film mulch on soil temperature our study has shown that fm increased the soil temperature during the wheat growing period by a maximum of 0 56 0 78 at 10 50 cm depths compared with ck when soil temperature was relatively low and decreased soil temperature when soil temperature was relatively high fig 1 previous studies on fm have mainly focused on temperature differences at the 0 30 cm soil layer ramakrishna et al 2006 hu et al 2014 li et al 2021 and increases in soil temperature ranged from 0 8 to 2 9 c mo et al 2016 he et al 2016 the variation of temperature increase between studies was related to climate and soil type or soil properties the individual study has observed the difference in soil temperature between fm and ck on bare soil can be as deep as 1 5 m wu et al 2018 which reflects a change in soil thermal condition by fm may be beyond our general expectation the increase in soil temperature under fm is mainly related to the small plant canopy at the crop early growth stage increased light transmittance and decreased heat exchange between soil and atmosphere gao et al 2009 wang et al 2013 liu et al 2016 the decrease in soil temperature under fm may be related to the shading effect of the wheat canopy in the late stage of wheat growth in addition the plastic film would be aged and damaged in the later stage of wheat growth which would weaken the effect of soil temperature olasantan 1999 fabrizzi et al 2005 zhang et al 2009 considering the improvement of soil water content li et al 2013a 2013b ren et al 2021 fm speeds up the early emergence and regreening of wheat in comparison with the control dong et al 2014 li et al 2016 2019 and promotes crop root growth fig 2 thus affects crop water use and yield 4 2 effect of plastic film mulch on water use it was found that the depth of soil water used by wheat generally exceeded 200 cm fig 3 however most previous studies estimated soil water use based on 200 cm or 200 cm depth liu et al 2009 li et al 2016 therefore taking 200 cm as the depth of soil water use will underestimate w in most cases which may underestimate et and overestimate water use efficiency our study has shown that the depth of soil water use by wheat under fm in the dry season 2018 19 was 60 cm deeper than that under ck fig 3 our results are in agreement with yang et al 2015 chai et al 2015 and li et al 2016 who have found wheat under fm used soil water deeper than that under ck in the 0 200 cm soil profile in the dry season this may be related to the fact that fm improved the distribution of roots in the soil layer lu and xiong 1991 niu et al 2004 kwabiah 2004 xu et al 2016 and increased the root length density by 22 0 in the 40 200 cm soil layer in the dry season fig 2 in addition the increase of deep soil water use by fm may be also related to the movement of water from deeper soil layer to topsoil through capillary action and or water vapor transmission by the temperature gradient wang et al 1998 during the experimental period wheat under fm used a similar amount of soil water w to that under ck however in the dry season 2018 19 the soil water use under fm was 26 mm higher than that under ck in the same region xie et al 2005 and xue et al 2011 have also reported wheat used more soil water under fm than under ck in the dry season this may be related to the fact that fm effectively conserved soil water reduced evaporation loss and provided more available water for crops in less precipitation environments li et al 2001a dong et al 2014 in addition fm promoted root growth fig 2 increased the proportion of roots in the deep soil layer niu et al 2004 kwabiah 2004 xu et al 2016 and promoted the absorption and utilization of deep soil water by crops clark et al 2003 li et al 2004 xie et al 2005 the interaction of fm and environment significantly affected the post flowering et 2018 21 and total et fig 4b c but did not significantly affect pre flowering et fig 4a hu et al 2019c found that fm had no effect on pre flowering et of wheat or maize but it had a significant effect on post flowering et others also found that fm increased total et during the growth stage of spring wheat in the dry season xie et al 2005 li et al 2004 chen et al 2015 fm improved the distribution of roots in the deep soil layers ma 1999 niu et al 2004 kwabiah et al 2004 which is conducive to use soil water in deep layers fm also increased the temperature in the soil profile which promote the deep soil water to move upward continuously yi 1988 to improve soil water use from deeper soil layers all these factors contributed to higher post anthesis et under fm in addition huang et al 2003 found that fm would reduce et for both wheat and maize compared to ck when in season precipitation was sufficient it is possibly due to the reduced evaporation li et al 2001a and increased collection of small precipitation events 5 mm wang et al 2009a zhang et al 2013 jiang et al 2015 4 3 yield and water use efficiency wheat yields in the first and second seasons were significantly lower than those in the third and fourth seasons and the yield of the fourth season was significantly higher than that of other seasons table 2 wheat crops were exposed to frost at the jointing stage in the first season which significantly influenced the number of ears and reduced the number of ears in the mature stage table 2 in the second season the low wheat yield was caused by severe drought table 2 while in the fourth season the sw level was sufficient and in season precipitation was plenty which achieved a similar yield as the irrigated wheat the sw levels considerably affected wheat yield and the high sw achieved greater yield this agrees with previous results and reflects the importance of sw to wheat yield musick et al 1994 zhang et al 2013 the mulch during a fallow period can significantly increase the sw level zhang et al 2013 and it is worth recommending such practice in semi arid regions in the ordinary three years 2018 21 fm significantly increased wheat yield by 19 compared to ck moreover there was no interaction between fm and the tested environment fig 5a indicating that fm can increase yield under dry or wet conditions the previous meta analysis has shown that the increase of yield by fm ranged from 12 5 to 30 4 ma et al 2018 lei et al 2021 wang et al 2021 the yield increase was mainly related to improved yield components table 1 especially the increase in spikes and grains per spike li et al 1999 wang et al 2016 2018 li et al 2019 these benefits are ascribed to reduced soil evaporation increased water content increased soil temperature fig 1 promoted root growth and development fig 2 and promoted deep soil water use fig 3 increased water of crop transpiration li et al 1999 2004 gan et al 2013 especially increased post flowering et fig 4b prolonged crop reproductive growth optimized dry matter distribution and increased harvest index li et al 2005 bu et al 2013 hu et al 2019c however in a two season study wang et al 2009b found fm significantly increased wheat yield with in season precipitation of 183 mm while reducing the yield by about 8 with in season precipitation of 149 mm they explained that the improvement of soil water and temperature conditions by fm enhanced wheat using a large amount of soil moisture before anthesis and insufficient precipitation in the reproductive stage led to severe water stress and the assimilation accumulated before anthesis could not be effectively translocated resulting in a decline in yield li et al 2001b 2004 zhang et al 2013 in our case the second season had 130 mm in season precipitation but the precipitation distribution was better at 30 for the jointing flowering and 47 for the flowering harvest period which was relatively effective for water supply in the later stage of wheat growth therefore the interaction between fm and the environment might vary with the local environment wue under fm was significantly higher by 17 7 compared with ck the previous meta analysis has shown that fm increased wue by 16 2 21 9 in the loess plateau ma et al 2018 lei et al 2021 the improvement of wue was related to a more significant increase in yield fig 5a shan and chen 1993 li et al 2004 relative to the increase in et table 1 fig 4b c 5 conclusion a four season winter wheat experiment in the loess plateau found that plastic film mulch significantly increased wheat yield and water use efficiency and had no significant interaction with the environment this is mainly related to the effect of plastic film mulch on soil temperature the promotion of root growth and significantly increased post anthesis evapotranspiration the results of this study provide an important reference for wheat production in similar environments considering the influence of plastic film mulch residue on the soil environment environmentally friendly biodegradable films are worthy of exploring and promoting application to enhance crop productivity credit authorship contribution

9533,plastic film mulch fm can significantly improve crop yield and water use efficiency wue but the interaction between water supply pre sowing soil water season and fm has not been clearly elucidated in this study a four year field experiment was conducted on the loess plateau of china to investigate the interactive effects of pre sowing soil water season and mulch fm and bare ground ck on winter wheat yield water use and wue the yield of wheat ranged from 1646 to 7955 kg ha 1 evapotranspiration et was from 193 and 405 mm and wue varied from 8 5 to 19 9 kg ha 1 mm 1 in relation to bare ground plastic mulch increased yield by 19 and wue by 26 the interaction between water supply and fm significantly affected et but not yield and wue besides conserving more water increases in yield and wue under fm were ascribed to the increase in soil temperatures at 10 50 cm soil layers by 0 28 0 53 c on average during the wheat growing period which promoted root growth enhanced the use of soil water at deep layers increased post anthesis et and total et especially in average and dry seasons biodegradable films are needed to avoid the environmental impact of residual plastic mulch with current materials keywords evapotranspiration loess soil soil temperature wheat root 1 introduction about 40 of the world s total land area is drylands with a regional range from about 20 90 fao 2008 grain production in drylands must be improved to meet the requirements of a growing world population urbanization and the transition to meat rich diets a major contribution to this improvement will be the capture and use of a greater portion of the limited and highly variable precipitation in dryland areas where annual precipitation varies from less than half of average in a dry year to more than twice average fao 2008 several approaches of soil and water conservation such as terracing conservation tillage various mulching improving soil properties and optimal cropping system etc can increase wue thus increasing yields and reducing the likelihood of crop failure lal and stewart 2012 plastic film mulch fm has been proven to be the most effective measure to improve crop yield and wue in comparison to the other mulching measures in the loess plateau of china zhang et al 2013 2014 moreover partial film mulch obtains equal gains as full film mulch in yield and wue with reduced environmental impact lei et al 2021 however the yield change of wheat and maize under fm varies from minus 20 150 depending on rainfall and other factors zhang et al 2013 2014 to take full advantage of fm to improve crop productivity it is paramount to clearly understand the interaction between water supply and fm winter wheat is a major staple food crop in drylands its yield depends on both in season precipitation and the amount of soil water stored in the soil before the growing season nielsen et al 2002 schillinger et al 2008 zhang et al 2013 previous work has indicated that pre sowing soil water is as important as in season precipitation for wheat yield zhang et al 2013 to our knowledge no study has systematically addressed the interactions between soil management mulch vs conventional stored soil water before sowing and in season precipitation on wheat yield water use and wue thus our objectives were to address the interactions between fm pre sowing soil water sw and season on soil water depletion soil temperature in the profile root growth pre and post anthesis evapotranspiration wheat yield and water use efficiency 2 materials and method 2 1 soil and climate field experiments were conducted from sep 2017 to jun 2021 for four years at yujiagong village 34 43 n 108 10 e yongshou county shaanxi province in the loess plateau the soil was a silt loam texture developed from loess deposits soil properties 0 20 cm before experiment establishment in 2017 were soil organic matter of 16 62 g kg 1 total nitrogen of 0 093 available phosphorus olsen p of 21 2 mg

temperature is 10 8 the annual mean frost free period is 210 days the groundwater level of the experimental site is deeper than 60 m and the crops cannot use the groundwater the precipitation during the wheat growth period was 285 mm 130 mm 193 mm and 266 mm for the 2017 18 2018 19 2019 20 and 2020 21 seasons wheat was exposed to frost from april 4th to 8th 2018 and april 12th to 16th 2018 and the lowest temperature on april 6th 2018 was 1 c frost severely affected the normal heading of wheat especially under fm in other seasons wheat flowered about 2 3 days earlier under fm than under ck 2 2 experiment design and management the study included two factors pre sowing soil water sw level and mulch there were three sw levels i e wet average and dry fallow seasons mulch had two levels control bare ground ck and fm fm 30 cm wide ridge covered with plastic film and 30 cm wide bare furrow totally there were 6 treatments and each one with four replicates plot size was 31 35 m2 5 7 5 5 m including 28 rows spaced at 20 cm for ck plots and 20 rows spaced at 30 cm for fm plots the sw levels were set according to dang et al 1991 who classified available soil water in 0 200 cm profile into three categories i e 200 mm 200 250 mm and 250 mm representing dry fallow average fallow and wet fallow respectively the dry fallow was created by planting crops bean in the first fallow and maize in other fallows in the fallow period mid june to the beginning of september the medium fallow was the conventional bare fallow and the wet fallow was generated by supplemental irrigation of bare fallow before wheat sowing in the 2020 21 season the precipitation in the fallow period was 435 mm the designed dry fallow became the average fallow and the average fallow met the wet fallow thus the 2020 21 season only contained two sw levels average fallow and wet fallow wheat crops cv tongmai 6 were sown by hand on 1st of october 2017 30th of september 2018 29th of september 2019 and 26th

fertilizer application rate was based on the local recommendations with 135 kg n ha 1 and 39 kg p ha 1 the nitrogen fertilizer was urea and the phosphorous fertilizer was superphosphate 16 p2o5 fertilizers were incorporated into the soil by a rotary tiller the fm was set up with the machine then manually sowed two rows of wheat in the furrow irrigation was not carried out during the growth period of winter wheat control of diseases pests and weeds followed local recommended practices 2 3 sampling and measurements soil temperature was recorded daily with a temperature sensor ds1921g wadison china during the wheat growing period the sensor was installed at 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm and 50 cm soil depths between wheat rows for fm and ck treatments at the average fallow condition with three replicated plots the temperature readings were automatically collected every 2 h on which the daily soil temperature calculation was based root samples were collected at an anthesis at 20 cm intervals down to 200 cm with an auger 8 cm in diameter root samples were soaked overnight in a pail of water containing a small amount of sodium hexametaphosphate then washed scanned epson perfection

moisture content was measured gravimetrically before wheat sowing at flowering and after harvest at 20 cm intervals down to 300 cm at harvest grain yield and its components were measured the estimation of grain yield was based on an area of 4 6 m2 the number of ears was counted based on an area of 1 m2 the number of kernels per ear was counted from randomly selected 10 20 ears in each plot additionally thousand kernel weight was measured 2 4 data processing and statistical analysis root length density rld was calculated as 1 rld rl v where rld cm cm 3 is root length density per

of wheat growth in addition the plastic film would be aged and damaged in the later stage of wheat growth which would weaken the effect of soil temperature olasantan 1999 fabrizzi et al 2005 zhang et al 2009 considering the improvement of soil water content li et al 2013a 2013b ren et al 2021 fm speeds up the early emergence and regreening of wheat in comparison with the control dong et al 2014 li et al 2016 2019 and promotes crop root growth fig 2 thus affects crop water use and yield 4 2 effect of plastic film mulch on water use it was found that the depth of soil water used by wheat generally exceeded 200 cm fig 3 however most previous studies estimated soil water use based on 200 cm or 200 cm depth liu et al 2009 li et al 2016 therefore taking 200 cm as the depth of soil water use will underestimate w in most cases which may underestimate et and overestimate water use efficiency our study has shown that the depth of soil water use by wheat under fm in the dry season 2018 19 was 60 cm deeper than that under ck fig 3 our results are in agreement with yang et al 2015 chai et al 2015 and li et al 2016 who have found wheat under fm used soil water deeper than that under ck in the 0 200 cm soil profile in the dry season this may be related to the fact that fm improved the distribution of roots in the soil layer lu and xiong 1991 niu et al 2004 kwabiah 2004 xu et al 2016 and increased the root length density by 22 0 in the 40 200 cm soil layer in the dry season fig 2 in addition the increase of deep soil water use by fm may be also related to the movement of water from deeper soil layer to topsoil through capillary action and or water vapor transmission by the temperature gradient wang et al 1998 during the experimental period wheat under fm used a similar amount of soil water w to that under ck however in the dry season 2018 19 the soil water use under fm was 26 mm higher than that under ck in the same region xie et al 2005 and xue et al 2011 have also reported wheat used more soil water under fm than under ck in the dry season this may be related to the fact that fm effectively conserved soil water reduced evaporation loss and provided more available water for crops in less precipitation environments li et al 2001a dong et al 2014 in addition fm promoted root growth fig 2 increased the proportion of roots in the deep soil layer niu et al 2004 kwabiah 2004 xu et al 2016 and promoted the absorption and utilization of deep soil water by crops clark et al 2003 li et al 2004 xie et al 2005 the interaction of fm and environment significantly affected the post flowering et 2018 21 and total et fig 4b c but did not significantly affect pre flowering et fig 4a hu et al 2019c found that fm had no effect on pre flowering et of wheat or maize but it had a significant effect on post flowering et others also found that fm increased total et during the growth stage of spring wheat in the dry season xie et al 2005 li et al 2004 chen et al 2015 fm improved the distribution of roots in the deep soil layers ma 1999 niu et al 2004 kwabiah et al 2004 which is conducive to use soil water in deep layers fm also increased the temperature in the soil profile which promote the deep soil water to move upward continuously yi 1988 to improve soil water use from deeper soil layers all these factors contributed to higher post anthesis et under fm in addition huang et al 2003 found that fm would reduce et for both wheat and maize compared to ck when in season precipitation was sufficient it is possibly due to the reduced evaporation li et al 2001a and increased collection of small precipitation events 5 mm wang et al 2009a zhang et al 2013 jiang et al 2015 4 3 yield and water use efficiency wheat yields in the first and second seasons were significantly lower than those in the third and fourth seasons and the yield of the fourth season was significantly higher than that of other seasons table 2 wheat crops were exposed to frost at the jointing stage in the first season which significantly influenced the number of ears and reduced the number of ears in the mature stage table 2 in the second season the low wheat yield was caused by severe drought table 2 while in the fourth season the sw level was sufficient and in season precipitation was plenty which achieved a similar yield as the irrigated wheat the sw levels considerably affected wheat yield and the high sw achieved greater yield this agrees with previous results and reflects the importance of sw to wheat yield musick et al 1994 zhang et al 2013 the mulch during a fallow period can significantly increase the sw level zhang et al 2013 and it is worth recommending such practice in semi arid regions in the ordinary three years 2018 21 fm significantly increased wheat yield by 19 compared to ck moreover there was no interaction between fm and the tested environment fig 5a indicating that fm can increase yield under dry or wet conditions the previous meta analysis has shown that the increase of yield by fm ranged from 12 5 to 30 4 ma et al 2018 lei et al 2021 wang et al 2021 the yield increase was mainly related to improved yield components table 1 especially the increase in spikes and grains per spike li et al 1999 wang et al 2016 2018 li et al 2019 these benefits are ascribed to reduced soil evaporation increased water content increased soil temperature fig 1 promoted root growth and development fig 2 and promoted deep soil water use fig 3 increased water of crop transpiration li et al 1999 2004 gan et al 2013 especially increased post flowering et fig 4b prolonged crop reproductive growth optimized dry matter distribution and increased harvest index li et al 2005 bu et al 2013 hu et al 2019c however in a two season study wang et al 2009b found fm significantly increased wheat yield with in season precipitation of 183 mm while reducing the yield by about 8 with in season precipitation of 149 mm they explained that the improvement of soil water and temperature conditions by fm enhanced wheat using a large amount of soil moisture before anthesis and insufficient precipitation in the reproductive stage led to severe water stress and the assimilation accumulated before anthesis could not be effectively translocated resulting in a decline in yield li et al 2001b 2004 zhang et al 2013 in our case the second season had 130 mm in season precipitation but the precipitation distribution was better at 30 for the jointing flowering and 47 for the flowering harvest period which was relatively effective for water supply in the later stage of wheat growth therefore the interaction between fm and the environment might vary with the local environment wue under fm was significantly higher by 17 7 compared with ck the previous meta analysis has shown that fm increased wue by 16 2 21 9 in the loess plateau ma et al 2018 lei et al 2021 the improvement of wue was related to a more significant increase in yield fig 5a shan and chen 1993 li et al 2004 relative to the increase in et table 1 fig 4b c 5 conclusion a four season winter wheat experiment in the loess plateau found that plastic film mulch significantly increased wheat yield and water use efficiency and had no significant interaction with the environment this is mainly related to the effect of plastic film mulch on soil temperature the promotion of root growth and significantly increased post anthesis evapotranspiration the results of this study provide an important reference for wheat production in similar environments considering the influence of plastic film mulch residue on the soil environment environmentally friendly biodegradable films are worthy of exploring and promoting application to enhance crop productivity credit authorship contribution

9534,regional to global studies of hydrology water availability and water use and their interaction with agricultural production and food security require accurate information on the location and extent of irrigated croplands in this study we derive the european irrigation map for the year 2010 eim2010 underpinned by the agricultural census conducted in the european union in 2010 the map contains 14 irrigated crop classes as well as total irrigable and irrigated areas centred on the year 2010 the thematic resolution of the map is tailored specifically to european agriculture and contains most relevant staple crops e g maize rice potato other cereals as well as major permanent crops e g irrigated olive orchards and vineyards the map was created using a consistent methodology and data gathered across the european union member states and the uk and therefore provides comparable and representative information across the continental domain the input data used to construct the map consisted of farm level records on irrigated areas and total crop areas collected during the 2010 agricultural census and aggregated to 10 km x 10 km grid as well as regional level statistics at nuts2 level on irrigated areas by crop type a custom developed disaggregation algorithm was used to distribute the regional level statistics into the 10 km x 10 km grid evaluation of the map against independent reference geospatial data indicated satisfactory agreement for both large scale spatial patterns as well as specific grid cell values for the main crop production regions the eim2010 is publicly available and provides valuable inputs for large scale modelling applications involving irrigated agriculture keywords irrigated area hydrological modelling crop modelling agricultural census statistical data 1 introduction irrigation is an important component of agriculture in the european union eu the prevalence of irrigation varies across europe depending on climate traditional cropping patterns the availability of water resources as well as socio economic factors such as irrigation subsidies or water pricing wriedt et al 2009 toan 2016 in the mediterranean climate of southern europe irrigation has traditionally been an essential element of agricultural production malek and verburg 2018 2017 in central and northern european countries where rainfall has usually been sufficient to sustain profitable yields irrigation has been applied only as a supplementary source of water to enhance agricultural production during crop development stages sensitive to water stress wriedt et al 2009 berbel et al 2015 however already observed changes in climate such as higher temperatures changing precipitation patterns e g toreti et al 2019 ceglar et al 2019 ruiz ramos et al 2018 longer rain deficient periods increased frequency of droughts and heat waves are already widening yield gaps between rain fed and irrigated agriculture therefore irrigation investments and practices gain popularity also in areas traditionally not irrigated in central and northern europe where availability of water resources is not yet a limiting factor for irrigation and agricultural production siebert et al 2005 greaves and wang 2016 irrigation has a high potential to impact on regional hydrology and water management fao 2011 iglesias and garotte 2015 gelati et al 2020 gobin et al 2017

example public water supply energy production haddeland et al 2014 rosegrant et al 2009 adamovic et al 2019 becomes more and more important distributed crop growth and hydrological models or coupled models are applied at large scales regional continental and global in order to support policy and decision making regarding complex agricultural water systems siad et al 2019 unece 2015 implementation of such large scale distributed models is associated with many challenges including high computational and storage requirements and data collection for model parameterisation as computational and storage data capabilities are constantly increasing it is data availability at appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions that often dictates the choice of modelling tools to be used to address research or management questions spatial distribution and extension of irrigated areas may be essential input factor for large scale physical models with hydrological components puy et al 2021 lack of up to date spatially distributed and homogenous quality data on distribution of irrigated crops in europe has been recognised as a limiting factor for european scale hydrological and crop modelling several data sets provide information on distribution of total irrigated areas or irrigated crop types with relatively fine spatial detail 10 km x 10 km grid making them suitable as inputs for large scale distributed model simulations table 1 currently most of the data sets that provide spatially distributed information on irrigated crops for europe are representative for a period around the year 2000 2005 table 1 with the exception of last updated version of the spam global dataset you et al 2014 wood sichra et al 2016 spam2010 you et al 2020 representative for the year 2010 the european irrigation map eim wriedt et al 2009 is the first and currently most recent data set developed specifically for europe and comprises 10 crop classes the eim was created by disaggregating regional level statistics on irrigated cropland areas into a 100 100 m grid using a land cover map developed by grizzetti et al 2007 and constrained by the global map of irrigated areas gmias siebert et al 2013 despite its high spatial resolution the authors recommended not using the eim at scales finer than 10 km x 10 km due to the uncertainties associated with the stochastic methodology used to create the map wriedt et al 2009 the corine land cover clc map provides spatially detailed 100 m resolution information of distribution of crops and irrigated areas on arable land for years 2012 and 2018 clc 2012 2018 however in respect to irrigated areas clc distinguishes non irrigated arable land and irrigated arable land with no further specification of crop types additionally the irrigated arable land includes only areas with irrigation infrastructure visible from satellite imagery clc 2012 2018 and many wide spread types of irrigation e g drip irrigation mobile sprinkler irrigation irrigation from groundwater sources irrigated permanent crops etc are excluded some of the global extent datasets outline irrigated and irrigable agricultural areas in europe for example the global map of irrigated areas gmias siebert et al 2013 and the global irrigated area map giam thenkabail et al 2009 contain data on areas equipped for irrigation as well as actually irrigated areas gmias 5 arc minute giam 10 km for years 2005 and 2000 respectively while the global map of irrigated rain fed and paddy croplands gripc salmon et al 2015 provides the distribution of rainfed and irrigated croplands complemented with layers of paddy areas at a 500 m x 500 m grid for the year 2005 while these maps are helpful to understand where irrigation takes place they do not provide information on specific classes of irrigated crops the global agro ecological zones iiasa fao 2012 and the monthly irrigated and rain fed crop areas in 2000 mirca2000 portmann et al 2010 distinguish many irrigated crop types listed in table 1 at a spatial resolution of 5 arc minute for a period around the year 2000 the spam dataset produced with the spatial production allocation model spam you et al 2014 yu et al 2020 wood sichra et al 2016 distinguishes the most important irrigated staple crops e g maize rice potato wheat barley and its latest version is dated around 2010 however the information on irrigated areas is derived from the latest version of global map of irrigation areas gmia v5 0 siebert et al 2013 representative for year 2005 due to their general global scope none of these global datasets includes all irrigated crop classes that are essential for european agriculture e g irrigated olives or vineyards here we present the european irrigation map for the year 2010 eim2010 as an update of most recent european irrigation map of wriedt et al 2009 representative for the year 2000 the eim2010 is intended as input for large scale modelling applications and has an acceptable spatial resolution the objective of this manuscript is to present the underlying data detail the methodology used to produce the crop irrigated areas and assess their quality against independent geospatial data furthermore we discuss possible ways to progress with spatial delineation of irrigated crops beyond approaches based solely on statistical census data as possible ways for increasing the spatial and temporal granularity 2 materials and methods the eim2010 was created by disaggregating regional statistics on irrigated areas by crop type into the 10 km x 10 km grid eea 2013 fig 1 presents a simplified outline of the disaggregation schema the input data include medium resolution gridded data on irrigated areas with no differentiation of specific crop classes and gridded data on total crop areas with no differentiation of rain fed versus irrigated portions of crops provided by eurostat the data on irrigated areas were pre processed gap filled prior their use 2 1 data sources 2 1 1 gridded statistical data inputs the farm level data on irrigated areas and total crop areas were collected by eurostat the statistical office of the european union during the 2010 farm structure survey fss conducted as agricultural census the fss data covers a wide range of agricultural management parameters including total crop area for 46 crop classes as well as total irrigable area tia defined as area equipped with irrigation infrastructure and irrigated area ia defined as actually irrigated area at least once a year both tia and ia represent summarized values of all irrigated crops within grid cells and thus are not crop specific on the other hand gridded total crop areas do not carry information on rain fed and irrigated portions of crops recently eurostat provided the 2010 farm level census data on total crop areas and tia and ia aggregated at 10 km x 10 km grid level bujnowska et al 2019 as well as lower resolution 20 and 60 km grids due to legal and confidentiality restrictions data gaps are imposed in cases when the value of crop area within a grid cell is explained by 4 or less holdings or when 85 of the value is explained by 1 or 2 holdings the data gaps in total crop areas were filled by bujnowska et al 2019 similar dissemination restraints are applied for the gridded tias and ias collected at the farm level aggregated to the 10 km x 10 km grid and disseminated by eurostat we estimated the missing tia and ia values of the 10 km x 10 km grid with a gap filling algorithm developed specifically to allocate the available lower resolution 20 km x 20 km 60 km x 60 km grids and regional level records in place of the missing values 2 1 2 regional statistical data inputs the regional level data on crop specific irrigated areas are available from the fss of 2010 eurostat 2010a the data on ia tia and irrigated areas by crop type as well as some additional information regarding the number of agricultural entities using different irrigation methods or water sources are available at the nuts2 administrative level except for germany where the spatial resolution is nuts1 eurostat 2010a the main irrigated crop classes considered in the fss comprising both arable land and permanent crops are as follows cereals excl maize and rice maize grain and green rice pulses potatoes sugar beet rape and turnip rape sunflower field vegetables 2 2 the original names from the eurostat database eurostat 2010a were modified for simplicity fresh vegetables melons and strawberries open field was changed to field vegetables and under glass vegetables flowers and permanent crops was changed to greenhouses fruit and berry plantations was changed to fruit and berry orchards citrus plantations was changed to citrus orchards olives plantations was changed to olives orchards temporary and permanent grass fruit and berry orchards citrus orchards olives orchards vineyards greenhouses textile crops and other crops on arable land in this study we focus on the 14 crop classes all irrigated crop classes considered in fss except for textile crops and other crops on arable land 2 2 distribution algorithm the scheme for disaggregating regional level irrigated areas to the grid level is illustrated in fig 2 irrigated crop area may be allocated only to grid cells that contain non zero values of available irrigated area and non zero values of total crop area furthermore available irrigated area within grid cell needs to be shared between all irrigated crops that are co located within the same grid cell for cases when available irrigated area does not suffice for all irrigated crops within one cell available irrigated area is allocated to crops with higher irrigation priority for example crops that require obligatory irrigation or provide higher economic income we apply a simplified approach to determine region specific irrigation practices we assume that the crops with a higher ratio of irrigated to total crop area within a given region have higher irrigation priorities than crops with lower ratio values for regions and crops where statistical data is sufficient we determined the fractions of irrigated to total crop areas by comparison of regional irrigated crop areas ef poirrig dataset eurostat 2010a and regional total crop areas apro cpshr dataset eurostat 2010b for regions and crops where priorities cannot be established based on the ratio of irrigated to total crop areas due to lack of respective records we apply a default ranking based on experts opinion as follows rice field vegetables fruit and berry orchards potatoes citrus orchards maize pulses sugar beet rape and turnip rape sunflower grass olive orchards vineyards and the remaining cereals while specifying pan european crop irrigation priorities has been tackled previously wriedt et al 2008 there are some drawbacks of using a generic list over such a large spatial domain due to diversity of climatological and agro management environments the generic priority ranking may diverge from region specific or local requirements for example pulses that need to be adequately irrigated in the mediterranean regions could be assigned obligatory irrigation locally to prevent yield losses at the same time we would like to stress that the default prioritisation is used only for few crops regions where statistical data is lacking as information on the total citrus orchards area for many regions was missing in the eurostat database and initial test runs with default irrigation priorities indicated severe underestimations of allocated areas of this crop we assigned a fixed ratio of 0 8 for citrus orchards a median value of the ratio for regions where statistical records are available as the first step of the procedure fig 2 the potential irrigated area for crop i is determined by obtaining a minimum of total crop i area a ij and available irrigated area aia ji within the grid cell j for the first crop in the priority ranking the available irrigated area is the same as ia j for the subsequent crops available irrigated area is diminished by values assigned to previously processed crops successively a factor defining contribution of each grid cell to the regional sum indicating concentration of areas suitable for irrigated cropi is calculated according to the formula 1 f c r o p i j min t a i j a i a i j j 1 n min t a i j a i a i j 100 where ta ij is a total area for crop i in cell j aia ij is available irrigated area for crop i in the grid cell j n is the number of grid cells within region r in step 2 of the procedure regional irrigated area for crop i ari is allocated into suitable cells i e cells with min a ij aia ji 0 and factor from eq 1 using the formula 2 ia ij f cropij a ri where ia ij is the allocated irrigated area of crop i within grid cell j and a ri is the regional area of irrigated crop i in region r if steps 1 2 are insufficient to allocate the entire regional irrigated area a ri to the suitable grid cells the remainder area left al is distributed into the additional potentially irrigable areas determined as differences between tia and ia as presented in step 3 of the procedure fig 2 and additional irrigated area for crop i iaadd ij is estimated for each of the grid cells with tia ia 0 finally prior to processing next crop in the irrigation priority ranking crop i 1 the available irrigated area within grid cell is diminished by irrigated area assigned to crop i 2 3 quality checks of the eim2010 prior to evaluating the map against the external data sources we performed an internal check and compared aggregated cell based values of crop specific irrigated areas against the respective regional data eurostat 2010a to check if entire regional level areas were distributed satisfactorily even for crops with the lowest irrigation priorities and hence most limited access to available irrigated area this check was performed for regions with at least 5000 ha of irrigated area for each of crop types selection of geospatial dataset for evaluation of the eim2010 was focused on the following criteria 1 homogenous cover for the entire european domain or its considerable parts 2 representativeness for the similar time period 3 comparable crop classes a multi step evaluation of the eim2010 was performed against two datasets that met these criteria namely spam2010 and sapm eurostat gridded results the spam2010 global datasets provides physical and harvested crop areas differentiated into rain fed and irrigated portions of crops for the year 2010 spam2010 as the first step of the evaluation we conducted a visual comparison of large scale distribution patterns of irrigated crop physical areas of the spam2010 with corresponding crops from the eim2010 out of its 42 crop classes represented by spam2010 the classes overlapping with eim2010 thematic resolution include maize potato rice sugar beet sunflower vegetables rapeseed 3 3 the corresponding classes eim2010 rape and turnip rape with spam2010 rapeseed and eim2010 fruit and berry plantations with spam2010 temperate fruit and fruit and berry plantations secondly the large scale spatial patterns as well as local cell based estimates of irrigated crop areas were evaluated against the survey on agricultural production methods sapm eurostat 2020 the sapm was a one off survey conducted in 2010 to collect farm level data on agri environmental measures for 17 countries sapm was carried out as a sample survey on the full fss population while for 14 countries it was carried as a full census the gridded sapm records are available only for a subset of european countries where sapm was conducted as a full census table 1 while for other countries including some with high importance of irrigation for e g spain greece sub regional resolution data is not available where available sapm gridded data may be directly compared with the eim2010 as both datasets use the same 10 km x 10 km grid and the same crop classification however the sapm gridded dataset contains data gaps due to the similar confidentiality restraints as described for the gridded fss data and for these cells the comparison is not possible a pair wise comparison of grid cell values from eim2010 and sapm gridded dataset was conducted for regions with at least 10 000 ha of irrigated crop area for a given crop class according to the eurostat 2010a following gupta et al 2009 we calculated three indicators pearson correlation coefficient r percent bias pbias and relative standard deviation error psde according to the formulas 3 r x m e a n x y m e a n y x m e a n x 2 y m e a n y 2 4 pbias 100 mean y mean x 1 5 psde 100 sd y sd x 1 where y and x are the sets of cell level irrigated crop areas from eim2010 and the sapm gridded datasets respectively and mean and sd are the sample mean and standard deviation operators pearson correlation coefficient r ranges from 1 1 0 values indicating no linear correlation the optimal value of pbias is 0 with positive negative values indicating overestimation underestimation of the average irrigated areas similarly the optimal value for psde is 0 with positive negative values indicating overestimation underestimation of the spatial variation of irrigated areas 3 results the eim2010 both crop specific irrigation layers and gap filled tia and ia layers is openly available from the agri4cast resources portal https agri4cast jrc ec europa eu dataportal index aspx fig 3 illustrates gap filled total irrigable areas tia as well as irrigated areas ia these maps display the focal areas of irrigation in southern europe extensive irrigated areas areas with high tia and ia are located in the mediterranean regions iberian peninsula southern italy and northern italy po basin and greece additionally many irrigated areas are present in a belt extending from south eastern france adour garonne loire seine basins through the benelux countries northern germany to denmark large contiguous irrigated areas are present in the danube basin additionally irrigated areas are also present in the maritsa basin in bulgaria and in the rhone and rhine basins as seen in fig 3c considerable differences are visible between potentially irrigated tia and actually irrigated ia areas in the danube basin e g romania hungary austria slovakia bulgaria parts of denmark belgium netherlands and north western germany maps of tia and ia that are included in the dataset fig 3 provide an overview of irrigation capacity and its utilization respectively at european scale the differences between tia and ia indicate areas equipped for irrigation which were not utilized during the reporting period large gaps are seen in regions where the role of irrigation is supplementary and where crop water requirements could have been fulfilled with available rainfall during the crop growing season in large contiguous areas of the danube basin romania hungary austria slovakia bulgaria and parts of denmark 2010 april july was significantly wetter than on average baruth et al 2010 the largest gaps between tia and ia seen in northern italy po basin could be related in addition to favourable meteorological conditions to the presence of the dense canal networks in whose vicinity land is classified as potentially irrigable similar situations occurred in the netherlands and to a smaller extent in denmark fig 4 presents the spatial distribution of the main irrigated crop classes in europe in 2010 maize is extensively irrigated in france portugal italy and greece as well as other countries such as denmark germany netherlands hungary romania bulgaria austria and slovakia fig 4a sub regional spatial variability of irrigated maize is considerable as illustrated for selected top maize producing regions in europe in fig 5 in lombardy fig 5a which is the top maize producing region in europe maize grows in the temperate areas iiasa fao 2012 with adequate water supply resulting in the highest crop area concentrated in the south lower plain in aquitaine most of the irrigated maize is grown in the south eastern part suitable for irrigation while there is no irrigated maize in the pyrenees where thermal conditions are not favourable fig 5b in castilla y león which is the main maize producing region of spain most of the crop is irrigated north of the douro river fig 5c similar inter regional variabilities are observed for other crops as well comparison of aggregated cell based values of irrigated crop areas against the regional data indicate satisfactory disaggregation as the differences were not considerable 3 in most cases for regions with at least 5000 ha of irrigated crop the differences did not exceed 1 even for crops with the lowest irrigation priorities however in case of some crops and regions the eim2010 underestimated the regional values by more than 5 table 1 in appendix this was especially the case for the citrus orchards that strongly compete for the irrigation area with other collocated crops or rice fields located in grid cells where too little irrigated area was reported and large discrepancies were present between rice areas and irrigated or irrigable areas this is most notably visible for rice in two regions alentejo portugal and provence alpes côte d azur france where rice area at regional scale is underestimated by 30 and 80 respectively in the eim2010 as compared to regional statistics in comparison to spam2010 the eim2010 layers seem to provide higher spatial variability of crops distribution within regions fig 6 the general distribution patterns of eim2010 and spam2010 are consistent for most of the common crop classes nevertheless some differences are visible especially for irrigated sunflower and rape and turnip rape eim2010 includes irrigated sunflower in some regions of the iberian peninsula in accordance with the regional statistics while these areas are omitted in the spam2010 on the other hand spam2010 shows extensive irrigated sunflower areas in the danube basin while eim2010 indicates that areas of irrigated sunflower in the danube basin are much more limited additionally eim2010 includes areas of irrigated rape and turnip rape that are not represented by the spam2010 product the evaluation against the gridded sapm data performed only for the countries with this data available shown that large scale spatial patterns were similar for example absolute differences of paired grid values of irrigated maize ranged 50 ha in most of the analysed regions with an exception of most intensive maize production regions e g in northern italy and western france and portugal here the absolute differences were higher fig 7 however relative differences were still moderate in case of other crops the differences were also generally rather small the pair wise comparison of grid level values indicated good correlation between eim2010 and sapm dataset however with considerable variability of indicator values across crops and regions the example comparison results for the top producing regions i e top producing regions with sapm gridded data available are illustrated in fig 8 for maize and in fig 9 for other selected crops while all indicator values we considered for regions with at least 10 000 ha of irrigated crop area are presented in table 2 in appendix pearson correlation coefficient generally exceeds values of 0 9 except for cereals other than maize and rice and olives in some regions where r 0 7 while pbias and psde values were generally of low magnitude indicating satisfactory representation of area values by eim2010 as compared to sapm gridded data 4 discussion information on irrigated surfaces is essential input for water

distribution and extent of irrigated crop surfaces is one of the main factors that propagate through assessments of water withdrawals puy et al 2021 the eim2010 dataset that we present here is harmonised in terms of data sources and methodology the procedure for creating the eim2010 is transparent and fully automated r script and could be repeated when the new fss data for the year 2020 becomes available to update the irrigated crop surfaces and monitor changes in irrigated agriculture over a period of decade other large scale irrigation datasets that cover the european domain e g eim spam gripc were created by disaggregating national or sub national inventory statistics into sub regional scale based on auxiliary datasets such as earth observation eo data crop inventories climate and meteorological data digital elevation maps etc wriedt et al 2009 you et al 2014 salmon et al 2015 the eim2010 data set was based on farm level inventories fss on crop specific irrigated areas aggregated to 10 km x 10 km grid therefore improving the accuracy regarding the distribution of irrigated crops within administrative units as compared to the spam2010 dataset eim2010 provides more spatial variation of irrigated crop patterns at sub regional scale additionally the thematic resolution of eim2010 was developed specifically for european agriculture with consideration of classes such as irrigated olives and vines omitted in the global datasets due to their relatively low global representation high thematic resolution of the map differentiation of 14 irrigated crop classes allows for more accurate representation of seasonally changing crop water requirements allen et al 1998 irrigation water requirements potential impacts of water scarcity on crops and similar agro hydrological modelling applications a main weakness of the approach based on statistical census data in a context of dynamic physical modelling and water governance is the low temporal resolution as the european census is conducted circa every 10 years total irrigable area i e the area equipped for irrigation is relatively constant from year to year eurostat 2010a as large public investments or incentives are required for developing irrigation schemes however actually irrigated area or areas of individual irrigated crop classes may change considerably from year to year due to prevailing agrometeorological conditions during the growing season agronomic and economic market conditions crop rotations etc such inter annual discrepancies may be especially visible where the role of irrigation is supplementary additional factors that impact the utilization of irrigation infrastructure include long term trends in irrigation management due to policy changes for example in romania only a fraction of irrigation infrastructure has been used after the political transformation due to poor maintenance as well as the cropping pattern transitions frone and frone 2015 bălteanu et al 2013 other limitations of the methodology derive from uncertainty of the underlying statistical data the specific grid cell values may be affected by estimation errors in the underlying farm level data and geo referencing errors due to assignment of individual farms to specific grid cells in order to increase spatial and temporal granularity of large scale irrigation products as well as to eliminate errors inherent to statistical approaches other than purely statistical data driven methods are needed for irrigation mapping earth observation eo data can be an alternative for mapping irrigated areas meier et al 2018 ozdogan et al 2010 calera et al 2017 incorporating a variety of data sources including statistical inventory records earth observation eo data and other auxiliary data sources could be used to obtain more reliable maps of irrigated areas at finer spatio temporal resolution compared to maps derived solely from statistical inventories in europe the application of eo for continental scale mapping of irrigated crops is a promising perspective due to availability of coordinated european scale data sources e g at eu and eea39 level this includes the possibility to combine the 10 m resolution observations from the fleet of sentinel satellites with in situ observations to derive algorithms to improve mapping of crops d andrimont et al 2021 and crop specific irrigated surfaces one example of such an in situ dataset is lucas gallego and delincé 2010 tóth et al 2013 which contains point information on the presence of the type of irrigation methods sources and conveyance structures recorded across the eu along with the ground observations of finely resolved crop classes a new lucas database that harmonises all past surveys has recently become available d andrimont et al 2020 with a tri annual temporal resolution furthermore the integrated administration and control systems iacs that are in place to manage the eu common agricultural policy expenditure and farmers applications include geospatial parcel level information on crop type as recorded in geospatial aid applications gsaa such geospatial information is increasingly becoming publicly available fusing such datasets could eventually improve the spatial and temporal granularity of crop cover and irrigation information 5 conclusions information on spatial distribution of irrigated crops is highly relevant for large scale hydrological and agricultural models that simulate complex interdependencies between water resources and agriculture the eim2010 presented in this study updates the previous european irrigation map for spatially distributed agricultural modelling of wriedt et al 2009 using data collected during the 2010 agricultural census the eim2010 currently is the most reliable source of information on spatial distribution of irrigated crop types across europe the eim2020 provides valuable inputs for large scale modelling applications involving irrigated agriculture and can support agricultural and water resources management policies as well as the development benchmarking of other products the thematic resolution of eim2010 is high and specific for european agriculture and includes total irrigated area tia irrigable area ia as well as 14 irrigated crop classes consideration of spatial distribution of individual crops types rather than generic crop types i e summer spring winter crops allows for refined representation of seasonally changing crop water requirements and associated impacts on agro hydrological processes represented by large scale models as compared to the global extent spam 2010 the only currently available dataset providing distribution of crop specific irrigated areas for year 2010 eim2010 demonstrates more detailed spatial variability of irrigated crop patterns at sub regional level this is because the underlying eim2010 methodology for disaggregation of regional level records into the 10 km x 10 km grid cells uses information on total crop areas and irrigated areas that was collected at farm level and aggregated to the same 10 km x 10 km grid moreover eim2010 provides additional crop classes including olives and vineyards essential for agricultural production in some european regions the evaluation performed for regions where reference gridded data is available indicates generally good agreement between large scale spatial patterns of irrigated crops and cell specific areas for the most important crop producing regions with irrigated crop area exceeding 10 000 ha future improvements of the european extent irrigation map should tackle the limitations posed by the low temporal and spatial granularity of irrigated crop information obtained solely from statistical census data as well as to the related uncertainties by incorporating other data types such as crop specific eo products in situ surveys and other types of auxiliary data declaration of competing interest the authors declare

9534,regional to global studies of hydrology water availability and water use and their interaction with agricultural production and food security require accurate information on the location and extent of irrigated croplands in this study we derive the european irrigation map for the year 2010 eim2010 underpinned by the agricultural census conducted in the european union in 2010 the map contains 14 irrigated crop classes as well as total irrigable and irrigated areas centred on the year 2010 the thematic resolution of the map is tailored specifically to european agriculture and contains most relevant staple crops e g maize rice potato other cereals as well as major permanent crops e g irrigated olive orchards and vineyards the map was created using a consistent methodology and data gathered across the european union member states and the uk and therefore provides comparable and representative information across the continental domain the input data used to construct the map consisted of farm level records on irrigated areas and total crop areas collected during the 2010 agricultural census and aggregated to 10 km x 10 km grid as well as regional level statistics at nuts2 level on irrigated areas by crop type a custom developed disaggregation algorithm was used to distribute the regional level statistics into the 10 km x 10 km grid evaluation of the map against independent reference geospatial data indicated satisfactory agreement for both large scale spatial patterns as well as specific grid cell values for the main crop production regions the eim2010 is publicly available and provides valuable inputs for large scale modelling applications involving irrigated agriculture keywords irrigated area hydrological modelling crop modelling agricultural census statistical data 1 introduction irrigation is an important component of agriculture in the european union eu the prevalence of irrigation varies across europe depending on climate traditional cropping patterns the availability of water resources as well as socio economic factors such as irrigation subsidies or water pricing wriedt et al 2009 toan 2016 in the mediterranean climate of southern europe irrigation has traditionally been an essential element of agricultural production malek and verburg 2018 2017 in central and northern european countries where rainfall has usually been sufficient to sustain profitable yields irrigation has been applied only as a supplementary source of water to enhance agricultural production during crop development stages sensitive to water stress wriedt et al 2009 berbel et al 2015 however already observed changes in climate such as higher temperatures changing precipitation patterns e g toreti et al 2019 ceglar et al 2019 ruiz ramos et al 2018 longer rain deficient periods increased frequency of droughts and heat waves are already widening yield gaps between rain fed and irrigated agriculture therefore irrigation investments and practices gain popularity also in areas traditionally not irrigated in central and northern europe where availability of water resources is not yet a limiting factor for irrigation and agricultural production siebert et al 2005 greaves and wang 2016 irrigation has a high potential to impact on regional hydrology and water management fao 2011 iglesias and garotte 2015 gelati et al 2020 gobin et al 2017

et al 2000 soil salinization daliakopoulos et al 2016 and sea water intrusion into coastal aquifers wriedt and bouraoui 2009 greggio et al 2012 additionally it is one of the main factors causing water management problems in river basins such as shifts of water scarcity from upstream to downstream sections of river basins and associated conflicts calera et al 2017 veldkamp et al 2017 munia et al 2018 balancing the beneﬁts of irrigation water abstraction to improve crop production van der velde et al 2010 against the negative environmental impacts and water demands from other sectors for example public water supply energy production haddeland et al 2014 rosegrant et al 2009 adamovic et al 2019 becomes more and more important distributed crop growth and hydrological models or coupled models are applied at large scales regional continental and global in order to support policy and decision making regarding complex agricultural water systems siad et al 2019 unece 2015 implementation of such large scale distributed models is associated with many challenges including high computational and storage requirements and data collection for model parameterisation as computational and storage data capabilities are constantly increasing it is data availability at appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions that often dictates the choice of modelling tools to be used to address research or management questions spatial distribution and extension of irrigated areas may be essential input factor for large scale physical models with hydrological components puy et al 2021 lack of up to date spatially distributed and homogenous quality data on distribution of irrigated crops in europe has been recognised as a limiting factor for european scale hydrological and crop modelling several data sets provide information on distribution of total irrigated areas or irrigated crop types with relatively fine spatial detail 10 km x 10 km grid making them suitable as inputs for large scale distributed model simulations table 1 currently most of the data sets that provide spatially distributed information on irrigated crops for europe are representative for a period around the year 2000 2005 table 1 with the exception of last updated version of the spam global dataset you et al 2014 wood sichra et al 2016 spam2010 you et al 2020 representative for the year 2010 the european irrigation map eim wriedt et al 2009 is the first and currently most recent data set developed specifically for europe and comprises 10 crop classes the eim was created by disaggregating regional level statistics on irrigated cropland areas into a 100 100 m grid using a land cover map developed by grizzetti et al 2007 and constrained by the global map of irrigated areas gmias siebert et al 2013 despite its high spatial resolution the authors recommended not using the eim at scales finer than 10 km x 10 km due to the uncertainties associated with the stochastic methodology used to create the map wriedt et al 2009 the corine land cover clc map provides spatially detailed 100 m resolution information of distribution of crops and irrigated areas on arable land for years 2012 and 2018 clc 2012 2018 however in respect to irrigated areas clc distinguishes non irrigated arable land and irrigated arable land with no further specification of crop types additionally the irrigated arable land includes only areas with irrigation infrastructure visible from satellite imagery clc 2012 2018 and many wide spread types of irrigation e g drip irrigation mobile sprinkler irrigation irrigation from groundwater sources irrigated permanent crops etc are excluded some of the global extent datasets outline irrigated and irrigable agricultural areas in europe for example the global map of irrigated areas gmias siebert et al 2013 and the global irrigated area map giam thenkabail et al 2009 contain data on areas equipped for irrigation as well as actually irrigated areas gmias 5 arc minute giam 10 km for years 2005 and 2000 respectively while the global map of irrigated rain fed and paddy croplands gripc salmon et al 2015 provides the distribution of rainfed and irrigated croplands complemented with layers of paddy areas at a 500 m x 500 m grid for the year 2005 while these maps are helpful to understand where irrigation takes place they do not provide information on specific classes of irrigated crops the global agro ecological zones iiasa fao 2012 and the monthly irrigated and rain fed crop areas in 2000 mirca2000 portmann et al 2010 distinguish many irrigated crop types listed in table 1 at a spatial resolution of 5 arc minute for a period around the year 2000 the spam dataset produced with the spatial production allocation model spam you et al 2014 yu et al 2020 wood sichra et al 2016 distinguishes the most important irrigated staple crops e g maize rice potato wheat barley and its latest version is dated around 2010 however the information on irrigated areas is derived from the latest version of global map of irrigation areas gmia v5 0 siebert et al 2013 representative for year 2005 due to their general global scope none of these global datasets includes all irrigated crop classes that are essential for european agriculture e g irrigated olives or vineyards here we present the european irrigation map for the year 2010 eim2010 as an update of most recent european irrigation map of wriedt et al 2009 representative for the year 2000 the eim2010 is intended as input for large scale modelling applications and has an acceptable spatial resolution the objective of this manuscript is to present the underlying data detail the methodology used to produce the crop irrigated areas and assess their quality against independent geospatial data furthermore we discuss possible ways to progress with spatial delineation of irrigated crops beyond approaches based solely on statistical census data as possible ways for increasing the spatial and temporal granularity 2 materials and methods the eim2010 was created by disaggregating regional statistics on irrigated areas by crop type into the 10 km x 10 km grid eea 2013 fig 1 presents a simplified outline of the disaggregation schema the input data include medium resolution gridded data on irrigated areas with no differentiation of specific crop classes and gridded data on total crop areas with no differentiation of rain fed versus irrigated portions of crops provided by eurostat the data on irrigated areas were pre processed gap filled prior their use 2 1 data sources 2 1 1 gridded statistical data inputs the farm level data on irrigated areas and total crop areas were collected by eurostat the statistical office of the european union during the 2010 farm structure survey fss conducted as agricultural census the fss data covers a wide range of agricultural management parameters including total crop area for 46 crop classes as well as total irrigable area tia defined as area equipped with irrigation infrastructure and irrigated area ia defined as actually irrigated area at least once a year both tia and ia represent summarized values of all irrigated crops within grid cells and thus are not crop specific on the other hand gridded total crop areas do not carry information on rain fed and irrigated portions of crops recently eurostat provided the 2010 farm level census data on total crop areas and tia and ia aggregated at 10 km x 10 km grid level bujnowska et al 2019 as well as lower resolution 20 and 60 km grids due to legal and confidentiality restrictions data gaps are imposed in cases when the value of crop area within a grid cell is explained by 4 or less holdings or when 85 of the value is explained by 1 or 2 holdings the data gaps in total crop areas were filled by bujnowska et al 2019 similar dissemination restraints are applied for the gridded tias and ias collected at the farm level aggregated to the 10 km x 10 km grid and disseminated by eurostat we estimated the missing tia and ia values of the 10 km x 10 km grid with a gap filling algorithm developed specifically to allocate the available lower resolution 20 km x 20 km 60 km x 60 km grids and regional level records in place of the missing values 2 1 2 regional statistical data inputs the regional level data on crop specific irrigated areas are available from the fss of 2010 eurostat 2010a the data on ia tia and irrigated areas by crop type as well as some additional information regarding the number of agricultural entities using different irrigation methods or water sources are available at the nuts2 administrative level except for germany where the spatial resolution is nuts1 eurostat 2010a the main irrigated crop classes considered in the fss comprising both arable land and permanent crops are as follows cereals excl maize and rice maize grain and green rice pulses potatoes sugar beet rape and turnip rape sunflower field vegetables 2 2 the original names from the eurostat database eurostat 2010a were modified for simplicity fresh vegetables melons and strawberries open field was changed to field vegetables and under glass vegetables flowers and permanent crops was changed to greenhouses fruit and berry plantations was changed to fruit and berry orchards citrus plantations was changed to citrus orchards olives plantations was changed to olives orchards temporary and permanent grass fruit and berry orchards citrus orchards olives orchards vineyards greenhouses textile crops and other crops on arable land in this study we focus on the 14 crop classes all irrigated crop classes considered in fss except for textile crops and other crops on arable land 2 2 distribution algorithm the scheme for disaggregating regional level irrigated areas to the grid level is illustrated in fig 2 irrigated crop area may be allocated only to grid cells that contain non zero values of available irrigated area and non zero values of total crop area furthermore available irrigated area within grid cell needs to be shared between all irrigated crops that are co located within the same grid cell for cases when available irrigated area does not suffice for all irrigated crops within one cell available irrigated area is allocated to crops with higher irrigation priority for example crops that require obligatory irrigation or provide higher economic income we apply a simplified approach to determine region specific irrigation practices we assume that the crops with a higher ratio of irrigated to total crop area within a given region have higher irrigation priorities than crops with lower ratio values for regions and crops where statistical data is sufficient we determined the fractions of irrigated to total crop areas by comparison of regional irrigated crop areas ef poirrig dataset eurostat 2010a and regional total crop areas apro cpshr dataset eurostat 2010b for regions and crops where priorities cannot be established based on the ratio of irrigated to total crop areas due to lack of respective records we apply a default ranking based on experts opinion as follows rice field vegetables fruit and berry orchards potatoes citrus orchards maize pulses sugar beet rape and turnip rape sunflower grass olive orchards vineyards and the remaining cereals while specifying pan european crop irrigation priorities has been tackled previously wriedt et al 2008 there are some drawbacks of using a generic list over such a large spatial domain due to diversity of climatological and agro management environments the generic priority ranking may diverge from region specific or local requirements for example pulses that need to be adequately irrigated in the mediterranean regions could be assigned obligatory irrigation locally to prevent yield losses at the same time we would like to stress that the default prioritisation is used only for few crops regions where statistical data is lacking as information on the total citrus orchards area for many regions was missing in the eurostat database and initial test runs with default irrigation priorities indicated severe underestimations of allocated areas of this crop we assigned a fixed ratio of 0 8 for citrus orchards a median value of the ratio for regions where statistical records are available as the first step of the procedure fig 2 the potential irrigated area for crop i is determined by obtaining a minimum of total crop i area a ij and available irrigated area aia ji within the grid cell j for the first crop in the priority ranking the available irrigated area is the same as ia j for the subsequent crops available irrigated area is diminished by values assigned to previously processed crops successively a factor defining contribution of each grid cell to the regional sum indicating concentration of areas suitable for irrigated cropi is calculated according to the formula 1 f c r o p i j min t a i j a i a i j j 1 n min t a i j a i a i j 100 where ta ij is a total area for crop i in cell j aia ij is available irrigated area for crop i in the grid cell j n is the number of grid cells within region r in step 2 of the procedure regional irrigated area for crop i ari is allocated into suitable cells i e cells with min a ij aia ji 0 and factor from eq 1 using the formula 2 ia ij f cropij a ri where ia ij is the allocated irrigated area of crop i within grid cell j and a ri is the regional area of irrigated crop i in region r if steps 1 2 are insufficient to allocate the entire regional irrigated area a ri to the suitable grid cells the remainder area left al is distributed into the additional potentially irrigable areas determined as differences between tia and ia as presented in step 3 of the procedure fig 2 and additional irrigated area for crop i iaadd ij is estimated for each of the grid cells with tia ia 0 finally prior to processing next crop in the irrigation priority ranking crop i 1 the available irrigated area within grid cell is diminished by irrigated area assigned to crop i 2 3 quality checks of the eim2010 prior to evaluating the map against the external data sources we performed an internal check and compared aggregated cell based values of crop specific irrigated areas against the respective regional data eurostat 2010a to check if entire regional level areas were distributed satisfactorily even for crops with the lowest irrigation priorities and hence most limited access to available irrigated area this check was performed for regions with at least 5000 ha of irrigated area for each of crop types selection of geospatial dataset for evaluation of the eim2010 was focused on the following criteria 1 homogenous cover for the entire european domain or its considerable parts 2 representativeness for the similar time period 3 comparable crop classes a multi step evaluation of the eim2010 was performed against two datasets that met these criteria namely spam2010 and sapm eurostat gridded results the spam2010 global datasets provides physical and harvested crop areas differentiated into rain fed and irrigated portions of crops for the year 2010 spam2010 as the first step of the evaluation we conducted a visual comparison of large scale distribution patterns of irrigated crop physical areas of the spam2010 with corresponding crops from the eim2010 out of its 42 crop classes represented by spam2010 the classes overlapping with eim2010 thematic resolution include maize potato rice sugar beet sunflower vegetables rapeseed 3 3 the corresponding classes eim2010 rape and turnip rape with spam2010 rapeseed and eim2010 fruit and berry plantations with spam2010 temperate fruit and fruit and berry plantations secondly the large scale spatial patterns as well as local cell based estimates of irrigated crop areas were evaluated against the survey on agricultural production methods sapm eurostat 2020 the sapm was a one off survey conducted in 2010 to collect farm level data on agri environmental measures for 17 countries sapm was carried out as a sample survey on the full fss population while for 14 countries it was carried as a full census the gridded sapm records are available only for a subset of european countries where sapm was conducted as a full census table 1 while for other countries including some with high importance of irrigation for e g spain greece sub regional resolution data is not available where available sapm gridded data may be directly compared with the eim2010 as both datasets use the same 10 km x 10 km grid and the same crop classification however the sapm gridded dataset contains data gaps due to the similar confidentiality restraints as described for the gridded fss data and for these cells the comparison is not possible a pair wise comparison of grid cell values from eim2010 and sapm gridded dataset was conducted for regions with at least 10 000 ha of irrigated crop area for a given crop class according to the eurostat 2010a following gupta et al 2009 we calculated three indicators pearson correlation coefficient r percent bias pbias and relative standard deviation error psde according to the formulas 3 r x m e a n x y m e a n y x m e a n x 2 y m e a n y 2 4 pbias 100 mean y mean x 1 5 psde 100 sd y sd x 1 where y and x are the sets of cell level irrigated crop areas from eim2010 and the sapm gridded datasets respectively and mean and sd are the sample mean and standard deviation operators pearson correlation coefficient r ranges from 1 1 0 values indicating no linear correlation the optimal value of pbias is 0 with positive negative values indicating overestimation underestimation of the average irrigated areas similarly the optimal value for psde is 0 with positive negative values indicating overestimation underestimation of the spatial variation of irrigated areas 3 results the eim2010 both crop specific irrigation layers and gap filled tia and ia layers is openly available from the agri4cast resources portal https agri4cast jrc ec europa eu dataportal index aspx fig 3 illustrates gap filled total irrigable areas tia as well as irrigated areas ia these maps display the focal areas of irrigation in southern europe extensive irrigated areas areas with high tia and ia are located in the mediterranean regions iberian peninsula southern italy and northern italy po basin and greece additionally many irrigated areas are present in a belt extending from south eastern france adour garonne loire seine basins through the benelux countries northern germany to denmark large contiguous irrigated areas are present in the danube basin additionally irrigated areas are also present in the maritsa basin in bulgaria and in the rhone and rhine basins as seen in fig 3c considerable differences are visible between potentially irrigated tia and actually irrigated ia areas in the danube basin e g romania hungary austria slovakia bulgaria parts of denmark belgium netherlands and north western germany maps of tia and ia that are included in the dataset fig 3 provide an overview of irrigation capacity and its utilization respectively at european scale the differences between tia and ia indicate areas equipped for irrigation which were not utilized during the reporting period large gaps are seen in regions where the role of irrigation is supplementary and where crop water requirements could have been fulfilled with available rainfall during the crop growing season in large contiguous areas of the danube basin romania hungary austria slovakia bulgaria and parts of denmark 2010 april july was significantly wetter than on average baruth et al 2010 the largest gaps between tia and ia seen in northern italy po basin could be related in addition to favourable meteorological conditions to the presence of the dense canal networks in whose vicinity land is classified as potentially irrigable similar situations occurred in the netherlands and to a smaller extent in denmark fig 4 presents the spatial distribution of the main irrigated crop classes in europe in 2010 maize is extensively irrigated in france portugal italy and greece as well as other countries such as denmark germany netherlands hungary romania bulgaria austria and slovakia fig 4a sub regional spatial variability of irrigated maize is considerable as illustrated for selected top maize producing regions in europe in fig 5 in lombardy fig 5a which is the top maize producing region in europe maize grows in the temperate areas iiasa fao 2012 with adequate water supply resulting in the highest crop area concentrated in the south lower plain in aquitaine most of the irrigated maize is grown in the south eastern part suitable for irrigation while there is no irrigated maize in the pyrenees where thermal conditions are not favourable fig 5b in castilla y león which is the main maize producing region of spain most of the crop is irrigated north of the douro river fig 5c similar inter regional variabilities are observed for other crops as well comparison of aggregated cell based values of irrigated crop areas against the regional data indicate satisfactory disaggregation as the differences were not considerable 3 in most cases for regions with at least 5000 ha of irrigated crop the differences did not exceed 1 even for crops with the lowest irrigation priorities however in case of some crops and regions the eim2010 underestimated the regional values by more than 5 table 1 in appendix this was especially the case for the citrus orchards that strongly compete for the irrigation area with other collocated crops or rice fields located in grid cells where too little irrigated area was reported and large discrepancies were present between rice areas and irrigated or irrigable areas this is most notably visible for rice in two regions alentejo portugal and provence alpes côte d azur france where rice area at regional scale is underestimated by 30 and 80 respectively in the eim2010 as compared to regional statistics in comparison to spam2010 the eim2010 layers seem to provide higher spatial variability of crops distribution within regions fig 6 the general distribution patterns of eim2010 and spam2010 are consistent for most of the common crop classes nevertheless some differences are visible especially for irrigated sunflower and rape and turnip rape eim2010 includes irrigated sunflower in some regions of the iberian peninsula in accordance with the regional statistics while these areas are omitted in the spam2010 on the other hand spam2010 shows extensive irrigated sunflower areas in the danube basin while eim2010 indicates that areas of irrigated sunflower in the danube basin are much more limited additionally eim2010 includes areas of irrigated rape and turnip rape that are not represented by the spam2010 product the evaluation against the gridded sapm data performed only for the countries with this data available shown that large scale spatial patterns were similar for example absolute differences of paired grid values of irrigated maize ranged 50 ha in most of the analysed regions with an exception of most intensive maize production regions e g in northern italy and western france and portugal here the absolute differences were higher fig 7 however relative differences were still moderate in case of other crops the differences were also generally rather small the pair wise comparison of grid level values indicated good correlation between eim2010 and sapm dataset however with considerable variability of indicator values across crops and regions the example comparison results for the top producing regions i e top producing regions with sapm gridded data available are illustrated in fig 8 for maize and in fig 9 for other selected crops while all indicator values we considered for regions with at least 10 000 ha of irrigated crop area are presented in table 2 in appendix pearson correlation coefficient generally exceeds values of 0 9 except for cereals other than maize and rice and olives in some regions where r 0 7 while pbias and psde values were generally of low magnitude indicating satisfactory representation of area values by eim2010 as compared to sapm gridded data 4 discussion information on irrigated surfaces is essential input for water management across spatial scales plot farm irrigation district river basin and beyond and should be produced in a transparent verifiable way and equally shared with all actors involved calera et al

climate and meteorological data digital elevation maps etc wriedt et al 2009 you et al 2014 salmon et al 2015 the eim2010 data set was based on farm level inventories fss on crop specific irrigated areas aggregated to 10 km x 10 km grid therefore improving the accuracy regarding the distribution of irrigated crops within administrative units as compared to the spam2010 dataset eim2010 provides more spatial variation of irrigated crop patterns at sub regional scale additionally the thematic resolution of eim2010 was developed specifically for european agriculture with consideration of classes such as irrigated olives and vines omitted in the global datasets due to their relatively low global representation high thematic resolution of the map differentiation of 14 irrigated crop classes allows for more accurate representation of seasonally changing crop water requirements allen et al 1998 irrigation water requirements potential impacts of water scarcity on crops and similar agro hydrological modelling applications a main weakness of the approach based on statistical census data in a context of dynamic physical modelling and water governance is the low temporal resolution as the european census is conducted circa every 10 years total irrigable area i e the area equipped for irrigation is relatively constant from year to year eurostat 2010a as large public investments or incentives are required for developing irrigation schemes however actually irrigated area or areas of individual irrigated crop classes may change considerably from year to year due to prevailing agrometeorological conditions during the growing season agronomic and economic market conditions crop rotations etc such inter annual discrepancies may be especially visible where the role of irrigation is supplementary additional factors that impact the utilization of irrigation infrastructure include long term trends in irrigation management due to policy changes for example in romania only a fraction of irrigation infrastructure has been used after the political transformation due to poor maintenance as well as the cropping pattern transitions frone and frone 2015 bălteanu et al 2013 other limitations of the methodology derive from uncertainty of the underlying statistical data the specific grid cell values may be affected by estimation errors in the underlying farm level data and geo referencing errors due to assignment of individual farms to specific grid cells in order to increase spatial and temporal granularity of large scale irrigation products as well as to eliminate errors inherent to statistical approaches other than purely statistical data driven methods are needed for irrigation mapping earth observation eo data can be an alternative for mapping irrigated areas meier et al 2018 ozdogan et al 2010 calera et al 2017 incorporating a variety of data sources including statistical inventory records earth observation eo data and other auxiliary data sources could be used to obtain more reliable maps of irrigated areas at finer spatio temporal resolution compared to maps derived solely from statistical inventories in europe the application of eo for continental scale mapping of irrigated crops is a promising perspective due to availability of coordinated european scale data sources e g at eu and eea39 level this includes the possibility to combine the 10 m resolution observations from the fleet of sentinel satellites with in situ observations to derive algorithms to improve mapping of crops d andrimont et al 2021 and crop specific irrigated surfaces one example of such an in situ dataset is lucas gallego and delincé 2010 tóth et al 2013 which contains point information on the presence of the type of irrigation methods sources and conveyance structures recorded across the eu along with the ground observations of finely resolved crop classes a new lucas database that harmonises all past surveys has recently become available d andrimont et al 2020 with a tri annual temporal resolution furthermore the integrated administration and control systems iacs that are in place to manage the eu common agricultural policy expenditure and farmers applications include geospatial parcel level information on crop type as recorded in geospatial aid applications gsaa such geospatial information is increasingly becoming publicly available fusing such datasets could eventually improve the spatial and temporal granularity of crop cover and irrigation information 5 conclusions information on spatial distribution of irrigated crops is highly relevant for large scale hydrological and agricultural models that simulate complex interdependencies between water resources and agriculture the eim2010 presented in this study updates the previous european irrigation map for spatially distributed agricultural modelling of wriedt et al 2009 using data collected during the 2010 agricultural census the eim2010 currently is the most reliable source of information on spatial distribution of irrigated crop types across europe the eim2020 provides valuable inputs for large scale modelling applications involving irrigated agriculture and can support agricultural and water resources management policies as well as the development benchmarking of other products the thematic resolution of eim2010 is high and specific for european agriculture and includes total irrigated area tia irrigable area ia as well as 14 irrigated crop classes consideration of spatial distribution of individual crops types rather than generic crop types i e summer spring winter crops allows for refined representation of seasonally changing crop water requirements and associated impacts on agro hydrological processes represented by large scale models as compared to the global extent spam 2010 the only currently available dataset providing distribution of crop specific irrigated areas for year 2010 eim2010 demonstrates more detailed spatial variability of irrigated crop patterns at sub regional level this is because the underlying eim2010 methodology for disaggregation of regional level records into the 10 km x 10 km grid cells uses information on total crop areas and irrigated areas that was collected at farm level and aggregated to the same 10 km x 10 km grid moreover eim2010 provides additional crop classes including olives and vineyards essential for agricultural production in some european regions the evaluation performed for regions where reference gridded data is available indicates generally good agreement between large scale spatial patterns of irrigated crops and cell specific areas for the most important crop producing regions with irrigated crop area exceeding 10 000 ha future improvements of the european extent irrigation map should tackle the limitations posed by the low temporal and spatial granularity of irrigated crop information obtained solely from statistical census data as well as to the related uncertainties by incorporating other data types such as crop specific eo products in situ surveys and other types of auxiliary data declaration of competing interest the authors declare
