2360,pakistan has experienced seasonal changes of streamflow causing a lack of available water resources for agriculture however understanding of future seasonal changes of streamflow over pakistan remains limited this study assessed the past and future changes in streamflow timing along the four major rivers of pakistan upper indus kabul jhelum and chenab river basins using observational data and bias corrected hydrological projections firstly the vic river routing model was simulated forced by simulated daily surface and base runoff data from six cordex south asia regional climate models 1962 2099 secondly the minimum and seasonality bias in simulated daily streamflow data were corrected based on observational records to quantify seasonal changes of the hydrologic regime half of annual cumulative streamflows hcss and center of volume dates cvds were computed from observed and bias corrected simulated streamflow data over 1962 2019 observational records showed a significant decreasing trend in cvd that is an earlier onset of the wet season by a range between 4 5 and 12 6 days across the three river basins except for chenab river basin bias corrected hydrologic projections showed decreased cvd across the four study river basins by 4 2 to 6 3 days during the record period 1962 2019 the decreased cvds ranges from 5 to 20 days in the near future the 2050 2059 average and 11 days to 37 days in the far future the 2090 2099 average this study reported diverse hydrologic responses to a similar magnitude of near surface temperature in pakistan highlighting a

important water resources for agricultural use agricultural industrial and domestic in pakistan and the northwestern india the uir basin includes chenab jhelum ravi sutlej and beas river basins from the highland areas the kabul river is a reach of the uir at the tarbela dam reservoir in pakistan available water resources along these rivers are crucial to support the irrigated agriculture system over the downstream regions that feeds over 200 million people in pakistan the agriculture sector in pakistan contributes to 23 of the gdp and accounts for 43 percent of the country s labor force usman 2016 due to strong variability of the regional hydroclimate system in pakistan regional communities are vulnerable to hydroclimatic extremes such as drought and flood in 2010 heavy monsoon rains over pakistan caused flood inundation over 20 of the country and inflicted over us 16 billion in economic loss rehman et al 2016 in 2018 the southern part of pakistan had persistent precipitation deficits during monsoon season causing a severe drought adnan and ullah 2020 therefore it is crucial to understand variability and trend of the regional hydroclimate system and the future changes of water availability in pakistan bukhari et al 2020 pakistan is a predominantly agricultural country with the abundant arable land lying within the indus river basin there are two agriculture seasons in pakistan named kharif and rabi the kharif season refers to summer growing months may to november with the major crops cultivated being rice corn and cotton crop productivity largely depends upon the amount and distribution of rain associated with the monsoon activities during the kharif season ahmed et al 2019 the rabi season refers to winter growing months december through april of the following calendar year with the major crops being wheat barley and millet pakistan 2009 the planting window differs regionally depending on available water supply regional climate and cultivated crop type the major limitation to production is generally the timing and availability of the irrigation water supply and the efficiency of water on farm due to missing irrigation systems major crop productivity in the upstream regions of pakistan is affected by climate variability most of this water supply in the uir basin comes from remote glaciers of the himalayan and karakorum mountain ranges while the remainder comes from seasonal rainfall especially during the monsoon season from july to september siddiqui et al 2012 found that major crops of pakistan are vulnerable to increased surface temperature which can cause destructive agricultural losses several studies have reported hydroclimatic changes over south asia including pakistan shahid and rahman 2021 found a significant increasing trend of near surface temperature during springs and summers over the indus basin and a significant decreasing trend of springtime precipitation over 1985 2015 raising a concern of a possible change in the drought risk mazhar et al 2016 reported a decline in summertime precipitation in the himalayas over 1866 2006 archer 2003 found increased wintertime precipitation over gauge stations of the uir basin since 1960 kehrwald et al 2008 found a rapid retreat of glaciers in the himalayas resulting in increased springtime freshwater resources in the downstream regions according to climate projections the indus and brahmaputra river basins would experience decreased streamflow in the future immerzeel et al 2010 khan et al 2020 found that warmer surface temperature would increase mean annual flow in the future ranging from 10 to 30 under the future scenarios for the mid 21st century 2041 2070 spring and winter flows significantly can cause an increased risk of future flood hazards for the uir basin archer et al 2010 found that there is no evidence of significant reduction in available water resources over the uir basin due to climate change however socio economic changes would threaten the sustainability of available water resources in the uir basin based on the findings of previous studies the impact of surface warming driven changes in streamflow and available water resources on seasonal changes of the hydrologic regime in pakistan remains uncertain over mountainous regions the onset of a snow melting season mainly determines the timing of spring onset and crop planting snow and ice melting processes are sensitive to changes in near surface temperatures for example warmer near surface temperatures in late winter and early spring accelerates snow and ice melting processes causing seasonal changes in soil moistures such as an early onset of spring cayan et al 2001 kam et al 2022 evan and eisenman 2021 a wet soil moisture condition in early spring is favorable for floods and a dry soil moisture condition in the following season is favorable for wildfires and heatwaves kim et al 2020 in addition a previous study huss and hock 2018 found that streamflow volumes would increase as glaciers melt due to climate change but that they would reach a peak water phase when streamflow volumes would begin to recess as glaciers run out of mass qin et al 2020 found that climate change has altered the regional water balance due to changes in the fraction of precipitation falling as snow and the timing of snowmelt over the himalayas andes and other mountainous regions eventually these seasonal hydrologic changes can increase the risk of springtime floods and summertime droughts kam et al 2018 causing the crop failure over snow dominant regions where is more vulnerable to food security seasonal hydrologic changes have been studied mainly over the north american and european regions due to the availability of long term records of daily streamflow over the western u s region observational data showed an earlier spring onset schwartz and reiter 2000 menzel and fabian 1999 cayan et al 2001 barnett et al 2005 dudley et al 2017 wasko et al 2020 a recent study assessed the linkage of wildfire driven evapotranspiration shift to streamflow timing collar et al 2022 over the european region the earlier spring onset caused such seasonal changes such as leaf unfolding have advanced by six days whereas autumn events such as leaf coloring have been delayed by about five days menzel and fabian 1999 and thus extension of the growing season liu et al 2018 according to coupled model intercomparison phase 5 cmip5 models the u s region showed geographical variation of trends in winter spring streamflow timing with a weaker indication of detectable anthropogenic contributions towards the earlier streamflow timing in the western u s region they reported a high sensitivity of wsct trends over the western part of north america to the record length and climate model bias in high mountain asia the sensitivity of hydrologic responses e g glacier mass changes to surface warming are spatially heterogeneous kapnick et al 2014 sakai and fujita 2017 understanding of hydrologic response particularly in streamflow timing to surface warming in high mountain asia remain limited sharif et al 2013 springtime streamflow of the uir originates mainly form glacial ice and snowpack in hindukush himalaya and the karakorum one of the largest mountainous regions that contain the world largest hoard of snow and ice masses except for the polar regions soncini et al 2015 while the remainder comes from seasonal rainfall during monsoon season july to september dahri et al 2021 found that the median annual air temperature for the indus basin is projected to be increased with a range between 0 8 and 5 7 c by the end of the 21st century this near surface warming trend would result in an increase in the maximum rate of discharge during the wet season in indus kabul jhelum and chenab rivers suggesting a need of critical modification in the strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of future floods and droughts conditions archer 2003 found that summertime streamflow volumes are governed by melt of glaciers and permanent snow thermal control in current summer melt of seasonal snow controlled by preceding winter and spring precipitation and winter and monsoon rainfall hasson 2016 found that the median warming of 1 c or more than 1 5 c projects the drying of the monsoon july september and the shift of snowpack accumulation melt season march june recent climate change studies over pakistan have been focused on changes in climatic and hydrologic variables yaseen et al 2020 studied the variability of the hydrometeorological time series over uir they found a warming trend of low altitude stations and an increase in the streamflow was also detected during winter and spring seasons at all hydrological stations while the annual precipitation showed significant decreasing trend for most of the stations they also reported annual runoff exhibited significant deceasing trends over jhelum five stations and indus basin five stations ougahi et al 2022 found that the increases of the late spring april through june water yield were associated with increased annual precipitation and temperature suggesting a possibility to alter the seasonality of river flows in the indus river basin the increasing temperature and precipitation patterns and altering timing of snowfall and glacial melt leads to change in the seasonality of river flows however direct studies of seasonal changes in the regional hydrologic response over pakistan are limited this study aims to investigate past and future changes in streamflow timing in pakistan from daily streamflow records and simulated daily streamflow data to achieve it a river routing model lohmann et al 1998 is run forced by simulated runoff data from six regional climate models and bias corrections of minimum and seasonality is applied to simulated streamflow data our overarching questions are included 1 are regional hydroclimate projections reliable to investigate changes in the timing of seasonal streamflow 2 how much can bias corrections improve simulated daily streamflow 3 are the changes in streamflow timing detectable over the past 4 how are changes in streamflow timing sensitive to future climate scenarios the findings of this study will advance the current knowledge of seasonal hydrologic changes in pakistan and provide a direction for proactive climate change mitigation and preparedness plans for future hydroclimatic extremes such as droughts and floods 2 data and method 2 1 study region and data typically large river basins are heavily regulated by dams and reservoirs pakistan has two major multi purpose storage reservoirs mangla and tarbela fao 2022 tarbela and mangla are located along upper indus river and jhelum river respectively kabul and chenab rivers are regulated at and warsak reservoir located in the valley of peshawar and marala barrage respectively in this study the four gauge stations along upper indus kabul jhelum and chenab river basins are selected as the study basins based on the availability of long term greater than 30 years daily streamflow records indicating that these stream gages are located upstream of these reservoir control features fig 1 the gaging stations for the four river basins are located at various elevations ranging from 425 to 490 m the drainage areas of these four basins range between 168 350 indus and 32 282 chenab km2 specific information for the study river basins is provided in table 1 this study uses daily streamflow records at the four stations of the study river basins over 1962 2019 previously these daily streamflow data have been used by akhtar et al 2020 that retrieved the streamflow records through the global change impact studies center pakistan http www gcisc org pk in addition monthly near surface temperature nst and precipitation from the climate research unit cru high resolution gridded datasets harris et al 2020 http crudata uea ac uk cru data hrg were used to compute the regional monthly averages over the corresponding drainage area these regional monthly averages of nst and precipitation were averaged over january through june to investigate the associations between changes in climatic and hydrologic variables the catchment scale the noaa climate data record of northern hemisphere snow cover extent version 1 are used to compute weakly snow cover extent fraction of the indus river basin estilow et al 2015 simulated daily mean surface and base runoff from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment south asia cordex south asia regional climate model simulations are used to estimate the future changes in streamflow timing sanjay et al 2017 near surface temperature from the cordex south asia regional climate projections are used to compute changes in near surface temperature in the near and far future the 2050 2059 and 2090 2099 average respectively the cordex south asia regional climate model projections include the 25 km 0 25 degree resolution meteorological and land surface data from one ensemble member of historical and future simulations of six models canesm2 cnrm cm5 csiro mk3 6 0 gfdl esm2m ipsl cm6a lr and mri esm mr they provide the representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 future scenario simulations giorgi and gutowski 2015 the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenario runs are stabilized radiative forcing at 4 5 w m2 and 8 5 w m2 in the year 2100 previously the cordex south asia climate projections have been used to understand the future changes in hydroclimatology over the himalayan region particularly indian monsoon system choudhary and dimri 2018 raju et al 2015 hydroclimatic extremes suman and maity 2020 rai et al 2019 and water security dubey et al 2020 2 2 methods 2 2 1 simulated streamflow using a river routing model to simulate daily streamflow at four river basins in pakistan the variable infiltration capacity river routing model vic rrm lohmann et al 1998 was run forced by simulated daily total surface and base runoff data from six cordex south asia regional climate projections the vic rrm has been developed to resolve a linearized version of the saint venant equations lohmann et al 1996 the original gauge based and modified grid based versions of this model has been used and validated in many previous studies at various spatial scales nijssen et al 1997 sheffield et al 2013 yuan et al 2015 in this study the grid based streamflow routing model was used since it can be simulated at the large spatial scale that is consistent to the scale of the cordex regional climate projections the source code for the gridded version of vic rrm is available upon request to the corresponding author the vic rrm simulates daily streamflow via a simple linear transfer function assuming that total runoff surface base runoff at each grid cell herein 25 km by 25 km grid cells is transferred into at least one of the eight adjacent grid cells lohmann et al 1996 in addition the runoff transport process is assumed to be linear and time invariant lohmann et al 1998 and the causality and the impulse response functions between grid cells are nonnegative duband et al 1993 littlewood and jakeman 1994 based on the 25 km digital elevation model dem data first topography information including the slope stream order and flow direction were calculated and then water transport velocity the drainage area of this grid cell and the distance to next grid cell then daily streamflow at each grid cell was calculated using simulated daily runoff data from historical 1962 2005 and future 2006 2099 projections of the cordex south asia regional climate models 2 2 2 bias correction of minimum and seasonality bias correction methodologies are necessarily applied to simulated daily streamflow data due to the well known climate model bias for hydrologic studies kam et al 2018 bennett et al 2022 meresa et al 2022 in this study minimum bias correction is applied to simulated streamflow data instead of mean bias correction to minimize negative values during the low flow season simulated daily streamflow were subtracted by the minimum of simulated streamflow over 1962 2005 and then were multiplied by the ratios of the standard deviations of observed to simulated daily streamflow for the corresponding calendar year then they were added by the observed minimum streamflow value over 1962 2005 eq 1 it is worth noting that daily streamflow on the last day of february of lunar years was added to daily streamflow on the previous day to have the constant time step of each year t 1 365 1 q c o r r m i n j t q o b s m i n s t d q obs j s t d q sim j q sim j t q s i m m i n t where q c o r r m i n j t is minimum bias corrected simulated daily streamflow for a day t t 1 365 of the calendar year j j 1962 2005 qobs min and qsim min are the minimum values from observed and simulated streamflow respectively over 1962 2005 and std q obs j a n d s t d q sim j are the standard deviations of observed and simulated streamflow respectively for a calendar year j in this study a simple weighting bias correction by a ratio of observed to simulated standard deviations was used to resolve non stationarity of the hydrologic system particularly in the future kam et al 2018 instead of the quantile machanig bias correction that is based on the stationarity of the hydrologic system and is appropriate for reconstruction of streamflow data over the past after the minimum bias correction the annual total streamflow is computed by summing daily streamflow during a calendar year j eq 2 2 q c o r r m i n j t 1 365 q c o r r m i n j t next the cumulative percentages of minimum bias corrected daily streamflow for each calendar year were computed eq 3 3 δ j t 100 t 1 t q c o r r m i n j t q c o r r m i n j where δ j t is the cumulative percentage of daily streamflow on a day t of the calendar year j in this study daily seasonality bias δ t was defined as the long term 1962 2005 averages of the difference between daily cumulative percentages of observed and simulated daily streamflow eq 4 c in fig 2 4 δ t j 1962 2005 p obs j t p sim j t 44 where the p sim j t a n d p obs j t are the cumulative percentiles of raw simulated and observed daily streamflow on the tth day of the jth calendar year respectively we assumed that the model discrepancies herein seasonality bias with observational records are constant over time ho et al 2012 for example the errors in the relationship between the distribution of observed and simulated daily streamflow are the same in the past and future this assumption allows correction of future simulated streamflow to be obtained by adding the seasonality bias to the cumulative daily streamflow percentage after computing the seasonality bias the cumulative daily streamflow q cor r sea j t is disaggregated at the daily scale through eqns 5 6 5 q cor r sea j t δ j t δ t 100 q c o r r m i n j 6 q cor r j t q cor r sea j t i f t 1 q cor r sea j t q cor r sea j t 1 i f t 1 after the minimum and seasonality bias correction few negative values are found from the corrected simulated streamflow data these negative values are around 0 5 2 for all the basins during the overlapping period 1962 2005 and less than 1 for all the basins in the near and far future to compute the cvd values negative streamflow data are replaced with the seven day average values centering on the dates with a negative value 3 and 3 days 2 2 3 calculation of streamflow timing streamflow timing have been often measured by half flow dates as the dates on which half of the annual seasonal total streamflow has passed court 1962 hodgkins et al 2003 in this study half of cumulative daily streamflow h c s j and the center of volume dates c v d j for a calendar year j were computed using eqs 7 and 8 respectively fig 3 7 h c s j t k 365 q j t 2 8 c v d j m i n m i k m q j t hcs j 2 where m is the mth days of the calendar year j when the cumulative daily streamflow from the first day to the mth day exceeds hcs j first time within the calendar year j to evaluate the impact of bias correction on the performance two common goodness of fit metrices nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and kling gupta efficiency kge of bias corrected streamflow data were reported in section 3 1 nse is calculated as one minus the ratio of the error variance of the modelled time series to the variance of the observed time series eq 9 while a perfect model has one of nse a model that has the same prediction skills than the average of the mean observed values has zero of nse 9 n s e 1 j 1962 2005 t 1 365 q obs j t q corr j t j 1962 2005 t 1 365 q obs j t q obs j kge has been increasingly used for model calibration and evaluation eq 10 since it combines the three components of nse correlation variability bias and mean bias in a balanced way eq 10 knoben et al 2019 while a perfect model has one of kge a model that has the same prediction skills than the average of the mean observed values has 0 41 of kge 10 k g e 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 where r is the pearson correlation coefficient between observed and bias corrected streamflow β is the ratio of the long term averages of bias corrected streamflow to observed streamflow bias ratio and γ is the ratio of coefficients of variation of bias corrected streamflow to observed streamflow variability ratio 2 2 4 mann kendall test in this study the non parametric mann kendall mk test mann 1945 kendall 1975 lettenmaier et al 1994 was conducted to check the significance of the past trend of hydroclimate variables over the four study river basins in this study the trends were evaluated at the significant level α 0 05 and 0 1 for two tail test the mk test determines whether a time series of streamflow has a statistically significant monotonic trend of streamflow in this study the python module pymannkendal is used to compute mk statistics hussain and mahmud 2019 this package reports the sign of the trend increase decrease and statistical significance true false based on multiple statistics including p value z normalized test statistics tau kendall tau s mann kendall score and its variance slope sen estimator slope and an intercept of kendall robust line a more detailed description of the mk test is found in kumar et al 2009 the original mk test does not account for autocorrelation in the data when the significance of a monotonic trend is evaluated different versions of the mk test have been previously proposed to account for short and long term consistency these versions were applied to remove the autocorrelation structure kam and sheffield 2016 and long term persistency kumar et al 2009 in observed streamflow data in this study the results from the classical mk test are reported because we found that time series of cvds are serially independent not shown 3 results 3 1 evaluation of bias corrected streamflow fig 4 shows nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and kling gupta efficiency kge metrics of simulated and bias corrected streamflow data against observed streamflow data raw simulated streamflow data over all the four basins show negative nse values with different magnitudes indus 1st largest negative nse value jhelum 2nd kabul 3rd and chenab river basins 4th generally the goodness to fit metrics are significantly higher over all the four river basins after the minimum bias correction the impacts of seasonality bias correction after minimum bias correction are various across the metrics and study basins the nse shows significant improvement of the performance after seasonality bias corrections across the study basins the kge shows no significant improvement over indus and kabul river basins while jhelum river basin still show a significantly higher kge value after seasonality correction the results are consistent with those from the minimum bias correction after the seasonality bias correction implying that the order of the bias corrections has no impact on uncertainty reduction therefore the minimum bias correction is a key contribution of uncertainties reduction in simulated streamflow with a minor impact of the seasonality bias correction across the basins it also implies that a calibration strategy deign is carefully designed when simulated streamflow data from climate models are used for regional hydrologic studies and a robust goodness to fit assessment is required through multiple verification metrics 3 2 seasonality and past changes in hydroclimatology over pakistan fig 5 shows the seasonality of the regional averages of nst and precipitation over the drainage areas of the study river basins overall the nst shows a boreal seasonal cycle with a peak month in july the indus river basin has only four june through september months when the nst is above the freezing temperature of water 0 c other three river basins have seven kabul to nine months above 0 c this is because the corresponding drainage area to the indus river basin covers high elevation regions covering the hindukush karakorum and himalaya ranges fig 1 the seasonality of precipitation shows two peak wet seasons within the calendar year in early spring march and summer july and august these two peaks shows maximum value of precipitation during the two crop growing seasons of pakistan the rabi december april and kharif may november seasons the indus river basin has the lowest precipitation among the study river basins and shows a slightly higher peak of summertime july august precipitation than that of springtime february april precipitation the kabul river basin has the 2nd lowest precipitation with low summer precipitation indicating a weak impact of indian monsoon due to the tropospheric anomalous high over the western central asia saeed et al 2011 jhelum and chenab river basins have a common seasonality of precipitation with a much higher peak in july and august when indian monsoon is active the sign of observed trends in hcss were negative but insignificant for all four river basins table 2 bias corrected streamflow data show consistency with half volumes from observational records for the four river basins that is the observed half volumes are placed between the minimum and maximum of half volumes from six cordex models over most of 1962 2005 fig 6 over the indus river basin observed half volumes are near or at the maximum of simulated half volumes and show higher half volumes in 1960s than the maximum of simulated half volumes that is simulated half volumes are inconsistent with observed half volumes over the kabul and chenab river basins observed half volumes are near or at the minimum of simulated half volumes and higher half volumes for the four study river basins observed cvds are generally between late april through early june 100th through 180th day of the calendar year and show a decreasing trend over 1962 2019 fig 7 bias corrected streamflow data show consistency with observed cvds for the four river basins over 1962 2005 observed cvds are close to the minimum of bias corrected cvds from the six cordex models for jhelum river basin while observed cvds are close to the average of the six cordex models for the rest of the three study river basins over 1962 2019 observed cvd values have become earlier by about 5 9 1 12 6 and 12 5 days for indus kabul jhelum and chenab river basins respectively indicating an earlier onset of the spring season in the recent decades the relationship of observed cvds with the monthly minimum near surface temperature in march may are examined over indus chenab and jhelum river basins kabul river basin when their negative correlation is strongest not shown the results show that the nst has increased over 1962 2019 by about 2 0 c across the study basins implying that the decreasing trend of cvd can be related to early melting of snow cover and glaciers over land due to the increased minimum nst however it requires further studies about precipitation snow cover nst interactions 3 3 outlook of changes in cvd fig 8 shows the future changes in cvds for near and far future the averages over 2050 2059 and 2090 2099 respectively the cvds from corrected streamflow data shows that cvds become earlier over all the four study basins in the future with spatial differences in the magnitude of the cvd changes overall the four study river basins show earlier cvds ranging from 8 to 13 days and 11 to 15 days in 2050s and 2090s respectively under the rcp4 5 scenario the indus and chenab river basins show earlier cvds by 22 and 16 days respectively in 2050s of the rcp8 5 scenario while the kabul and jhelum river basins show earlier cvds by 10 days in 2090s of the rcp8 5 scenario the indus and chenab river basins show earlier cvds by 37 and 32 days respectively and the kabul and jhelum river basins show earlier cvds by 15 and 24 days respectively from the future cordex south asia climate projections the future changes in near surface temperatures nst are further examined as a potential cause of the future cvd changes for the study river basins fig 9 there is a general tendency of nst that near surface is warmer by above 2 c and 5 c in the near and far future respectively across the study river basins the results indicate that the hydrologic response to a similar magnitude of near surface warming varies depending on regional climate and the geographical characteristics of the catchment on interest 4 discussion according to the bias corrected cordex climate projections observed decreasing trends of the cvd will likely continue this study found spatial variations of the magnitude of cvd changes across the study river basins given a similar magnitude of near surface warming in the future different hydrologic responses can be related to regional precipitation seasonality and geographical characteristics including location elevation land cover and slope for example mountainous regions have snowfall which are stored in a form of snowpack during the winter months in the early spring months snowpacks are melted during the spring months when the surface temperature is above the freezing temperature the geographical characteristics e g slope aspect will strengthen or weaken the change of surface warming on the rate of snow melting processes which can lead to diversity in the seasonal changes in streamflow timing over mountainous areas like our study basins kapnick et al 2014 kang et al 2016 kam et al 2018 gordon et al 2022 except for kabul river basin an arid semi arid region if precipitation shows no significant trend changes in the seasonality of streamflow is strongly correlated with changes in the speed of snow melting over snow dominant regions like the upper indus river e g change in the fraction of snow cover areas fig 10 however current regional and global climate models have a poor representation of snow melting processes due to the coarse resolution of the models and missing the detailed physics for snow melting processes in the coarse resolution models therefore higher resolution models that include detailed snow melting processes is required for reliable regional hydrologic projections du et al 2022 meresa et al 2022 similar results were also found by ougahi et al 2022 using a semi distributed hydrologic model soil and water assessment tool they found that the climate change has implications for the water resources by a combination of changes in temperature and precipitation patterns resulting in seasonal changes of river flows these changes will affect the crop productivity over pakistan a recent study dahri et al 2021 on climate and hydrologic regimes of high altitude indus basin found that the mean air temperature is projected to increase further between 0 8 and 5 7 c by the end of 21st century the inflow of indus tarbela is likely to increase compared to kabul jhelum and chenab river inflows furthermore a substantial increase in the magnitude of peak flows and one month earlier attainment is also projected for all river gauges however this study found a non significant trend of the mean precipitation for january through june and the 1st half volume since 1962 which need a further investigation for an emergence time of the trends in hydroclimatic variables during winters and springs over the study regions global climate change affects the regional climate and hydrologic systems differently this study was focused on past and future seasonal changes over pakistan as a regional hydrologic response of the high mountainous region to global climate change this study found a significant change of streamflow timing over pakistan during the late winter and early spring which can affect crop yield with the current planting and cultivating schedules the proposed methods are applicable to other high mountainous asian countries where the long term daily streamflow data is available recently the reanalysis products such as ecmwf reanalysis version 5 era5 hersbach et al 2020 provide global long term hydrologic variables leading to research opportunities to explore the past seasonal change of hydrologic systems around the world bain et al 2022 new global datasets are available to extend the proposed bias correction methods to evaluate changes in streamflow timing in mountainous regions including the himalayas andes and other mountainous regions where are susceptible to climate change mishra 2015 immerzeel et al 2020 in addition a new phase of the cordex project gutowski jr et al 2016 provides the relatively high resolution hydroclimatic projection which also enable us to explore the climate change impact on regional hydrologic response via the proposed methods in this study the findings of this study were based on the upstream gauge stations to avoid human disturbance the current water engineered systems in the downstream regions can mitigate the impact of climate change but understanding of to what extent they can mitigate remain unknown this study suggests the need to further investigate the capacity of the current water engineered systems in the downstream regions for climate change adaption and mitigation this study also alerts other high mountain asian countries of the need to investigate the need to upgrade water engineer systems and water resources management planning 5 conclusions this study highlights the diverse hydrologic responses in pakistan to 2 6 c near surface warming which can cause changes in the risk of climatic extremes such as droughts and floods this study informs a need for proactive climate adaptation planning to meet the regional and national forthcoming needs and basin based strategies for sustainability of water resources systems in pakistan to mitigate efficiently the impact of climate change in pakistan further studies for actual causes of the decrease in the cvds and their impacts on the risk of climatic extremes in the following summer months are warranted furthermore the two crop growing seasons of pakistan rabi agriculture crops sown in winter and harvested in the spring and kharif domesticated plants cultivated and harvested during the rainy season will be altered due to this change in the cvd and half volume values in future during the kharif season streamflow is dominated by snowmelt based flows in early spring and monsoon rainfall in summer while precipitation is mostly in the form of snowfall and the baseflow is from groundwater during the rabi season as the streamflow cresting is shifting earlier the definitions of these seasons will likely change this study suggests the need to update of the current crop planning schedule for climate

2360,pakistan has experienced seasonal changes of streamflow causing a lack of available water resources for agriculture however understanding of future seasonal changes of streamflow over pakistan remains limited this study assessed the past and future changes in streamflow timing along the four major rivers of pakistan upper indus kabul jhelum and chenab river basins using observational data and bias corrected hydrological projections firstly the vic river routing model was simulated forced by simulated daily surface and base runoff data from six cordex south asia regional climate models 1962 2099 secondly the minimum and seasonality bias in simulated daily streamflow data were corrected based on observational records to quantify seasonal changes of the hydrologic regime half of annual cumulative streamflows hcss and center of volume dates cvds were computed from observed and bias corrected simulated streamflow data over 1962 2019 observational records showed a significant decreasing trend in cvd that is an earlier onset of the wet season by a range between 4 5 and 12 6 days across the three river basins except for chenab river basin bias corrected hydrologic projections showed decreased cvd across the four study river basins by 4 2 to 6 3 days during the record period 1962 2019 the decreased cvds ranges from 5 to 20 days in the near future the 2050 2059 average and 11 days to 37 days in the far future the 2090 2099 average this study reported diverse hydrologic responses to a similar magnitude of near surface temperature in pakistan highlighting a

important water resources for agricultural use agricultural industrial and domestic in pakistan and the northwestern india the uir basin includes chenab jhelum ravi sutlej and beas river basins from the highland areas the kabul river is a reach of the uir at the tarbela dam reservoir in pakistan available water resources along these rivers are crucial to support the irrigated agriculture system over the downstream regions that feeds over 200 million people in pakistan the agriculture sector in pakistan contributes to 23 of the gdp and accounts for 43 percent of the country s labor force usman 2016 due to strong variability of the regional hydroclimate system in pakistan regional communities are vulnerable to hydroclimatic extremes such as drought and flood in 2010 heavy monsoon rains over pakistan caused flood inundation over 20 of the country and inflicted over us 16 billion in economic loss rehman et al 2016 in 2018 the southern part of pakistan had persistent precipitation deficits during monsoon season causing a severe drought adnan and ullah 2020 therefore it is crucial to understand variability and trend of the regional hydroclimate system and the future changes of water availability in pakistan bukhari et al 2020 pakistan is a predominantly agricultural country with the abundant arable land lying within the indus river basin there are two agriculture seasons in pakistan named kharif and rabi the kharif season refers to summer growing months may to november with the major crops cultivated being rice corn and cotton crop productivity largely depends upon the amount and distribution of rain associated with the monsoon activities during the kharif season ahmed et al 2019 the rabi season refers to winter growing months december through april of the following calendar year with the major crops being wheat barley and millet pakistan 2009 the planting window differs regionally depending on available water supply regional climate and cultivated crop type the major limitation to production is generally the timing and availability of the irrigation water supply and the efficiency of water on farm due to missing irrigation systems major crop productivity in the upstream regions of pakistan is affected by climate variability most of this water supply in the uir basin comes from remote glaciers of the himalayan and karakorum mountain ranges while the remainder comes from seasonal rainfall especially during the monsoon season from july to september siddiqui et al 2012 found that major crops of pakistan are vulnerable to increased surface temperature which can cause destructive agricultural losses several studies have reported hydroclimatic changes over south asia including pakistan shahid and rahman 2021 found a significant increasing trend of near surface temperature during springs and summers over the indus basin and a significant decreasing trend of springtime precipitation over 1985 2015 raising a concern of a possible change in the drought risk mazhar et al 2016 reported a decline in summertime precipitation in the himalayas over 1866 2006 archer 2003 found increased wintertime precipitation over gauge stations of the uir basin since 1960 kehrwald et al 2008 found a rapid retreat of glaciers in the himalayas resulting in increased springtime freshwater resources in the downstream regions according to climate projections the indus and brahmaputra river basins would experience decreased streamflow in the future immerzeel et al 2010 khan et al 2020 found that warmer surface temperature would increase mean annual flow in the future ranging from 10 to 30 under the future scenarios for the mid 21st century 2041 2070 spring and winter flows significantly can cause an increased risk of future flood hazards for the uir basin archer et al 2010 found that there is no evidence of significant reduction in available water resources over the uir basin due to climate change however socio economic changes would threaten the sustainability of available water resources in the uir basin based on the findings of previous studies the impact of surface warming driven changes in streamflow and available water resources on seasonal changes of the hydrologic regime in pakistan remains uncertain over mountainous regions the onset of a snow melting season mainly determines the timing of spring onset and crop planting snow and ice melting processes are sensitive to changes in near surface temperatures for example warmer near surface temperatures in late winter and early spring accelerates snow and ice melting processes causing seasonal changes in soil moistures such as an early onset of spring cayan et al 2001 kam et al 2022 evan and eisenman 2021 a wet soil moisture condition in early spring is favorable for floods and a dry soil moisture condition in the following season is favorable for wildfires and heatwaves kim et al 2020 in addition a previous study huss and hock 2018 found that streamflow volumes would increase as glaciers melt due to climate change but that they would reach a peak water phase when streamflow volumes would begin to recess as glaciers run out of mass qin et al 2020 found that climate change has altered the regional water balance due to changes in the fraction of precipitation falling as snow and the timing of snowmelt over the himalayas andes and other mountainous regions eventually these seasonal hydrologic changes can increase the risk of springtime floods and summertime droughts kam et al 2018 causing the crop failure over snow dominant regions where is more vulnerable to food security seasonal hydrologic changes have been studied mainly over the north american and european regions due to the availability of long term records of daily streamflow over the western u s region observational data showed an earlier spring onset schwartz and reiter 2000 menzel and fabian 1999 cayan et al 2001 barnett et al 2005 dudley et al 2017 wasko et al 2020 a recent study assessed the linkage of wildfire driven evapotranspiration shift to streamflow timing collar et al 2022 over the european region the earlier spring onset caused such seasonal changes such as leaf unfolding have advanced by six days whereas autumn events such as leaf coloring have been delayed by about five days menzel and fabian 1999 and thus extension of the growing season liu et al 2018 according to coupled model intercomparison phase 5 cmip5 models the u s region showed geographical variation of trends in winter spring streamflow timing with a weaker indication of detectable anthropogenic contributions towards the earlier streamflow timing in the western u s region they reported a high sensitivity of wsct trends over the western part of north america to the record length and climate model bias in high mountain asia the sensitivity of hydrologic responses e g glacier mass changes to surface warming are spatially heterogeneous kapnick et al 2014 sakai and fujita 2017 understanding of hydrologic response particularly in streamflow timing to surface warming in high mountain asia remain limited sharif et al 2013 springtime streamflow of the uir originates mainly form glacial ice and snowpack in hindukush himalaya and the karakorum one of the largest mountainous regions that contain the world largest hoard of snow and ice masses except for the polar regions soncini et al 2015 while the remainder comes from seasonal rainfall during monsoon season july to september dahri et al 2021 found that the median annual air temperature for the indus basin is projected to be increased with a range between 0 8 and 5 7 c by the end of the 21st century this near surface warming trend would result in an increase in the maximum rate of discharge during the wet season in indus kabul jhelum and chenab rivers suggesting a need of critical modification in the strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of future floods and droughts conditions archer 2003 found that summertime streamflow volumes are governed by melt of glaciers and permanent snow thermal control in current summer melt of seasonal snow controlled by preceding winter and spring precipitation and winter and monsoon rainfall hasson 2016 found that the median warming of 1 c or more than 1 5 c projects the drying of the monsoon july september and the shift of snowpack accumulation melt season march june recent climate change studies over pakistan have been focused on changes in climatic and hydrologic variables yaseen et al 2020 studied the variability of the hydrometeorological time series over uir they found a warming trend of low altitude stations and an increase in the streamflow was also detected during winter and spring seasons at all hydrological stations while the annual precipitation showed significant decreasing trend for most of the stations they also reported annual runoff exhibited significant deceasing trends over jhelum five stations and indus basin five stations ougahi et al 2022 found that the increases of the late spring april through june water yield were associated with increased annual precipitation and temperature suggesting a possibility to alter the seasonality of river flows in the indus river basin the increasing temperature and precipitation patterns and altering timing of snowfall and glacial melt leads to change in the seasonality of river flows however direct studies of seasonal changes in the regional hydrologic response over pakistan are limited this study aims to investigate past and future changes in streamflow timing in pakistan from daily streamflow records and simulated daily streamflow data to achieve it a river routing model lohmann et al 1998 is run forced by simulated runoff data from six regional climate models and bias corrections of minimum and seasonality is applied to simulated streamflow data our overarching questions are included 1 are regional hydroclimate projections reliable to investigate changes in the timing of seasonal streamflow 2 how much can bias corrections improve simulated daily streamflow 3 are the changes in streamflow timing detectable over the past 4 how are changes in streamflow timing sensitive to future climate scenarios the findings of this study will advance the current knowledge of seasonal hydrologic changes in pakistan and provide a direction for proactive climate change mitigation and preparedness plans for future hydroclimatic extremes such as droughts and floods 2 data and method 2 1 study region and data typically large river basins are heavily regulated by dams and reservoirs pakistan has two major multi purpose storage reservoirs mangla and tarbela fao 2022 tarbela and mangla are located along upper indus river and jhelum river respectively kabul and chenab rivers are regulated at and warsak reservoir located in the valley of peshawar and marala barrage respectively in this study the four gauge stations along upper indus kabul jhelum and chenab river basins are selected as the study basins based on the availability of long term greater than 30 years daily streamflow records indicating that these stream gages are located upstream of these reservoir control features fig 1 the gaging stations for the four river basins are located at various elevations ranging from 425 to 490 m the drainage areas of these four basins range between 168 350 indus and 32 282 chenab km2 specific information for the study river basins is provided in table 1 this study uses daily streamflow records at the four stations of the study river basins over 1962 2019 previously these daily streamflow data have been used by akhtar et al 2020 that retrieved the streamflow records through the global change impact studies center pakistan http www gcisc org pk in addition monthly near surface temperature nst and precipitation from the climate research unit cru high resolution gridded datasets harris et al 2020 http crudata uea ac uk cru data hrg were used to compute the regional monthly averages over the corresponding drainage area these regional monthly averages of nst and precipitation were averaged over january through june to investigate the associations between changes in climatic and hydrologic variables the catchment scale the noaa climate data record of northern hemisphere snow cover extent version 1 are used to compute weakly snow cover extent fraction of the indus river basin estilow et al 2015 simulated daily mean surface and base runoff from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment south asia cordex south asia regional climate model simulations are used to estimate the future changes in streamflow timing sanjay et al 2017 near surface temperature from the cordex south asia regional climate projections are used to compute changes in near surface temperature in the near and far future the 2050 2059 and 2090 2099 average respectively the cordex south asia regional climate model projections include the 25 km 0 25 degree resolution meteorological and land surface data from one ensemble member of historical and future simulations of six models canesm2 cnrm cm5 csiro mk3 6 0

runs are stabilized radiative forcing at 4 5 w m2 and 8 5 w m2 in the year 2100 previously the cordex south asia climate projections have been used to understand the future changes in hydroclimatology over the himalayan region particularly indian monsoon system choudhary and dimri 2018 raju et al 2015 hydroclimatic extremes suman and maity 2020 rai et al 2019 and water security dubey et al 2020 2 2 methods 2 2 1 simulated streamflow using a river routing model to simulate daily streamflow at four river basins in pakistan the variable infiltration capacity river routing model vic rrm lohmann et al 1998 was run forced by simulated daily total surface and base runoff data from six cordex south asia regional climate projections the vic rrm has been developed to resolve a linearized version of the saint venant equations lohmann et al 1996 the original gauge based and modified grid based versions of this model has been used and validated in many previous studies at various spatial scales nijssen et al 1997 sheffield et al 2013 yuan et al 2015 in this study the grid based streamflow routing model was used since it can be simulated at the large spatial scale that is consistent to the scale of the cordex regional climate projections the source code for the gridded version of vic rrm is available upon request to the corresponding author the vic rrm simulates daily streamflow via a simple linear transfer function assuming that total runoff surface base runoff at each grid cell herein 25 km by 25 km grid cells is transferred into at least one of the eight adjacent grid cells lohmann et al 1996 in addition the runoff transport process is assumed to be linear and time invariant lohmann et al 1998 and the causality and the impulse response functions between grid cells are nonnegative duband et al 1993 littlewood and jakeman 1994 based on the 25 km digital elevation model dem data first topography information including the slope stream order and flow direction were calculated and then water transport velocity the drainage area of this grid cell and the distance to next grid cell then daily streamflow at each grid cell was calculated using simulated daily runoff data from historical 1962 2005 and future 2006 2099 projections of the cordex south asia regional climate models 2 2 2 bias correction of minimum and seasonality bias correction methodologies are necessarily applied to simulated daily streamflow data due to the well known climate model bias for hydrologic studies kam et al 2018 bennett et al 2022 meresa et al 2022 in this study minimum bias correction is applied to simulated streamflow data instead of mean bias correction to minimize negative values during the low flow season simulated daily streamflow were subtracted by the minimum of simulated streamflow over 1962 2005 and then were multiplied by the ratios of the standard deviations of observed to simulated daily streamflow for the corresponding calendar year then they were added by the observed minimum streamflow value over 1962 2005 eq 1 it is worth noting that daily streamflow on the last day of february of lunar years was added to daily streamflow on the previous day to have the constant time step of each year t 1 365 1 q c o r r m i n j t q o b s m i n s t d q obs j s t d q sim j q sim j t q s i m m i n t where q c o r r m i n j t is minimum bias corrected simulated daily streamflow for a day t t 1 365 of the calendar year j j 1962 2005 qobs min and qsim min are the minimum values from observed and simulated streamflow respectively over 1962 2005 and std q obs j a n d s t d q sim j are the standard deviations of observed and simulated streamflow respectively for a calendar year j in this study a simple weighting bias correction by a ratio of observed to simulated standard deviations was used to resolve non stationarity of the hydrologic system particularly in the future kam et al 2018 instead of the quantile machanig bias correction that is based on the stationarity of the hydrologic system and is appropriate for reconstruction of streamflow data over the past after the minimum bias correction the annual total streamflow is computed by summing daily streamflow during a calendar year j eq 2 2 q c o r r m i n j t 1 365 q c o r r m i n j t next the cumulative percentages of minimum bias corrected daily streamflow for each calendar year were computed eq 3 3 δ j t 100 t 1 t q c o r r m i n j t q c o r r m i n j where δ j t is the cumulative percentage of daily streamflow on a day t of the calendar year j in this study daily seasonality bias δ t was defined as the long term 1962 2005 averages of the difference between daily cumulative percentages of observed and simulated daily streamflow eq 4 c in fig 2 4 δ t j 1962 2005 p obs j t p sim j t 44 where the p sim j t a n d p obs j t are the cumulative percentiles of raw simulated and observed daily streamflow on the tth day of the jth calendar year respectively we assumed that the model discrepancies herein seasonality bias with observational records are constant over time ho et al 2012 for example the errors in the relationship between the distribution of observed and simulated daily streamflow are the same in the past and future this assumption allows correction of future simulated streamflow to be obtained by adding the seasonality bias to the cumulative daily streamflow percentage after computing the seasonality bias the cumulative daily streamflow q cor r sea j t is disaggregated at the daily scale through eqns 5 6 5 q cor r sea j t δ j t δ t 100 q c o r r m i n j 6 q cor r j t q cor r sea j t i f t 1 q cor r sea j t q cor r sea j t 1 i f t 1 after the minimum and seasonality bias correction few negative values are found from the corrected simulated streamflow data these negative values are around 0 5 2 for all the basins during the overlapping period 1962 2005 and less than 1 for all the basins in the near and far future to compute the cvd values negative streamflow data are replaced with the seven day average values centering on the dates with a negative value 3 and 3 days 2 2 3 calculation of streamflow timing streamflow timing have been often measured by half flow dates as the dates on which half of the annual seasonal total streamflow has passed court 1962 hodgkins et al 2003 in this study half of cumulative daily streamflow h c s j and the center of volume dates c v d j for a calendar year j were computed using eqs 7 and 8 respectively fig 3 7 h c s j t k 365 q j t 2 8 c v d j m i n m i k m q j t hcs j 2 where m is the mth days of the calendar year j when the cumulative daily streamflow from the first day to the mth day exceeds hcs j first time within the calendar year j to evaluate the impact of bias correction on the performance two common goodness of fit metrices nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and kling gupta efficiency kge of bias corrected streamflow data were reported in section 3 1 nse is calculated as one minus the ratio of the error variance of the modelled time series to the variance of the observed time series eq 9 while a perfect model has one of nse a model that has the same prediction skills than the average of the mean observed values has zero of nse 9 n s e 1 j 1962 2005 t 1 365 q obs j t q corr j t j 1962 2005 t 1 365 q obs j t q obs j kge has been increasingly used for model calibration and evaluation eq 10 since it combines the three components of nse correlation variability bias and mean bias in a balanced way eq 10 knoben et al 2019 while a perfect model has one of kge a model that has the same prediction skills than the average of the mean observed values has 0 41 of kge 10 k g e 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 where r is the pearson correlation coefficient between observed and bias corrected streamflow β is the ratio of the long term averages of bias corrected streamflow to observed streamflow bias ratio and γ is the ratio of coefficients of variation of bias corrected streamflow to observed streamflow variability ratio 2 2 4 mann kendall test in this study the non parametric mann kendall mk test mann 1945 kendall 1975 lettenmaier et al 1994 was conducted to check the significance of the past trend of hydroclimate variables over the four study river basins in this study the trends were evaluated at the significant level α 0 05 and 0 1 for two tail test the mk test determines whether a time series of streamflow has a statistically significant monotonic trend of streamflow in this study the python module pymannkendal is used to compute mk statistics hussain and mahmud 2019 this package reports the sign of the trend increase decrease and statistical significance true false based on multiple statistics including p value z normalized test statistics tau kendall tau s mann kendall score and its variance slope sen estimator slope and an intercept of kendall robust line a more detailed description of the mk test is found in kumar et al 2009 the original mk test does not account for autocorrelation in the data when the significance of a monotonic trend is evaluated different versions of the mk test have been previously proposed to account for short and long term consistency these versions were applied to remove the autocorrelation structure kam and sheffield 2016 and long term persistency kumar et al 2009 in observed streamflow data in this study the results from the classical mk test are reported because we found that time series of cvds are serially independent not shown 3 results 3 1 evaluation of bias corrected streamflow fig 4 shows nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and kling gupta efficiency kge metrics of simulated and bias corrected streamflow data against observed streamflow data raw simulated streamflow data over all the four basins show negative nse values with different magnitudes indus 1st largest negative nse value jhelum 2nd kabul 3rd and chenab river basins 4th generally the goodness to fit metrics are significantly higher over all the four river basins after the minimum bias correction the impacts of seasonality bias correction after minimum bias correction are various across the metrics and study basins the nse shows significant improvement of the performance after seasonality bias corrections across the study basins the kge shows no significant improvement over indus and kabul river basins while jhelum river basin still show a significantly higher kge value after seasonality correction the results are consistent with those from the minimum bias correction after the seasonality bias correction implying that the order of the bias corrections has no impact on uncertainty reduction therefore the minimum bias correction is a key contribution of uncertainties reduction in simulated streamflow with a minor impact of the seasonality bias correction across the basins it also implies that a calibration strategy deign is carefully designed when simulated streamflow data from climate models are used for regional hydrologic studies and a robust goodness to fit assessment is required through multiple verification metrics 3 2 seasonality and past changes in hydroclimatology over pakistan fig 5 shows the seasonality of the regional averages of nst and precipitation over the drainage areas of the study river basins overall the nst shows a boreal seasonal cycle with a peak month in july the indus river basin has only four june through september months when the nst is above the freezing temperature of water 0 c other three river basins have seven kabul to nine months above 0 c this is because the corresponding drainage area to the indus river basin covers high elevation regions covering the hindukush karakorum and himalaya ranges fig 1 the seasonality of precipitation shows two peak wet seasons within the calendar year in early spring march and summer july and august these two peaks shows maximum value of precipitation during the two crop growing seasons of pakistan the rabi december april and kharif may november seasons the indus river basin has the lowest precipitation among the study river basins and shows a slightly higher peak of summertime july august precipitation than that of springtime february april precipitation the kabul river basin has the 2nd lowest precipitation with low summer precipitation indicating a weak impact of indian monsoon due to the tropospheric anomalous high over the western central asia saeed et al 2011 jhelum and chenab river basins have a common seasonality of precipitation with a much higher peak in july and august when indian monsoon is active the sign of observed trends in hcss were negative but insignificant for all four river basins table 2 bias corrected streamflow data show consistency with half volumes from observational records for the four river basins that is the observed half volumes are placed between the minimum and maximum of half volumes from six cordex models over most of 1962 2005 fig 6 over the indus river basin observed half volumes are near or at the maximum of simulated half volumes and show higher half volumes in 1960s than the maximum of simulated half volumes that is simulated half volumes are inconsistent with observed half volumes over the kabul and chenab river basins observed half volumes are near or at the minimum of simulated half volumes and higher half volumes for the four study river basins observed cvds are generally between late april through early june 100th through 180th day of the calendar year and show a decreasing trend over 1962 2019 fig 7 bias corrected streamflow data show consistency with observed cvds for the four river basins over 1962 2005 observed cvds are close to the minimum of bias corrected cvds from the six cordex models for jhelum river basin while observed cvds are close to the average of the six cordex models for the rest of the three study river basins over 1962 2019 observed cvd values have become earlier by about 5 9 1 12 6 and 12 5 days for indus kabul jhelum and chenab river basins respectively indicating an earlier onset of the spring season in the recent decades the relationship of observed cvds with the monthly minimum near surface temperature in march may are examined over indus chenab and jhelum river basins kabul river basin when their negative correlation is strongest not shown the results show that the nst has increased over 1962 2019 by about 2 0 c across the study basins implying that the decreasing trend of cvd can be related to early melting of snow cover and glaciers over land due to the increased minimum nst however it requires further studies about precipitation snow cover nst interactions 3 3 outlook of changes in cvd fig 8 shows the future changes in cvds for near and far future the averages over 2050 2059 and 2090 2099 respectively the cvds from corrected streamflow data shows that cvds become earlier over all the four study basins in the future with spatial differences in the magnitude of the cvd changes overall the four study river basins show earlier cvds ranging from 8 to 13 days and 11 to 15 days in 2050s and 2090s respectively under the rcp4 5 scenario the indus and chenab river basins show earlier cvds by 22 and 16 days respectively in 2050s of the rcp8 5 scenario while the kabul and jhelum river basins show earlier cvds by 10 days in 2090s of the rcp8 5 scenario the indus and chenab river basins show earlier cvds by 37 and 32 days respectively and the kabul and jhelum river basins show earlier cvds by 15 and 24 days respectively from the future cordex south asia climate projections the future changes in near surface temperatures nst are further examined as a potential cause of the future cvd changes for the study river basins fig 9 there is a general tendency of nst that near surface is warmer by above 2 c and 5 c in the near and far future respectively across the study river basins the results indicate that the hydrologic response to a similar magnitude of near surface warming varies depending on regional climate and the geographical characteristics of the catchment on interest 4 discussion according to the bias corrected cordex climate projections observed decreasing trends of the cvd will likely continue this study found spatial variations of the magnitude of cvd changes across the study river basins given a similar magnitude of near surface warming in the future different hydrologic responses can be related to regional precipitation seasonality and geographical characteristics including location elevation land cover and slope for example mountainous regions have snowfall which are stored in a form of snowpack during the winter months in the early spring months snowpacks are melted during the spring months when the surface temperature is above the freezing temperature the geographical characteristics e g slope aspect will strengthen or weaken the change of surface warming on the rate of snow melting processes which can lead to diversity in the seasonal changes in streamflow timing over mountainous areas like our study basins kapnick et al 2014 kang et al 2016 kam et al 2018 gordon et al 2022 except for kabul river basin an arid semi arid region if precipitation shows no significant trend changes in the seasonality of streamflow is strongly correlated with changes in the speed of snow melting over snow dominant regions like the upper indus river e g change in the fraction of snow cover areas fig 10 however current regional and global climate models have a poor representation of snow melting processes due to the coarse resolution of the models and missing the detailed physics for snow melting processes in the coarse resolution models therefore higher resolution models that include detailed snow melting processes is required for reliable regional hydrologic projections du et al 2022 meresa et al 2022 similar results were also found by ougahi et al 2022 using a semi distributed hydrologic model soil and water assessment tool they found that the climate change has implications for the water resources by a combination of changes in temperature and precipitation patterns resulting in seasonal changes of river flows these changes will affect the crop productivity over pakistan a recent study dahri et al 2021 on climate and hydrologic regimes of high altitude indus basin found that the mean air temperature is projected to increase further between 0 8 and 5 7 c by the end of 21st century the inflow of indus tarbela is likely to increase compared to kabul jhelum and chenab river inflows furthermore a substantial increase in the magnitude of peak flows and one month earlier attainment is also projected for all river gauges however this study found a non significant trend of the mean precipitation for january through june and the 1st half volume since 1962 which need a further investigation for an emergence time of the trends in hydroclimatic variables during winters and springs over the study regions global climate change affects the regional climate and hydrologic systems differently this study was focused on past and future seasonal changes over pakistan as a regional hydrologic response of the high mountainous region to global climate change this study found a significant change of streamflow timing over pakistan during the late winter and early spring which can affect crop yield with the current planting and cultivating schedules the proposed methods are applicable to other high mountainous asian countries where the long term daily streamflow data is available recently the reanalysis products such as ecmwf reanalysis version 5 era5 hersbach et al 2020 provide global long term hydrologic variables leading to research opportunities to explore the past seasonal change of hydrologic systems around the world bain et al 2022 new global datasets are available to extend the proposed bias correction methods to evaluate changes in streamflow timing in mountainous regions including the himalayas andes and other mountainous regions where are susceptible to climate change mishra 2015 immerzeel et al 2020 in addition a new phase of the cordex project gutowski jr et al 2016 provides the relatively high resolution hydroclimatic projection which also enable us to explore the climate change impact on regional hydrologic response via the proposed methods in this study the findings of this study were based on the upstream gauge stations to avoid human disturbance the current water engineered systems in the downstream regions can mitigate the impact of climate change but understanding of to what extent they can mitigate remain unknown this study suggests the need to further investigate the capacity of the current water engineered systems in the downstream regions for climate change adaption and mitigation this study also alerts other high mountain asian countries of the need to investigate the need to upgrade water engineer systems and water resources management planning 5 conclusions this study highlights the diverse hydrologic responses in pakistan to 2 6 c near surface warming which can cause changes in the risk of climatic extremes such as droughts and floods this study informs a need for proactive climate adaptation planning to meet the regional and national forthcoming needs and basin based strategies for sustainability of water resources systems in pakistan to mitigate efficiently the impact of climate change in pakistan further studies for actual causes of the decrease in the cvds and their impacts on the risk of climatic extremes in the following summer months are warranted furthermore the two crop growing seasons of pakistan rabi agriculture crops sown in winter and harvested in the spring and kharif domesticated plants cultivated and harvested during the rainy season will be altered due to this change in the cvd and half volume values in future during the kharif season streamflow is dominated by snowmelt based flows in early spring and monsoon rainfall in summer while precipitation is mostly in the form of snowfall and the baseflow is from groundwater during the rabi season as the streamflow cresting is shifting earlier the definitions of these seasons will likely change this study suggests the need to update of the current crop planning schedule for climate

2361,decision makers in urban water systems have long searched for robust runoff management alternatives that can resist deviations from the performance for which they were designed in this study with the development of a new comprehensive framework consisting of many objective robust decision making mordm and storm water management model swmm robust alternatives for the implementation of low impact development lid practices are presented under future climate change the proposed methodology has been applied to district 10 of the tehran municipality located in the central part of tehran iran in the first step the performances of general circulation models gcms in predicting rainfall in the base period 1986 2005 were compared and mpi esm lr was selected as the best model for predicting rainfall in the future period 2021 2040 in the next step by developing the swmm hydrological model runoff quality and quantity were simulated under rcp8 5 and rcp2 6 by coupling swmm with the nsga ii multi objective evolutionary algorithm and specifying objective functions the most optimal lids implementation scenarios were produced then well characterized uncertainties were changed into deep uncertainties and the robustness of each design alternative was quantified using two robustness assessment methods finally system vulnerabilities were discovered using the patient rule induction method prim and classification and regression tree cart this study showed that scenarios with a higher percentage of lids are more robust against deep uncertainties using different rcp scenarios also revealed that methodological selection of future climate scenarios can affect the robustness of candidate alternatives implementing swmm mordm enables decision makers to effectively generate runoff management scenarios and visually evaluate their robustness against deep uncertainties keywords climate change robustness deep uncertainty low impact development decision making data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction population growth urbanization and climate change have caused many changes in the urban environment that can adversely affect runoff quality and quantity in light of rising water demand and scarcity surface runoff can be collected and utilized for different water uses after being partially purified jia et al 2014 low impact development lid by using tools with the least environmental impacts is an effective step in sustainable development pirouz et al 2019 reducing the effects of climate change zahmatkesh et al 2015 ghodsi et al 2020 and minimizing the impact of urbanization on impermeable surfaces eckart et al 2018 taghizadeh et al 2021 many studies have been conducted in recent decades to evaluate the efficacy of lids for urban runoff management van roon 2007 martin mikle et al 2015 wang et al 2018 behroozi et al 2018 kourtis et al 2020 nazari et al 2021 hettiarachchi et al 2022 in addition to simulation of urban drainage systems the storm water management model swmm allows control over lids by coupling with other tools huang et al 2018 macro et al 2019 for this reason swmm has been employed to investigate the effect of lids on urban runoff control in various studies mani et al 2019 bai et al 2018 due to the different objectives of implementing lids such as improving runoff quality and reducing runoff quantity effective use of these approaches requires a suitable combination scales and locations that balances between objectives and costs of implementation raei et al 2019 in this regard many studies have widely used single and multi objective optimization algorithms to present the most desired lid implementation scenarios for urban runoff management for instance lee et al 2012 evaluated the optimal location type and cost of stormwater management strategies to fulfill water quality and quantity targets using the system for urban stormwater treatment and analysis integration sustain non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii was used by ghodsi et al 2016b to estimate the type area and location of low impact development practices for urban runoff management in a watershed located in iran although optimal runoff management scenarios can be generated using multi objective optimization the performance of these scenarios needs to be evaluated in response to arising model uncertainties in the absence of sufficient and reliable input data and parameters such as watershed characteristics decision making in urban runoff management needs to consider uncertainties associated with these parameters ghodsi et al 2016a raei et al 2019 in these situations using probability models which themselves have uncertainties could lead to more uncertain predictions herman et al 2015 ghodsi et al 2016a modeling under uncertainties where robust scenarios take priority over optimal scenarios can be a reliable choice for urban runoff management in this regard lempert and collins 2007 compared robust and optimal decision making under uncertainties using a simulation model the results showed that robust scenarios are preferred to optimal ones when uncertainties are significant lately various robustness analysis frameworks such as robust decision making rdm lempert 2002 lempert 2003 decision scaling brown et al 2012 many objective robust decision making mordm kasprzyk et al 2013 and information gap info gap theory ben haim 2004 have been applied to the robust design of water resource systems against uncertainties for example ghodsi et al 2016a used info gap theory to examine uncertainties associated with swmm key parameters results showed that the stochastic framework in which uncertainties are considered in the decision making process provides more reliable answers than the deterministic model moallemi et al 2020 compared efficiency of two methods rdm and epoch era they concluded that the performance of each method varies depending on the circumstances and problems but in general rdm works very well in situations where stakeholders do not have much information about future conditions rdm tries to identify robust alternatives that provide acceptable performance across many future plausible scenarios lempert 2002 in this regard a set of pre specified policies is subjected to the future states of the world sows which are constructed by sampling over plausible ranges of uncertain parameters bryant and lempert 2010 lempert and collins 2007 this helps decision makers to assess whether the management policies resulting from hydrological modeling perform well for uncertain scenarios and to clarify whether they are robust across different states of the world herman et al 2015 rdm also employs scenario discovery approaches such as patient rule induction method prim friedman and fisher 1999 and classification and regression tree cart breiman et al 1984 to identify ranges of uncertain factors responsible for system failure in rdm like decision scaling and info gap frameworks it is common to evaluate a small set of pre specified design alternatives this may lead to ignoring the critical trade offs among competing objectives that provide insight about design criteria and decision makers conflicts herman et al 2014 to meet these challenges kasprzyk et al 2013 introduced the mordm framework which combines rdm with optimization algorithms among all the robustness evaluation methods mordm has a tremendous ability to visually analyze and quantify the robustness of design options and evaluate the performance of each against deep uncertainties this method has recently been employed to solve different water management problems by presenting multi objective robust decision making kasprzyk et al 2013 revealed that incorporating robustness as a decision making factor can significantly affect the formulation of water management issues and negotiate the selection of candidate options to implement ren et al 2019 employed mordm to determine the robust operating rules of a water supply system results indicated that using mordm can improve the performance of optimal operating rules which were previously unable to deal with uncertainties meysami and niksokhan 2020 used a framework integrating swat and mordm to identify the most robust waste load allocation strategies resisting the system uncertainty employing this method under different climate scenarios revealed that the model s efficacy highly depends on the managers stakeholders design preferences and methodological selection of the climate scenarios in this research with the development of a framework integrating many objective robust decision making and the swmm hydrological model the robust scenarios for locating lid tools under climate change are presented in this regard we have used the most appropriate gcm under two climate scenarios to identify how different scenario definitions for the future change the robustness of candidate planning alternatives the key innovations of this research are stated below 1 the development of coupled swmm nsgaii which contains powerful simulation optimization models that provide the best design alternatives considering both quantity minimizing runoff volume and implementation costs of lids and quality minimizing total suspended solids aspects of runoff management 2 developing the mordm framework and coupling it with the simulation optimization model which provides in depth insight into alternatives performance against deep uncertainty 3 using different rcps to evaluate how the robustness of candidate alternatives changes under different future climate scenarios 4 application of two powerful scenario discovery approaches including prim and cart these methods specify exactly the permissible sampling ranges of uncertain parameters and by presenting a decision tree also visualize the result of using different combinations of uncertain parameters in satisfying stakeholders preferences our study is the first to provide a comprehensive framework for managing both quality and quantity aspects of urban runoff that incorporates methodologies from multi objective optimization and robust decision making indeed in recent research hydrological simulations are based on a certain assumption about key parameters while mordm tries to identify how changes in these assumptions can affect the performance of management strategies in this study we demonstrate the application of mordm for urban runoff management in five main parts in the first stage called problem formulation we will simulate urban runoff quality and quantity using the swmm model next by coupling nsga ii with the simulation model the best runoff management scenarios will be produced as design alternatives in the third step following recognizing key parameters of deep uncertainty specific combinations of them are sampled to generate states of the world sows then by subjecting alternatives under well characterized uncertainty to the deeply uncertain sows the robustness of each design alternative will be evaluated using two robustness assessment methods finally key uncertain factors responsible for system vulnerabilities are identified by employing two powerful scenario discovery approaches prim and cart the remainder of the article is arranged as follows the model framework is presented and explained in detail in section 2 in section 3 district 10 of tehran municipality is described as a case study section 4 contains lessons derived from this research and finally the conclusion and future research guide are presented in section 5 2 materials and methods in this research a comprehensive framework combining mordm with the swmm hydrological model is evaluated for robustness analysis of lids implementation strategies also climate models are applied to identify how the robustness of alternatives changes over different future climate scenarios a flowchart of the proposed methodology is presented in fig 1 in the following sections the principal components of the framework are discussed 2 1 data collection in order to implement the proposed framework for the real world study area various datasets should be collected and used in this regard to simulate runoff quality and quantity in the study area different data related to sub catchment features permeability topography and land use and drainage system characteristics are required additionally for implementing runoff management strategies initial information on applicable lid practices is determined in order to determine the most appropriate gcm and predict how rainfall changes in the future projected information of these models for the historical 1986 2005 and future 2021 2040 periods is collected from the ipcc reference website in addition the 6 hour rainfall data of historical period are collected from mehrabad synoptic station for rainfall disaggregation and estimating the design rainfall under climatic change scenarios 2 2 climate change projection general circulation models gcms predict future rainfall under different climate scenarios which can be utilized to understand how climate change can affect stormwater runoff ghodsi et al 2020 yang et al 2022 lee et al 2022 these models simulate rainfall in three dimensional cells with around 100 250 km horizontal resolution using gcms climate variables can be simulated under different climate change scenarios in its fifth assessment report intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc has identified four new scenarios for how greenhouse gases may vary in the future called representative concentration pathways rcp in this research we have used rcp8 5 and rcp2 6 which estimate the greatest and lowest changes in hydrological variables especially rainfall the characteristics of these two scenarios are provided in section s 2 of the supplementary information since the gcms outputs are at a very coarse resolution they cannot be used for many applications like watershed modeling which require reliable data at an appropriate spatial resolution ghodsi et al 2020 to solve this issue different downscaling methods have been developed to provide projected values in closer agreement with station level data maraun et al 2010 lars wg as a statistical method has shown high performance in this study area and is able to downscale gcms outputs roozbahani et al 2020 oliazadeh et al 2021 this model by using the markov chain method extracts climate variables from the target cell in which the synoptic station under study is located and transforms them into daily station data charles bwalya 2017 lars wg provides downscaled predictions on a daily scale while runoff studies need to be examined on a smaller scale so in this study the disaggregation method proposed by roozbhani et al 2020 is employed for determining 6 hour design rainfall in this method first the most appropriate probabilistic distribution should be fitted to the maximum annual rainfall data of the historical period in 6 hour and 24 hour durations then rainfall with a 5 and 10 year return period is calculated for each duration finally by dividing these values a relative coefficient is determined for each return period which is utilized for calculating future 6 hour design rainfall 2 3 runoff quality and quantity simulation in this study the swmm hydrological model developed by the united states environmental protection agency usepa is utilized for urban runoff quality and quantity simulation rossman 2015 the swmm can simulate the rainfall runoff process as a single event or over a long term this model consists of two main components hydrologic and hydraulic modules during the simulation first the hydrological module performs on the collection of sub catchments which receives rainfall data and calculates the runoff volume and pollutant load then the hydraulic module transports the generated runoff from sub catchments to the outlet in swmm two processes of build up and wash off are utilized for runoff quality simulation pollutant build up for a given land use determines the amount of a particular pollutant built on the ground preceding a rainfall event and is available for washing off during the rainfall this accumulated pollutant load is a function of unrainy days traffic flow and street swiping james and boregowda 1986 in our research an exponential function is used for modeling this process rossman 2010 1 b c 1 1 e c 2 t where b is pollutant build up mass per curb length c1 and c 2 denote the maximum possible build up mass per area or curb length and the build up rate constant 1 day respectively and t represents the number of preceding unrainy days pollutants are washed off in the runoff collection system during a rainfall event in this study an exponential function is used to simulate this process rossman 2010 2 w d 1 q d 2 b where d1 and d2 represent the wash off coefficient and the wash off exponent respectively the runoff rate per unit area mm hour is denoted by q and b is the pollutant build up in units of the total mass also swmm5 1 has a toolbox that allows researchers to simulate the impact of using lid tools in quantitative and qualitative runoff control in our research based on the study area characteristics three types of lids including vegetative swale permeable pavement and infiltration trench are utilized for effective runoff management under climate change conditions a brief explanation of each of the mentioned tools is provided in section s 1 of the supplementary information 2 4 identifying design alternatives due to the diverse types and functions of lids along with complex urban environments the main concern is to determine the optimal location of these practices martin mikle et al 2015 geng and sharpley 2019 ghodsi et al 2020 to solve this issue the nsga ii multi objective optimization algorithm deb et al 2002 is developed and coupled with the swmm to identify the optimal scenarios for lids implementation indeed the swmm nsgaii coupled model provides efficient and optimal solutions responding to the conflicting objectives ghodsi et al 2016b raei et al 2019 latifi et al 2019 these conflicting objectives are defined as three functions to minimize 1 runoff volume 2 tss contamination load at the watershed outlet and 3 implementation cost of lids hence the swmm nsgaii model is run defining three objective functions expressed in eqs 3 to 5 3 z 1 m i n r u n o f f v o l u m e 4 z 2 t s s c o n t a m i n a t i o n l o a d 5 z 3 m i n i m p l e m e n t a t i o n c o s t w h e r e z 1 and z 2 are associated with the quantity and quality of urban runoff management respectively also z 3 as a key objective of the problem denotes the cost of lids implementation which is calculated based on the cost per unit for lids implementation fallahi zarandi 2013 ghodsi et al 2016a ghodsi et al 2020 to address the conflicting objectives mentioned in the optimization process the types and areas of lids in different sub catchments are considered as decision variables ultimately by iterative execution of the swmm nsgaii model non dominated solutions are generated as the optimal design alternatives for urban runoff management 2 5 uncertainty analysis using the mordm framework in the previous step design alternatives were generated in a situation where modeling parameters were on the best estimation values and simulation was performed under well characterized uncertainty in this step we explore how the alternatives perform if these estimations are changed in this regard mordm subjects each alternative to a wide range of plausible futures and evaluates their performance under different assumptions about uncertain factors this can help decision makers identify robust solutions and select acceptable performance across future uncertain scenarios there are three main steps for uncertainty analysis in mordm 1 determining uncertain factors and creating future states of the world 2 evaluating robustness using different robust assessment measures and 3 scenario discovery in the following these steps are defined in detail 2 5 1 determining uncertain factors and creating future states of the world for creating the future states of the world first uncertain parameters should be identified in this regard sensitivity analysis is able to determine the modeling parameters that have the most impact on the results to identify the most effective parameters on the swmm output sensitivity analysis is performed by the oat one at a time method saltelli and annoni 2010 oat method does not require complex computation to analyze sensitivity and has been widely used in previous studies karamouz et al 2016 binesh et al 2019 in this method the model s output runoff quality and quantity at the watershed outlet is calculated by varying one model s input parameter at a time while the others are kept unchanged finally parameters for which a slight change in their values significantly changes the mentioned outputs are chosen for uncertainty analysis deep uncertainty was first defined by lempert 2003 as a situation where key parameters of the model or their probability distributions are unknown and cannot be agreed upon in this situation mordm analyzes the performance of management strategies across many future possible states of the world and provides information about alternatives robustness against deep uncertainty lempert and collins 2007 lempert et al 2002 for this purpose after determining the uncertain factors the latin hyper cube lhs sampling model is employed to sample from the uncertainty space and create sows in this regard lhs generates random values within the permissible ranges of uncertain factors and each combination of these values is defined as one sow then simulations are performed under each sow and the performance of design alternatives is evaluated 2 5 2 robustness evaluation in this step after subjecting alternatives to sows their performance is quantified using robustness assessment measures in this study regret based and satisficing based measures developed by herman et al 2015 are used for the robustness evaluation of design alternatives these two measures evaluate robustness from different points of view which can help decision makers to analyze alternatives performance from different aspects 2 5 2 1 regret based robustness regret based robustness calculates the deviation in alternatives performance due to deep uncertainty in other words this index evaluates the effect of selecting the wrong options in future scenarios savage 1951 in general regret based robustness aims to reduce system performance variations caused by deep uncertainty as compared to the ideal design in this case we calculate the system performance degradation between the selected design and the best case in each scenario as eq 6 6 r regret max i quantile s s f i x s sup y p f i y s f i x s 0 9 where f i x s represents the value of objective ith in sow s p is a set of design alternatives created by the optimization model s u p y p f i y s defines as the best solution in p amongst sows here the best solution is defined as the ideal solution in a multi objective environment the ideal solution obtains the best attainable value in each objective to identify the ideal solution after determining the uncertainty space and creating future sows design alternatives are run under uncertain scenarios sows and the best value in each objective is considered as the ideal solution s characteristics hadka et al 2015 indeed the upper bound of performance is calculated by modeling the design alternatives under sows determining the best value depends on the problem formulation since in our research objectives are being minimized minimum values of objectives are determined as ideal solution characteristics with these explanations ideal solution may not be among the design alternatives but was modeled within states of the world 2 5 2 2 satisficing based robustness mordm can enable decision makers to participate in the decision making process in this regard satisficing based robustness is defined as the measure that evaluates how alternatives can satisfy preferences in future plausible scenarios in this index eq 7 the possibility of design is determined according to the performance criteria specified by the stakeholders this measure is expressed as a fraction reflecting how many states of the world s fulfill stakeholders criteria 7 r satisficing 1 s s s i s f x s where i s f x s 1 if solution x meets the requirements defined by the stakeholders in the state of the world s and i s f x s 0 otherwise the precise definition of thresholds for quantifying satisficing based robustness is a critical step in implementing mordm and the continuation of the process depends on it in this regard stakeholders and their preferences should be identified there is no specific method for determining satisficing thresholds and it might differ according to the different research and problems ghodsi et al 2016a defined the robustness threshold as a desired utility function value each stakeholder strives to achieve in our research this definition was determined as a satisficing threshold for each stakeholder and formulated as eq 8 8 satisficingthreshold f i m a x w i f i m a x f i m i n where fi max and fi min denote the maximum and minimum values of utility function related to ith stakeholder in a set of alternatives respectively wi is the coefficient which was set to be 0 3 based on previous studies for determining the satisficing threshold in a set of alternatives swmm is run considering well characterized uncertainties the utility function s minimum and maximum values are then determined for each stakeholder finally the utility function s highest value less a particular percentage w of the difference between its maximum and minimum values is defined as the satisficing threshold 2 6 scenario discovery the final step in implementing mordm is scenario discovery in this step the model s outputs across uncertainty scenarios are analyzed to present a clear explanation of the combination of uncertain factors that effectively predict future sows lempert et al 2008 in this research two powerful scenario discovery approaches including prim and cart are employed in the following these two methods are defined in detail 2 6 1 patient rule induction method prim patient rule induction method prim friedman and fisher 1999 as a powerful scenario discovery approach tries to characterize the system s deterministic pattern from the uncertainty space fig 2 shows the process of scenario discovery using the prim method scenario discovery is started by determining the threshold which is utilized to divide the states of the world into two groups of acceptable and vulnerable vulnerable sows are those in which the design alternative violates the specific threshold in this study satisficing threshold defined in section 2 5 2 2 is applied to identify vulnerable sows in fig 2 after applying the threshold sows are colored blue and red representing acceptable and vulnerable sows respectively in this figure each point represents one state of the world in step 2 prim tries to capture a scenario box that covers the states of the world with poor performance this box has two main features coverage and density coverage is the number of vulnerable sows captured within a box in relation to the total in the entire space and density is defined as the total number of captured vulnerable sows over the total inside the box each scenario box represents ranges of uncertain factors x1 and x2 in which the candidate solution shows poor performance during the scenario discovery process prim iteratively changes the size of the box to lead to better coverage and density finally vulnerable ranges are visually presented to the decision makers by providing dimensions that are limited to the maximum and minimum values of uncertain factors 2 6 2 classification and regression trees cart classification and regression trees cart brieman et al 1984 is another scenario discovery approach that provides results in the form of a decision tree during the scenario discovery process the model s results under uncertainties are subdivided into two partitions each partition within a tree has a partitioning rule which is defined based on the minimization of the sum of variances for two resulting nodes hancock et al 2005 to put it another way minimization of relative error re for two resulting nodes in the tree is required to generate a node 9 r e d l 0 l y l y l 2 r 0 r y r y r 2 where y l and y r with respective means of y l and y r correspond to the left and right partitions variables in accordance with eq 9 the splitting rule d is defined as a statement in some estimator variable x to determine the right and left hypotheses 3 case study to analyze the application of our framework for robust urban runoff management district 10 of tehran municipality 51 21ʹ 14 e 51 22ʹ 47 e 35 42ʹ 01 n 35 40ʹ 05 n located in tehran iran is selected as the case study district 10 has an area of 807 ha of which 57 percent is dedicated to residential land use with high population 25 percent to urban passages and access and the remaining 18 percent is allocated to services such as green spaces and parks industrial plants and commercial buildings behroozi et al 2018 ghaedrahmati and alian 2019 the high population density low percentage of permeable surfaces numerous passages and streets have doubled the need for quality and quantity management of runoff in this region the region is divided into 84 sub catchments and generated runoff is drained by various channels fig 3 the most important channels are the gholgholi komeil and firoozabadi the total length of the modeled channels is about 79 km in which the proportion of main and second degree channels is 6000 m and 73 km respectively for hydraulic simulation the previous study results zistab consulting engineering company 2012 have been used to model the main and secondary channels the mehrabad synoptic station 35 41ʹ 35 n 51 18ʹ 46 e with an altitude of 1191 m above sea level is the nearest station to the study area and observed rainfall recorded at this station is used for estimating future design rainfall 3 1 stakeholders in the case study different organizations could be involved in the runoff management of a watershed the main stakeholders responsible for urban runoff management in district 10 of tehran municipality are presented in the following 3 1 1 stakeholder 1 tehran regional water company trwc trwc is in charge of supplying water for different sectors including agriculture domestic and environmental due to the presence of agricultural areas in southern tehran both runoff quality and quantity are preferred to be maximized by this stakeholder indeed regarding quantity management trwc does not prefer more lids implementation although to improve the quality of the receiving water implementing lids is desirable for this stakeholder so the utility function for trwc is defined as the maximization of runoff volume and the minimization of tss load at the catchment outlet and formulated as follows ghodsi et al 2016a raei et al 2019 10 minimizef 1 w r 1 1 v i v max w r 2 tss i tss max where i represents the runoff management scenario number vi stands for the runoff volume at the outlet for the ith scenario and vmax stands for the maximum runoff volume of the catchment in this regard swmm was run when no lids were implemented in the sub catchments and runoff volume at the outlet was considered as vmax tssi represents the total suspended solids load of scenario i and tssmax stands for the maximum tss contamination load when swmm was executed without implementing lid tools w r1 and w r2 are the relative importance weights of runoff quantity and quality which were set to 0 5 based on the same study by ghodsi et al 2016a 3 1 2 stakeholder 2 tehran municipality tm since the municipality of tehran has the duty to protect the drainage system network it seeks to minimize the capacity of the network in order to reduce the costs of construction maintenance and reconstruction therefore increasing the infiltration and reducing the runoff volume are preferred by this beneficiary drainage systems are generally open channels where washed contaminants can reduce water quality and cause odor and insects therefore reducing contamination load is another stakeholder preference also tehran municipality as one of the main sponsors of lids implementation seeks to reduce the implementation cost according to the above utility function of this stakeholder is defined as eq 11 11 minimizef 2 w m 1 c i c max w m 2 tss i tss max w m 3 v i v max where vi and tssi represent the total runoff volume and total tss contamination load at the watershed outlet for the ith urban runoff management scenario respectively ci is the cost of lids implementation for the ith scenario vmax and tssmax denote the runoff volume and tss load at the watershed outlet when no lids are implemented cmax is the maximum cost of implementation among design alternatives wm1 wm2 and wm3 are the relative importance of cost of implementation runoff volume and tss contamination load respectively these coefficients were set to 0 3 0 35 and 0 35 respectively in line with previous research by ghodsi et al 2016a 3 2 most sensitive parameters of swmm in the case study achieving reliable simulation results requires a calibrated model for the study area in this regard the simulation model developed in this study was calibrated using the quality and quantity observation data at the watershed outlet recorded by dayarian 2015 however the uncertainty of the model s key parameters should be considered for reliable decision making for sensitivity analysis of the swmm model in the study area in each step of the oat method one model s input parameter was varied in 10 intervals within its permissible range and the model output was computed results showed that the build up and wash off coefficients as well as the impervious coefficient of sub catchments have a significant effect on the quantity and quality of runoff compared to other parameters the dominant land use in the study area is residential with high population density and as it was expected the oat showed that the build up and wash off coefficients c1 and d1 in eqs 1 and 2 related to this land use have the most effect on the model s output because of insufficient statistical information about the mentioned parameters in the study area these parameters are considered with deep uncertainty ghodsi et al 2016a the impervious coefficient as one of the sub catchments characteristics is defined as the percentage of impervious area in the watershed due to the lack of adequate information about this parameter its values are usually estimated and have uncertainty to perform uncertainty analysis imperviousness c1 and d1 coefficients are allowed to vary within their permissible ranges limited by upper and lower bounds in order to set an upper bound for these parameters m1 percent of a deterministic value calibrated value is added to the calibrated value and in the same way the calibrated value minus m2 percent of the calibrated value denotes the lower bound of permissible variation based on a previous study conducted by ghodsi et al 2016a for parameters d1 and c1 m1 and m2 are set to be 50 and 25 respectively the center value lower and upper bounds for the mentioned parameters are listed in table 1 it should be noted that lower bounds and upper bounds are restricted to the meaningful ranges which are obtained from previous studies by zhang and hamlett 2006 and soltani 2009 4 results 4 1 determining design rainfall under climate change different climate models do not have the same performance in predicting hydrological variables in this regard performance analysis should be implemented in our research the long term monthly average rainfall predicted by gcms for the baseline period was compared to the observation data and different indexes were used to quantify the performance of models the performance evaluation indexes used in this research are defined in supplementary information as eqs s1 to s4 table 2 presents the performance of gcms in the study area there is no clear logic and unanimous approach to choosing x models from y and this entirely depends on the models performance raju and kumar 2020 so in this research according to the results the mpi esm lr model gets the best value in each statistical measure and is selected as the most appropriate model for predicting rainfall in the future to identify the 6 hour design rainfall for the future period the most common probability distributions used in hydrology such as normal distribution pearson log pearson type 3 and generalized extreme values gev were fitted to the 6 and 24 hour maximum annual rainfall series of the historical period results showed that the gev distribution model has the best performance and was selected for estimating maximum precipitation with different probability of occurrence then by calculating 6 and 24 hour rainfall with a 5 and 10 year return period the relationship between these values was determined and used to disaggregate the mpi esm lr daily prediction for the future period table 3 presents the 6 and 24 hour maximum rainfall of the base period the relationship between these values was identified as 0 501 and 0 515 for 5 and 10 year return periods respectively then by fitting the gev distribution model to the maximum annual daily rainfall predicted by mpi esm lr and downscaled by lars wg future rainfall with 5 and 10 year return periods were calculated finally 6 hour rainfall was obtained under climate change scenarios by multiplying these values by the mentioned coefficients the results shown in table 4 indicate that the maximum 6 hour rainfall of the future period 2021 2040 under the optimistic scenario rcp2 6 will be almost constant and increase under the pessimistic scenario rcp8 5 4 2 quantifying the robustness of the design alternatives using the mordm the third step in implementing mordm is to identify design alternatives this stage provides a high degree of knowledge about alternatives performance under well characterized uncertainty since three lids can be implemented in 84 simulated sub catchments 252 decision variables were determined for the optimization problem also each decision variable was constrained by the minimum and maximum values of the possible implementation area by coupling the swmm and nsga ii optimization model 100 design alternatives were produced as the optimal runoff management alternatives under rcp8 5 and rcp2 6 until this part of the research swmm s output was used as baseline data and design alternatives were produced based on well characterized uncertainties which implies that uncertainties surrounding the simulation were not taken into account so in this part the robustness of alternatives against deep uncertainty is evaluated as mentioned in section 3 2 c1 in build up equation eq 1 and d1 in wash off equation eq 2 as well as imperviousness coefficient were identified as parameters with deep uncertainties next 1000 latin hyper cube samples lhs were generated randomly for each parameter within the plausible and meaningful ranges defined in table 1 the output is a 1000 3 matrix each row representing one state of the world then for each design alternative swmm that was previously run under well characterized input parameters was implemented for sows and the robustness of the solutions was quantified based on measures defined in eqs 6 and 7 in order to quantify regret based robustness deviation from the ideal solution is calculated for each design alternative as stated in section 2 5 2 1 the ideal solution gets the best values in each objective since all the objectives are assumed to be minimized in our research the minimum values of tss load and runoff volume under sows were determined as the ideal solution s characteristics satisfying based robustness for each design alternative is quantified as a fraction of the scenarios that satisfy the requirements in this regard first by using eqs 10 and 11 maximum and minimum values of the stakeholders utility functions were calculated and then satisficing threshold for each stakeholder was determined based on eq 8 table 5 represents the calculated satisficing threshold for each stakeholder next for each design alternative the utility functions of stakeholders were calculated in each sow finally if the values of the utility functions calculated for each stakeholder were less than the satisficing threshold all stakeholders are in a state of satisfaction the number one is saved otherwise the number zero is stored the sum of these numbers divided by the number of sows indicates the satisficing based robustness of the design option fig 4 a d and 5 a d represent the robustness of design alternatives based on regret and satisfcing based measures respectively each glyph and line corresponds to one runoff management scheme and is colored based on its robustness value including regret based fig 4 and satisficing based fig 5 blue glyphs show robust scenarios whereas red glyphs represent poor performance against deep uncertainty key results derived from these visualization are stated below based on the color trend of figures the regret of selecting scenarios with a high percentage of lids is low and stakeholders preferences are more met in the future sows these figures relatively show the same region in the two robustness indices the bottom left corner areas with stricter plans for runoff management are highly robust since these two methods have fundamentally distinct measurement criteria observing the same trend in these approaches confirms that plans with a higher percentage of lids implementation are more robust against deep uncertainty in each climate scenario the robustness of the options decreases as the design rainfall s return period increases this is noticeable under rcp8 5 that the maximum satisfaction value decreases from 0 95 in fig 5 c to 0 56 in fig 5 d and there is no design option with a satisficing value of 1 this also confirmed that by increasing the return period the performance of the lids in controlling runoff decreases based on the satisficing criterion the sudden decreasing robustness in the middle design options under rcp8 5 t 10 is quite evident while the regret based values are close to each other and can not cover this significant vulnerability this indicates that the selection of the robustness measures can influence the process of decision making and various of these methods must be implemented in each research 4 3 vulnerability analysis after quantifying robustness and ranking solutions based on two measures discussed in the previous step we have employed prim and cart methods for vulnerability analysis these approaches discover the uncertainty space to find different combinations of parameters that lead to system vulnerabilities lempert et al 2008 to narrow the scope of this step we select an alternative for vulnerability assessment however it is normal in practice to investigate several design alternatives in this step in this research a solution from a region with both high robustness indicators has been selected randomly the highlighted solution shown in fig 5 d is selected for further analysis by prim and cart satisficing value of 0 55 for this alternative indicates that there exist key vulnerabilities leading to failures stakeholders preferences are not met in 45 of future states of the world but further analysis by prim and cart reveals the factors causing vulnerabilities in this research we define vulnerability states as those in which stakeholders preferences are not met utility function calculated for each stakeholder is more than satisficing threshold fig 6 shows the scenario discovery results represented by prim for the selected solution related to each stakeholder in these figures red boxes denote the range of uncertain parameters leading to unsatisfied stakeholders according to the result since tm seeks to reduce runoff volume prim has also introduced a high percentage of impervious coefficient as the range of vulnerability of this stakeholder because with increasing the sub catchments impermeable surfaces generated runoff also increases in contrast since trwc s preference is to increase runoff volume to supply water for the agriculture sector low values of the impervious coefficient are presented as the range of vulnerability for this beneficiary fig 6 also indicates that d1 is the critical factor for trwc moderate values of parameter d1 lead to susceptibility whereas this parameter is not significant for tm this stakeholder is allowed to sample all values of d1 the cart is another scenario discovery approach that can enable decision makers to identify partitions that provide a specific misclassification rate and derive the desired ex post evaluation fig 7 represents the key drivers of each stakeholder s vulnerability identified by the cart in our research we have partitioned solutions into two groups satisfied and unsatisfied a partition is named satisfied if the number of acceptable sows sows in which the solution satisfies the stakeholders preferences is greater than the unsatisfied circumstances otherwise the solution is classified as unsatisfied under each partition there is a rule that by following partitions are further divided the numbers in each partition represent the number of satisfied left and unsatisfied right scenarios respectively partitions are colored red or blue if the partition is identified as unsatisfied or satisfied respectively for example as shown in fig 7 b in the first partition before starting the route out of 1000 examined scenarios 565 sows are identified as satisfied while in 435 sows stakeholders preferences are not met so the partition is coded as blue 565 435 next continuing the right part of the tree if imp coe 80 and c1 84 only 6 of the other sows would be subjected to failure more constraints c1 78 decrease the unsatisfying rate to 0 6 the depth of each uncertainty factor in the tree it should be noted that an uncertainty might exist multiple times gives researchers decision makers an idea of how important it is to classify vulnerabilities factors that are closest to the source provide more predicting potential in exploring vulnerabilities as discussed based on prim analysis d1 was identified as a key factor of vulnerability for trwc but fig 7 a shows that cart was unable to identify this parameter as vulnerable so it is recommended to use both methods for scenario discovery 5 summary and conclusion this article investigated the implementation of a framework combining mordm with the swmm hydrological model to recognize robust lid implementation strategies under climate change conditions in this regard first by analyzing the performance of different gcms mpi esm lr was identified as the most appropriate model to simulate future rainfall changes then the prediction of this model under rcp8 5 and rcp2 6 were downscaled using the lars wg model the results showed that 6 hour rainfall under rcp2 6 is almost constant and will increase under rcp8 5 compared to the base period then using swmm nsgaii optimal scenarios of lids implementation were generated for runoff management under climate change sensitivity analysis by oat showed that imperviousness build up and wash off coefficients impact the model output most and uncertainties related to their values should be considered in the decision making process for this purpose mordm was implemented for uncertainty analysis first different combinations of uncertain factors were created as future states of the world next the robustness of each design alternative was quantified using regret and satisficing based measures results showed that plans with a higher percentage of lids are more robust against deep uncertainties on the other hand there was a decrease in the robustness of the solution which implies that the performance of the lids changes over different climate scenarios these measures can help to evaluate robustness from different points of view for example the satisficing based measure has the potential to incorporate stakeholders preferences into robustness evaluation and enables stakeholders to participate in the decision making process then an alternative was selected from the region with the highest robustness in which runoff volume and tss load can be reduced by 31 3 and 29 5 respectively further analysis on this alternative revealed that in 45 of future sows stakeholders preferences are vulnerable to being unmet in this regard prim and cart were employed for scenario discovery and identifying vulnerabilities using these approaches the allowable ranges of each uncertain parameter were visually introduced to the stakeholders and can enable them to know how their decisions can affect the system s vulnerability in future scenarios the framework implemented in this research shows that design criteria defined by stakeholders could affect the effectiveness of the model and cause robust urban runoff management plans to fail under different future scenarios generating robust lids implementation alternatives requires well defined deep uncertainties main stakeholders and their design criteria swmm mordm as a comprehensive framework enables decision makers to generate optimal runoff management schemes and evaluate how they are robust against future uncertain scenarios ultimately this framework provides robust decision support to address uncertainties that arise as urban runoff systems undergo change in future works the swmm mordm framework could be extended to incorporate other robustness evaluation indexes including regret type i and satisficing type ii more information about different robustness indexes is available in the previous study hadka et al 2015 robustness against deep uncertainties could be a powerful index for comparing design alternatives performance using different multi criteria decision making mcdm methods furthermore since swmm mordm provides a flexible framework it can incorporate other systems indicators such as resiliency vulnerability and sustainability into the decision making process under uncertainty also to further develop the climate change segment of the framework temperature based associations can be developed for the study area this method was effectively evaluated in previous research and can reduce the need for gcms alexander et al 2019 roderick

2361,decision makers in urban water systems have long searched for robust runoff management alternatives that can resist deviations from the performance for which they were designed in this study with the development of a new comprehensive framework consisting of many objective robust decision making mordm and storm water management model swmm robust alternatives for the implementation of low impact development lid practices are presented under future climate change the proposed methodology has been applied to district 10 of the tehran municipality located in the central part of tehran iran in the first step the performances of general circulation models gcms in predicting rainfall in the base period 1986 2005 were compared and mpi esm lr was selected as the best model for predicting rainfall in the future period 2021 2040 in the next step by developing the swmm hydrological model runoff quality and quantity were simulated under rcp8 5 and rcp2 6 by coupling swmm with the nsga ii multi objective evolutionary algorithm and specifying objective functions the most optimal lids implementation scenarios were produced then well characterized uncertainties were changed into deep uncertainties and the robustness of each design alternative was quantified using two robustness assessment methods finally system vulnerabilities were discovered using the patient rule induction method prim and classification and regression tree cart this study showed that scenarios with a higher percentage of lids are more robust against deep uncertainties using different rcp scenarios also revealed that methodological selection of future climate scenarios can affect the robustness of candidate alternatives implementing swmm mordm enables decision makers to effectively generate runoff management scenarios and visually evaluate their robustness against deep uncertainties keywords climate change robustness deep uncertainty low impact development decision making data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction population growth urbanization and climate change have caused many changes in the urban environment that can adversely affect runoff quality and quantity in light of rising water demand and scarcity surface runoff can be collected and utilized for different water uses after being partially purified jia et al 2014 low impact development lid by using tools with the least environmental impacts is an effective step in sustainable development pirouz et al 2019 reducing the effects of climate change zahmatkesh et al 2015 ghodsi et al 2020 and minimizing the impact of urbanization on impermeable surfaces eckart et al 2018 taghizadeh et al 2021 many studies have been conducted in recent decades to evaluate the efficacy of lids for urban runoff management van roon 2007 martin mikle et al 2015 wang et al 2018 behroozi et al 2018 kourtis et al 2020 nazari et al 2021 hettiarachchi et al 2022 in addition to simulation of urban drainage systems the storm water management model swmm allows control over lids by coupling with other tools huang et al 2018 macro et al 2019 for this reason swmm has been employed to investigate the effect of lids on urban runoff control in various studies mani et al 2019 bai et al 2018 due to the different objectives of implementing lids such as improving runoff quality and reducing runoff quantity effective use of these approaches requires a suitable combination scales and locations that balances between objectives and costs of implementation raei et al 2019 in this regard many studies have widely used single and multi objective optimization algorithms to present the most desired lid implementation scenarios for urban runoff management for instance lee et al 2012 evaluated the optimal location type and cost of stormwater management strategies to fulfill water quality and quantity targets using the system for urban stormwater treatment and analysis integration sustain non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii was used by ghodsi et al 2016b to estimate the type area and location of low impact development practices for urban runoff management in a watershed located in iran although optimal runoff management scenarios can be generated using multi objective optimization the performance of these scenarios needs to be evaluated in response to arising model uncertainties in the absence of sufficient and reliable input data and parameters such as watershed characteristics decision making in urban runoff management needs to consider uncertainties associated with these parameters ghodsi et al 2016a raei et al 2019 in these situations using probability models which themselves have uncertainties could lead to more uncertain predictions herman et al 2015 ghodsi et al 2016a modeling under uncertainties where robust scenarios take priority over optimal scenarios can be a reliable choice for urban runoff management in this regard lempert and collins 2007 compared robust and optimal decision making under uncertainties using a simulation model the results showed that robust scenarios are preferred to optimal ones when uncertainties are significant lately various robustness analysis frameworks such as robust decision making rdm lempert 2002 lempert 2003 decision scaling brown et al 2012 many objective robust decision making mordm kasprzyk et al 2013 and information gap info gap theory ben haim 2004 have been applied to the robust design of water resource systems against uncertainties for example ghodsi et al 2016a used info gap theory to examine uncertainties associated with swmm key parameters results showed that the stochastic framework in which uncertainties are considered in the decision making process provides more reliable answers than the deterministic model moallemi et al 2020 compared efficiency of two methods rdm and epoch era they concluded that the performance of each method varies depending on the circumstances and problems but in general rdm works very well in situations where stakeholders do not have much information about future conditions rdm tries to identify robust alternatives that provide acceptable performance across many future plausible scenarios lempert 2002 in this regard a set of pre specified policies is subjected to the future states of the world sows which are constructed by sampling over plausible ranges of uncertain parameters bryant and lempert 2010 lempert and collins 2007 this helps decision makers to assess whether the management policies resulting from hydrological modeling perform well for uncertain scenarios and to clarify whether they are robust across different states of the world herman et al 2015 rdm also employs scenario discovery approaches such as patient rule induction method prim friedman and fisher 1999 and classification and regression tree cart breiman et al 1984 to identify ranges of uncertain factors responsible for system failure in rdm like decision scaling and info gap frameworks it is common to evaluate a small set of pre specified design alternatives this may lead to ignoring the critical trade offs among competing objectives that provide insight about design criteria and decision makers conflicts herman et al 2014 to meet these challenges kasprzyk et al 2013 introduced the mordm framework which combines rdm with optimization algorithms among all the robustness evaluation methods mordm has a tremendous ability to visually analyze and quantify the robustness of design options and evaluate the performance of each against deep uncertainties this method has recently been employed to solve different water management problems by presenting multi objective robust decision making kasprzyk et al 2013 revealed that incorporating robustness as a decision making factor can significantly affect the formulation of water management issues and negotiate the selection of candidate options to implement ren et al 2019 employed mordm to determine the robust operating rules of a water supply system results indicated that using mordm can improve the performance of optimal operating rules which were previously unable to deal with uncertainties meysami and niksokhan 2020 used a framework integrating swat and mordm to identify the most robust waste load allocation strategies resisting the system uncertainty employing this method under different climate scenarios revealed that the model s efficacy highly depends on the managers stakeholders design preferences and methodological selection of the climate scenarios in this research with the development of a framework integrating many objective robust decision making and the swmm hydrological model the robust scenarios for locating lid tools under climate change are presented in this regard we have used the most appropriate gcm under two climate scenarios to identify how different scenario definitions for the future change the robustness of candidate planning alternatives the key innovations of this research are stated below 1 the development of coupled swmm nsgaii which contains powerful simulation optimization models that provide the best design alternatives considering both quantity minimizing runoff volume and implementation costs of lids and quality minimizing total suspended solids aspects of runoff management 2 developing the mordm framework and coupling it with the simulation optimization model which provides in depth insight into alternatives performance against deep uncertainty 3 using different rcps to evaluate how the robustness of candidate alternatives changes under different future climate scenarios 4 application of two powerful scenario discovery approaches including prim and cart these methods specify exactly the permissible sampling ranges of uncertain parameters and by presenting a decision tree also visualize the result of using different combinations of uncertain parameters in satisfying stakeholders preferences our study is the first to provide a comprehensive framework for managing both quality and quantity aspects of urban runoff that incorporates methodologies from multi objective optimization and robust decision making indeed in recent research hydrological simulations are based on a certain assumption about key parameters while mordm tries to identify how changes in these assumptions can affect the performance of management strategies in this study we demonstrate the application of mordm for urban runoff management in five main parts in the first stage called problem formulation we will simulate urban runoff quality and quantity using the swmm model next by coupling nsga ii with the simulation model the best runoff management scenarios will be produced as design alternatives in the third step following recognizing key parameters of deep uncertainty specific combinations of them are sampled to generate states of the world sows then by subjecting alternatives under well characterized uncertainty to the deeply uncertain sows the robustness of each design alternative will be evaluated using two robustness assessment methods finally key uncertain factors responsible for system vulnerabilities are identified by employing two powerful scenario discovery approaches prim and cart the remainder of the article is arranged as follows the model framework is presented and explained in detail in section 2 in section 3 district 10 of tehran municipality is described as a case study section 4 contains lessons derived from this research and finally the conclusion and future research guide are presented in section 5 2 materials and methods in this research a comprehensive framework combining mordm with the swmm hydrological model is evaluated for robustness analysis of lids implementation strategies also climate models are applied to identify how the robustness of alternatives changes over different future climate scenarios a flowchart of the proposed methodology is presented in fig 1 in the following sections the principal components of the framework are discussed 2 1 data collection in order to implement the proposed framework for the real world study area various datasets should be collected and used in this regard to simulate runoff quality and quantity in the study area different data related to sub catchment features permeability topography and land use and drainage system characteristics are required additionally for implementing runoff management strategies initial information on applicable lid practices is determined in order to determine the most appropriate gcm and predict how rainfall changes in the future projected information of these models for the historical 1986 2005 and future 2021 2040 periods is collected from the ipcc reference website in addition the 6 hour rainfall data of historical period are collected from mehrabad synoptic station for rainfall disaggregation and estimating the design rainfall under climatic change scenarios 2 2 climate change projection general circulation models gcms predict future rainfall under different climate scenarios which can be utilized to understand how climate change can affect stormwater runoff ghodsi et al 2020 yang et al 2022 lee et al 2022 these models simulate rainfall in three dimensional cells with around 100 250 km horizontal resolution using gcms climate variables can be simulated under different climate change scenarios in its fifth assessment report intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc has identified four new scenarios for how greenhouse gases may vary in the future called representative concentration pathways rcp in this research we have used rcp8 5 and rcp2 6 which estimate the greatest and lowest changes in hydrological variables especially rainfall the characteristics of these two scenarios are provided in section s 2 of the supplementary information since the gcms outputs are at a very coarse resolution they cannot be used for many applications like watershed modeling which require reliable data at an appropriate spatial resolution ghodsi et al 2020 to solve this issue different downscaling methods have been developed to provide projected values in closer agreement with station level data maraun et al 2010 lars wg as a statistical method has shown high performance in this study area and is able to downscale gcms outputs roozbahani et al 2020 oliazadeh et al 2021 this model by using the markov chain method extracts climate variables from the target cell in which the synoptic station under study is located and transforms them into daily station data charles bwalya 2017 lars wg provides downscaled predictions on a daily scale while runoff studies need to be examined on a smaller scale so in this study the disaggregation method proposed by roozbhani et al 2020 is employed for determining 6 hour design rainfall in this method first the most appropriate probabilistic distribution should be fitted to the maximum annual rainfall data of the historical period in 6 hour and 24 hour durations then rainfall with a 5 and 10 year return period is calculated for each duration finally by dividing these values a relative coefficient is determined for each return period which is utilized for calculating future 6 hour design rainfall 2 3 runoff quality and quantity simulation in this study the swmm hydrological model developed by the united states environmental protection agency usepa is utilized for urban runoff quality and quantity simulation rossman 2015 the swmm can simulate the rainfall runoff process as a single event or over a long term this model consists of two main components hydrologic and hydraulic modules during the simulation first the hydrological module performs on the collection of sub catchments which receives rainfall data and calculates the runoff volume and pollutant load then the hydraulic module transports the generated runoff from sub catchments to the outlet in swmm two processes of build up and wash off are utilized for runoff quality simulation pollutant build up for a given land use determines the amount of a particular pollutant built on the ground preceding a rainfall event and is available for washing off during the rainfall this accumulated pollutant load is a function of unrainy days traffic flow and street swiping james and boregowda 1986 in our research an exponential function is used for modeling this process rossman 2010 1 b c 1 1 e c 2 t where b is pollutant build up mass per curb length c1 and c 2 denote the maximum possible build up mass per area or curb length and the build up rate constant 1 day respectively and t represents the number of preceding unrainy days pollutants are washed off in the runoff collection system during a rainfall event in this study an exponential function is used to simulate this process rossman 2010 2 w d 1 q d 2 b where d1 and d2 represent the wash off coefficient and the wash off exponent respectively the runoff rate per unit area mm hour is denoted by q and b is the pollutant build up in units of the total mass also swmm5 1 has a toolbox that allows researchers to simulate the impact of using lid tools in quantitative and qualitative runoff control in our research based on the study area characteristics three types of lids including vegetative swale permeable pavement and infiltration trench are utilized for effective runoff management under climate change conditions a brief explanation of each of the mentioned tools is provided in section s 1 of the supplementary information 2 4 identifying design alternatives due to the diverse types and functions of lids along with complex urban environments the main concern is to determine the optimal location of these practices martin mikle et al 2015 geng and sharpley 2019 ghodsi et al 2020 to solve this issue the nsga ii multi objective optimization algorithm deb et al 2002 is developed and coupled with the swmm to identify the optimal scenarios for lids implementation indeed the swmm nsgaii coupled model provides efficient and optimal solutions responding to the conflicting objectives ghodsi et al 2016b raei et al 2019 latifi et al 2019 these conflicting objectives are defined as three functions to minimize 1 runoff volume 2 tss contamination load at the watershed outlet and 3 implementation cost of lids hence the swmm nsgaii model is run defining three objective functions expressed in eqs 3 to 5 3 z 1 m i n r u n o f f v o l u m e 4 z 2 t s s c o n t a m i n a t i o n l o a d 5 z 3 m i n i m p l e m e n t a t i o n c o s t w h e r e z 1 and z 2 are associated with the quantity and quality of urban runoff management respectively also z 3 as a key objective of the problem denotes the cost of lids implementation which is calculated based on the cost per unit for lids implementation fallahi zarandi 2013 ghodsi et al 2016a ghodsi et al 2020 to address the conflicting objectives mentioned in the optimization process the types and areas of lids in different sub catchments are considered as decision variables ultimately by iterative execution of the swmm nsgaii model non dominated solutions are generated as the optimal design alternatives for urban runoff management 2 5 uncertainty analysis using the mordm framework in the previous step design alternatives were generated in a situation where modeling parameters were on the best estimation values and simulation was performed under well characterized uncertainty in this step we explore how the alternatives perform if these estimations are changed in this regard mordm subjects each alternative to a wide range of plausible futures and evaluates their performance under different assumptions about uncertain factors this can help decision makers identify robust solutions and select acceptable performance across future uncertain scenarios there are three main steps for uncertainty analysis in mordm 1 determining uncertain factors and creating future states of the world 2 evaluating robustness using different robust assessment measures and 3 scenario discovery in the following these steps are defined in detail 2 5 1 determining uncertain factors and creating future states of the world for creating the future states of the world first uncertain parameters should be identified in this regard sensitivity analysis is able to determine the modeling parameters that have the most impact on the results to identify the most effective parameters on the swmm output sensitivity analysis is performed by the oat one at a time method saltelli and annoni 2010 oat method does not require complex computation to analyze sensitivity and has been widely used in previous studies karamouz et al 2016 binesh et al 2019 in this method the model s output runoff quality and quantity at the watershed outlet is calculated by varying one model s input parameter at a time while the others are kept unchanged finally parameters for which a slight change in their values significantly changes the mentioned outputs are chosen for uncertainty analysis deep uncertainty was first defined by lempert 2003 as a situation where key parameters of the model or their probability distributions are unknown and cannot be agreed upon in this situation mordm analyzes the performance of management strategies across many future possible states of the world and provides information about alternatives robustness against deep uncertainty lempert and collins 2007 lempert et al 2002 for this purpose after determining the uncertain factors the latin hyper cube lhs sampling model is employed to sample from the uncertainty space and create sows in this regard lhs generates random values within the permissible ranges of uncertain factors and each combination of these values is defined as one sow then simulations are performed under each sow and the performance of design alternatives is evaluated 2 5 2 robustness evaluation in this step after subjecting alternatives to sows their performance is quantified using robustness assessment measures in this study regret based and satisficing based measures developed by herman et al 2015 are used for the robustness evaluation of design alternatives these two measures evaluate robustness from different points of view which can help decision makers to analyze alternatives performance from different aspects 2 5 2 1 regret based robustness regret based robustness calculates the deviation in alternatives performance due to deep uncertainty in other words this index evaluates the effect of selecting the wrong options in future scenarios savage 1951 in general regret based robustness aims to reduce system performance variations caused by deep uncertainty as compared to the ideal design in this case we calculate the system performance degradation between the selected design and the best case in each scenario as eq 6 6 r regret max i quantile s s f i x s sup y p f i y s f i x s 0 9 where f i x s represents the value of objective ith in sow s p is a set of design alternatives created by the optimization model s u p y p f i y s defines as the best solution in p amongst sows here the best solution is defined as the ideal solution in a multi objective environment the ideal solution obtains the best attainable value in each objective to identify the ideal solution after determining the uncertainty space and creating future sows design alternatives are run under uncertain scenarios sows and the best value in each objective is considered as the ideal solution s characteristics hadka et al 2015 indeed the upper bound of performance is calculated by modeling the design alternatives under sows determining the best value depends on the problem formulation since in our research objectives are being minimized minimum values of objectives are determined as ideal solution characteristics with these explanations ideal solution may not be among the design alternatives but was modeled within states of the world 2 5 2 2 satisficing based robustness mordm can enable decision makers to participate in the decision making process in this regard satisficing based robustness is defined as the measure that evaluates how alternatives can satisfy preferences in future plausible scenarios in this index eq 7 the possibility of design is determined according to the performance criteria specified by the stakeholders this measure is expressed as a fraction reflecting how many states of the world s fulfill stakeholders criteria 7 r satisficing 1 s s s i s f x s where i s f x s 1 if solution x meets the requirements defined by the stakeholders in the state of the world s and i s f x s 0 otherwise the precise definition of thresholds for quantifying satisficing based robustness is a critical step in implementing mordm and the continuation of the process depends on it in this regard stakeholders and their preferences should be identified there is no specific method for determining satisficing thresholds and it might differ according to the different research and problems ghodsi et al 2016a defined the robustness threshold as a desired utility function value each stakeholder strives to achieve in our research this definition was determined as a satisficing threshold for each stakeholder and formulated as eq 8 8 satisficingthreshold f i m a x w i f i m a x f i m i n where fi max and fi min denote the maximum and minimum values of utility function related to ith stakeholder in a set of alternatives respectively wi is the coefficient which was set to be 0 3 based on previous studies for determining the satisficing threshold in a set of alternatives swmm is run considering well characterized uncertainties the utility function s minimum and maximum values are then determined for each stakeholder finally the utility function s highest value less a particular percentage w of the difference between its maximum and minimum values is defined as the satisficing threshold 2 6 scenario discovery the final step in implementing mordm is scenario discovery in this step the model s outputs across uncertainty scenarios are analyzed to present a clear explanation of the combination of uncertain factors that effectively predict future sows lempert et al 2008 in this research two powerful scenario discovery approaches including prim and cart are employed in the following these two methods are defined in detail 2 6 1 patient rule induction method prim patient rule induction method prim friedman and fisher 1999 as a powerful scenario discovery approach tries to characterize the system s deterministic pattern from the uncertainty space fig 2 shows the process of scenario discovery using the prim method scenario discovery is started by determining the threshold which is utilized to divide the states of the world into two groups of acceptable and vulnerable vulnerable sows are those in which the design alternative violates the specific threshold in this study satisficing threshold defined in section 2 5 2 2 is applied to identify vulnerable sows in fig 2 after applying the threshold sows are colored blue and red representing acceptable and vulnerable sows respectively in this figure each point represents one state of the world in step 2 prim tries to capture a scenario box that covers the states of the world with poor performance this box has two main features coverage and density coverage is the number of vulnerable sows captured within a box in relation to the total in the entire space and density is defined as the total number of captured vulnerable sows over the total inside the box each scenario box represents ranges of uncertain factors x1 and x2 in which the candidate solution shows poor performance during the scenario discovery process prim iteratively changes the size of the box to lead to better coverage and density finally vulnerable ranges are visually presented to the decision makers by providing dimensions that are limited to the maximum and minimum values of uncertain factors 2 6 2 classification and regression trees cart classification and regression trees cart brieman et al 1984 is another scenario discovery approach that provides results in the form of a decision tree during the scenario discovery process the model s results under uncertainties are subdivided into two partitions each partition within a tree has a partitioning rule which is defined based on the minimization of the sum of variances for two resulting nodes hancock et al 2005 to put it another way minimization of relative error re for two resulting nodes in the tree is required to generate a node 9 r e d l 0 l y l y l 2 r 0 r y r y r 2 where y l and y r with respective means of y l and y r correspond to the left and right partitions variables in accordance with eq 9 the splitting rule d is defined as a statement in some estimator variable x to determine the right and left hypotheses 3 case study to analyze the application of our framework for robust urban runoff management district 10 of tehran municipality 51 21ʹ 14 e 51 22ʹ 47 e 35 42ʹ 01 n 35 40ʹ 05 n located in tehran iran is selected as the case study district 10 has an area of 807 ha of which 57 percent is dedicated to residential land use with high population 25 percent to urban passages and access and the remaining 18 percent is allocated to services such as green spaces and parks industrial plants and commercial buildings behroozi et al 2018 ghaedrahmati and alian 2019 the high population density low percentage of permeable surfaces numerous passages and streets have doubled the need for quality and quantity management of runoff in this region the region is divided into 84 sub catchments and generated runoff is drained by various channels fig 3 the most important channels are the gholgholi komeil and firoozabadi the total length of the modeled channels is about 79 km in which the proportion of main and second degree channels is 6000 m and 73 km respectively for hydraulic simulation the previous study results zistab consulting engineering company 2012 have been used to model the main and secondary channels the mehrabad synoptic station 35 41ʹ 35 n 51 18ʹ 46 e with an altitude of 1191 m above sea level is the nearest station to the study area and observed rainfall recorded at this station is used for estimating future design rainfall 3 1 stakeholders in the case study different organizations could be involved in the runoff management of a watershed the main stakeholders responsible for urban runoff management in district 10 of tehran municipality are presented in the following 3 1 1 stakeholder 1 tehran regional water company trwc trwc is in charge of supplying water for different sectors including agriculture domestic and environmental due to the presence of agricultural areas in southern tehran both runoff quality and quantity are preferred to be maximized by this stakeholder indeed regarding quantity management trwc does not prefer more lids implementation although to improve the quality of the receiving water implementing lids is desirable for this stakeholder so the utility function for trwc is defined as the maximization of runoff volume and the minimization of tss load at the catchment outlet and formulated as follows ghodsi et al 2016a raei et al 2019 10 minimizef 1 w r 1 1 v i v max w r 2 tss i tss max where i represents the runoff management scenario number vi stands for the runoff volume at the outlet for the ith scenario and vmax stands for the maximum runoff volume of the catchment in this regard swmm was run when no lids were implemented in the sub catchments and runoff volume at the outlet was considered as vmax tssi represents the total suspended solids load of scenario i and tssmax stands for the maximum tss contamination load when swmm was executed without implementing lid tools w r1 and w r2 are the relative importance weights of runoff quantity and quality which were set to 0 5 based on the same study by ghodsi et al 2016a 3 1 2 stakeholder 2 tehran municipality tm since the municipality of tehran has the duty to protect the drainage system network it seeks to minimize the capacity of the network in order to reduce the costs of construction maintenance and reconstruction therefore increasing the infiltration and reducing the runoff volume are preferred by this beneficiary drainage systems are generally open channels where washed contaminants can reduce water quality and cause odor and insects therefore reducing contamination load is another stakeholder preference also tehran municipality as one of the main sponsors of lids implementation seeks to reduce the implementation cost according to the above utility function of this stakeholder is defined as eq 11 11 minimizef 2 w m 1 c i c max w m 2 tss i tss max w m 3 v i v max where vi and tssi represent the total runoff volume and total tss contamination load at the watershed outlet for the ith urban runoff management scenario respectively ci is the cost of lids implementation for the ith scenario vmax and tssmax denote the runoff volume and tss load at the watershed outlet when no lids are implemented cmax is the maximum cost of implementation among design alternatives wm1 wm2 and wm3 are the relative importance of cost of implementation runoff volume and tss contamination load respectively these coefficients were set to 0 3 0 35 and 0 35 respectively in line with previous research by ghodsi et al 2016a 3 2 most sensitive parameters of swmm in the case study achieving reliable simulation results requires a calibrated model for the study area in this regard the simulation model developed in this study was calibrated using the quality and quantity observation data at the watershed outlet recorded by dayarian 2015 however the uncertainty of the model s key parameters should be considered for reliable decision making for sensitivity analysis of the swmm model in the study area in each step of the oat method one model s input parameter was varied in 10 intervals within its permissible range and the model output was computed results showed that the build up and wash off coefficients as well as the impervious coefficient of sub catchments have a significant effect on the quantity and quality of runoff compared to other parameters the dominant land use in the study area is residential with high population density and as it was expected the oat showed that the build up and wash off coefficients c1 and d1 in eqs 1 and 2 related to this land use have the most effect on the model s output because of insufficient statistical information about the mentioned parameters in the study area these parameters are considered with deep uncertainty ghodsi et al 2016a the impervious coefficient as one of the sub catchments characteristics is defined as the percentage of impervious area in the watershed due to the lack of adequate information about this parameter its values are usually estimated and have uncertainty to perform uncertainty analysis imperviousness c1 and d1 coefficients are allowed to vary within their permissible ranges limited by upper and lower bounds in order to set an upper bound for these parameters m1 percent of a deterministic value calibrated value is added to the calibrated value and in the same way the calibrated value minus m2 percent of the calibrated value denotes the lower bound of permissible variation based on a previous study conducted by ghodsi et al 2016a for parameters d1 and c1 m1 and m2 are set to be 50 and 25 respectively the center value lower and upper bounds for the mentioned parameters are listed in table 1 it should be noted that lower bounds and upper bounds are restricted to the meaningful ranges which are obtained from previous studies by zhang and hamlett 2006 and soltani 2009 4 results 4 1 determining design rainfall under climate change different climate models do not have the same performance in predicting hydrological variables in this regard performance analysis should be implemented in our research the long term monthly average rainfall predicted by gcms for the baseline period was compared to the observation data and different indexes were used to quantify the performance of models the performance evaluation indexes used in this research are defined in supplementary information as eqs s1 to s4 table 2 presents the performance of gcms in the study area there is no clear logic and unanimous approach to choosing x models from y and this entirely depends on the models performance raju and kumar 2020 so in this research according to the results the mpi esm lr model gets the best value in each statistical measure and is selected as the most appropriate model for predicting rainfall in the future to identify the 6 hour design rainfall for the future period the most common probability distributions used in hydrology such as normal distribution pearson log pearson type 3 and generalized extreme values gev were fitted to the 6 and 24 hour maximum annual rainfall series of the historical period results showed that the gev distribution model has the best performance and was selected for estimating maximum precipitation with different probability of occurrence then by calculating 6 and 24 hour rainfall with a 5 and 10 year return period the relationship between these values was determined and used to disaggregate the mpi esm lr daily prediction for the future period table 3 presents the 6 and 24 hour maximum rainfall of the base period the relationship between these values was identified as 0 501 and 0 515 for 5 and 10 year return periods respectively then by fitting the gev distribution model to the maximum annual daily rainfall predicted by mpi esm lr and downscaled by lars wg future rainfall with 5 and 10 year return periods were calculated finally 6 hour rainfall was obtained under climate change scenarios by multiplying these values by the mentioned coefficients the results shown in table 4 indicate that the maximum 6 hour rainfall of the future period 2021 2040 under the optimistic scenario rcp2 6 will be almost constant and increase under the pessimistic scenario rcp8 5 4 2 quantifying the robustness of the design alternatives using the mordm the third step in implementing mordm is to identify design alternatives this stage provides a high degree of knowledge about alternatives performance under well characterized uncertainty since three lids can be implemented in 84 simulated sub catchments 252 decision variables were determined for the optimization problem also each decision variable was constrained by the minimum and maximum values of the possible implementation area by coupling the swmm and nsga ii optimization model 100 design alternatives were produced as the optimal runoff management alternatives under rcp8 5 and rcp2 6 until this part of the research swmm s output was used as baseline data and design alternatives were produced based on well characterized uncertainties which implies that uncertainties surrounding the simulation were not taken into account so in this part the robustness of alternatives against deep uncertainty is evaluated as mentioned in section 3 2 c1 in build up equation eq 1 and d1 in wash off equation eq 2 as well as imperviousness coefficient were identified as parameters with deep uncertainties next 1000 latin hyper cube samples lhs were generated randomly for each parameter within the plausible and meaningful ranges defined in table 1 the output is a 1000 3 matrix each row representing one state of the world then for each design alternative swmm that was previously run under well characterized input parameters was implemented for sows and the robustness of the solutions was quantified based on measures defined in eqs 6 and 7 in order to quantify regret based robustness deviation from the ideal solution is calculated for each design alternative as stated in section 2 5 2 1 the ideal solution gets the best values in each objective since all the objectives are assumed to be minimized in our research the minimum values of tss load and runoff volume under sows were determined as the ideal solution s characteristics satisfying based robustness for each design alternative is quantified as a fraction of the scenarios that satisfy the requirements in this regard first by using eqs 10 and 11 maximum and minimum values of the stakeholders utility functions were calculated and then satisficing threshold for each stakeholder was determined based on eq 8 table 5 represents the calculated satisficing threshold for each stakeholder next for each design alternative the utility functions of stakeholders were calculated in each sow finally if the values of the utility functions calculated for each stakeholder were less than the satisficing threshold all stakeholders are in a state of satisfaction the number one is saved otherwise the number zero is stored the sum of these numbers divided by the number of sows indicates the satisficing based robustness of the design option fig 4 a d and 5 a d represent the robustness of design alternatives based on regret and satisfcing based measures respectively each glyph and line corresponds to one runoff management scheme and is colored based on its robustness value including regret based fig 4 and satisficing based fig 5 blue glyphs show robust scenarios whereas red glyphs represent poor performance against deep uncertainty key results derived from these visualization are stated below based on the color trend of figures the regret of selecting scenarios with a high percentage of lids is low and stakeholders preferences are more met in the future sows these figures relatively show the same region in the two robustness indices the bottom left corner areas with stricter plans for runoff management are highly robust since these two methods have fundamentally distinct measurement criteria observing the same trend in these approaches confirms that plans with a higher percentage of lids implementation are more robust against deep uncertainty in each climate scenario the robustness of the options decreases as the design rainfall s return period increases this is noticeable under rcp8 5 that the maximum satisfaction value decreases from 0 95 in fig 5 c to 0 56 in fig 5 d and there is no design option with a satisficing value of 1 this also confirmed that by increasing the return period the performance of the lids in controlling runoff decreases based on the satisficing criterion the sudden decreasing robustness in the middle design options under rcp8 5 t 10 is quite evident while the regret based values are close to each other and can not cover this significant vulnerability this indicates that the selection of the robustness measures can influence the process of decision making and various of these methods must be implemented in each research 4 3 vulnerability analysis after quantifying robustness and ranking solutions based on two measures discussed in the previous step we have employed prim and cart methods for vulnerability analysis these approaches discover the uncertainty space to find different combinations of parameters that lead to system vulnerabilities lempert et al 2008 to narrow the scope of this step we select an alternative for vulnerability assessment however it is normal in practice to investigate several design alternatives in this step in this research a solution from a region with both high robustness indicators has been selected randomly the highlighted solution shown in fig 5 d is selected for further analysis by prim and cart satisficing value of 0 55 for this alternative indicates that there exist key vulnerabilities leading to failures stakeholders preferences are not met in 45 of future states of the world but further analysis by prim and cart reveals the factors causing vulnerabilities in this research we define vulnerability states as those in which stakeholders preferences are not met utility function calculated for each stakeholder is more than satisficing threshold fig 6 shows the scenario discovery results represented by prim for the selected solution related to each stakeholder in these figures red boxes denote the range of uncertain parameters leading to unsatisfied stakeholders according to the result since tm seeks to reduce runoff volume prim has also introduced a high percentage of impervious coefficient as the range of vulnerability of this stakeholder because with increasing the sub catchments impermeable surfaces generated runoff also increases in contrast since trwc s preference is to increase runoff volume to supply water for the agriculture sector low values of the impervious coefficient are presented as the range of vulnerability for this beneficiary fig 6 also indicates that d1 is the critical factor for trwc moderate values of parameter d1 lead to susceptibility whereas this parameter is not significant for tm this stakeholder is allowed to sample all values of d1 the cart is another scenario discovery approach that can enable decision makers to identify partitions that provide a specific misclassification rate and derive the desired ex post evaluation fig 7 represents the key drivers of each stakeholder s vulnerability identified by the cart in our research we have partitioned solutions into two groups satisfied and unsatisfied a partition is named satisfied if the number of acceptable sows sows in which the solution satisfies the stakeholders preferences is greater than the unsatisfied circumstances otherwise the solution is classified as unsatisfied under each partition there is a rule that by following partitions are further divided the numbers in each partition represent the number of satisfied left and unsatisfied right scenarios respectively partitions are colored red or blue if the partition is identified as unsatisfied or satisfied respectively for example as shown in fig 7 b in the first partition before starting the route out of 1000 examined scenarios 565 sows are identified as satisfied while in 435 sows stakeholders preferences are not met so the partition is coded as blue 565 435 next continuing the right part of the tree if imp coe 80 and c1 84 only 6 of the other sows would be subjected to failure more constraints c1 78 decrease the unsatisfying rate to 0 6 the depth of each uncertainty factor in the tree it should be noted that an uncertainty might exist multiple times gives researchers decision makers an idea of how important it is to classify vulnerabilities factors that are closest to the source provide more predicting potential in exploring vulnerabilities as discussed based on prim analysis d1 was identified as a key factor of vulnerability for trwc but fig 7 a shows that cart was unable to identify this parameter as vulnerable so it is recommended to use both methods for scenario discovery 5 summary and conclusion this article investigated the implementation of a framework combining mordm with the swmm hydrological model to recognize robust lid implementation strategies under climate change conditions in this regard first by analyzing the performance of different gcms mpi esm lr was identified as the most appropriate model to simulate future rainfall changes then the prediction of this model under rcp8 5 and rcp2 6 were downscaled using the lars wg model the results showed that 6 hour rainfall under rcp2 6 is almost constant and will increase under rcp8 5 compared to the base period then using swmm nsgaii optimal scenarios of lids implementation were generated for runoff management under climate change sensitivity analysis by oat showed that imperviousness build up and wash off coefficients impact the model output most and uncertainties related to their values should be considered in the decision making process for this purpose mordm was implemented for uncertainty analysis first different combinations of uncertain factors were created as future states of the world next the robustness of each design alternative was quantified using regret and satisficing based measures results showed that plans with a higher percentage of lids are more robust against deep uncertainties on the other hand there was a decrease in the robustness of the solution which implies that the performance of the lids changes over different climate scenarios these measures can help to evaluate robustness from different points of view for example the satisficing based measure has the potential to incorporate stakeholders preferences into robustness evaluation and enables stakeholders to participate in the decision making process then an alternative was selected from the region with the highest robustness in which runoff volume and tss load can be reduced by 31 3 and 29 5 respectively further analysis on this alternative revealed that in 45 of future sows stakeholders preferences are vulnerable to being unmet in this regard prim and cart were employed for scenario discovery and identifying vulnerabilities using these approaches the allowable ranges of each uncertain parameter were visually introduced to the stakeholders and can enable them to know how their decisions can affect the system s vulnerability in future scenarios the framework implemented in this research shows that design criteria defined by stakeholders could affect the effectiveness of the model and cause robust urban runoff management plans to fail under different future scenarios generating robust lids implementation alternatives requires well defined deep uncertainties main stakeholders and their design criteria swmm mordm as a comprehensive framework enables decision makers to generate optimal runoff management schemes and evaluate how they are robust against future uncertain scenarios ultimately this framework provides robust decision support to address uncertainties that arise as urban runoff systems undergo change in future works the swmm mordm framework could be extended to incorporate other robustness evaluation indexes including regret type i and satisficing type ii more information about different robustness indexes is available in the previous study hadka et al 2015 robustness against deep uncertainties could be a powerful index for comparing design alternatives performance using different multi criteria decision making mcdm methods furthermore since swmm mordm provides a flexible framework it can incorporate other systems indicators such as resiliency vulnerability and sustainability into the decision making process under uncertainty also to further develop the climate change segment of the framework temperature based associations can be developed for the study area this method was effectively evaluated in previous research and can reduce the need for gcms alexander et al 2019 roderick

2362,understanding the mechanisms of water migration and heat transfer in frozen soil is essential for the selection of water resource management measures and determination of irrigation schemes for winters however the dynamics of the groundwater level and temperature caused by freezing and thawing and their impact on soil water redistribution remain unclear in this field study the mechanisms of water migration and heat transfer in the soil during the freeze thaw period under the combined action of the surface temperature change upper boundary and groundwater level fluctuation lower boundary were comprehensively considered with the theory and method of heat transfer freeze thaw characteristic curves of soil and water balance model the results showed that 1 the soil temperature distribution and groundwater temperature dynamics can be interpreted intuitively by the soil temperature gradient and accumulated heat storage 2 the freeze thaw characteristic curves of soil indicated that the soil temperature dynamics caused a phase transition of the soil water this further changed the soil water potential and permeability by 1 2 magnitudes and 1 5 magnitudes respectively which affected the direction and quantity of water migration 3 the water balance quantitatively revealed the controlling effect of groundwater level changes caused by freezing and thawing on soil moisture dynamics about 20 of the ice in the frozen layer was formed by the upward recharge of the groundwater during the freezing period in the thawing period most of this water returned to the groundwater 84 while the rest 16 increased the soil water content these results systematically explain the mechanisms of heat transfer and water migration between the soil water and the groundwater during the freeze thaw period providing a theoretical reference for agricultural water management in seasonally frozen regions keywords freeze thaw water balance heat transfer water migration data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction seasonally frozen soil is distributed worldwide in china it accounts for more than half of the total land area mainly in the northwest and northeast regions where water shortage is prominent wang et al 2019 significantly different from nonfrozen soil seasonally frozen soil is a special soil water system containing ice in which the variation in the ice content is equivalent to both the dynamic storage of the liquid water and the dynamic change in the heat therefore the water heat transfer within the frozen soil is strongly coupled under freeze thaw action the connection between soil water and groundwater is significantly intensified daniel and staricka 2000 miao et al 2017 during the freezing period soil water and groundwater migrate to the frozen layer under the action of a potential gradient formed in the soil water and the ice content in the frozen layer increases chen et al 2019 ireson et al 2013 stähli et al 1999 during the thawing period with the gradual warming of the air the water that melts from the snow and frozen soil seeps down causing a redistribution of the soil water li et al 2021 the ice melt water snowmelt water also contributes to groundwater resources contained in subglacial aquifers kong et al 2019 after the freeze thaw process when the liquid water content of the surface soil increases the excessive water may be associated with spring waterlogging mud pumping and other phenomena bayard et al 2005 however when the moisture in the surface soil decreases due to evaporation there is often soil salt accumulation and crop death due to physiological dehydration zhang and wang 2001 plants and crops require a suitable quality of water for growth particularly in arid areas with little rainfall sun et al 2021 a change in the dynamic balance between water and heat in a soil water system is directly related to the utilization of water resources and agricultural production practice bing et al 2015 chen et al 2022 liu et al 2021 musa et al 2016 wu et al 2018 xie and batlle aguilar 2017 zhu et al 2020 therefore research on the mechanisms of heat transfer and water migration in a soil water groundwater system during the freeze thaw process is important for the selection of water resource management measures and for the sustainable development of agriculture the interaction between soil water and heat during the freeze thaw period is mainly reflected in the following two aspects the variation in the soil temperature causes a phase change of the water which changes the soil water movement parameters and soil water potential in turn affecting water movement cary and mayland 1972 koopmans and miller 1966 lu et al 2021 moreover variations in the soil moisture content distribution and the proportion of water phases ice and water influence the thermal characteristics of the soil both spatially and temporally thus affecting the heat transfer process and temperature distribution in the soil he et al 2021 yi et al 2014 when the groundwater table depth is less than the sum of the depth affected by freezing and thawing and the height of the capillary rise of soil water the freeze thaw process will not only affect the groundwater temperature but also promote the groundwater to participate in the migration and redistribution of soil water liu et al 2019 lyu et al 2022 schneider 1961 shastri and sánchez 2012 willis et al 1963 the recharge and distribution of groundwater to the vadose zone during the freezing period and the recharge contributions of the snowmelt water and frozen layer meltwater to groundwater during the thawing period jointly control the moisture distribution and groundwater level dynamics dai et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 current studies on soil moisture and heat transfer under freezing and thawing mainly focused on the influence of air temperature and precipitation conditions on the soil temperature and humidity dynamics within the atmosphere and vadose zone iwata et al 2011 sun et al 2021 wang et al 2019 comprehensive analyses of the atmosphere vadose zone groundwater system as a whole are lacking in addition the lower boundary of soil is often treated as a constant groundwater table alkhaier et al 2012 hansson and lundin 2006 shoop and bigl 1997 ignoring the impact of freeze thaw induced water level fluctuation on soil water migration and redistribution in the entire atmosphere soil water groundwater system this results in an overestimation of the exchange between groundwater and soil water xie et al 2021 and making it difficult to explain the dynamic causes of the continuous decrease in the groundwater temperature during the freeze thaw period studies have been conducted on the use of a hydrothermal coupling model and a multivariate statistical model to quantitatively analyze the impact of water level fluctuation on soil moisture dynamics during the freeze thaw period cui et al 2020 xie et al 2021 however research on the mechanisms of soil water migration and heat transfer during this period under the combined effect of surface upper boundary temperature variation and groundwater level lower boundary fluctuation under hydrothermal coupling conditions is lacking in this study taking a typical site in northeast china s seasonally frozen soil region as an example and considering the atmosphere soil water and groundwater as an overall research object the temperature and water distribution characteristics of the soil water and groundwater in this region were analyzed including the process and mechanisms of heat transfer and water migration during the freeze thaw period based on the conservation relationship of the water and heat transfer process in the soil water groundwater system the impact of groundwater on soil moisture redistribution during the freeze thaw period was analyzed based on the water balance providing a basis for formulating a reasonable water management plan for winters 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted at the changchun site located in changchun city jilin china fig 1 the site is characterized by a continental monsoon climate the average annual precipitation is 583 8 mm and the average annual evaporation is 1239 mm the site is covered by frozen soil for six months from november to april and the maximum freezing depth during the monitoring period was approximately 1 m regarding the soil type it is mainly loess the soil is classified as miscellaneous fill with a thickness of approximately 30 cm underlain by silty loess loam to a depth of 175 cm loess loam with a soil thickness between 175 and 380 cm and loam below 380 cm phreatic water is stored in the quaternary loess layer evaluated from pumping tests the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer is 0 5 m d and the specific yield is 0 03 because the site terrain belongs to a plain area the slope of the ground terrain is gentle and the hydraulic gradient of the groundwater is small approximately 5 therefore the lateral flow is low without any exploitation around the study site the aquifer is mainly recharged by precipitation and discharged by evaporation the groundwater at the site flows in an approximately west to east direction 2 2 data collection in our study the data collected during november 2018 to april 2019 were used as an example daily

automatic water level logger hobo u20 001 04 onset computer corporation usa except for the meteorological data which were monitored every day the other data were monitored every 30 min 2 3 data analysis a pearson s correlation analysis was performed to identify the influence of the air temperature on the soil temperature and eq 1 was used to estimate the freezing and thawing rate in the

corresponding frozen soil thickness and time when the freezing or thawing depth reaches i 1 and i respectively on this basis the soil temperature gradient δ t s δ z zhang et al 2019 and heat storage δ

the soil water potential soil water potential gradient and permeability coefficient the potential energy ψ the sum of the matrix potential and osmotic potential in a frozen soil can be calculated using the generalized clapeyron equation assuming ice at standard atmospheric pressure the potential energy ψ of an aqueous solution passing through pores can be determined using the following variant

the matrix potential osmotic potential and gravity potential ψ z m is the gravitational potential taking the ground surface as the base level negative below the surface on this basis the soil water

water potential gradient ψ sh z1 and ψ sh z2 m represent the soil water potentials at depths z 1 and z 2 respectively δ ψ total δ z 0 indicates that water migrates from deep to shallow regions otherwise it migrates from shallow to deep regions tarnawski and wagner 1996 used the relative permeability coefficient formula for unfrozen soil obtained by brooks and corey 1964 to estimate the

subscripts i 1 3 correspond to clay silt and sandy soils respectively 3 results 3 1 air temperature precipitation and frozen soil dynamics during freeze thaw period the changes in the air temperature fig 2 a and soil freezing depth fig 2b indicate that the freezing and thawing processes started in early november the daily average air temperature started to be below 0 c and the surface freeze thaw cycle occurred and ended in mid to late april of the following year the daily average temperature continued to be above 0 c and the surface freeze thaw cycle disappeared during this period the daily average air temperature gradually decreased from 10 9 to 10 9 c in november to 21 2 to 1 2 c in late december and then gradually increased to 4 6 to 22 3 c in march and april with an overall fluctuation range of 21 2 to 22 3 c during the freeze thaw period the precipitation was in the form of snowfall with a total precipitation of 32 2 mm the precipitation in each episode was low ranging from 0 1 to 13 4 mm under the influence of air temperature the development of the frozen soil depth position of the 0 c isotherm showed an overall trend of first increasing and then decreasing during the freeze thaw period fig 2b specifically as the air temperature dropped from 0 7 to 10 6 c in early december the freezing depth continued to increase and developed to a maximum of approximately 90 cm in late february after the surface began to freeze for 86 days thereafter the air temperature began to rise to 0 c and above and the lower and upper layer soil frosts began thawing almost simultaneously finally the soil profile melted in early march however as the air temperature fluctuated at approximately 0 c in march the surface was still experiencing multiple freeze thaw cycles and there were unstable frozen layers no frozen layer appeared in the soil profile until the air temperature continued to be above 0 c in late april 3 2 soil temperature dynamics during freeze thaw period as shown in fig 3 a1 and a2 the soil temperature varied dramatically under the influence of air temperature and its fluctuation amplitude decreased with increasing depth the surface soil temperature fluctuated the most reaching as high as about 60 c maximum minus minimum the soil temperature at the bottom 230 cm fluctuated the least and its temperature range was about 10 c with the soil temperature below 0 c the soil in each layer entered the freezing state in turn the surface soil temperature 0 10 cm started to be below 0 c in late november table 2 the freezing time of the other soil layers gradually lagged behind with increasing depth and there was a significant difference between the upper and lower 40 cm specifically in the range of 10 40 cm the time lag of soil freezing was 3 13 days for every 10 cm increase in the soil depth while it increased to 12 16 days in the soil depth range of 40 80 cm table 2 overall the freezing rate of the shallow layer within 40 cm 0 77 3 33 cm day was higher than that of the deep layer within 40 80 cm 0 83 1 25 cm day unlike the freezing process in which the soil temperature decreased from the surface layer to the deeper layer an increase in the soil temperature to above 0 c during melting started from the surface layer 0 10 cm and the deep layer 65 80 cm simultaneously both in late february table 2 in the thawing process there was a lag in the thawing time from the surface layer to the middle of the frozen layer and from the deep layer to the middle of the frozen layer specifically the thawing time of the surface layer from 10 to 20 cm delayed by seven days and the thawing rate was 1 43 cm day the lag in the thawing time from 65 to 50 cm in the deep layer was six days and the thawing rate was 2 5 cm day the 20 50 cm soil layer in the middle began to thaw almost on the same day from the above it is clear that the soil thawing rate was higher than the freezing rate affected by the freezing and thawing of the soil the temporal and spatial variations in the monthly average soil temperature in the vertical direction showed evident zoning characteristics with a boundary of 100 cm the nearest monitoring depth below the maximum freezing depth fig 4 a in the range of 0 100 cm the temporal and spatial variations in the soil temperature were evident with the occurrence of freezing and thawing of the soil specifically in the freezing period from november to february the depth range of the monthly average soil temperature below 0 c continuously extended to the deeper layer while in the thawing period from march to april the monthly average soil temperature kept rising and its increase in the shallow layer was greater than that in the deep layer until the monthly average soil temperature in all the layers was greater than 0 c accordingly the soil temperature changed from being higher in the deep layer than in the shallow layer during the freezing period to being higher in the shallow layer than in the deep layer during the thawing period in contrast the monthly average soil temperature in the range of 100 230 cm was always greater than 0 c throughout the freeze thaw period and its variation line with depth was almost parallel specifically in the entire freeze thaw period the soil temperature in this range decreased overall and the deep soil temperature was always greater than the shallow soil temperature by comparing the soil temperature profiles before and after freezing and thawing fig 4a the soil temperature in the range of 0 20 cm increased significantly while that in the range of 20 230 cm decreased significantly the temperature distribution in the vertical direction also changed from a monotonic distribution before freezing lower at the top and higher at the bottom to a bidirectional distribution high at the top and bottom and minimum in the middle that is the temperature decreased from the top and bottom toward the middle layer 3 3 dynamics of soil liquid water content during freeze thaw period the changes in the soil liquid water content were strongly correlated with the soil temperature the phase change in the soil water occurred near 0 c and the liquid water content decreased and increased due to the freezing and thawing processes respectively when the soil was completely frozen the liquid water content of each layer in the frozen zone was reduced to about 16 84 of that in the pre freezing period fig 3b1 the liquid water content at the surface was the lowest when it was completely frozen fluctuating in the range of about 1 4 fig 3b1 while that at the remaining depths was in the range of about 17 25 fig 3b1 in addition the duration for which the soil liquid water content maintained a low value decreased with increasing soil depth under the influence of freezing and thawing the temporal and spatial variations in the monthly average soil liquid water content also showed zonation with a boundary of 100 cm fig 4b in the range of 0 100 cm the phase transition made the seasonal variation in the soil liquid water content evident specifically in the freezing period from november to february the range of the soil layer where the monthly average liquid water content of the soil was reduced due to freezing developed to the deep layer while in the thawing period from march to april the monthly average soil liquid water content increased overall with thawing and the increase in the shallow layer was greater than that in the deep layer in contrast the soil liquid water content in the 100 230 cm layer hardly changed in the freeze thaw period figs 3b2 and 4b by comparing the liquid water profiles before and after freeze thaw fig 4b the soil moisture in all the layers except on the surface 0 10 cm increased compared with that before freezing 3 4 dynamics of groundwater level and groundwater temperature during the freeze thaw period with the freezing and thawing of the soil the groundwater table depth showed a seasonal fluctuation phenomenon of first increasing and then decreasing and its variation trend was similar to that of the freezing depth in the initial stage of freezing with the air temperature fluctuating around 0 c the groundwater table depth fluctuated around 2 70 m fig 5 with the air temperature below 0 c and soil freezing depth developing steadily in early december the rate of groundwater level decline 0 51 cm day began to increase significantly in late february the groundwater table depth reached its maximum value 3 20 m which came approximately five days later than the occurrence of the maximum freezing depth in the middle of december the slight rise in the water level corresponded to the recharge process of frost melt water when the daily maximum air temperature rose to above 0 c with the subsequent after late february air temperature rising above 0 c the soil began to melt in both directions meanwhile the groundwater table depth gradually decreased at a rate of 0 76 cm d which was slightly higher than that in the freezing period finally it stabilized at 2 78 m in mid april unlike the change in the groundwater level the groundwater temperature dropped from 11 04 c since the freeze thaw period the groundwater temperature did not stabilize at 8 78 c until the beginning of april when the air temperature had been continuously above 0 c for half a month even in the stage of water level rise the rate at which the groundwater temperature decreased hardly changed and it was always maintained at approximately 0 02 c day 4 discussion 4 1 heat transfer process during the freeze thaw period and distribution characteristics of soil temperature and groundwater temperature the temporal variation in the soil temperature during the freezing and thawing period was mainly dominated by the air temperature moreover the heat transfer efficiency between the atmosphere and soil had the characteristics of layer by layer decrease spatially spatially the zonation results of the monthly average soil temperature showed that the air temperature mainly affected the soil temperature dynamics in the range of 0 100 cm fig 4a the pearson s correlation coefficient r between the air and soil temperatures showed that the correlation between the two was stronger in the range of 0 50 cm and r decreased with increasing depth fig 6 at 50 cm the correlation between the air and soil temperatures was already weak r 0 3563 meanwhile the slope of the linear fitting st a at b between the air and soil temperatures within 0 50 cm i e the heat transfer efficiency between them sun et al 2021 decreased exponentially with increasing depth a 0 72 0 95 d 0 09 r2 0 9929 fig 7 the results showed that the response of the soil temperature to the air temperature was the fastest at the surface and the response of the soil temperature to the air temperature gradually weakened with the increase in the depth temporally the direction of heat transfer in the soil profile changed regularly with the air temperature during the freeze thaw process during the freezing period the soil temperature gradient within the range of 0 230 cm was greater than 0 fig 8 a b indicating that the heat transferred upward and was eventually lost from the surface resulting in a decreasing trend in the soil temperature of the profile fig 8c during the thawing period as the air temperature rose to above 0 c in late february the temperature gradient of the soil surface 0 10 cm in the range of 0 100 cm began to be below 0 fig 8a and the heat was transferred downward however the soil temperature gradient in the range of 100 230 cm was still greater than 0 fig 8b indicating that the unfrozen layer continued to transfer heat to the upper soil layer under the influence of the lagged heat transfer of the air temperature this corresponded to the phenomenon wherein the soil temperature rose in the range of 0 100 cm and continued to decrease in the range of 100 230 cm in the thawing stage during the period from late february to early april the positive and negative temperature gradients of the soil layer in the range of 10 100 cm crossed between layers fig 8b this was attributed to the fact that the air temperature still fluctuated at approximately 0 c and the soil layer was affected by bi directional heat transfer directions indicated by arrows in fig 8c between the surface and the deep unfrozen layer among them the 30 50 cm and 60 80 cm layers were interlayers with upward heat transfer and whose temperature gradient was greater than 0 their thickness gradually decreased with increasing surface soil temperature gradient and these layers finally disappeared in early april after the air temperature remained above 0 c for half a month moreover the soil layer in the range of 0 100 cm began to uniformly transfer heat downward in the thawing stage the difference in the heat transfer between the upper frozen layer and the lower unfrozen layer finally resulted in a bi directionally decreasing distribution of the soil temperature from the top and bottom to the middle layer figs 4a and 8c a notable phenomenon here is that the variation trend in the groundwater temperature did not change with the increase in the soil temperature and water level after the end of the freezing period this phenomenon can be directly explained by introducing the concept of accumulated soil daily heat storage fig 8d although the heat transfer direction changed since the thawing period and the soil daily heat storage started to fluctuate at approximately 0 which meant that the soil layer absorbed and released heat alternately the accumulated soil daily heat storage in the same period was still less than 0 overall and its changing trend tended to stabilize and did not continue to decrease the change in the accumulated soil daily heat storage indicated that the heat absorbed in the thawing period could not compensate for the heat released in the freezing period resulting in the loss of heat in the soil compared with the initial state which also controlled the groundwater temperature decline throughout the freeze thaw period this made the dynamics of the groundwater temperature and the accumulated soil daily heat storage consistent 4 2 characteristics and mechanism of soil water migration and distribution driven by soil temperature change during the freeze thaw period air temperature not only directly drove the change in the soil temperature but also influenced the dynamics of the soil liquid water content due to the co variation in the soil temperature and soil liquid water content during the freeze thaw process phase change and moisture transfer of the soil liquid water were key processes controlling the soil water distribution during the freeze thaw period the variation in the soil temperature directly affected the phase transition of water which in turn affected the amount of the soil liquid water content there was a strong correlation between the soil liquid water and heat changes during the freeze thaw process fig 9 moreover the variation in the soil liquid water content in the different soil layers with the soil temperature tended to be consistent overall with the decrease in the soil temperature the soil liquid water content reduced to a minimum value due to phase transition and maintained a dynamic equilibrium subsequently as the soil warmed up the soil liquid water content increased as the ice melted overall the liquid water content varied nonlinearly with the soil temperature between the lowest liquid water content during soil freezing and the liquid water content after the end of thawing table 3 specifically before the freezing front reached the soil layer in the early freezing stage the soil temperature in the layer decreased gradually and the variation in the liquid water content was small section ab when the soil in each layer was frozen successively from late november to early january point b the liquid water content decreased rapidly in a narrow temperature range with a significant variation section bc which was attributed to the fact that the free water with a large proportion in the pores was frozen first however when the soil temperature of each layer further decreased to 0 8 to 0 c from late november to early february point c the reduction rate of the liquid water content decreased due to the limited amount of freezable liquid water until the soil temperature further decreased to 9 8 to 0 7 c from early february to mid february point d and the liquid water content of each layer reached the lowest under the influence of different degrees of phase transition section cd however the change trend in the liquid water content in the thawing period was opposite to the decreasing trend in the liquid water content in the freezing period as the soil temperature of each layer rose to 0 7 to 0 5 c point e from the end of february to the beginning of march the liquid water content gradually increased due to the melting of ice however in this process under the influence of supercooling effect the liquid water content at the same soil temperature was lower than that in the freezing stage showing an evident lag thereafter when the soil temperature of each layer continued to rise to 0 6 1 1 c from mid march to late april point f the rising rate of the soil liquid water content began to be greater than the decreasing rate of the soil liquid water content in the same temperature range rateef ratebc these results indicated that the variation in the soil liquid water content during the thawing period was not only related to phase transformation but also affected by water migration between the soil layers after the end of the thawing stage in late april the liquid water content point g of all layers except near the surface 0 10 cm increased compared with that of the initial frozen water content point a in early november directions indicated by arrows in fig 9 the recharge of water from the deep parts of the vadose zone and groundwater to the surface frozen layer during the freezing period was characterized profile water redistribution occurred during the thawing period notably the freeze thaw characteristic curves obtained from the measured soil data at various depths in the field were different from those obtained from laboratory tests in previous studies theoretically due to the influence of solutes in the soil the freezing temperature temperature at point b corresponding to the intersection point between the gradual decline in the liquid water content and the beginning of the sharp drop should be less than or equal to 0 c pikul et al 1989 wu et al 2018 however in this study the liquid water content of the soil began to drop when the soil temperature was above 0 c and this was more evident in the deep layer the water in the unfrozen layers just below the freezing front was strongly absorbed due to the suction yielded at the freezing front wang and akae 2004 therefore the soil liquid water content decreased significantly due to the migration of water to the upper frozen layer before phase transition under laboratory conditions the water content often drops suddenly when the soil temperature reaches freezing temperature 0 c azmatch et al 2012 which is different from field results this further lead to the phenomenon that the simulated moisture may not decrease synchronously with the actual moisture reported in a simulation study xie et al 2021 this also means that the simulated liquid water flux values may change later than the actual situation thereby affecting the estimation of the relevant water balance and water level dynamics since the freeze thaw characteristic curve is key to the coupled water and heat transport in water transport simulations one of the essential issues in these models is obtaining a relevant expression for the freeze thaw characteristic curve of the soil zhou et al 2020 thus the freeze thaw characteristic curve measured for the actual site should be used to simulate the water migration at the field scale in practice which can help better consider the actual situation of water change the variations in the air and soil temperatures not only caused phase transformation of soil water but also controlled and affected the water migration process by changing the distributions of the soil water potential and permeability at different depths the soil water potential of the frozen soil can be estimated by measuring the soil temperature accurately azmatch et al 2012 koopmans and miller 1966 according to the freezing point reduction equation eqs 5 7 the changes in the water potential fig 10 c and water potential gradient fig 10a and b within the frozen layer are shown in fig 10 their change trends were synchronized with those of the soil temperature and soil temperature gradient respectively in the freezing period the soil water potential decreased with decreasing soil temperature while the soil temperature gradient and soil water potential gradient increased in the thawing period the soil water potential increased with increasing soil temperature while the soil temperature gradient and soil water potential gradient decreased specifically when the soil temperature in the profile fluctuated between 0 1 and 1 1 c in the early freezing stage the soil water potential varied from 12 56 to 136 92 m and the soil water potential gradient fluctuated between 248 04 and 1118 91 from every degree celsius below zero the cryogenic suction associated with the soil water potential which develops between the ice and the water phases in frozen soils builds up arzanfudi and al khoury 2018 the cryogenic suction gives rise to the upward migration of water from the unfrozen region to the frozen region soil water potential gradient is greater than 0 arzanfudi and al khoury 2018 which in turn results in a decline in the groundwater level fig 5 in mid december when the soil temperature decreased to 0 2 to 11 7 c the range of the soil water potential decreased to 25 32 to 1433 65 m and the soil water potential gradient increased to 1976 91 7041 49 approximately 6 8 times that of the initial stage resulting in an increase in the rate of water level decline fig 5 this phenomenon indirectly reflects that the amount of migrated water depends on the soil water potential gradient when the soil temperature in the profile decreased to 0 7 to 9 6 c in mid february the variation range of the soil water potential decreased to 87 98 to 1180 22 m 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than that in the early freezing stage and the soil water potential gradient ranged from 614 67 to 5120 49 from mid december to late february due to the small change in the soil water potential gradient the rate of water level decline also remained stable fig 5 subsequently in early march as the soil temperature rose to 0 1 to 6 c the soil water potential rose to 12 76 to 741 66 m and the soil water potential gradient decreased to 1 to 125 57 at the same time moisture moved downward and the water level began to rise this is because upon thawing the cryogenic suction diminished which made the water to return to its initial equilibrium condition by reversing the direction of migration from upward to downward arzanfudi and al khoury 2018 overall the soil water potential became more negative with decreasing soil temperature in the freezing period which made the soil water in the unfrozen layer and groundwater to move continuously toward the freezing front driven by a high water potential gradient finally decreasing the groundwater level during the thawing period as the soil temperature continued to rise and the frozen layer began to thaw from the surface downward and from the bottom of the frozen layer upward the water potential under the frozen layer began to increase which in turn drove the infiltration of water to recharge the groundwater and increase the water level in the above process the drastic change in the soil liquid water content also determined the relative permeability coefficient of soil which then affected the soil water migration flux the mathematical model proposed by tarnawski and wagner eqs 8 11 can be used to estimate the permeability of unsaturated frozen soil azmatch et al 2012 overall the fluctuation range of the permeability coefficient on the surface 0 cm was much wider than that at other depths 10 230 cm fig 11 and the variation had no evident rule which was attributed to the significant fluctuation in the liquid water content in the pores due to the interference of external environment fig 3b1 the soil permeability within the frozen layer 10 100 cm changed seasonally throughout the freeze thaw period showing a decreasing dynamic equilibrium rising trend however the soil permeability remained stable in the nonfrozen layer range 100 230 cm specifically during the freezing period the relative permeability coefficient in the 10 100 cm range decreased from 3 12 10 10 3 67 10 6 to 2 53 10 14 4 37 10 7 m d and the permeability coefficient of each layer decreased by 1 5 orders of magnitude this was attributed to the significant decrease in the soil effective porosity after the formation of ice by water in situ and water migration from groundwater to the frozen layer as the effective porosity increased with increasing liquid water after soil thawing the soil permeability coefficient recovered to 3 69 10 9 4 33 10 6 m d in the depth range of 10 100 cm which promoted the frost melt water infiltration however in the nonfrozen layer that is within the range of 100 230 cm the relative permeability coefficient of the soil pores was unchanged because the water content in the entire freeze thaw period was recharged by groundwater and upper melt water which ensured a stable water transfer from groundwater to the frozen layer in the freezing period and from the frozen layer to groundwater in the thawing period compared with the initial state of freezing after thawing the surface permeability coefficient decreased significantly however the permeability coefficient of the other layers of soil increased which was the result of soil water redistribution as reflected in the above freeze thaw characteristic curve 4 3 effect of groundwater on soil water redistribution in the freeze thaw period based on water balance the above analysis showed that the change in the groundwater level during the freeze thaw period was the result of the exchange between groundwater and soil water therefore groundwater has an important influence on the redistribution of soil water the effect of groundwater on soil water redistribution can be quantitatively calculated and analyzed based on the principle of water balance the region between the surface z 0 and the maximum groundwater table depth z h 2 was taken as the equilibrium domain the lower boundary of the equilibrium domain was considered the zero flux boundary while the water exchange between the upper boundary and the external environment was via evaporation and rainfall ma et al 2012 fig 12 considering that there was no hindrance to capillary water transfer and that groundwater could be exchanged with the soil water the water content of the unfrozen layer between the maximum monitoring depth of the soil water 230 cm and the groundwater table was assumed to be the field capacity θ cf in addition the time control points in the equilibrium calculation were the time at which the water level and soil water were in their original state before freezing t 1 the occurrence time of the maximum freezing depth t 2 and the time at which the water level started to stabilize t 3 in the entire freeze thaw process among them t 1 and t 3 were the starting and ending points of the freeze thaw process respectively while t 2 simply divided the freeze thaw process into freezing and thawing stages w 1 w 2 and w 3 and their equilibrium relationships at t 1 t 2 and t 3 satisfied the following equations 12 w 1 i 0 230 θ 1 i h i h 1 230 θ cf h 2 h 1 θ sat 13 w 2 i 0 z f θ 2d i h i i z f 230 θ 2i h

liquid water content of layer i h i cm is the depth represented by the monitoring point corresponding to layer i θ di cm3 cm3 is the total water content the sum of the liquid water content and the ice

is the maximum freezing depth e and p cm are the evaporation and rainfall snow respectively the subscripts f and t correspond to the freezing and thawing periods respectively the amount of water migration between the soil water and groundwater during the freezing and thawing periods can be estimated as follows 1 moisture migration during the freezing period the amount of groundwater that migrates upward is the amount of water released after the water level drops 17 δ w m h 2 h 1 θ sat θ cf where δ w m cm is the amount of groundwater migrated to the upper soil layer during the freezing period the water content of the frozen layer is not only affected by the recharging of the groundwater but also by the evaporation and rainfall of the upper boundary the water balance in the frozen layer is as follows 18 δ w d δ w m δ w zf 230 p f e f 19 δ w zf 230 i z f 230 θ 2i θ 1i h i where δ w d cm is the change in the water content per unit area within the frozen layer during the freezing period δ w zf 230 cm is the change in the water content per unit area within the range from the maximum freezing depth to 230 cm during the freezing period from the maximum freezing depth the average ice content θ ice of each layer within the frozen layer at t 2 can be calculated 20 θ i ce θ i c e m θ i c e s 21 θ i c e m δ w d z f 22 θ i c e s δ w u f 0 z f z f 23 δ w uf 0 z f i 0 z f θ 1i θ 2i h

i c e s cm3 cm3 is the average content of the ice formed by in situ freezing of the liquid water within the frozen layer δ w uf 0 z f cm is the difference in the unfrozen water content per unit area within the frozen layer at t 1 and t 2 the relationship between the average ice content of the frozen layer formed by groundwater migration and the total water content θ 2d i of the frozen layer is as follows 24 θ 2d i θ 1 i θ i ce m 2 amount of water migration during the thawing period when water released from the melting of the frozen layer and snowmelt infiltrated to recharge the groundwater the recharge quantity of the groundwater at t 3 is 25 δ w r h 2 h 3 θ sat θ cf where δ w r cm is the amount of recharge received by groundwater during the thawing period according to the estimation models of the water balance eqs 12 16 and water migration eqs 17 25 in the soil water groundwater system the change in the water content in the equilibrium region can be calculated by substituting the groundwater table depth soil liquid water content and maximum freezing depth at each time control point while ignoring the difference between soil evaporation and precipitation in the normal freezing period p f e f 0 on this basis the moisture balance and migration terms can be calculated as follows table 4 a comparison of the water volumes in the equilibrium region before freezing and thawing w 1 and after the freeze thaw period w 3 showed a increase in the overall water volume this was because the evaporation of the upper boundary was smaller than the supply of snowmelt p t e t 0 and the intensity of effective infiltration p t e t divided by melt duration t 3 t 2 was about 0 05 mm day due to the fine particles in the site medium the high capillary rise and the small initial groundwater table depth the shallow groundwater table depth played an important role in transporting more water to the upper layer thereby promoting the storage of water during the melting period and finally resulting in a increase of moisture in the soil the overall equilibrium of the equilibrium domain was mainly affected by evaporation and precipitation at the upper boundary while the redistribution of the soil moisture was closely related to the exchange between soil water and groundwater during the freezing period groundwater migrated to the frozen layer with a migration amount of 1 5 cm δ w m which was stored in the vadose zone in the form of ice as the groundwater migrated to the frozen layer a part of the water in the unfrozen layer below the maximum freezing depth also migrated upward to the frozen layer therefore the ice content formed by migration within the frozen layer was approximately 1 7 cm which was slightly greater than δ w m from the average to the maximum freezing depth range the amount of ice formed by migration θ ice m was approximately 25 of that formed by in situ water freezing θ ice s in the soil frozen layer during the thawing period the water stored in the soil as ice will be redistributed in the form of infiltration to the groundwater and storage in the vadose zone the infiltration to the groundwater part δ w r was 1 26 cm accounting for about 84 of the recharge amount δ w m of groundwater to the vadose zone in the freezing period the amount of water stored in the vadose zone was determined by the effective infiltration amount p t e t and the difference between the groundwater recharge amount δ w r in the thawing period and the groundwater discharge amount δ w m in the freezing period which was approximately 0 56 cm from the analysis in section 4 2 since the water content in the 0 10 cm surface layer after thawing was lower than that before freezing the water content of 0 56 cm was mainly stored in the range of soil depths affected by freeze thaw action except in the surface layer 10 125 cm fig 4b and the water content of these layers evidently increased while the water content of deeper soil 125 230 cm changed slightly in summary the calculation results showed that most of the water that migrated to the soil layer during the freezing period returned to the groundwater during the melting period the remaining fraction was stored in the vadose zone which mainly increased the water content in the range of the soil depth affected by freeze thaw action except in the surface layer compared with that before the freeze thaw period 5 conclusions in areas with shallow groundwater the air temperature dynamics at the upper boundary of soil and the groundwater level at the lower boundary were found to have important effects on the heat transfer and water migration in a soil groundwater system during the freeze thaw period this influence was directly related to the dynamics and distribution of the water and heat in the vadose zone the heat transfer efficiency between the atmosphere and soil could be characterized by a layer by layer decrease spatially resulting in the zonation of the soil temperature dynamics with the maximum freezing depth in different zones the variation in the heat transfer process with time made the soil temperature in the frozen layer to fluctuate in a drop rise manner while the soil temperature in the unfrozen layer decreased continuously resulting in a bi directional distribution of the soil profile temperature decreasing from the top and bottom to the middle layer after the thawing period notably the heat absorbed by soil during the thawing period could not compensate for the heat lost during the freezing period therefore the groundwater temperature decreased throughout the freeze thaw period which was different from the increasing trends in the air temperature and groundwater level during the thawing period therefore the dynamics of the accumulated soil daily heat storage in the unfrozen layer could explain the variation in the groundwater temperature in fact the groundwater temperature is considered to be affected not only by heat conduction but also by the induced groundwater flow due to groundwater mining shohei et al 2016 in this study the relationship between the groundwater temperature and soil heat storage was obtained under the condition that the groundwater level was only affected by freezing and thawing with no effect from external human activities in the following study in addition to the effect of heat transfer on the dynamics of the groundwater temperature other factors such as the groundwater flow induced by groundwater mining need to be considered under the direct influence of soil temperature the liquid water content in the soil profile presented the same zonation as the soil temperature in the frozen layer the freeze thaw characteristic curve revealed the influence of the water phase change water migration and supercooling effect on the dynamics of the soil liquid water content moreover it reflected a different law from that observed in the laboratory experiment that is the soil moisture dropped rapidly when the soil temperature was above 0 c this result suggests that in field simulations it is necessary to obtain freeze thaw characteristic curves in situ for more realistic simulation results in addition to the direct influence of the soil temperature on water dynamics reflected by phase transformation the variation trends in the soil water potential soil water potential gradient permeability coefficient and groundwater level with the soil temperature and soil liquid water content reflected an indirect effect of the soil temperature on water migration and distribution under the direct and indirect influences of the soil temperature the soil liquid water redistributed after the end of the thawing period showing that the surface 0 10 cm water content decreased compared with the initial state while the water content in the remaining layers 10 230 cm increased the results of the quantitative calculation based on water equilibrium revealed that the change in the soil moisture was the result of water infiltration at the upper boundary and redistribution of the groundwater recharge in the soil layer in addition to subtracting the amount of water seeping into the groundwater the remaining groundwater that recharged to the frozen layer in the freezing period was stored in the vadose zone because of which ultimately the water stored in the vadose zone became higher than that at the beginning of the freezing period after the end of the thawing period therefore the influence of groundwater level dynamics on soil water redistribution during the freeze thaw period cannot be ignored these results provide a theoretical basis for shedding new light on the soil temperature and water distribution in the vadose zone after the end of the thawing period which in turn can help formulate water management plans for winters however in this study the effects of snow accumulation and melting were not discussed in more datail due to the low and scattered winter

2362,understanding the mechanisms of water migration and heat transfer in frozen soil is essential for the selection of water resource management measures and determination of irrigation schemes for winters however the dynamics of the groundwater level and temperature caused by freezing and thawing and their impact on soil water redistribution remain unclear in this field study the mechanisms of water migration and heat transfer in the soil during the freeze thaw period under the combined action of the surface temperature change upper boundary and groundwater level fluctuation lower boundary were comprehensively considered with the theory and method of heat transfer freeze thaw characteristic curves of soil and water balance model the results showed that 1 the soil temperature distribution and groundwater temperature dynamics can be interpreted intuitively by the soil temperature gradient and accumulated heat storage 2 the freeze thaw characteristic curves of soil indicated that the soil temperature dynamics caused a phase transition of the soil water this further changed the soil water potential and permeability by 1 2 magnitudes and 1 5 magnitudes respectively which affected the direction and quantity of water migration 3 the water balance quantitatively revealed the controlling effect of groundwater level changes caused by freezing and thawing on soil moisture dynamics about 20 of the ice in the frozen layer was formed by the upward recharge of the groundwater during the freezing period in the thawing period most of this water returned to the groundwater 84 while the rest 16 increased the soil water content these results systematically explain the mechanisms of heat transfer and water migration between the soil water and the groundwater during the freeze thaw period providing a theoretical reference for agricultural water management in seasonally frozen regions keywords freeze thaw water balance heat transfer water migration data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction seasonally frozen soil is distributed worldwide in china it accounts for more than half of the total land area mainly in the northwest and northeast regions where water shortage is prominent wang et al 2019 significantly different from nonfrozen soil seasonally frozen soil is a special soil water system containing ice in which the variation in the ice content is equivalent to both the dynamic storage of the liquid water and the dynamic change in the heat therefore the water heat transfer within the frozen soil is strongly coupled under freeze thaw action the connection between soil water and groundwater is significantly intensified daniel and staricka 2000 miao et al 2017 during the freezing period soil water and groundwater migrate to the frozen layer under the action of a potential gradient formed in the soil water and the ice content in the frozen layer increases chen et al 2019 ireson et al 2013 stähli et al 1999 during the thawing period with the gradual warming of the air the water that melts from the snow and frozen soil seeps down causing a redistribution of the soil water li et al 2021 the ice melt water snowmelt water also contributes to groundwater resources contained in subglacial aquifers kong et al 2019 after the freeze thaw process when the liquid water content of the surface soil increases the excessive water may be associated with spring waterlogging mud pumping and other phenomena bayard et al 2005 however when the moisture in the surface soil decreases due to evaporation there is often soil salt accumulation and crop death due to physiological dehydration zhang and wang 2001 plants and crops require a suitable quality of water for growth particularly in arid areas with little rainfall sun et al 2021 a change in the dynamic balance between water and heat in a soil water system is directly related to the utilization of water resources and agricultural production practice bing et al 2015 chen et al 2022 liu et al 2021 musa et al 2016 wu et al 2018 xie and batlle aguilar 2017 zhu et al 2020 therefore research on the mechanisms of heat transfer and water migration in a soil water groundwater system during the freeze thaw process is important for the selection of water resource management measures and for the sustainable development of agriculture the interaction between soil water and heat during the freeze thaw period is mainly reflected in the following two aspects the variation in the soil temperature causes a phase change of the water which changes the soil water movement parameters and soil water potential in turn affecting water movement cary and mayland 1972 koopmans and miller 1966 lu et al 2021 moreover variations in the soil moisture content distribution and the proportion of water phases ice and water influence the thermal characteristics of the soil both spatially and temporally thus affecting the heat transfer process and temperature distribution in the soil he et al 2021 yi et al 2014 when the groundwater table depth is less than the sum of the depth affected by freezing and thawing and the height of the capillary rise of soil water the freeze thaw process will not only affect the groundwater temperature but also promote the groundwater to participate in the migration and redistribution of soil water liu et al 2019 lyu et al 2022 schneider 1961 shastri and sánchez 2012 willis et al 1963 the recharge and distribution of groundwater to the vadose zone during the freezing period and the recharge contributions of the snowmelt water and frozen layer meltwater to groundwater during the thawing period jointly control the moisture distribution and groundwater level dynamics dai et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 current studies on soil moisture and heat transfer under freezing and thawing mainly focused on the influence of air temperature and precipitation conditions on the soil temperature and humidity dynamics within the atmosphere and vadose zone iwata et al 2011 sun et al 2021 wang et al 2019 comprehensive analyses of the atmosphere vadose zone groundwater system as a whole are lacking in addition the lower boundary of soil is often treated as a constant groundwater table alkhaier et al 2012 hansson and lundin 2006 shoop and bigl 1997 ignoring the impact of freeze thaw induced water level fluctuation on soil water migration and redistribution in the entire atmosphere soil water groundwater system this results in an overestimation of the exchange between groundwater and soil water xie et al 2021 and making it difficult to explain the dynamic causes of the continuous decrease in the groundwater temperature during the freeze thaw period studies have been conducted on the use of a hydrothermal coupling model and a multivariate statistical model to quantitatively analyze the impact of water level fluctuation on soil moisture dynamics during the freeze thaw period cui et al 2020 xie et al 2021 however research on the mechanisms of soil water migration and heat transfer during this period under the combined effect of surface upper boundary temperature variation and groundwater level lower boundary fluctuation under hydrothermal coupling conditions is lacking in this study taking a typical site in northeast china s seasonally frozen soil region as an example and considering the atmosphere soil water and groundwater as an overall research object the temperature and water distribution characteristics of the soil water and groundwater in this region were analyzed including the process and mechanisms of heat transfer and water migration during the freeze thaw period based on the conservation relationship of the water and heat transfer process in the soil water groundwater system the impact of groundwater on soil moisture redistribution during the freeze thaw period was analyzed based on the water balance providing a basis for formulating a reasonable water management plan for winters 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted at the changchun site located in changchun city jilin china fig 1 the site is characterized by a continental monsoon climate the average annual precipitation is 583 8 mm and the average annual evaporation is 1239 mm the site is covered by frozen soil for six months from november to april and the maximum freezing depth during the monitoring period was approximately 1 m regarding the soil type it is mainly loess the soil is classified as miscellaneous fill with a thickness of approximately 30 cm underlain by silty loess loam to a depth of 175 cm loess loam with a soil thickness between 175 and 380 cm and loam below 380 cm phreatic water is stored in the quaternary loess layer evaluated from pumping tests the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer is 0 5 m d and the specific yield is 0 03 because the site terrain belongs to a plain area the slope of the ground terrain is gentle and the hydraulic gradient of the groundwater is small approximately 5 therefore the lateral flow is low without any exploitation around the study site the aquifer is mainly recharged by precipitation and discharged by evaporation the groundwater at the site flows in an approximately west to east direction 2 2 data collection in our study the data collected during november 2018 to april 2019 were used as an example daily

fig 2 a and soil freezing depth fig 2b indicate that the freezing and thawing processes started in early november the daily average air temperature started to be below 0 c and the surface freeze thaw cycle occurred and ended in mid to late april of the following year the daily average temperature continued to be above 0 c and the surface freeze thaw cycle disappeared during this period the daily average air temperature gradually decreased from 10 9 to 10 9 c in november to 21 2 to 1 2 c in late december and then gradually increased to 4 6 to 22 3 c in march and april with an overall fluctuation range of 21 2 to 22 3 c during the freeze thaw period the precipitation was in the form of snowfall with a total precipitation of 32 2 mm the precipitation in each episode was low ranging from 0 1 to 13 4 mm under the influence of air temperature the development of the frozen soil depth position of the 0 c isotherm showed an overall trend of first increasing and then decreasing during the freeze thaw period fig 2b specifically as the air temperature dropped from 0 7 to 10 6 c in early december the freezing depth continued to increase and developed to a maximum of approximately 90 cm in late february after the surface began to freeze for 86 days thereafter the air temperature began to rise to 0 c and above and the lower and upper layer soil frosts began thawing almost simultaneously finally the soil profile melted in early march however as the air temperature fluctuated at approximately 0 c in march the surface was still experiencing multiple freeze thaw cycles and there were unstable frozen layers no frozen layer appeared in the soil profile until the air temperature continued to be above 0 c in late april 3 2 soil temperature dynamics during freeze thaw period as shown in fig 3 a1 and a2 the soil temperature varied dramatically under the influence of air temperature and its fluctuation amplitude decreased with increasing depth the surface soil temperature fluctuated the most reaching as high as about 60 c maximum minus minimum the soil temperature at the bottom 230 cm fluctuated the least and its temperature range was about 10 c with the soil temperature below 0 c the soil in each layer entered the freezing state in turn the surface soil temperature 0 10 cm started to be below 0 c in late november table 2 the freezing time of the other soil layers gradually lagged behind with increasing depth and there was a significant difference between the upper and lower 40 cm specifically in the range of 10 40 cm the time lag of soil freezing was 3 13 days for every 10 cm increase in the soil depth while it increased to 12 16 days in the soil depth range of 40 80 cm table 2 overall the freezing rate of the shallow layer within 40 cm 0 77 3 33 cm day was higher than that of the deep layer within 40 80 cm 0 83 1 25 cm day unlike the freezing process in which the soil temperature decreased from the surface layer to the deeper layer an increase in the soil temperature to above 0 c during melting started from the surface layer 0 10 cm and the deep layer 65 80 cm simultaneously both in late february table 2 in the thawing process there was a lag in the thawing time from the surface layer to the middle of the frozen layer and from the deep layer to the middle of the frozen layer specifically the thawing time of the surface layer from 10 to 20 cm delayed by seven days and the thawing rate was 1 43 cm day the lag in the thawing time from 65 to 50 cm in the deep layer was six days and the thawing rate was 2 5 cm day the 20 50 cm soil layer in the middle began to thaw almost on the same day from the above it is clear that the soil thawing rate was higher than the freezing rate affected by the freezing and thawing of the soil the temporal and spatial variations in the monthly average soil temperature in the vertical direction showed evident zoning characteristics with a boundary of 100 cm the nearest monitoring depth below the maximum freezing depth fig 4 a in the range of 0 100 cm the temporal and spatial variations in the soil temperature were evident with the occurrence of freezing and thawing of the soil specifically in the freezing period from november to february the depth range of the monthly average soil temperature below 0 c continuously extended to the deeper layer while in the thawing period from march to april the monthly average soil temperature kept rising and its increase in the shallow layer was greater than that in the deep layer until the monthly average soil temperature in all the layers was greater than 0 c accordingly the soil temperature changed from being higher in the deep layer than in the shallow layer during the freezing period to being higher in the shallow layer than in the deep layer during the thawing period in contrast the monthly average soil temperature in the range of 100 230 cm was always greater than 0 c throughout the freeze thaw period and its variation line with depth was almost parallel specifically in the entire freeze thaw period the soil temperature in this range decreased overall and the deep soil temperature was always greater than the shallow soil temperature by comparing the soil temperature profiles before and after freezing and thawing fig 4a the soil temperature in the range of 0 20 cm increased significantly while that in the range of 20 230 cm decreased significantly the temperature distribution in the vertical direction also changed from a monotonic distribution before freezing lower at the top and higher at the bottom to a bidirectional distribution high at the top and bottom and minimum in the middle that is the temperature decreased from the top and bottom toward the middle layer 3 3 dynamics of soil liquid water content during freeze thaw period the changes in the soil liquid water content were strongly correlated with the soil temperature the phase change in the soil water occurred near 0 c and the liquid water content decreased and increased due to the freezing and thawing processes respectively when the soil was completely frozen the liquid water content of each layer in the frozen zone was reduced to about 16 84 of that in the pre freezing period fig 3b1 the liquid water content at the surface was the lowest when it was completely frozen fluctuating in the range of about 1 4 fig 3b1 while that at the remaining depths was in the range of about 17 25 fig 3b1 in addition the duration for which the soil liquid water content maintained a low value decreased with increasing soil depth under the influence of freezing and thawing the temporal and spatial variations in the monthly average soil liquid water content also showed zonation with a boundary of 100 cm fig 4b in the range of 0 100 cm the phase transition made the seasonal variation in the soil liquid water content evident specifically in the freezing period from november to february the range of the soil layer where the monthly average liquid water content of the soil was reduced due to freezing developed to the deep layer while in the thawing period from march to april the monthly average soil liquid water content increased overall with thawing and the increase in the shallow layer was greater than that in the deep layer in contrast the soil liquid water content in the 100 230 cm layer hardly changed in the freeze thaw period figs 3b2 and 4b by comparing the liquid water profiles before and after freeze thaw fig 4b the soil moisture in all the layers except on the surface 0 10 cm increased compared with that before freezing 3 4 dynamics of groundwater level and groundwater temperature during the freeze thaw period with the freezing and thawing of the soil the groundwater table depth showed a seasonal fluctuation phenomenon of first increasing and then decreasing and its variation trend was similar to that of the freezing depth in the initial stage of freezing with the air temperature fluctuating around 0 c the groundwater table depth fluctuated around 2 70 m fig 5 with the air temperature below 0 c and soil freezing depth developing steadily in early december the rate of groundwater level decline 0 51 cm day began to increase significantly in late february the groundwater table depth reached its maximum value 3 20 m which came approximately five days later than the occurrence of the maximum freezing depth in the middle of december the slight rise in the water level corresponded to the recharge process of frost melt water when the daily maximum air temperature rose to above 0 c with the subsequent after late february air temperature rising above 0 c the soil began to melt in both directions meanwhile the groundwater table depth gradually decreased at a rate of 0 76 cm d which was slightly higher than that in the freezing period finally it stabilized at 2 78 m in mid april unlike the change in the groundwater level the groundwater temperature dropped from 11 04 c since the freeze thaw period the groundwater temperature did not stabilize at 8 78 c until the beginning of april when the air temperature had been continuously above 0 c for half a month even in the stage of water level rise the rate at which the groundwater temperature decreased hardly changed and it was always maintained at approximately 0 02 c day 4 discussion 4 1 heat transfer process during the freeze thaw period and distribution characteristics of soil temperature and groundwater temperature the temporal variation in the soil temperature during the freezing and thawing period was mainly dominated by the air temperature moreover the heat transfer efficiency between the atmosphere and soil had the characteristics of layer by layer decrease spatially spatially the zonation results of the monthly average soil temperature showed that the air temperature mainly affected the soil temperature dynamics in the range of 0 100 cm fig 4a the pearson s correlation coefficient r between the air and soil temperatures showed that the correlation between the two was stronger in the range of 0 50 cm and r decreased with increasing depth fig 6 at 50 cm the correlation between the air and soil temperatures was already weak r 0 3563 meanwhile the slope of the linear fitting st a at b between the air and soil temperatures within 0 50 cm i e the heat transfer efficiency between them sun et al 2021 decreased exponentially with increasing depth a 0 72 0 95 d 0 09 r2 0 9929 fig 7 the results showed that the response of the soil temperature to the air temperature was the fastest at the surface and the response of the soil temperature to the air temperature gradually weakened with the increase in the depth temporally the direction of heat transfer in the soil profile changed regularly with the air temperature during the freeze thaw process during the freezing period the soil temperature gradient within the range of 0 230 cm was greater than 0 fig 8 a b indicating that the heat transferred upward and was eventually lost from the surface resulting in a decreasing trend in the soil temperature of the profile fig 8c during the thawing period as the air temperature rose to above 0 c in late february the temperature gradient of the soil surface 0 10 cm in the range of 0 100 cm began to be below 0 fig 8a and the heat was transferred downward however the soil temperature gradient in the range of 100 230 cm was still greater than 0 fig 8b indicating that the unfrozen layer continued to transfer heat to the upper soil layer under the influence of the lagged heat transfer of the air temperature this corresponded to the phenomenon wherein the soil temperature rose in the range of 0 100 cm and continued to decrease in the range of 100 230 cm in the thawing stage during the period from late february to early april the positive and negative temperature gradients of the soil layer in the range of 10 100 cm crossed between layers fig 8b this was attributed to the fact that the air temperature still fluctuated at approximately 0 c and the soil layer was affected by bi directional heat transfer directions indicated by arrows in fig 8c between the surface and the deep unfrozen layer among them the 30 50 cm and 60 80 cm layers were interlayers with upward heat transfer and whose temperature gradient was greater than 0 their thickness gradually decreased with increasing surface soil temperature gradient and these layers finally disappeared in early april after the air temperature remained above 0 c for half a month moreover the soil layer in the range of 0 100 cm began to uniformly transfer heat downward in the thawing stage the difference in the heat transfer between the upper frozen layer and the lower unfrozen layer finally resulted in a bi directionally decreasing distribution of the soil temperature from the top and bottom to the middle layer figs 4a and 8c a notable phenomenon here is that the variation trend in the groundwater temperature did not change with the increase in the soil temperature and water level after the end of the freezing period this phenomenon can be directly explained by introducing the concept of accumulated soil daily heat storage fig 8d although the heat transfer direction changed since the thawing period and the soil daily heat storage started to fluctuate at approximately 0 which meant that the soil layer absorbed and released heat alternately the accumulated soil daily heat storage in the same period was still less than 0 overall and its changing trend tended to stabilize and did not continue to decrease the change in the accumulated soil daily heat storage indicated that the heat absorbed in the thawing period could not compensate for the heat released in the freezing period resulting in the loss of heat in the soil compared with the initial state which also controlled the groundwater temperature decline throughout the freeze thaw period this made the dynamics of the groundwater temperature and the accumulated soil daily heat storage consistent 4 2 characteristics and mechanism of soil water migration and distribution driven by soil temperature change during the freeze thaw period air temperature not only directly drove the change in the soil temperature but also influenced the dynamics of the soil liquid water content due to the co variation in the soil temperature and soil liquid water content during the freeze thaw process phase change and moisture transfer of the soil liquid water were key processes controlling the soil water distribution during the freeze thaw period the variation in the soil temperature directly affected the phase transition of water which in turn affected the amount of the soil liquid water content there was a strong correlation between the soil liquid water and heat changes during the freeze thaw process fig 9 moreover the variation in the soil liquid water content in the different soil layers with the soil temperature tended to be consistent overall with the decrease in the soil temperature the soil liquid water content reduced to a minimum value due to phase transition and maintained a dynamic equilibrium subsequently as the soil warmed up the soil liquid water content increased as the ice melted overall the liquid water content varied nonlinearly with the soil temperature between the lowest liquid water content during soil freezing and the liquid water content after the end of thawing table 3 specifically before the freezing front reached the soil layer in the early freezing stage the soil temperature in the layer decreased gradually and the variation in the liquid water content was small section ab when the soil in each layer was frozen successively from late november to early january point b the liquid water content decreased rapidly in a narrow temperature range with a significant variation section bc which was attributed to the fact that the free water with a large proportion in the pores was frozen first however when the soil temperature of each layer further decreased to 0 8 to 0 c from late november to early february point c the reduction rate of the liquid water content decreased due to the limited amount of freezable liquid water until the soil temperature further decreased to 9 8 to 0 7 c from early february to mid february point d and the liquid water content of each layer reached the lowest under the influence of different degrees of phase transition section cd however the change trend in the liquid water content in the thawing period was opposite to the decreasing trend in the liquid water content in the freezing period as the soil temperature of each layer rose to 0 7 to 0 5 c point e from the end of february to the beginning of march the liquid water content gradually increased due to the melting of ice however in this process under the influence of supercooling effect the liquid water content at the same soil temperature was lower than that in the freezing stage showing an evident lag thereafter when the soil temperature of each layer continued to rise to 0 6 1 1 c from mid march to late april point f the rising rate of the soil liquid water content began to be greater than the decreasing rate of the soil liquid water content in the same temperature range rateef ratebc these results indicated that the variation in the soil liquid water content during the thawing period was not only related to phase transformation but also affected by water migration between the soil layers after the end of the thawing stage in late april the liquid water content point g of all layers except near the surface 0 10 cm increased compared with that of the initial frozen water content point a in early november directions indicated by arrows in fig 9 the recharge of water from the deep parts of the vadose zone and groundwater to the surface frozen layer during the freezing period was characterized profile water redistribution occurred during the thawing period notably the freeze thaw characteristic curves obtained from the measured soil data at various depths in the field were different from those obtained from laboratory tests in previous studies theoretically due to the influence of solutes in the soil the freezing temperature temperature at point b corresponding to the intersection point between the gradual decline in the liquid water content and the beginning of the sharp drop should be less than or equal to 0 c pikul et al 1989 wu et al 2018 however in this study the liquid water content of the soil began to drop when the soil temperature was above 0 c and this was more evident in the deep layer the water in the unfrozen layers just below the freezing front was strongly absorbed due to the suction yielded at the freezing front wang and akae 2004 therefore the soil liquid water content decreased significantly due to the migration of water to the upper frozen layer before phase transition under laboratory conditions the water content often drops suddenly when the soil temperature reaches freezing temperature 0 c azmatch et al 2012 which is different from field results this further lead to the phenomenon that the simulated moisture may not decrease synchronously with the actual moisture reported in a simulation study xie et al 2021 this also means that the simulated liquid water flux values may change later than the actual situation thereby affecting the estimation of the relevant water balance and water level dynamics since the freeze thaw characteristic curve is key to the coupled water and heat transport in water transport simulations one of the essential issues in these models is obtaining a relevant expression for the freeze thaw characteristic curve of the soil zhou et al 2020 thus the freeze thaw characteristic curve measured for the actual site should be used to simulate the water migration at the field scale in practice which can help better consider the actual situation of water change the variations in the air and soil temperatures not only caused phase transformation of soil water but also controlled and affected the water migration process by changing the distributions of the soil water potential and permeability at different depths the soil water potential of the frozen soil can be estimated by measuring the soil temperature accurately azmatch et al 2012 koopmans and miller 1966 according to the freezing point reduction equation eqs 5 7 the changes in the water potential fig 10 c and water potential gradient fig 10a and b within the frozen layer are shown in fig 10 their change trends were synchronized with those of the soil temperature and soil temperature gradient respectively in the freezing period the soil water potential decreased with decreasing soil temperature while the soil temperature gradient and soil water potential gradient increased in the thawing period the soil water potential increased with increasing soil temperature while the soil temperature gradient and soil water potential gradient decreased specifically when the soil temperature in the profile fluctuated between 0 1 and 1 1 c in the early freezing stage the soil water potential varied from 12 56 to 136 92 m and the soil water potential gradient fluctuated between 248 04 and 1118 91 from every degree celsius below zero the cryogenic suction associated with the soil water potential which develops between the ice and the water phases in frozen soils builds up arzanfudi and al khoury 2018 the cryogenic suction gives rise to the upward migration of water from the unfrozen region to the frozen region soil water potential gradient is greater than 0 arzanfudi and al khoury 2018 which in turn results in a decline in the groundwater level fig 5 in mid december when the soil temperature decreased to 0 2 to 11 7 c the range of the soil water potential decreased to 25 32 to 1433 65 m and the soil water potential gradient increased to 1976 91 7041 49 approximately 6 8 times that of the initial stage resulting in an increase in the rate of water level decline fig 5 this phenomenon indirectly reflects that the amount of migrated water depends on the soil water potential gradient when the soil temperature in the profile decreased to 0 7 to 9 6 c in mid february the variation range of the soil water potential decreased to 87 98 to 1180 22 m 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than that in the early freezing stage and the soil water potential gradient ranged from 614 67 to 5120 49 from mid december to late february due to the small change in the soil water potential gradient the rate of water level decline also remained stable fig 5 subsequently in early march as the soil temperature rose to 0 1 to 6 c the soil water potential rose to 12 76 to 741 66 m and the soil water potential gradient decreased to 1 to 125 57 at the same time moisture moved downward and the water level began to rise this is because upon thawing the cryogenic suction diminished which made the water to return to its initial equilibrium condition by reversing the direction of migration from upward to downward arzanfudi and al khoury 2018 overall the soil water potential became more negative with decreasing soil temperature in the freezing period which made the soil water in the unfrozen layer and groundwater to move continuously toward the freezing front driven by a high water potential gradient finally decreasing the groundwater level during the thawing period as the soil temperature continued to rise and the frozen layer began to thaw from the surface downward and from the bottom of the frozen layer upward the water potential under the frozen layer began to increase which in turn drove the infiltration of water to recharge the groundwater and increase the water level in the above process the drastic change in the soil liquid water content also determined the relative permeability coefficient of soil which then affected the soil water migration flux the mathematical model proposed by tarnawski and wagner eqs 8 11 can be used to estimate the permeability of unsaturated frozen soil azmatch et al 2012 overall the fluctuation range of the permeability coefficient on the surface 0 cm was much wider than that at other depths 10 230 cm fig 11 and the variation had no evident rule which was attributed to the significant fluctuation in the liquid water content in the pores due to the interference of external environment fig 3b1 the soil permeability within the frozen layer 10 100 cm changed seasonally throughout the freeze thaw period showing a decreasing dynamic equilibrium rising trend however the soil permeability remained stable in the nonfrozen layer range 100 230 cm specifically during the freezing period the relative permeability coefficient in the 10 100 cm range decreased from 3 12 10 10 3 67 10 6 to 2 53 10 14 4 37 10 7 m d and the permeability coefficient of each layer decreased by 1 5 orders of magnitude this was attributed to the significant decrease in the soil effective porosity after the formation of ice by water in situ and water migration from groundwater to the frozen layer as the effective porosity increased with increasing liquid water after soil thawing the soil permeability coefficient recovered to 3 69 10 9 4 33 10 6 m d in the depth range of 10 100 cm which promoted the frost melt water infiltration however in the nonfrozen layer that is within the range of 100 230 cm the relative permeability coefficient of the soil pores was unchanged because the water content in the entire freeze thaw period was recharged by groundwater and upper melt water which ensured a stable water transfer from groundwater to the frozen layer in the freezing period and from the frozen layer to groundwater in the thawing period compared with the initial state of freezing after thawing the surface permeability coefficient decreased significantly however the permeability coefficient of the other layers of soil increased which was the result of soil water redistribution as reflected in the above freeze thaw characteristic curve 4 3 effect of groundwater on soil water redistribution in the freeze thaw period based on water balance the above analysis showed that the change in the groundwater level during the freeze thaw period was the result of the exchange between groundwater and soil water therefore groundwater has an important influence on the redistribution of soil water the effect of groundwater on soil water redistribution can be quantitatively calculated and analyzed based on the principle of water balance the region between the surface z 0 and the maximum groundwater table depth z h 2 was taken as the equilibrium domain the lower boundary of the equilibrium domain was considered the zero flux boundary while the water exchange between the upper boundary and the external environment was via evaporation and rainfall ma et al 2012 fig 12 considering that there was no hindrance to capillary water transfer and that groundwater could be exchanged with the soil water the water content of the unfrozen layer between the maximum monitoring depth of the soil water 230 cm and the groundwater table was assumed to be the field capacity θ cf in addition the time control points in the equilibrium calculation were the time at which the water level and soil water were in their original state before freezing t 1 the occurrence time of the maximum freezing depth t 2 and the time at which the water level started to stabilize t 3 in the entire freeze thaw process among them t 1 and t 3 were the starting and ending points of the freeze thaw process respectively while t 2 simply divided the freeze thaw process into freezing and thawing stages w 1 w 2 and w 3 and their equilibrium relationships at t 1 t 2 and t 3 satisfied the following equations 12 w 1 i 0 230 θ 1 i h i h 1 230 θ cf h 2 h 1 θ sat 13 w 2 i 0 z f θ 2d i h i i z f 230 θ 2i h

liquid water content of layer i h i cm is the depth represented by the monitoring point corresponding to layer i θ di cm3 cm3 is the total water content the sum of the liquid water content and the ice content of layer i i represents the position of each layer corresponding to the depth of the monitoring point h is the groundwater table depth 1 2 and 3 in the subscripts of the variables represent times t 1 t 2 and t 3 respectively θ cf cm3 cm3 is the field capacity θ sat cm3 cm3 is the saturated water content θ sat θ cf and their difference were estimated by considering the soil texture z f cm is the maximum freezing depth e and p cm are the evaporation and rainfall snow respectively the subscripts f and t correspond to the freezing and thawing periods respectively the amount of water migration between the soil water and groundwater during the freezing and thawing periods can be estimated as follows 1 moisture migration during the freezing period the amount of groundwater that migrates upward is the amount of water released after the water level drops 17 δ w m h 2 h 1 θ sat θ cf where δ w m cm is the amount of groundwater migrated to the upper soil layer during the freezing period the water content of the frozen layer is not only affected by the recharging of the groundwater but also by the evaporation and rainfall of the upper boundary the water balance in the frozen layer is as follows 18 δ w d δ w m δ w zf 230 p f e f 19 δ w zf 230 i z f 230 θ 2i θ 1i h i where δ w d cm is the change in the water content per unit area within the frozen layer during the freezing period δ w zf 230 cm is the change in the water content per unit area within the range from the maximum freezing depth to 230 cm during the freezing period from the maximum freezing depth the average ice content θ ice of each layer within the frozen layer at t 2 can be calculated 20 θ i ce θ i c e m θ i c e s 21 θ i c e m δ w d z f 22 θ i c e s δ w u f 0 z f z f 23 δ w uf 0 z f i 0 z f θ 1i θ 2i h

i c e s cm3 cm3 is the average content of the ice formed by in situ freezing of the liquid water within the frozen layer δ w uf 0 z f cm is the difference in the unfrozen water content per unit area within the frozen layer at t 1 and t 2 the relationship between the average ice content of the frozen layer formed by groundwater migration and the total water content θ 2d i of the frozen layer is as follows 24 θ 2d i θ 1 i θ i ce m 2 amount of water migration during the thawing period when water released from the melting of the frozen layer and snowmelt infiltrated to recharge the groundwater the recharge quantity of the groundwater at t 3 is 25 δ w r h 2 h 3 θ sat θ cf where δ w r cm is the amount of recharge received by groundwater during the thawing period according to the estimation models of the water balance eqs 12 16 and water migration eqs 17 25 in the soil water groundwater system the change in the water content in the equilibrium region can be calculated by substituting the groundwater table depth soil liquid water content and maximum freezing depth at each time control point while ignoring the difference between soil evaporation and precipitation in the normal freezing period p f e f 0 on this basis the moisture balance and migration terms can be calculated as follows table 4 a comparison of the water volumes in the equilibrium region before freezing and thawing w 1 and after the freeze thaw period w 3 showed a increase in the overall water volume this was because the evaporation of the upper boundary was smaller than the supply of snowmelt p t e t 0 and the intensity of effective infiltration p t e t divided by melt duration t 3 t 2 was about 0 05 mm day due to the fine particles in the site medium the high capillary rise and the small initial groundwater table depth the shallow groundwater table depth played an important role in transporting more water to the upper layer thereby promoting the storage of water during the melting period and finally resulting in a increase of moisture in the soil the overall equilibrium of the equilibrium domain was mainly affected by evaporation and precipitation at the upper boundary while the redistribution of the soil moisture was closely related to the exchange between soil water and groundwater during the freezing period groundwater migrated to the frozen layer with a migration amount of 1 5 cm δ w m which was stored in the vadose zone in the form of ice as the groundwater migrated to the frozen layer a part of the water in the unfrozen layer below the maximum freezing depth also migrated upward to the frozen layer therefore the ice content formed by migration within the frozen layer was approximately 1 7 cm which was slightly greater than δ w m from the average to the maximum freezing depth range the amount of ice formed by migration θ ice m was approximately 25 of that formed by in situ water freezing θ ice s in the soil frozen layer during the thawing period the water stored in the soil as ice will be redistributed in the form of infiltration to the groundwater and storage in the vadose zone the infiltration to the groundwater part δ w r was 1 26 cm accounting for about 84 of the recharge amount δ w m of groundwater to the vadose zone in the freezing period the amount of water stored in the vadose zone was determined by the effective infiltration amount p t e t and the difference between the groundwater recharge amount δ w r in the thawing period and the groundwater discharge amount δ w m in the freezing period which was approximately 0 56 cm from the analysis in section 4 2 since the water content in the 0 10 cm surface layer after thawing was lower than that before freezing the water content of 0 56 cm was mainly stored in the range of soil depths affected by freeze thaw action except in the surface layer 10 125 cm fig 4b and the water content of these layers evidently increased while the water content of deeper soil 125 230 cm changed slightly in summary the calculation results showed that most of the water that migrated to the soil layer during the freezing period returned to the groundwater during the melting period the remaining fraction was stored in the vadose zone which mainly increased the water content in the range of the soil depth affected by freeze thaw action except in the surface layer compared with that before the freeze thaw period 5 conclusions in areas with shallow groundwater the air temperature dynamics at the upper boundary of soil and the groundwater level at the lower boundary were found to have important effects on the heat transfer and water migration in a soil groundwater system during the freeze thaw period this influence was directly related to the dynamics and distribution of the water and heat in the vadose zone the heat transfer efficiency between the atmosphere and soil could be characterized by a layer by layer decrease spatially resulting in the zonation of the soil temperature dynamics with the maximum freezing depth in different zones the variation in the heat transfer process with time made the soil temperature in the frozen layer to fluctuate in a drop rise manner while the soil temperature in the unfrozen layer decreased continuously resulting in a bi directional distribution of the soil profile temperature decreasing from the top and bottom to the middle layer after the thawing period notably the heat absorbed by soil during the thawing period could not compensate for the heat lost during the freezing period therefore the groundwater temperature decreased throughout the freeze thaw period which was different from the increasing trends in the air temperature and groundwater level during the thawing period therefore the dynamics of the accumulated soil daily heat storage in the unfrozen layer could explain the variation in the groundwater temperature in fact the groundwater temperature is considered to be affected not only by heat conduction but also by the induced groundwater flow due to groundwater mining shohei et al 2016 in this study the relationship between the groundwater temperature and soil heat storage was obtained under the condition that the groundwater level was only affected by freezing and thawing with no effect from external human activities in the following study in addition to the effect of heat transfer on the dynamics of the groundwater temperature other factors such as the groundwater flow induced by groundwater mining need to be considered under the direct influence of soil temperature the liquid water content in the soil profile presented the same zonation as the soil temperature in the frozen layer the freeze thaw characteristic curve revealed the influence of the water phase change water migration and supercooling effect on the dynamics of the soil liquid water content moreover it reflected a different law from that observed in the laboratory experiment that is the soil moisture dropped rapidly when the soil temperature was above 0 c this result suggests that in field simulations it is necessary to obtain freeze thaw characteristic curves in situ for more realistic simulation results in addition to the direct influence of the soil temperature on water dynamics reflected by phase transformation the variation trends in the soil water potential soil water potential gradient permeability coefficient and groundwater level with the soil temperature and soil liquid water content reflected an indirect effect of the soil temperature on water migration and distribution under the direct and indirect influences of the soil temperature the soil liquid water redistributed after the end of the thawing period showing that the surface 0 10 cm water content decreased compared with the initial state while the water content in the remaining layers 10 230 cm increased the results of the quantitative calculation based on water equilibrium revealed that the change in the soil moisture was the result of water infiltration at the upper boundary and redistribution of the groundwater recharge in the soil layer in addition to subtracting the amount of water seeping into the groundwater the remaining groundwater that recharged to the frozen layer in the freezing period was stored in the vadose zone because of which ultimately the water stored in the vadose zone became higher than that at the beginning of the freezing period after the end of the thawing period therefore the influence of groundwater level dynamics on soil water redistribution during the freeze thaw period cannot be ignored these results provide a theoretical basis for shedding new light on the soil temperature and water distribution in the vadose zone after the end of the thawing period which in turn can help formulate water management plans for winters however in this study the effects of snow accumulation and melting were not discussed in more datail due to the low and scattered winter precipitation at the upper boundary of the soil water groundwater system and this factor should be further considered in subsequent studies credit authorship contribution statement tingting wu formal

2363,the quantification of subsurface discharges may significantly be affected by multiple sources of uncertainty especially in highly heterogeneous aquifers in this work subsurface discharges within alluvial aquifers located in the province of lecco lombardy northern italy are quantified relying upon a monte carlo mc framework under geological and conditioning data uncertainty sources these are respectively employed through different geological conceptual models whose facies spatial distributions are simulated through sequential indicator simulations methodology sisim and by conditioning stochastic facies simulations with different data constraints stochastic porosity fields are then achieved upon facies simulated fields by associating average porosity values to each local simulated facies then stochastic subsurface discharge fluxes are quantified under steady hydraulic conditions upon saturated hydraulic fields inferred from porosity ones then the study of subsurface discharges is pursued via the generalized extreme values gev approach this method enables both to interpret peak over thresholds pots discharges spatial distribution and to study the role geological and data uncertainty sources on their quantification for example studying discharges conveyed towards a lake through the surrounding aquifer these uncertainty based analyses show that subsurface discharges clearly convey in correspondence of main alluvial aquifers as well as the tendency to be collected along preferential pathways furthermore the inspection of pots empirical probability spatial distributions highlights that the geological uncertainty plays as a primary uncertainty source rather than the conditioning data the latter plays a minor role e g between different employed models only in presence of a relevant geological difference between analyzed ones these results are consistent with other kinds of information such as hydrogeological sections and available piezometric maps providing novel contributions to understanding how to quantify subsurface discharges in poorly monitored aquifers or how to treat various sources of uncertainty keywords subsurface discharge geostatistics monte carlo geological uncertainty data uncertainty data availability data are freely available and their source is reported in the dedicated section 1 introduction the quantification of subsurface discharges in alluvial aquifers is one of the most interesting topics in the domain of subsurface hydrology this is particularly challenging where the lithological composition of subsurface aquifers is complex such as in fractured or karst aquifers hyman 2020 or heterogeneous alluvial areas where riparian groundwater intensively interacts with surface water bodies kaser and hunkeler 2016 hester and fox 2020 the importance of addressing this issue has been underlined to understand subsurface flow patterns at various scales from the macropore to the catchment one see zhang et al 2016 the interpretation of core data such as proposed by bianchi et al 2011 enables the interpretation of the connectivity between different areas of an alluvial aquifer as underlined by riva et al 2010 and rhodes et al 2017 moreover a proper interpretation of subsurface flow structures may lead to quantifying water exchanges between aquifers and surface water bodies e g as proposed by kazmierczak et al 2016 and liyi et al 2020 using physical and tracing methods or using numerical schemes to interpret flow pathways within the vadose zone see hong et al 2020 however the quantification of subsurface discharges in highly heterogeneous areas such as alluvial surficial aquifers is ruled by several uncertainty sources which are mainly due to the geological conceptualization of the investigated aquifer hence to the reconstruction of facies from stratigraphic data geological cores borehole data or hydrogeological sections as well as highlighted by riva et al 2010 mustafa et al 2018 and gueting et al 2018 phelps et al 2018 focused the analysis on geological models conceptualization and variogram based customized models as uncertainty sources hence governing the reconstruction of complex geological structures dealing with multiple geological facies is an issue usually faced relying upon sequential indicator simulations i e sisim see goovaerts 1997 chiles and delfiner 2009 as a widely known and applied methodology for the reconstructions of facies fields i e 2d or 3d spatial distributions within heterogeneous domains as well as proposed by zhang et al 2009 serrano et al 2012 and serrano et al 2014 and more recently by siena and riva 2020 and jorreto zaguirre et al 2020 moreover the stochastic modeling of facies enables to proper consider complex geological structures including faults or multiple stratified sedimentary layers see e g goodwin et al 2022 in addition to the geological source of uncertainty recent literature works have underlined the importance of considering other ones these may arise when simulating facies spatial distributions and employing these as priors for subsequent conditioned ones ma and jafarpour 2019 another source of uncertainty is represented by the number of conditioning data or the prevalent dimensions of the search ellipsoid that the modeler chooses when employing kriging based estimation or simulation methodologies this aspect seems particularly interesting as well as underlined by recent works such as athens and caers 2022 selia et al 2022 samson and deutsch 2022 and mery and marcotte 2022 where various investigations upon conditioning data based uncertainty sources are proposed the present work aims to study the spatial distribution of subsurface discharges and their quantification upon a geological source of uncertainty and another is provided by conditioning data involved in stochastic field simulations geological uncertainty is involved by relying upon 2d sequential indicator simulations sisim of facies whose stochastic realizations are grasped within different conceptual models and collected within a monte carlo mc framework stochastic facies fields lead to achieve spatial fields of total porosity hence saturated hydraulic conductivity ones estimated under steady and fixed hydraulic conditions then stochastic simulations of subsurface discharges are obtained and analyzed in the proximity of two of the main surface water bodies of the investigated area the attention of the present work is focused to i understanding subsurface flow spatial features in alluvial phreatic aquifers like those within the investigated area and ii analyzing the impact of geological hence facies spatial variability and conditioning data for simulated discharges moreover iii to assess which source of uncertainty geological or data based plays the major role in discharges spatial characterization hence regulating the interactions between the phreatic aquifer and surface water bodies the paper is structured as follows section 2 encompasses the methodology through several subsections section 2 1 describes the investigated area from a hydrogeological viewpoint as well as describes available quantitative data and other kinds of information sections 2 2 and 2 3 introduce the role of geological and data sources of uncertainty respectively section 2 4 provides a brief description of the methodology to simulate facies stochastic realizations and to collect them within a monte carlo mc framework section 2 5 explains how facies spatial distributions are employed to evaluate saturated hydraulic conductivity fields section 2 6 introduces the generalized extreme values approach employed to spatially describe peak over threshold hence maximum subsurface discharges results are enclosed in section 3 encompassing facies stochastic fields and hydraulic conductivity ones in sections 3 1 and 3 2 respectively in sections 3 3 and 3 4 two case studies are proposed to study subsurface discharge spatial distributions in the proximity of major surface water bodies and to deepen the role of the uncertainty sources in particular the geological one section 3 5 analyzes the use of the generalized extreme value gev distribution approach to study stochastically simulated subsurface discharge while section 3 6 encloses the study of peaks over threshold pots of groundwater discharges enabling to properly inspect the impact of data related uncertainty major conclusions and future research vectors are reported in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 data field setting and hydrogeological framework the present study analyzes the phreatic aquifer system located in the province of lecco northern italy and encompassing an extent of approximately 31 25 km2 see fig 1 the domain is located in a sedimentary alluvial region characterized by the two major rivers in the area i e adda and lambro respectively average groundwater flow is directed southwards beretta et al 1984 with the adda river which generally plays a draining role the lakes located within the domain are generally recharged from the surrounding aquifer since lying on low elevated alluvial beds data sources are listed in detail in the data source section the current morphological and geological setting of the area is due to glacial and fluvial sedimentary areas which originated during the last glaciation surface waters are carved on mostly alluvial deposits the phreatic aquifer resides in permeable alluvial sediments which are locally alternated with clayey or silty lenses with emphasis close to rivers the most exploited area for anthropic water related uses is located in the southern part of the domain where the surficial i e phreatic aquifer average thickness is about 35 40 m the surficial aquifer is mostly sandy and grave with non negligible intrusions of clayey lenses whose extensions are anyway not continuous throughout wide extensions groundwater circulation in this phreatic aquifer is regulated by several paleochannels in particular in the proximity of the adda river see e g cavallin et al 1983 beretta et al 1984 schiavo et al 2022 the present study relies on stratigraphic and lithologic information obtained from n 222 boreholes depicted as yellow circles in fig 1 each borehole stratigraphy enables to infer the elevation zn x y of the surface aquifer bottom n 1 2 n x and y are planar coordinates i e the local elevation of a rocky or clayey aquitard top and the lithological local composition of the aquifer the domain is then discretized by cells with side l 100 m e g in 77 500 cells each one identified upon its barycenter coordinates xi xi yi with i 1 77500 the recognition of 5 k 1 5 prevalent facies as well as their average volumetric fractions are performed each borehole n th location is then embedded with an indicator k 1 5 indicating the most prevalent facies characterizing that aquifer site hence across its whole local thickness upon the knowledge of facies volumetric fractions an available piezometric reconstruction dated 2013 and currently used by local authorities supports the analysis by informing about main subsurface flow directions throughout the investigated areas and is employed to infer local values of the hydraulic gradient h i reconstructed upon water table contour levels and well piezometric information aquifer bottom elevation is employed to obtain an estimation of local saturated aquifer thickness di and which geological layers belong to the phreatic aquifer i e are located above the low permeability aquitard top spatially continuous estimation of local water table level h i and aquifer bottom elevation z i then local aquifer saturated thickness d i and hydraulic gradient h i have been obtained via ordinary kriging procedure taking mean values without considering estimated variances details not shown for further details see also schiavo 2022 and schiavo et al 2022 2 2 geological uncertainty relying upon boreholes dataset described in section 2 1 the uncertain spatial distribution of facies is considered by using three different geological models gm see e g rojas et al 2008 ma et al 2022 athens and caers 2022 each one of these respectively assumes a unique structure of the subsurface domain hence subdividing borehole lithological information into groups each one collecting one or more facies upon their main lithological patterns hence each gm is characterized by a different number of facies determining the hydrogeological structure of the investigate phreatic aquifer 2 3 conditioning data uncertainty once each geological model gm is defined the variation in the number of conditioning points cp as a data source of uncertainty is considered following the way opened by recent works athens and caers 2022 ma et al 2022 selia et al 2022 the uncertainty related to cp affects the kind of facies simulated in a generic i th domain location by controlling the number of the surrounding truth points involved in kriging equations see e g chiles and delfiner 2009 moreover the planar isotropic search radius r s is much larger r s 10 km than the facies correlation scale being a kriging equations parameter thus cp number is the only uncertainty source related to conditioning data when simulating the spatial distribution of facies a gm with a prescribed number of facies and a certain cp number is from now on defined as a combined model cm 2 4 stochastic simulations of geological facies a monte carlo based mc framework is employed to collect stochastic facies simulations performed at each domain cell i stochastic simulations of facies are based on bi dimensional indicator variograms associated to each gm s facies omnidirectional variograms are more indicated for large domains being suitable to infer spatial geological patterns that might not be directional schiavo 2022 which on the contrary is the case of data alongside rivers or permeable fans fontana et al 2014 the sequential indicator simulations sisim approach is a well known and widely used methodology to achieve stochastic simulations of geomaterials see e g isaaks and srivastava 1989 goovaerts 1997 in heterogeneous domains as well as described e g by zhang et al 2009 and more recently by siena and riva 2020 and jorreto zaguirre et al 2020 the sisim approach here adopted can be summarized in few passages i for a dataset of n boreholes the generic n th borehole is associated with its 2d prevalent facies e g k facies i e with the one with the largest volumetric fraction across the whole phreatic aquifer local thickness this information is retrieved from stratigraphic and geological data ii borehole facies to be simulated are defined for each gm if a gm is conceived with fewer facies hence less than k than those which have been recognized at point i the exceeding ones are grouped into facies with the most similar lithologic patterns therefore each gm is associated with a number of cps returning a unique cm iii the function z x i n is employed as a discrete variable indicating the facies f associated to a location i for each cm then the indicator function i k x i is employed being 1 if f k or 0 otherwise iv a planar omnidirectional isotropic variogram γ k h is computed for each facies employed in each cm in the present study zero nugget exponential variogram functions have been employed to interpret facies data the range r k at which each variogram structure reaches a plateau is estimated through a maximum likelihood ml approach v bidimensional conditional mc realizations of the spatial distribution of each cm facies are achieved using indicator variograms obtained at step iv applied to all n available boreholes the sequential simulation methodology is widely described in isaaks and srivastava 1989 and remy et al 2009 the sisim methodology returns r stochastic facies realizations for each employed cm the condition of numerical stability for each cm s collection of r realizations must be fulfilled see results section the consistency of each cm with the geological features of the investigated aquifer is assured as follows each cm s facies realization r is associated to an average porosity value taken from a literature based ranges from freeze and cherry 1979 this procedure returns r total porosity stochastic values for each domain location i i e r different ϕ i ϕ x i values at each cell i estimated via simulated facies 2 5 stochastic simulations of subsurface discharges local values ϕ i of total porosity are then employed to deduce saturated conductivity fields following the approach proposed by riva et al 2010 the local i th saturated hydraulic conductivity can be evaluated through the kozeny carman formulation kozeny 1927 carman 1956 1 k sat i k sat x i 8 3 10 3 g ϕ i 3 d 10 i 2 ν 1 ϕ i 2 upon the knowledge of g 9 806 m s2 as the gravity acceleration constant ν 1 002 m2 s as water viscosity at 20 c and d 10 as the 10th percentile of the cumulative particle size distribution the empirical formulation proposed by vukovic and soro 1992 enables to deduce the d 10 associated with a local porosity value ϕ i as well 2 ϕ i ϕ x i 0 255 1 0 83 d 60 d 10 where d 60 2 19 10 3 m defined as the 60th percentile of the cumulative particle size distribution is taken as a constant value for all realizations r this value of d 60 was calculated by rosas et al 2014 and is feasible for most of sandy alluvial aquifer soils similar values are usually adopted for moderately sorted sandy gravely soils see e g riva et al 2006 riva et al 2008 riva et al 2010 here the choice of taking d 60 as a constant while employing d 10 as a stochastic porosity based value is strengthened by the lack of correlation between d 10 and d 60 that was verified in previous works for various alluvial soils e g by riva et al 2006 and riva et al 2010 like the ones here considered thus local values of subsurface discharges are calculated relying upon average saturated hydraulic conductivity fields using darcy s law freeze and cherry 1979 as follows 3 q i q x i k sat i h i d i a where a l l h i and d i respectively are cell area m2 local hydraulic gradient m m and local saturated thickness m the latter two deduced from available piezometric information described in section 2 1 each subsurface discharge value q i embedding the i th cell is therefore related to the most probable local value of k sat i through the 3 therefore stochastic realizations of q i and average values q i are available at each domain cell the latter calculated as the mean across r simulated ones for each cm 2 6 the study of discharge spatial distribution through general extreme value distributions the analysis of both stochastic simulated discharges q i and average ones q i calculated through different cms let one appraise how much local discharge may change under various sources of uncertainty however the spatial variability of maximum and minimum values of q i across different cms requires different statistical tools to be thoroughly investigated in this work a particular focus is dedicated to the largest cm s simulated discharges as prevalent q i contributes to the subsurface flow the proposed way is to interpret either q i and q i empirical probability spatial distributions relying upon a type i generalized estreme values distribution see e g weibull 1951 gumbel 1958 singh 1998 i e a gumbel spatial distribution of local discharges this approach is borrowed from hydrometeorology e g jenkinson 1955 koutsoyiannis 2004a koutsoyiannis 2004b since it is usually employed to study rainfall peak over threshold pot ratios i e those exceeding a prescribed threshold in this work pots are

of each gm facies simulations is fulfilled by simulating r 2000 mc realizations this number of stochastic realizations yields numerically stable results assessed through the stability of first statistical moments for all three employed gm details not shown once gm1 gm2 and gm3 facies subdivision is achieved each one of these is conditioned upon data uncertainty the latter spans three different number of cp i e 24 12 and 6 cp hence giving three different cms for each gm the following fig 2 depicts the conceptualization of cms as the combination of different gms and cps number where three stochastic realizations among r 2000 simulated ones are illustrated for each cm therefore 9 different cms are employed each one collecting r 2000 mc facies realizations at this point one may note that the numerical stability of a gm s facies subsequently guarantees the numerical stability of each cm s stochastic realization constrained by a different employed number of cp this way simulated facies in a particular location i as well as previously described depends both on geological and data uncertainty varying among different cms 3 2 hydraulic conductivity stochastic and average spatial distributions porosity average values are taken from literature based ranges taken from freeze and cherry 1979 gravels 0 20 0 30 sands 0 30 0 40 clays 0 60 0 70 compact rocks or conglomerates 0 10 0 20 and fractured rocks or conglomerates 0 10 0 30 therefore each facies is associated to the average value of porosity taken from these intervals the porosity embedding cells with combined facies i e to facies gr in gm2 and cc in gm3 is associated to the most similar facies considered in the gm as an example facies gr is associated to the average value of gravel porosities interval see table 1 panel a because of their similar ranges of porosity see table 1 at this point eqs 1 and 2 are employed to associate each stochastic facies hence porosity field to a corresponding hydraulic conductivity one which depends on cm s geological and data uncertainty fig 3 depicts average saturated hydraulic conductivity fields deduced from average porosity fields and returned to give an idea of average k sat i spatial distribution throughout the domain the lower is the number of facies employed in a gm the more spatially uniform and generally less permeable is a conductivity field for example average saturated conductivity fields related to cm 7 9 illustrated in fig 3 are more uniform and generally characterized by lower k sat i values than those referring to gm1 and gm2 i e cm 1 6 for all cms the highest values of simulated conductivities are in proximity of surface water bodies which are depicted in light blue and juxtaposed to conductivity average fields in fig 3 conductivity fields enable to quantify subsurface discharges either stochastic q i or q i ones this way a quantification of subsurface discharges is provided although main flow directions must be inferred from other sources of information such as piezometric maps or well data therefore the stochasticity of discharges q i embedding a cell i is due to both a geological and a data source of uncertainty i e to the spatial distribution of facies in each realization r rather than in the choice of local porosity values 3 3 first application the study of subsurface discharges along a hydrogeological section the study of subsurface discharges along an available hydrogeological section section a alongside adda river see fig 1 enables to both appraise the spatial distribution of the highest discharges in complex alluvial systems and how they may vary under different uncertainty sources the following fig 4 illustrates the spatial distribution of stochastic discharges for each cm s r realizations blue lines obtained through stochastic porosity fields as described in section 2 6 and 2 7 along section a from north to south red lines depict for each cm the average local subsurface discharge calculated as the mean across local stochastic q i realizations as well as shown in fig 4 main aquifer bodies are identified from hydrogeological sections and highlighted by red dashed boxes in fig 4 s upper part each fig 4 cm s panel enables to have an idea about the spatial correspondence between locations where the aquifer tends to be highly permeable light blue and green facies see fig 4 s legend and those with the highest simulated q i along the section average discharges q i across realizations significantly differ from the highest simulated ones because of the high variability between mc averaged and random conductivity fields q i peaks mostly located in alluvial areas suggest that groundwater interactions with surface water bodies are not spatially uniform along section a highlighting a conveying pattern of subsurface flow in highly permeable soils furthermore the analysis of geological and data uncertainty sources gives different responses the former one is a relevant source of uncertainty in discharge quantification since a significant decrease is appreciated for both q i and q i fields from cm 1 6 hence from gm1 and gm2 to cm 7 9 hence gm3 the decrease of the highest q i peaks in cm 7 9 is due to the reduced number of facies employed in gm3 which causes hydraulic conductivities being more uniform and generally lower than those belonging to other cms the effect of data uncertainty in this case seems to poorly influence discharges quantification since a barely noticeable decrease in q i or q i quantification is appraised for cm 3 6 and 9 in respect of their 24 and 12 cp counterparts similar results not shown have been obtained for all other hydrogeological sections illustrated in fig 1 3 4 second application the study of subsurface discharges around annone lake the lake of annone is one of minor lakes present in the domain of interest see fig 1 its drainage role in the context of the local phreatic subsurface aquifer is exposed by some dated literature works e g cavallin et al 1983 beretta et al 1984 and more recent ones e g fontana et al 2014 although focused on a larger scale of investigation this role is clearly underlined by available piezometric maps but neither a quantitative analysis of the area nor discharges quantification have ever been provided as far as known to the author stochastic and average subsurface discharges are evaluated as described in section 2 6 and 2 7 and reported in fig 5 for each cm in the present application the lake is conceptualized as a fully penetrating water body through the phreatic alluvial aquifer with the spatial extension i e its perimeter at the ground level kept constant across the whole aquifer thickness the lake lies on a depressed alluvial sedimentary bed and is recharged from the surrounding aquifer as well as qualitatively inferred from the juxtaposed available piezometric map see water table contours and available well data not shown in detail highlighting main subsurface flow directions yellow and green arrows for each cm model blue lines depict stochastic discharges quantified as previously described while red ones depict average ones see panel a in each fig 5 s panel both q i and q i are not uniform along lake s perimeter black dashed polygon panel b peaking in two areas highlighted by green and yellow colored bands panel a mirrored by green and yellow dots and bands panel b respectively both q i and q i are much higher there than elsewhere along the perimeter and this is entirely due on fixed and steady hydraulic conditions as in the present case to the high local conductivity values both q i and q i for cm 1 6 do not show macroscopic differences since geological models gm1 and gm2 are quite similar moreover different numerical constrains i e the number of cps produce no dramatic variations in discharges quantification on the contrary cm 7 9 show a remarkable discharge reduction providing more uniform discharges along the perimeter the variability of simulated mc q i across cms is offered in fig 6 s panel a where a boxplot of q i across annone lake perimeter is offered for each cm as previously discussed the higher q i variability due to the stochasticity of conductivity fields is registered for gms with the highest number of facies a barely appreciable decrease in q i maximum values and average q i across each cm s r realizations can be inspected when comparing gm1 hence cm 1 3 and gm2 hence cm 4 6 while this decrease abruptly increase when dealing with gm3 s cms q i ranges furthermore if all cms realizations hence 1 8 10 4 mc simulations are considered across annone lake s perimeter the highest variability in simulated q i embeds most permeable locations highlighted by colored bands mirroring those illustrated in fig 6 s panel a at this point these results are significant to underline two different issues first which is almost intuitive the impact of the number of simulated facies seriously affects discharges quantification although compact and fractured rocks cr and fr grouped to other facies in gm3 play a minor role at the geological level because of their low joint volumetric contribution about 10 of the total see table 1 they do non negligibly affect the quantification of either q i and q i while gm3 s q i are slightly higher than those for gm1 and gm2 and the highest q i peaks for cm 6 9 are significantly lower than their counterparts in cm 1 6 at the same time the highest variability in simulated q i is accesses in gm1 and gm2 rather in gm3 s cms moreover both q i minimum and maximum values tend to decrease with the increase of the gm order with no significant changes among cms with different number of cp however such an analysis does not provide enough information to fully understand geological and data uncertainty effects especially for maximum values of q i 3 5 the analysis of subsurface discharges through generalized extreme value theory the generalized extreme value approach gev is employed to spatially represent the empirical spatial distributions of thresholded discharges recharging the lake of annone a two parameter extreme value type 1 distribution or ev1 is employed to study extreme stochastic discharges i e q i maxima and minima between different cms which exceed a fixed threshold the ev1 density function for q i is written as follows 5 f q i μ σ 1 σ exp q i μ σ exp exp q i μ σ where q i q x i are peak over threshold local average discharges and μ σ are the location and the scale parameters representing the mean and the standard deviation of q i calculated along the perimeter for each cm s realizations respectively the best estimates of μ σ are obtained through a ml based approach details not shown the 5 is employed to represent q i exceeding for each cm the following thresholds in l s 10 20 50 100 200 500 as well as depicted by colored curves in fig 7 for each thresholded discharge series both empirical continuous curves and theoretical dashed curves probability distributions are illustrated the adequacy of choosing the gev approach is supported by the similarity between the former and the latter ones the discrepancy between empirical and theoretical ev1 distributions becomes non negligible only for highly thresholded q i i e those exceeding 500 l s but spatial distributions tails are analyzed under the same gev approach to understand how maximum discharges vary and convey water to surface water bodies in this case the lake of annone the use of ev1 distributions enables to retrieve additional information about the impact of geological and data sources of uncertainty on average discharges quantification illustrated in fig 7 with a plot for each cm s distributions as well as preliminary discussed in section 3 4 q i are quantified by using the gm3 hence cm 7 9 and are lower than their gm1 and gm2 counterparts a deeper analysis reveals that the sampled occurrence frequency of low q i i e those exceeding low thresholds 10 20 and 50 l s is lower for gm3 than for gm1 or gm2 while intermediate q i i e those exceeding 100 and 200 l s are more frequent around mean values hence with lower variances than those quantified with gm3 high q i values close to the mean are much more frequent in gm3 underlining a much more spatial uniformity of q i than for those evaluated with gm1 and gm2 the conveying spatial pattern of subsurface discharges i e the ability to recognize some cells which are embedded by values of q i much higher than surrounding ones is significantly undermined when relying upon gm3 s cms thus a reduced number of facies in gm3 flattens q i on its spatial average value avoiding to inform about which areas are preferentially recharged or drained 3 6 the effect of geological and data uncertainty sources on subsurface peaks over threshold discharges and their spatial distributions the effect of numerical sources of uncertainty on high discharges becomes more evident if only those exceeding high thresholds are investigated through the gev approach these are considered as pots from a spatial viewpoint the following fig 8 illustrates both stochastic discharges qi r 2000 blue curves and average qi ones red dashed curves grouped upon each cm and obtained as the mean across simulated ones for each perimeter location i note qi quantification via the mean across conductivity fields returns the same results maximum discharges have been considered hence those exceeding a threshold of 500 l s to study how the spatial peaks of discharges change from a cm to another one hence the influence of geological or data uncertainties green and light blue arrows are enclosed in each cm s panel to highlight the impact of cps on the position of average discharges q i exceeding the threshold of 500 l s with the maximum frequency and the tendency of stochastic realizations to be skewed respectively green and blue arrows and lines highlight that the change in cms provoke a slight change both in the shape of distributions and in the frequency of average discharges whose variation is enhanced when the number of facies and the number of cp decreases fig 8 s panels enable to appraise a prevalent role of the geological uncertainty source in respect of the data one the effect of changing the number of facies in a gm has different impacts on discharges quantification whether for gm2 or gm3 if compared with gm1 see vertical green lines for those evaluated through the geological conceptualization offered by gm2 a non negligible but very low increase in the skewness of the highest discharges make them differ from gm1 s ones on the contrary less skewed discharges are obtained with gm3 rather than with gm1 and gm2 the analysis of the position of q i empirical distributions peaks through their coordinates i e q i frequency in fig 8 s plots is reported in fig 9 and enables further and deeper considerations fig 9 represents red curves peaks see them also in fig 7 s panels in a q i frequency log log plot therefore the coordinates of q i distributions peaks respectively individuate for each cm the most frequent q i simulated across the perimeter and its variation around the spatial mean divided by the spatial standard deviation dots are grouped using different colors upon their different gms while cps are enclosed as dots etiquettes here it is implicitly assumed that such an analysis for average discharges peaks may enlighten how geological and data uncertainty affect all stochastic discharges quantification the change in the spatial frequency i e δ f of most frequent q i values along lake s perimeter and their quantification i e δ q i μ σ do not significantly change across different cps across gm1 s cms since blue points positions in the log log plot in fig 9 are almost coincident these changes become non negligible when moving to analyze gm2 s cms thus analyzing cms related to 4 facies green dots when moving to gm3 and its cms these differences are much more evident both the differences in frequency and simulated q i between gm3 and other two gms and the difference between different cms related to the same gm3 are relevant employing more cps returns q i which exhibit more discharge peaks i e less frequent and higher than those obtained with less cps this is due to the larger simulated values k sat i embedding few locations along the lake perimeter see colored bands in figs 5 and 6 the less cp employed the more uniform and less permeable along the perimeter are the average conductivity fields returning lower and more frequent q i peaks i e more flattened and uniform q i spatial distributions than in the other gms this way of behaving affects the shape of all stochastic discharges since all the blue curves reported in fig 7 s panels slightly tend to be less skewed in discharges values and frequent along the perimeter apart of geologically induced effects the role of data source of uncertainty seems to become relevant only if a geological primary source of uncertainty which rules discharges spatial non uniformity or uniformity is given hence if a change in the employed gm is considered this means that since gm1 and gm2 are not so dissimilar one to each other a variation in the number of cps does not significantly affect q i and q i spatial distributions for these gms on the other hand for gm3 which geological hence conceptual differentiation from gm1 and gm2 is more relevant the higher the decrease in employed cp number the higher is the spatial uniformity of both average and stochastic simulated discharges 4 conclusions the present study provides significant results to properly frame how geological and data uncertainty sources affect the quantification of subsurface discharges in heterogeneous aquifers a stochastic approach has been employed to compare three geological model achieved through a sisim methodology to simulate facies spatial distributions each geological model employees three kinds of data constrains then average porosity literature based values have been associated to facies realizations enabling to evaluate stochastic fields of saturated hydraulic conductivity the latter ones enable to quantify subsurface discharge realizations under fixed and steady hydraulic conditions hence to study aquifer river or aquifer lake interactions spatial patterns furthermore the generalized extreme values approach represents a novel viewpoint to study the spatial distribution of subsurface discharges pots and the impact of data uncertainty on their quantification major conclusions can be resumed as follows 1 stochastic subsurface discharges can be quantified under steady and fixed hydraulic conditions upon the sole knowledge of facies spatial locations through several possible geological models which vehiculate different conceptualizations of the geological setting of the investigated area 2 subsurface discharges are mostly conveyed towards permeable aquifer areas where their maximum values are quantified while being barely significant in other ones these patterns are assessed both for stochastic and average discharges suggesting that subsurface channelization may be a main spatial pattern regulating water fluxes within the phreatic aquifer through preferential pathways these results are consistent with available geological hydrogeological and piezometric information 3 the primary source of uncertainty affecting the quantification of subsurface discharges is the geological one the latter has been investigated through different geological models proving to exert a major influence on subsurface discharges both stochastic and average spatial distributions this aspect has been investigated through the analysis of discharges simulated along a hydrogeological section and across a minor lake aquifer thickness 4 a generalized extreme value approach has been employed from a spatial perspective enabling to properly inspect both the role of geological and data uncertainty the effect of the latter one related to conditioning data is properly investigated by discharges peaks over threshold i e the tails of gev of discharges empirical distributions data uncertainty seems to behave as dependent on and conditioned to a more relevant uncertainty source hence playing as a secondary and subsidiary uncertainty source if the primary i e geological source of uncertainty exists and is relevant when considering different kind of models then conditioning data uncertainty becomes significant and subsidiarily contributes to affect discharges quantification enhancing the effect given by the geological uncertainty otherwise data uncertainty source is not relevant at all the present work opens the way to several research vectors unsteady hydraulic conditions could represent a major research direction to understand the impact on subsurface discharges quantification when local water table levels vary on time this possibility seems to be appealing within the framework climate change impacts on subsurface flow regimes whose quantification is fundamental in many anthropic applications furthermore another research vector may be represented by employing uncertain porosity values i e stochastic ones to be associated to simulated facies as an additional uncertainty source at the end it would be useful to involve other sources of quantitative information although limited to few locations such as local hydraulic conductivity estimations

2363,the quantification of subsurface discharges may significantly be affected by multiple sources of uncertainty especially in highly heterogeneous aquifers in this work subsurface discharges within alluvial aquifers located in the province of lecco lombardy northern italy are quantified relying upon a monte carlo mc framework under geological and conditioning data uncertainty sources these are respectively employed through different geological conceptual models whose facies spatial distributions are simulated through sequential indicator simulations methodology sisim and by conditioning stochastic facies simulations with different data constraints stochastic porosity fields are then achieved upon facies simulated fields by associating average porosity values to each local simulated facies then stochastic subsurface discharge fluxes are quantified under steady hydraulic conditions upon saturated hydraulic fields inferred from porosity ones then the study of subsurface discharges is pursued via the generalized extreme values gev approach this method enables both to interpret peak over thresholds pots discharges spatial distribution and to study the role geological and data uncertainty sources on their quantification for example studying discharges conveyed towards a lake through the surrounding aquifer these uncertainty based analyses show that subsurface discharges clearly convey in correspondence of main alluvial aquifers as well as the tendency to be collected along preferential pathways furthermore the inspection of pots empirical probability spatial distributions highlights that the geological uncertainty plays as a primary uncertainty source rather than the conditioning data the latter plays a minor role e g between different employed models only in presence of a relevant geological difference between analyzed ones these results are consistent with other kinds of information such as hydrogeological sections and available piezometric maps providing novel contributions to understanding how to quantify subsurface discharges in poorly monitored aquifers or how to treat various sources of uncertainty keywords subsurface discharge geostatistics monte carlo geological uncertainty data uncertainty data availability data are freely available and their source is reported in the dedicated section 1 introduction the quantification of subsurface discharges in alluvial aquifers is one of the most interesting topics in the domain of subsurface hydrology this is particularly challenging where the lithological composition of subsurface aquifers is complex such as in fractured or karst aquifers hyman 2020 or heterogeneous alluvial areas where riparian groundwater intensively interacts with surface water bodies kaser and hunkeler 2016 hester and fox 2020 the importance of addressing this issue has been underlined to understand subsurface flow patterns at various scales from the macropore to the catchment one see zhang et al 2016 the interpretation of core data such as proposed by bianchi et al 2011 enables the interpretation of the connectivity between different areas of an alluvial aquifer as underlined by riva et al 2010 and rhodes et al 2017 moreover a proper interpretation of subsurface flow structures may lead to quantifying water exchanges between aquifers and surface water bodies e g as proposed by kazmierczak et al 2016 and liyi et al 2020 using physical and tracing methods or using numerical schemes to interpret flow pathways within the vadose zone see hong et al 2020 however the quantification of subsurface discharges in highly heterogeneous areas such as alluvial surficial aquifers is ruled by several uncertainty sources which are mainly due to the geological conceptualization of the investigated aquifer hence to the reconstruction of facies from stratigraphic data geological cores borehole data or hydrogeological sections as well as highlighted by riva et al 2010 mustafa et al 2018 and gueting et al 2018 phelps et al 2018 focused the analysis on geological models conceptualization and variogram based customized models as uncertainty sources hence governing the reconstruction of complex geological structures dealing with multiple geological facies is an issue usually faced relying upon sequential indicator simulations i e sisim see goovaerts 1997 chiles and delfiner 2009 as a widely known and applied methodology for the reconstructions of facies fields i e 2d or 3d spatial distributions within heterogeneous domains as well as proposed by zhang et al 2009 serrano et al 2012 and serrano et al 2014 and more recently by siena and riva 2020 and jorreto zaguirre et al 2020 moreover the stochastic modeling of facies enables to proper consider complex geological structures including faults or multiple stratified sedimentary layers see e g goodwin et al 2022 in addition to the geological source of uncertainty recent literature works have underlined the importance of considering other ones these may arise when simulating facies spatial distributions and employing these as priors for subsequent conditioned ones ma and jafarpour 2019 another source of uncertainty is represented by the number of conditioning data or the prevalent dimensions of the search ellipsoid that the modeler chooses when employing kriging based estimation or simulation methodologies this aspect seems particularly interesting as well as underlined by recent works such as athens and caers 2022 selia et al 2022 samson and deutsch 2022 and mery and marcotte 2022 where various investigations upon conditioning data based uncertainty sources are proposed the present work aims to study the spatial distribution of subsurface discharges and their quantification upon a geological source of uncertainty and another is provided by conditioning data involved in stochastic field simulations geological uncertainty is involved by relying upon 2d sequential indicator simulations sisim of facies whose stochastic realizations are grasped within different conceptual models and collected within a monte carlo mc framework stochastic facies fields lead to achieve spatial fields of total porosity hence saturated hydraulic conductivity ones estimated under steady and fixed hydraulic conditions then stochastic simulations of subsurface discharges are obtained and analyzed in the proximity of two of the main surface water bodies of the investigated area the attention of the present work is focused to i understanding subsurface flow spatial features in alluvial phreatic aquifers like those within the investigated area and ii analyzing the impact of geological hence facies spatial variability and conditioning data for simulated discharges moreover iii to assess which source of uncertainty geological or data based plays the major role in discharges spatial characterization hence regulating the interactions between the phreatic aquifer and surface water bodies the paper is structured as follows section 2 encompasses the methodology through several subsections section 2 1 describes the investigated area from a hydrogeological viewpoint as well as describes available quantitative data and other kinds of information sections 2 2 and 2 3 introduce the role of geological and data sources of uncertainty respectively section 2 4 provides a brief description of the methodology to simulate facies stochastic realizations and to collect them within a monte carlo mc framework section 2 5 explains how facies spatial distributions are employed to evaluate saturated hydraulic conductivity fields section 2 6 introduces the generalized extreme values approach employed to spatially describe peak over threshold hence maximum subsurface discharges results are enclosed in section 3 encompassing facies stochastic fields and hydraulic conductivity ones in sections 3 1 and 3 2 respectively in sections 3 3 and 3 4 two case studies are proposed to study subsurface discharge spatial distributions in the proximity of major surface water bodies and to deepen the role of the uncertainty sources in particular the geological one section 3 5 analyzes the use of the generalized extreme value gev distribution approach to study stochastically simulated subsurface discharge while section 3 6 encloses the study of peaks over threshold pots of groundwater discharges enabling to properly inspect the impact of data related uncertainty major conclusions and future research vectors are reported in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 data field setting and hydrogeological framework the present study analyzes the phreatic aquifer system located in the province of lecco northern italy and encompassing an extent of approximately 31 25 km2 see fig 1 the domain is located in a sedimentary alluvial region characterized by the two major rivers in the area i e adda and lambro respectively average groundwater flow is directed southwards beretta et al 1984 with the adda river which generally plays a draining role the lakes located within the domain are generally recharged from the surrounding aquifer since lying on low elevated alluvial beds data sources are listed in detail in the data source section the current morphological and geological setting of the area is due to glacial and fluvial sedimentary areas which originated during the last glaciation surface waters are carved on mostly alluvial deposits the phreatic aquifer resides in permeable alluvial sediments which are locally alternated with clayey or silty lenses with emphasis close to rivers the most exploited area for anthropic water related uses is located in the southern part of the domain where the surficial i e phreatic aquifer average thickness is about 35 40 m the surficial aquifer is mostly sandy and grave with non negligible intrusions of clayey lenses whose extensions are anyway not continuous throughout wide extensions groundwater circulation in this phreatic aquifer is regulated by several paleochannels in particular in the proximity of the adda river see e g cavallin et al 1983 beretta et al 1984 schiavo et al 2022 the present study relies on stratigraphic and lithologic information obtained from n 222 boreholes depicted as yellow circles in fig 1 each borehole stratigraphy enables to infer the elevation zn x y of the surface aquifer bottom n 1 2 n x and y are planar coordinates i e the local elevation of a rocky or clayey aquitard top and the lithological local composition of the aquifer the domain is then discretized by cells with side l 100 m e g in 77 500 cells each one identified upon its barycenter coordinates xi xi yi with i 1 77500 the recognition of 5 k 1 5 prevalent facies as well as their average volumetric fractions are performed each borehole n th location is then embedded with an indicator k 1 5 indicating the most prevalent facies characterizing that aquifer site hence across its whole local thickness upon the knowledge of facies volumetric fractions an available piezometric reconstruction dated 2013 and currently used by local authorities supports the analysis by informing about main subsurface flow directions throughout the investigated areas and is employed to infer local values of the hydraulic gradient h i reconstructed upon water table contour levels and well piezometric information aquifer bottom elevation is employed to obtain an estimation of local saturated aquifer thickness di and which geological layers belong to the phreatic aquifer i e are located above the low permeability aquitard top spatially continuous estimation of local water table level h i and aquifer bottom elevation z i then local aquifer saturated thickness d i and hydraulic gradient h i have been obtained via ordinary kriging procedure taking mean values without considering estimated variances details not shown for further details see also schiavo 2022 and schiavo et al 2022 2 2 geological uncertainty relying upon boreholes dataset described in section 2 1 the uncertain spatial distribution of facies is considered by using three different geological models gm see e g rojas et al 2008 ma et al 2022 athens and caers 2022 each one of these respectively assumes a unique structure of the subsurface domain hence subdividing borehole lithological information into groups each one collecting one or more facies upon their main lithological patterns hence each gm is characterized by a different number of facies determining the hydrogeological structure of the investigate phreatic aquifer 2 3 conditioning data uncertainty once each geological model gm is defined the variation in the number of conditioning points cp as a data source of uncertainty is considered following the way opened by recent works athens and caers 2022 ma et al 2022 selia et al 2022 the uncertainty related to cp affects the kind of facies simulated in a generic i th domain location by controlling the number of the surrounding truth points involved in kriging equations see e g chiles and delfiner 2009 moreover the planar isotropic search radius r s is much larger r s 10 km than the facies correlation scale being a kriging equations parameter thus cp number is the only uncertainty source related to conditioning data when simulating the spatial distribution of facies a gm with a prescribed number of facies and a certain cp number is from now on defined as a combined model cm 2 4 stochastic simulations of geological facies a monte carlo based mc framework is employed to collect stochastic facies simulations performed at each domain cell i stochastic simulations of facies are based on bi dimensional indicator variograms associated to each gm s facies omnidirectional variograms are more indicated for large domains being suitable to infer spatial geological patterns that might not be directional schiavo 2022 which on the contrary is the case of data alongside rivers or permeable fans fontana et al 2014 the sequential indicator simulations sisim approach is a well known and widely used methodology to achieve stochastic simulations of geomaterials see e g isaaks and srivastava 1989 goovaerts 1997 in heterogeneous domains as well as described e g by zhang et al 2009 and more recently by siena and riva 2020 and jorreto zaguirre et al 2020 the sisim approach here adopted can be summarized in few passages i for a dataset of n boreholes the generic n th borehole is associated with its 2d prevalent facies e g k facies i e with the one with the largest volumetric fraction across the whole phreatic aquifer local thickness this information is retrieved from stratigraphic and geological data ii borehole facies to be simulated are defined for each gm if a gm is conceived with fewer facies hence less than k than those which have been recognized at point i the exceeding ones are grouped into facies with the most similar lithologic patterns therefore each gm is associated with a number of cps returning a unique cm iii the function z x i n is employed as a discrete variable indicating the facies f associated to a location i for each cm then the indicator function i k x i is employed being 1 if f k or 0 otherwise iv a planar omnidirectional isotropic variogram γ k h is computed for each facies employed in each cm in the present study zero nugget exponential variogram functions have been employed to interpret facies data the range r k at which each variogram structure reaches a plateau is estimated through a maximum likelihood ml approach v bidimensional conditional mc realizations of the spatial distribution of each cm facies are achieved using indicator variograms obtained at step iv applied to all n available boreholes the sequential simulation methodology is widely described in isaaks and srivastava 1989 and remy et al 2009 the sisim methodology returns r stochastic facies realizations for each employed cm the condition of numerical stability for each cm s collection of r realizations must be fulfilled see results section the consistency of each cm with the geological features of the investigated aquifer is assured as follows each cm s facies realization r is associated to an average porosity value taken from a literature based ranges from freeze and cherry 1979 this procedure returns r total porosity stochastic values for each domain location i i e r different ϕ i ϕ x i values at each cell i estimated via simulated facies 2 5 stochastic simulations of subsurface discharges local values ϕ i of total porosity are then employed to deduce saturated conductivity fields following the approach proposed by riva et al 2010 the local i th saturated hydraulic conductivity can be evaluated through the kozeny carman formulation kozeny 1927 carman 1956 1 k sat i k sat x i 8 3 10 3 g ϕ i 3 d 10 i 2 ν 1 ϕ i 2 upon the knowledge of g 9 806 m s2 as the gravity acceleration constant ν 1 002 m2 s as water viscosity at 20 c and d 10 as the 10th percentile of the cumulative particle size distribution the empirical formulation proposed by vukovic and soro 1992 enables to deduce the d 10 associated with a local porosity value ϕ i as well 2 ϕ i ϕ x i 0 255 1 0 83 d 60 d 10 where d 60 2 19 10 3 m defined as the 60th percentile of the cumulative particle size distribution is taken as a constant value for all realizations r this value of d 60 was calculated by rosas et al 2014 and is feasible for most of sandy alluvial aquifer soils similar values are usually adopted for moderately sorted sandy gravely soils see e g riva et al 2006 riva et al 2008 riva et al 2010 here the choice of taking d 60 as a constant while employing d 10 as a stochastic porosity based value is strengthened by the lack of correlation between d 10 and d 60 that was verified in previous works for various alluvial soils e g by riva et al 2006 and riva et al 2010 like the ones here considered thus local values of subsurface discharges are calculated relying upon average saturated hydraulic conductivity fields using darcy s law freeze and cherry 1979 as follows 3 q i q x i k sat i h i d i a where a l l h i and d i respectively are cell area m2 local hydraulic gradient m m and local saturated thickness m the latter two deduced from available piezometric information described in section 2 1 each subsurface discharge value q i embedding the i th cell is therefore related to the most probable local value of k sat i through the 3 therefore stochastic realizations of q i and average values q i are available at each domain cell the latter calculated as the mean across r simulated ones for each cm 2 6 the study of discharge spatial distribution through general extreme value distributions the analysis of both stochastic simulated discharges q i and average ones q i calculated through different cms let one appraise how much local discharge may change under various sources of uncertainty however the spatial variability of maximum and minimum values of q i across different cms requires different statistical tools to be thoroughly investigated in this work a particular focus is dedicated to the largest cm s simulated discharges as prevalent q i contributes to the subsurface flow the proposed way is to interpret either q i and q i empirical probability spatial distributions relying upon a type i generalized estreme values distribution see e g weibull 1951 gumbel 1958 singh 1998 i e a gumbel spatial distribution of local discharges this approach is borrowed from hydrometeorology e g

then investigated as the maximum ones to study main water fluxes e g recharging water bodies across the surficial subsurface domain and the impact on their quantification of employing different geological models or data conditioning constrains 3 results 3 1 combined models under geological and data uncertainty three different geological models are considered for the dataset described in section 2 1 respectively considering 5 4 and 3 groups of facies with different lithological patterns the gm1 relies on the following subdivision of borehole facies into five lithological categories gravel g clay c sand s compact rock conglomerate cr and fractured rock conglomerate fr listed in table 1 by decreasing volumetric fraction one planar indicator variogram γ k h is employed for each one of these facies and denoted by a corresponding index k 1 5 gm2 relies on gm1 s facies classification with gravel g and fractured rock fr considered as unique facies i e gravel and fractured rock gr whose joint population spatial correlation is expressed by a proper indicator variogram gm3 relies on gm2 s facies classification with clay c and compact rock cr considered as a unique facies i e clay and compact rock gr whose joint population spatial correlation is expressed by a proper indicator variogram each experimental indicator variogram γ k h correlation scale is evaluated through a ml approach enabling to employ a zero nugget omnidirectional isotropic exponential model 4 γ k h σ k 2 exp 1 3 h r k to describe facies spatial correlation with h σ k 2 and r k as the separation distance the variogram sill and range associated to each gm s facies respectively the following table 1 reports ml estimated ranges r k for all employed indicator variograms the numerical stability requirement of each gm facies simulations is fulfilled by simulating r 2000 mc realizations this number of stochastic realizations yields numerically stable results assessed through the stability of first statistical moments for all three employed gm details not shown once gm1 gm2 and gm3 facies subdivision is achieved each one of these is conditioned upon data uncertainty the latter spans three different number of cp i e 24 12 and 6 cp hence giving three different cms for each gm the following fig 2 depicts the conceptualization of cms as the combination of different gms and cps number where three stochastic realizations among r 2000 simulated ones are illustrated for each cm therefore 9 different cms are employed each one collecting r 2000 mc facies realizations at this point one may note that the numerical stability of a gm s facies subsequently guarantees the numerical stability of each cm s stochastic realization constrained by a different employed number of cp this way simulated facies in a particular location i as well as previously described depends both on geological and data uncertainty varying among different cms 3 2 hydraulic conductivity stochastic and average spatial distributions porosity average values are taken from literature based ranges taken from freeze and cherry 1979 gravels 0 20 0 30 sands 0 30 0 40 clays 0 60 0 70 compact rocks or conglomerates 0 10 0 20 and fractured rocks or conglomerates 0 10 0 30 therefore each facies is associated to the average value of porosity taken from these intervals the porosity embedding cells with combined facies i e to facies gr in gm2 and cc in gm3 is associated to the most similar facies considered in the gm as an example facies gr is associated to the average value of gravel porosities interval see table 1 panel a because of their similar ranges of porosity see table 1 at this point eqs 1 and 2 are employed to associate each stochastic facies hence porosity field to a corresponding hydraulic conductivity one which depends on cm s geological and data uncertainty fig 3 depicts average saturated hydraulic conductivity fields deduced from average porosity fields and returned to give an idea of average k sat i spatial distribution throughout the domain the lower is the number of facies employed in a gm the more spatially uniform and generally less permeable is a conductivity field for example average saturated conductivity fields related to cm 7 9 illustrated in fig 3 are more uniform and generally characterized by lower k sat i values than those referring to gm1 and gm2 i e cm 1 6 for all cms the highest values of simulated conductivities are in proximity of surface water bodies which are depicted in light blue and juxtaposed to conductivity average fields in fig 3 conductivity fields enable to quantify subsurface discharges either stochastic q i or q i ones this way a quantification of subsurface discharges is provided although main flow directions must be inferred from other sources of information such as piezometric maps or well data therefore the stochasticity of discharges q i embedding a cell i is due to both a geological and a data source of uncertainty i e to the spatial distribution of facies in each realization r rather than in the choice of local porosity values 3 3 first application the study of subsurface discharges along a hydrogeological section the study of subsurface discharges along an available hydrogeological section section a alongside adda river see fig 1 enables to both appraise the spatial distribution of the highest discharges in complex alluvial systems and how they may vary under different uncertainty sources the following fig 4 illustrates the spatial distribution of stochastic discharges for each cm s r realizations blue lines obtained through stochastic porosity fields as described in section 2 6 and 2 7 along section a from north to south red lines depict for each cm the average local subsurface discharge calculated as the mean across local stochastic q i realizations as well as shown in fig 4 main aquifer bodies are identified from hydrogeological sections and highlighted by red dashed boxes in fig 4 s upper part each fig 4 cm s panel enables to have an idea about the spatial correspondence between locations where the aquifer tends to be highly permeable light blue and green facies see fig 4 s legend and those with the highest simulated q i along the section average discharges q i across realizations significantly differ from the highest simulated ones because of the high variability between mc averaged and random conductivity fields q i peaks mostly located in alluvial areas suggest that groundwater interactions with surface water bodies are not spatially uniform along section a highlighting a conveying pattern of subsurface flow in highly permeable soils furthermore the analysis of geological and data uncertainty sources gives different responses the former one is a relevant source of uncertainty in discharge quantification since a significant decrease is appreciated for both q i and q i fields from cm 1 6 hence from gm1 and gm2 to cm 7 9 hence gm3 the decrease of the highest q i peaks in cm 7 9 is due to the reduced number of facies employed in gm3 which causes hydraulic conductivities being more uniform and generally lower than those belonging to other cms the effect of data uncertainty in this case seems to poorly influence discharges quantification since a barely noticeable decrease in q i or q i quantification is appraised for cm 3 6 and 9 in respect of their 24 and 12 cp counterparts similar results not shown have been obtained for all other hydrogeological sections illustrated in fig 1 3 4 second application the study of subsurface discharges around annone lake the lake of annone is one of minor lakes present in the domain of interest see fig 1 its drainage role in the context of the local phreatic subsurface aquifer is exposed by some dated literature works e g cavallin et al 1983 beretta et al 1984 and more recent ones e g fontana et al 2014 although focused on a larger scale of investigation this role is clearly underlined by available piezometric maps but neither a quantitative analysis of the area nor discharges quantification have ever been provided as far as known to the author stochastic and average subsurface discharges are evaluated as described in section 2 6 and 2 7 and reported in fig 5 for each cm in the present application the lake is conceptualized as a fully penetrating water body through the phreatic alluvial aquifer with the spatial extension i e its perimeter at the ground level kept constant across the whole aquifer thickness the lake lies on a depressed alluvial sedimentary bed and is recharged from the surrounding aquifer as well as qualitatively inferred from the juxtaposed available piezometric map see water table contours and available well data not shown in detail highlighting main subsurface flow directions yellow and green arrows for each cm model blue lines depict stochastic discharges quantified as previously described while red ones depict average ones see panel a in each fig 5 s panel both q i and q i are not uniform along lake s perimeter black dashed polygon panel b peaking in two areas highlighted by green and yellow colored bands panel a mirrored by green and yellow dots and bands panel b respectively both q i and q i are much higher there than elsewhere along the perimeter and this is entirely due on fixed and steady hydraulic conditions as in the present case to the high local conductivity values both q i and q i for cm 1 6 do not show macroscopic differences since geological models gm1 and gm2 are quite similar moreover different numerical constrains i e the number of cps produce no dramatic variations in discharges quantification on the contrary cm 7 9 show a remarkable discharge reduction providing more uniform discharges along the perimeter the variability of simulated mc q i across cms is offered in fig 6 s panel a where a boxplot of q i across annone lake perimeter is offered for each cm as previously discussed the higher q i variability due to the stochasticity of conductivity fields is registered for gms with the highest number of facies a barely appreciable decrease in q i maximum values and average q i across each cm s r realizations can be inspected when comparing gm1 hence cm 1 3 and gm2 hence cm 4 6 while this decrease abruptly increase when dealing with gm3 s cms q i ranges furthermore if all cms realizations hence 1 8 10 4 mc simulations are considered across annone lake s perimeter the highest variability in simulated q i embeds most permeable locations highlighted by colored bands mirroring those illustrated in fig 6 s panel a at this point these results are significant to underline two different issues first which is almost intuitive the impact of the number of simulated facies seriously affects discharges quantification although compact and fractured rocks cr and fr grouped to other facies in gm3 play a minor role at the geological level because of their low joint volumetric contribution about 10 of the total see table 1 they do non negligibly affect the quantification of either q i and q i while gm3 s q i are slightly higher than those for gm1 and gm2 and the highest q i peaks for cm 6 9 are significantly lower than their counterparts in cm 1 6 at the same time the highest variability in simulated q i is accesses in gm1 and gm2 rather in gm3 s cms moreover both q i minimum and maximum values tend to decrease with the increase of the gm order with no significant changes among cms with different number of cp however such an analysis does not provide enough information to fully understand geological and data uncertainty effects especially for maximum values of q i 3 5 the analysis of subsurface discharges through generalized extreme value theory the generalized extreme value approach gev is employed to spatially represent the empirical spatial distributions of thresholded discharges recharging the lake of annone a two parameter extreme value type 1 distribution or ev1 is employed to study extreme stochastic discharges i e q i maxima and minima between different cms which exceed a fixed threshold the ev1 density function for q i is written as follows 5 f q i μ σ 1 σ exp q i μ σ exp exp q i μ σ where q i q x i are peak over threshold local average discharges and μ σ are the location and the scale parameters representing the mean and the standard deviation of q i calculated along the perimeter for each cm s realizations respectively the best estimates of μ σ are obtained through a ml based approach details not shown the 5 is employed to represent q i exceeding for each cm the following thresholds in l s 10 20 50 100 200 500 as well as depicted by colored curves in fig 7 for each thresholded discharge series both empirical continuous curves and theoretical dashed curves probability distributions are illustrated the adequacy of choosing the gev approach is supported by the similarity between the former and the latter ones the discrepancy between empirical and theoretical ev1 distributions becomes non negligible only for highly thresholded q i i e those exceeding 500 l s but spatial distributions tails are analyzed under the same gev approach to understand how maximum discharges vary and convey water to surface water bodies in this case the lake of annone the use of ev1 distributions enables to retrieve additional information about the impact of geological and data sources of uncertainty on average discharges quantification illustrated in fig 7 with a plot for each cm s distributions as well as preliminary discussed in section 3 4 q i are quantified by using the gm3 hence cm 7 9 and are lower than their gm1 and gm2 counterparts a deeper analysis reveals that the sampled occurrence frequency of low q i i e those exceeding low thresholds 10 20 and 50 l s is lower for gm3 than for gm1 or gm2 while intermediate q i i e those exceeding 100 and 200 l s are more frequent around mean values hence with lower variances than those quantified with gm3 high q i values close to the mean are much more frequent in gm3 underlining a much more spatial uniformity of q i than for those evaluated with gm1 and gm2 the conveying spatial pattern of subsurface discharges i e the ability to recognize some cells which are embedded by values of q i much higher than surrounding ones is significantly undermined when relying upon gm3 s cms thus a reduced number of facies in gm3 flattens q i on its spatial average value avoiding to inform about which areas are preferentially recharged or drained 3 6 the effect of geological and data uncertainty sources on subsurface peaks over threshold discharges and their spatial distributions the effect of numerical sources of uncertainty on high discharges becomes more evident if only those exceeding high thresholds are investigated through the gev approach these are considered as pots from a spatial viewpoint the following fig 8 illustrates both stochastic discharges qi r 2000 blue curves and average qi ones red dashed curves grouped upon each cm and obtained as the mean across simulated ones for each perimeter location i note qi quantification via the mean across conductivity fields returns the same results maximum discharges have been considered hence those exceeding a threshold of 500 l s to study how the spatial peaks of discharges change from a cm to another one hence the influence of geological or data uncertainties green and light blue arrows are enclosed in each cm s panel to highlight the impact of cps on the position of average discharges q i exceeding the threshold of 500 l s with the maximum frequency and the tendency of stochastic realizations to be skewed respectively green and blue arrows and lines highlight that the change in cms provoke a slight change both in the shape of distributions and in the frequency of average discharges whose variation is enhanced when the number of facies and the number of cp decreases fig 8 s panels enable to appraise a prevalent role of the geological uncertainty source in respect of the data one the effect of changing the number of facies in a gm has different impacts on discharges quantification whether for gm2 or gm3 if compared with gm1 see vertical green lines for those evaluated through the geological conceptualization offered by gm2 a non negligible but very low increase in the skewness of the highest discharges make them differ from gm1 s ones on the contrary less skewed discharges are obtained with gm3 rather than with gm1 and gm2 the analysis of the position of q i empirical distributions peaks through their coordinates i e q i frequency in fig 8 s plots is reported in fig 9 and enables further and deeper considerations fig 9 represents red curves peaks see them also in fig 7 s panels in a q i frequency log log plot therefore the coordinates of q i distributions peaks respectively individuate for each cm the most frequent q i simulated across the perimeter and its variation around the spatial mean divided by the spatial standard deviation dots are grouped using different colors upon their different gms while cps are enclosed as dots etiquettes here it is implicitly assumed that such an analysis for average discharges peaks may enlighten how geological and data uncertainty affect all stochastic discharges quantification the change in the spatial frequency i e δ f of most frequent q i values along lake s perimeter and their quantification i e δ q i μ σ do not significantly change across different cps across gm1 s cms since blue points positions in the log log plot in fig 9 are almost coincident these changes become non negligible when moving to analyze gm2 s cms thus analyzing cms related to 4 facies green dots when moving to gm3 and its cms these differences are much more evident both the differences in frequency and simulated q i between gm3 and other two gms and the difference between different cms related to the same gm3 are relevant employing more cps returns q i which exhibit more discharge peaks i e less frequent and higher than those obtained with less cps this is due to the larger simulated values k sat i embedding few locations along the lake perimeter see colored bands in figs 5 and 6 the less cp employed the more uniform and less permeable along the perimeter are the average conductivity fields returning lower and more frequent q i peaks i e more flattened and uniform q i spatial distributions than in the other gms this way of behaving affects the shape of all stochastic discharges since all the blue curves reported in fig 7 s panels slightly tend to be less skewed in discharges values and frequent along the perimeter apart of geologically induced effects the role of data source of uncertainty seems to become relevant only if a geological primary source of uncertainty which rules discharges spatial non uniformity or uniformity is given hence if a change in the employed gm is considered this means that since gm1 and gm2 are not so dissimilar one to each other a variation in the number of cps does not significantly affect q i and q i spatial distributions for these gms on the other hand for gm3 which geological hence conceptual differentiation from gm1 and gm2 is more relevant the higher the decrease in employed cp number the higher is the spatial uniformity of both average and stochastic simulated discharges 4 conclusions the present study provides significant results to properly frame how geological and data uncertainty sources affect the quantification of subsurface discharges in heterogeneous aquifers a stochastic approach has been employed to compare three geological model achieved through a sisim methodology to simulate facies spatial distributions each geological model employees three kinds of data constrains then average porosity literature based values have been associated to facies realizations enabling to evaluate stochastic fields of saturated hydraulic conductivity the latter ones enable to quantify subsurface discharge realizations under fixed and steady hydraulic conditions hence to study aquifer river or aquifer lake interactions spatial patterns furthermore the generalized extreme values approach represents a novel viewpoint to study the spatial distribution of subsurface discharges pots and the impact of data uncertainty on their quantification major conclusions can be resumed as follows 1 stochastic subsurface discharges can be quantified under steady and fixed hydraulic conditions upon the sole knowledge of facies spatial locations through several possible geological models which vehiculate different conceptualizations of the geological setting of the investigated area 2 subsurface discharges are mostly conveyed towards permeable aquifer areas where their maximum values are quantified while being barely significant in other ones these patterns are assessed both for stochastic and average discharges suggesting that subsurface channelization may be a main spatial pattern regulating water fluxes within the phreatic aquifer through preferential pathways these results are consistent with available geological hydrogeological and piezometric information 3 the primary source of uncertainty affecting the quantification of subsurface discharges is the geological one the latter has been investigated through different geological models proving to exert a major influence on subsurface discharges both stochastic and average spatial distributions this aspect has been investigated through the analysis of discharges simulated along a hydrogeological section and across a minor lake aquifer thickness 4 a generalized extreme value approach has been employed from a spatial perspective enabling to properly inspect both the role of geological and data uncertainty the effect of the latter one related to conditioning data is properly investigated by discharges peaks over threshold i e the tails of gev of discharges empirical distributions data uncertainty seems to behave as dependent on and conditioned to a more relevant uncertainty source hence playing as a secondary and subsidiary uncertainty source if the primary i e geological source of uncertainty exists and is relevant when considering different kind of models then conditioning data uncertainty becomes significant and subsidiarily contributes to affect discharges quantification enhancing the effect given by the geological uncertainty otherwise data uncertainty source is not relevant at all the present work opens the way to several research vectors unsteady hydraulic conditions could represent a major research direction to understand the impact on subsurface discharges quantification when local water table levels vary on time this possibility seems to be appealing within the framework climate change impacts on subsurface flow regimes whose quantification is fundamental in many anthropic applications furthermore another research vector may be represented by employing uncertain porosity values i e stochastic ones to be associated to simulated facies as an additional uncertainty source at the end it would be useful to involve other sources of quantitative information although limited to few locations such as local hydraulic conductivity estimations

2364,reservoir water balance models are required to analyze the impact of alternative designs and operations on the performance of water infrastructure projects spanning multiple basins however the impact of such projects on instream ecology and water quality of participating basins remains relatively less explored quantitatively from a design perspective this is due to the requirement of the complex systems model to simulate processes which require additional data for parameterization while also increasing simulation time which affects the performance of optimization algorithms here we propose a conceptual framework to quantify the contribution of water from different basins to various reservoir related fluxes in a multi reservoir system these include water released for demand satisfaction maintaining minimum environmental flows and preventing dam failure for a given reservoir we quantify the time varying proportions of water supplied from other reservoirs and from the reservoir s inflows for each release we apply this framework to a proposed water transfer project in southern india that caters to the diminishing water supply of the nagarjuna sagar ns reservoir in the krishna river basin by transferring water from the godavari river basin our results show that the transferred water majorly caters to the additional demands on the ns reservoir to transfer water further south we also find that in general the transferred water has little to no contribution to satisfying environmental flows downstream of the recipient however we do note a very high up to 50 contribution of transferred water to environmental flows at the ns reservoir for a few selected realizations of inflows in the monsoon season based on prior literature these releases are concerning given the substantial differences in the ecological composition of fish species in both basins and may lead to invasive species downstream of the ns reservoir we show how the proposed framework can be used to attribute recipient reservoir releases to donor and recipient inflows and shed light on failure dynamics by identifying fluxes that contribute to failures keywords reservoirs ecological impacts system model optimization water transfers minimum environmental flow data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction large scale water infrastructure projects spanning multiple reservoirs and basins influence the socio economic conditions in many river basins across the globe biswas and tortajada 2001 nüsser 2003 wilson et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 these projects affect surrounding populations that rely on them for water supply protection from floods hydroelectricity generation as well as food production from agriculture the global increase in water stress in the recent decades along with a concurrent increase in extreme flood events has made their impact even more profound lal et al 2020 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 schlosser et al 2014 vörösmarty et al 2000 proper management of large scale water infrastructure grigg 2019 being a potential source of hydroelectricity these projects are also likely to contribute to clean energy initiatives as evident by many planned investments around the globe zarfl et al 2015 thus the attainment of sustainable development goals related to water food and energy in many parts of the world is inherently linked to the planning and management of water related infrastructure such as reservoirs and inter basin water transfers the planning and management of large scale water projects pose a significant decision analytic challenge several factors complicate the identification of suitable design and operational strategies such as the presence of multiple stakeholders with potentially conflicting preferences complex underlying systems models with feedbacks between human and natural processes and unknown future trajectories of forcing variables such as rainfall depending upon the specific project sectors may include a combination of irrigation water supply hydroelectricity navigation fisheries and ecology furthermore as these projects have a lifetime that spans several decades the data and conditions under which their designs are based may not be applicable to future operating conditions to address these challenges advancements in decision analysis methods aim to identify and evaluate alternative designs for multiple stakeholders and under a range of possible future climates herman and zeff 2014 kasprzyk et al 2013 2009 malloy et al 2017 woodruff et al 2013 projects such as inter basin water transfers are typical of large infrastructure projects that aim to satisfy the requirements of diverse sectors spread across basin boundaries rollason et al 2022 sinha et al 2020 they intend to reduce the regional difference in water availability and are anticipated to contribute nearly 25 of global water withdrawals by 2025 gohari et al 2013 gupta and van der zaag 2008 shumilova et al 2018 the main rationale behind these projects is that a basin where the water supply is surplus when compared to demands can divert water to another basin where a deficit exists in india too interbasin water transfers are being explored as possible infrastructure interventions to cater to a reducing gap between water demand and supply in many regions nwda 2021 sinha et al 2020 veena et al 2021 however they remain a topic of debate due to a few challenging issues first historically water surplus basins may face water shortages in the future due to a changing climate and thus several planned transfers may not serve their intended goal ghosh et al 2016 studies suggest that water transfers may be substituted by measures that focus on demand management or virtual water trade ghosh et al 2016 karandish et al 2021 long et al 2021 second past experiences with large reservoirs in general and inter basin water transfers in particular have revealed unforeseen water quality and ecological damages sustained by riverine ecosystems and the displacement of local populations gernaat et al 2017 shi et al 2019 tundisi 2018 thus a framework that allows an assessment of such impacts would be useful in the design stage a systems model that translates design alternatives to measurable performance goals is an integral part of decision analysis for water resources systems guo et al 2020 kasprzyk et al 2013 quinn et al 2019 trindade et al 2017 these are generally reservoir water balance models that track the storage and releases for various purposes in multi reservoir systems guo et al 2020 mahjouri and ardestani 2010 mousavi et al 2017 sadegh et al 2010 however the water quality and ecological implications of mixing waters originating from differing regions and basins are often unexplored when simple reservoir water balance models are used in multi reservoir systems especially inter basin transfers the water originates from another basin in the case of multi reservoir systems within the same major river basin water will originate from different sub basins with potentially different compositions this impacts the quality and ecological composition of water in receiving reservoirs inter basin water transfers are particular examples where the water quality of the donor basin may have a substantial difference from that of the recipient basin mahjouri and ardestani 2010 sadegh et al 2010 shourian et al 2017 explicit water quality modeling and impacts on aquatic ecology in multi reservoir systems would require considerable data support and complex systems models hu et al 2014 park et al 2014 quan et al 2016 an increasing number of studies focus on water quality aspects of reservoir operations bekoe et al 2021 park et al 2014 wang et al 2016 woo et al 2021 xia et al 2018 zeng et al 2015 a notable example includes the analysis by park et al 2014 who employ a water quality model to evaluate the water quality of a parallel triple reservoir system through dam operation several recent analyses focus on the impact of a water transfer project on the water quality of the recipient basin woo et al 2021 zeng et al 2015 while these recent efforts provide a promising avenue for further research the increased complexity of the models employed and their data requirements may pose a challenge in the complex decision context of these projects the application of simulation optimization based approaches relies on running the systems model a large number of times kumar and reddy 2007 reddy and kumar 2006 yang et al 2019 the complex response surface mapping of objective space to decision space in water management problems precludes the ability to derive the true optima analytically multi objective optimization using evolutionary algorithms provides approximate solutions that must be further evaluated to ensure the reliability of the solutions obtained akhtar and shoemaker 2019 hadka and reed 2015 salazar et al 2017 trindade et al 2020 veena et al 2021 furthermore long term planning of water resources considering climate and socio economic changes requires performance analysis of potential designs under a large number of deeply uncertain futures bartholomew and kwakkel 2020 hadka et al 2015 kasprzyk et al 2013 li and kinzelbach 2020 trindade et al 2017 in hydrology source tracking is a well established science that attempts to attribute water in a river into its various sources direct precipitation groundwater etc this partitioning can be done experimentally or via analytical techniques such as travel time distribution models daniel et al 2000 jing et al 2021 such techniques are helpful in the separation of baseflow and in quantifying the time spent by water in the soil matrix which ultimately impacts its quality engdahl et al 2013 there is a potential for a conceptually similar approach in multi reservoir systems that tracks the origin of water under suitable assumptions of mixing a large reservoir possibly receives water from various basins or sub basins and then releases it to canals for demand satisfaction or downstream to maintain minimum environmental flow mef in this study we develop a conceptual framework to attribute the water released for various purposes in a multi reservoir system to its various sources in the proposed framework we devise a way to track the source of water using the concept of virtual storages in addition to the water balance model we propose a conceptual model that partitions each reservoir release into its source components we apply the proposed framework to analyze the water quality implications of an inter basin water transfer project that aims to divert water from the godavari river basin to the krishna river basin two of the largest basins in southern india although water is mainly transferred from other regions with the intention of satisfying demands once it is stored in a reservoir it may also be released downstream as minimum environmental flows it would be essential to learn how much and how often water from another basin is being released directly into the recipient river system downstream these proportions will be governed by the temporal dynamics of inflows and demands in the participating basins and require a systematic approach for quantification which we develop here the main contributions of our study are to develop a source tracking framework that quantifies the composition of reservoir releases in multi reservoir systems to apply the framework to an inter basin water transfer project and estimate the proportion of recipient reservoir releases for demands and minimum environmental flows satisfied using water from the donor basin to analyze the impact of different climatic conditions especially extremely low flow conditions on the proportions identified in 2 and to understand intra annual variations of these proportions 2 the inchampalli nagarjuna sagar ins water transfer project the ins water transfer is a proposed project aiming to divert around 16 426 mm3 of water annually from the godavari basin to the krishna basin in southern india fig 1 nwda 2021 veena et al 2021 the region is monsoon dominated with the water year beginning on june 1 at the onset of monsoon the recipient nagarjuna sagar ns reservoir is the largest in the krishna basin and caters to a large populace predominantly farmers it also supplies water to the hyderabad metropolitan region which is india s major pharmaceutical and software hub according to the 2011 census nearly 20 million people are affected by the ns reservoir the ns reservoir has been facing increasing water shortages due to upstream developments increasing water demands and record droughts increasing the need for additional measures to cater to the basin s growing needs kumar et al 2021 the ins project is a typical example of a high supply low demand donor basin and low supply high demand recipient basin veena et al 2021 apart from transferring water to the ns reservoir the donor reservoir in the godavari basin is also committed to transferring 4370 mm3 of water annually to the pulichintala reservoir further east the ns reservoir is committed to transferring 14 200 mm3 of water annually to the somasila reservoir further south nwda 2021 in addition to specifying the annual transfer volumes the nwda 2021 also provides the intra annual distributions of the transfers 2 1 data sources we obtained the inflow data for the perur gage for the period 1967 to 2012 the site where the donor reservoir with a live storage capacity of 4285 mm3 is proposed to be constructed across the river godavari the data is downloaded from the india wris portal https indiawris gov in wris and is originally collected by the central water commission for the recipient ns reservoir with a live storage capacity of 5733 mm3 we obtained the inflows for the period 1967 to 2016 from the irrigation and command area development cad department telangana india we calculate the irrigation demands for both basins at a monthly resolution by assuming an annually fixed cropping pattern and estimating the net requirements for each crop prasad et al 2006 veena et al 2021 domestic demands were calculated using population data and per capita demand estimates nwda 2020 we assume the industrial demands to be equal to domestic demands due to inadequate information on industrial water use following veena et al 2021 the minimum environmental flow mef requirements downstream of both reservoirs are set as 30 of the mean daily inflows to the reservoir as per the recommendations by smakhtin 2008 a threshold for high flow exceedances downstream is set by analyzing historical records and identifying the maximum downstream releases from the recipient reservoir at the daily time step in the donor reservoir where no reservoir presently exists this threshold is set to the maximum daily inflows across the entire available record 3 methodology the flow of analysis indicating the inputs and outputs at various stages is indicated in fig 2 we first set up a standard water balance model for the ins project which is used to identify suitable water transfer alternatives using stochastic multi objective optimization section 3 1 once the water transfer alternatives have been identified we apply the source tracking approach to apportion each reservoir release in the recipient reservoir to its source section 3 2 3 1 the systems model and identification of operational strategies for the ins project 3 1 1 systems model a

prior committed transfers for other reservoirs superscript d refers to the donor basin superscript r refers to the recipient basin and subscript t denotes the model time step we simulate the water balance at a 15 day time step over a 15 year planning horizon the planning horizon is a typical time period within which reservoir operators are likely to use an optimized policy before considering updates based on new hydro climatic and socio economic conditions the prior committed transfer requirements pr req are obtained using intra annual distributions provided by nwda 2021 the minimum environmental flow requirements mefr req are aggregated from daily time series obtained by using the 30 criterion described before demand dr req values are available at monthly resolution and divided equally to obtain 15 day resolution time series er are released whenever reservoir storage exceeds 95 of live storage capacity the historical inflows at both donor and recipient sites are subject to uncertainty due to the underlying complex hydrological processes and vagaries of the indian summer monsoon therefore instead of using a single observed inflow time series for optimization we generated 10 000 possible inflow q time series for each site to represent the variability in observational records this is important to capture extreme hydroclimatic conditions such as droughts george et al 2009 venot et al 2010 and floods garg and mishra 2019 prasad et al 2012 we use the synthetic streamflow generation method proposed by kirsch et al 2013 which is also employed by other recent studies herman et al 2016 veena et al 2021 the method generates multiple inflow realizations for a period of 15 years by preserving autocorrelation and multi site correlation as quantified from 45 years of observed data at donor and recipient sites between 1967 and 2012 veena et al 2021 for more details on streamflow generation refer to veena et al 2021 3 1 2 objective functions and decision variables in order to identify suitable water transfer alternatives we evaluate various aspects of the performance of the ins project the primary goal of this project is to satisfy demands in the recipient ns reservoir therefore we include three demand related objective functions that aggregate temporally varying demand satisfaction states the reliability resilience and vulnerability of demand satisfaction hashimoto et al 1982 they represent the frequency of successful demand satisfaction states average recovery time from deficit states and magnitude of deficits respectively we also consider two additional objectives for the project that may affect the two basins these are related to maintaining minimum environmental flow mef and preventing high flow thresholds downstream of both reservoirs finally as both reservoirs are committed to transferring water to other reservoirs not explicitly considered in our systems model we include a constraint on satisfying these additional demands considering the critical role mef plays in instream ecology we also constrain its lower bounds during the optimization thus a total of five objective functions and two constraints are considered in the multi objective formulation these follow the optimization setup of veena et al 2021 to enable a comparison of results at a later stage the definition and aggregation of objectives across the stochastically varying inflows are detailed in table 1 the decision variables for the ins project are the monthly transfer volumes of water here assumed to remain the same every year eq 3 3 d v dv 1 dv 2 dv 11 dv 12 in eq 3 d v represents the decision vector comprising 12 monthly transfer decisions from june to may the upper limit of these transfers is determined by the capacity of the water transfer canal 2800 mm3 nwda 2020 3 1 3 multi objective optimization to identify water transfer strategies the pareto approximate water transfer strategies are obtained by stochastic multi objective optimization considering five objectives and two inequality constraints given by eq 4 4 f x f rel d f rel r 2 f res d f res r 2 f vul d f vul r 2 f hf d f hf r 2 f ef d f ef r 2 s u b j e c t t o f pr

optimization experiment is evaluated as the mean performance across the donor and recipient basin to mimic the regional authorities social planner perspective the borg moea a multi objective evolutionary algorithm is used to identify pareto approximate strategies through stochastic multi objective optimization hadka and reed 2013 it is proven efficient and robust compared to other moeas for water resource system problems gupta et al 2020 li and kinzelbach 2020 salazar et al 2016 singh et al 2015 veena et al 2021 in order to reduce the computational demands without compromising the accurate representation of stochastic uncertainties we randomly sample 100 inflow realizations from a larger set of 10 000 inflows for each function call of the borg moea we aggregate the objective function values evaluated for the 100 inflow samples by calculating their mean to represent a risk neutral scenario which is commonly used in earlier studies quinn et al 2017 shapiro et al 2013 veena et al 2021 the solutions obtained from stochastic optimization are re evaluated with the larger set of 100 000 stochastic inflow samples generated independently of the optimization set using the methodology described in section 3 1 1 the convergence of the optimization algorithm is tested by performing a seed analysis these solutions are then used to simulate the various fluxes using the source tracking framework 3 2 the source tracking model the source tracking model is a conceptual model that identifies the relative contribution of water from the donor reservoir to various releases from the recipient ns reservoir it partitions the recipient storage into two virtual storages the virtual transferred storage vts and the virtual recipient storage vrs vts tracks the water transferred from the donor reservoir to the recipient reservoir while vrs tracks the water stored in the recipient reservoir originating from its own inflows both vts and vrs are updated using water balance equations we term these storages as virtual because they do not exist in reality as the water from the donor reservoir is completely mixed in the recipient reservoir however we show that by using the concept of virtual storages new insights can be gained about the impact of the water transfer on the water composition of various releases from the recipient basin water is released from the recipient reservoir downstream into the river channel as minimum environmental flow or excess releases or into canals for demand satisfaction in the command area or transferred further on as prior committed transfers to identify the proportion of releases arising from vts and vrs we make the following assumptions for releases related to minimum environmental flow downstream and demand satisfaction in the command area of the recipient reservoir we first deplete the storage comprising of its own inflows vrs if a deficit still exists additional water is released from the donor s contribution vts this assumption is based on the rationale that to satisfy the recipient s demands and minimum environmental flow requirements first water should be used from its own supply of inflows the prior committed transfer to the somasila reservoir from the recipient ns reservoir is assumed to be first contributed by vts and any remaining demands are supplied by vrs this is based on the rationale that one of the intended goals of the ins project was to allow such benefits to regions further south of the ns reservoir nwda 2021 the deficits that exist after exhausting both vts and vrs are evaluated with these assumptions eqs 5 19 represent the updated systems model and fig 3 shows the procedure we apply this model to water transfer strategies obtained from multi objective optimization the proportions

the following assumptions 1 the storages vts and vrs are termed virtual as they do not exist in reality practically the water from the donor reservoir is completely mixed with that of the recipient reservoir these virtual partitions are assumed to allow estimation of relative contribution of donor and recicipient waters to various fluxes from the recipient reservoir 2 the model assumes that the inflow to vts is the water transferred from the donor to the recipient reservoir whereas the inflows to the recipient reservoir are added to vrs thus vts is the ibwt water while vrs is recipient reservoir s inflows 3 while releasing water for minimum environmental flows and demand satisfaction from the recipient reservoir water first depletes vrs if a deficit still exists additional water is released from vts this assumption is based on the rationale that to satisfy the recipient s demands and minimum environmental flow requirements first water should be used from its own supply of inflows 4 for prior committed transfer to other reservoirs from the recipient reservoir contributions are first deducted from vts and any remaining demands are supplied by vrs this is based on the rationale that one of the intended goals of the ins project was to allow such benefits to regions further south of the ns reservoir 4 results 4 1 stochastic multi objective optimization we identified 27 pareto approximate water transfer strategies using stochastic multi objective optimization these strategies were obtained by performing the optimization 10 times using a different random seed to initialize the borg moea each time and considering 10 000 inflow time series to represent stochasticity the resulting solutions were re sorted and re evaluated against the larger set of 100 000 inflow time series to obtain the pareto approximate strategies fig s1 the objective function values across all strategies range from 90 to 92 for the reliability of demand satisfaction 37 60 days for the resilience of demand satisfaction and 213 401 mm3 for the mean deficits in demand satisfaction the reliability of avoiding high flow exceedances was constant across strategies at 97 similarly the reliability of satisfying minimum environmental flow was similar across strategies with a value of 97 we visualize the trade offs between the demand related objectives in fig 4 a as there are minimal variations in the other two objectives a range of possible compromises between the three demand related objectives is evident for example the solution attaining the highest performance in mean deficits 213 mm3 results in the reliability of demand satisfaction of 90 and resilience of demand satisfaction of 60 days similarly the solution attaining the highest performance in the reliability of demand satisfaction 92 results in mean deficits of 320 mm3 and resilience of demand satisfaction of 40 days thus significant tradeoffs exist between the three demand related objectives to understand the likely impact of water transfers on various releases from the ns reservoir using the source tracking systems model we first apply the model to a selected compromise strategy we then summarize the results across all strategies the compromise strategy chosen for further analysis attains a reliability of demand satisfaction of 91 resilience of demand satisfaction of 44 days and mean annual deficits of 253 mm3 highlighted in fig 4 4 2 application of the source tracking model the source tracking model conceptually separates the contribution from ns reservoir inflows vrs and inter basin water transfer from the godavari river basin ibwt water or vts to each release of the reservoir here we analyze the contributions from vts to various releases of the ns reservoir and the storage in vts at each fortnightly time step across 15 simulation years for the compromise strategy fig 5 these contributions are evaluated for each of the 100 000 inflow realizations the median as well as the 99 5th percentile values across all realizations are shown it is evident that the median contribution from ibwt water is highest for prior committed transfers pr with values reaching up to 100 during the months of august october on the other hand the outside basin contributions are absent for demand releases dr and environmental flow releases mefr when considering median values however the 99 5th percentile values of the contributions from mefr may reach up to 50 depending upon the specific inflow realization fig 5a these contributions occur during the monsoon season when mef requirements are higher than usual overall we find a strong seasonal imprint on the vts contributions to various releases and considerable inter annual variability of the contributions we now focus on the contributions from vts to mefr as these are directly related to the water quality and ecological effects of the project as contributions from vts show a strong seasonal and inter annual variability we assess how various inflow conditions affect the vts contributions fig 6 to evaluate the impact of seasonality on the contributions we group the monsoon months from june to september as monsoon and the non monsoon months from october to may in the non monsoon category rao 1979 the value of inflow percentiles across all the monsoonal and non monsoonal time steps for 100 000 realizations are calculated fig 6c f we visualize the relative contribution of vts to mefr during non monsoon and monsoon seasons as a function of inflow percentiles fig 6a d for each inflow percentile a range of vts contributions are obtained across time steps in the planning horizon and 100 000 realizations the summary statistics of these contribution values is assessed against each flow percentile the median value of the contribution is nearly zero across all inflow percentiles for both monsoon and non monsoon seasons indicating that in typical flow conditions ibwt water does not contribute to mefr however the 99 5th percentile values of the contributions from ibwt water to mefr are substantial in the monsoon season 0 60 while they range between 0 and 4 in the non monsoon season fig 6a d in the monsoon season the 99 5th percentile vts contribution to mefr increases as inflow reduces the frequency of timesteps contributing to mefr from vts increases with increasing inflows till the 3rd percentile inflow value and reduces below that this indicates that though the frequency of non zero occurrence of vts contribution to mefr is low till the 3rd percentile the aggregated contribution in percentage is high in non monsoon months the 99 5th percentile contribution of vts to mefr peaks in low flow periods reaches 0 for the 3rd 75th inflow percentile and then peaks at around 85th percentile a similar trend is seen in the case of the frequency of time steps contributing to mefr from vts thus the water quality effects of transfers will be more evident during the monsoon season when the environmental flow requirements are higher overall high mefr contributions from ibwt water occur during monsoon season when flow values are low across the 100 000 inflow stochastic realizations the high demands on the ns reservoir in conjunction with reduced inflows during part of the monsoon season resulted in high contribution from ibwt water to mefr in some instances the contribution of ibwt water to irrigation and water supply related releases dr and committed transfers to other reservoirs pr during monsoon and non monsoon seasons against inflow percentile values is similarly shown in supplementary figs s2 s4 similar to the case of mefr the median of contributions from vts to dr is zero across all inflow conditions for both monsoon and non monsoon seasons as inflow decreases the 99 5th percentile contribution from vts to dr increases in both monsoon and non monsoon seasons there is a substantial difference in the patterns of vts contributions to pr when compared to mefr and dr the 99 5th percentile contribution from vts to pr is 100 for all inflow conditions in both monsoon and non monsoon seasons the 99 5th percentile value of the contribution of vts to pr is 100 during monsoon season across most inflows except for inflows lower than the 7th percentile and inflows greater than the 69th percentile whereas in the monsoon season the median value of these contributions reaches 100 only when the 34th inflow percentile is exceeded overall our results indicate a much higher contribution of ibwt water to pr and negligible contribution to dr and mefr in normal median conditions of inflows however when inflows are lower than usual there is a chance of very high contributions from vts to dr and mefr indicating that in a long planning horizon there are likely to be instances when ibwt water is released through the ns reservoir for all purposes we now analyze the volumetric ns reservoir related fluxes at aggregated annual and seasonal time scales fig 7 the figure visualizes each hydrologic flux related to the ns reservoir including vrs vts mefr pr dr er and the water transfer ins transfer the average annual monsoonal and non monsoonal values of these fluxes across all realizations are shown in fig 7a c in order to understand the impact of water transfers during extremely low flow conditions the fluxes are shown for low flow scenarios separately fig 7d f across the 100 000 inflow realizations the flow value at a given time step is classified as low flow when it falls below the 30th percentile of all the values at that time step in the case of monsoon june sept months for non monsoon oct may months the 10th percentile is used as a threshold these thresholds are guided by analyzing the vts contributions across all time steps and 100 000 realizations to identify critical flow values below which significant vts contributions occur fig 6 three main insights are revealed by visualizing the average annual contribution of vts and vrs to each release across the 100 000 realizations and 15 simulation years fig 7a d first during low flow conditions around 14 of mefr green bars are provided by the transferred water vts annually grey shades connecting orange bar to green bars fig 7d however the vts contribution to mefr is only 1 when all flow conditions are considered grey shades connecting orange bar to green bar fig 7a we thus observe that below certain critical flow thresholds ibwt s contributions to mefr become considerable and are likely to impact downstream waters secondly annually 65 of the water earmarked as pr for the somasila project from the ns reservoir purple bars is being met from vts the waters of the donor godavari river basin grey shades connecting orange to purple bars fig 7a during low flow conditions only 29 of the water committed for the somasila project is satisfied by the donor s water while the rest of the requirements go unsatisfied with no contributions from the recipient ns reservoir purple bar fig 7d third the average annual contribution of transferred water to satisfy the recipient ns s own water demands dr is 8 grey shades connecting orange bar to military green bar fig 7a under low flow conditions the percentage contribution from transferred water to ns s own demands rises to 54 grey shades connecting orange bar to military green bar fig 7a thus the ns reservoir depends on the donor s water much more during low flow conditions we now discuss the aggregate monsoonal and non monsoonal contributions at seasonal scales to better understand the difference in dynamics of releases between these two periods fig 7b c e f the contribution to mefr at annual monsoon and non monsoon scales is 1 1 and 0 respectively under all flow conditions however when low flow conditions prevail the contribution from vts to mefr is significant only at annual 14 and monsoon 23 scales low flow conditions in non monsoon months do not result in substantial vts contributions due to lower environmental flow requirements in these months we also find that the contribution from vts to pr is 89 and 43 for the monsoon and non monsoon periods respectively during low flow conditions these contributions reduce to 49 and 5 for monsoon and non monsoon periods respectively across all time steps ibwt s contribution to the ns reservoir s water demands satisfaction is 3 and 12 in monsoon and non monsoon periods respectively during low flow conditions these contributions increase to 63 and 42 in monsoon and non monsoon periods respectively thus ns s increased dependence on transferred water is also observed in extremely low flow conditions to test the generalizability of the results discussed above we further quantify the range of vts contribution across 100 000 realizations at each time step evaluated for all the 27 strategies obtained through optimization fig s5 table s1 overall we do not find any major variations in our results as transfer strategies are altered the contribution of ibwt water to various releases shows minimal variations across the strategies at annual time scales for example across all strategies 6 8 of water to satisfy ns s annual water demands is contributed by water transferred from outside the basin table s1 variation across strategies is slightly greater at the monsoon or non monsoon time scales anywhere between 8 and 13 of water for demand satisfaction is contributed by water transfers during the non monsoon season the highest variation across strategies is observed for low flow conditions when contributions can vary significantly for example in the low flow periods during monsoon the aggregated vts contributions to mefr can vary from 18 to 49 thus the choice of the water transfer strategy has considerable water quality implications under extreme low flow conditions but in average flow conditions the differences are negligible 5 discussion and recommendations studies on inter basin water transfers mainly focus on alleviating the water scarcity in the recipient basin several studies explore other ecological and economic aspects of the water transfer schemes such as the impact of water transfer on the downstream ecosystem and tourism in the recipient akron et al 2017 davies et al 1992 grant et al 2012 karamouz et al 2010 zhuang 2016 in such studies where water transfer projects are proposed to meet multiple goals the source tracking systems model may help to reveal how the transferred water is being utilized across different fluxes from the recipient reservoir the multi basin multi sectoral conflicts are likely to become quite complex under deeply uncertain climate and socio economic changes posing a huge decision analytic challenge bartholomew and kwakkel 2020 gosain et al 2011 herman and zeff 2014 madhusoodhanan et al 2016 our framework allows diagnosis of the water fluxes in multi reservoir systems to ascertain whether they are meeting the intended benefits this information may help water managers to modify operations and or designs for example in the case of the ins project alternatives such as local demand mitigation and virtual water transfers may be considered to reduce the requirements from the ns reservoir to somasilla gao et al 2020 karandish et al 2021 these insights into the flow of water for various purposes and the contribution of various sources to each reservoir release cannot possibly be derived from a simple water balance model due to the time varying nature of the inflows and transfers it is not possible to segregate such effects additionally the source tracking model may also be used to modify the problem formulation of a multi objective optimization problem to include an objective function that minimizes the contribution of the donor s water to releases in the recipient reservoir the source attribution framework proposed here can be used to provide indirect information that can assist in evaluating the extent of impacts on water quality and ecology for example by analyzing the time varying contributions from within basin and outside basin waters to reservoir releases for environmental flows a decision maker may speculate on the seasonal variation in the water quality of downstream river flow nonetheless explicit modeling of ecology or water quality would be a more desirable alternative however the setting up and validation of such models is often challenging due to the unavailability of relevant data also the requisite expertise to apply or interpret the outcomes of such complex models may not be available to planners everywhere in such instances the source attribution framework can be used to provide a quick and approximate understanding of ibwt s impacts which may help guide stakeholder consultations studies have shown that fish species in the krishna basin the recipient basin in ins transfer are already endangered by invasive species of the godavari basin the donor basin in ins transfer due to downstream transfers between the two rivers babu et al 2016 seshagiri et al 2021 these adverse effects on the recipient s ecosystem indicate a need for interventions to avoid the release of the donor s water downstream in the recipient basin our framework helps in revealing underlying failure dynamics thereby we recommend interventions for better management of water transfer fig s6 here we classify the recommendations into structural demand related and policy interventions as below a structural interventions 1 provide separate reservoir storages for the transferred water at the recipient site this reduces the chance of invasive species from godavari waters entering the krishna basin this is a large structural intervention that will incur economic costs and planning to identify another reservoir site however these costs have to be weighed against a potential loss of native fishes from the krishna river 2 structural interventions to avoid entry of invasive species to ns waters arrangements can be made to prevent the fish transfer from the donor to the recipient reservoir for example provision of meshes or other infrastructure arrangements wherever possible b demand related interventions 1 demand management in recipient basin cropping patterns of the ns command area may be revised to better adjust to its own available water this may be coupled with an improvement in irrigation water management to reduce water loss 2 water managers are recommended to revisit the demands from the somasila project and reduce the amount of water being transferred studies show that introducing artificial groundwater recharge and conjunctive use successfully reduces the deficits to a great extent molakala et al 2022 such policy interventions in the somasila reservoir can reduce stress on the nagarjuna sagar reservoir c policy interventions 1 re envisaged water use in water scarce regions water is a resource that can be used for many economic activities agriculture being one by designing policies that train the populace in water scarce regions towards equally beneficial but lower water use activities reliance on water transfers may be reduced 2 connect the canals of inchampalli and somasila directly to avoid negative consequences on the ns downstream ecology this recommendation arises from the observation that a considerable portion of water transfer is used to satisfy the requirements of somasilla therefore it makes practical sense to check whether a canal directly connecting the godavari to somasilla may be feasible this avoids the mixing of godavari s and krishna s water and propagation of species upstream of the recipient reservoir 3 decentralizing water storage and distribution network by providing small scale infrastructures it may be beneficial to rethink the design of the ins project instead of transferring water first to the ns reservoir and then releasing it for demand satisfaction water may be directly delivered to the agricultural sites using secondary water storage such as tank systems tank systems predate modern water infrastructure and have enabled water management in southern india for centuries anuradha et al 2021 shah and sakthivadivel 2019 venkatachalam and balooni 2018 these may be directly connected with the donor to avoid mixing external water into the ns reservoir 6 conclusions this study proposed a systems model to track the contribution of outside basin water to reservoir releases in a multi reservoir project the proposed model was used to analyze the consequences of several alternative water transfer strategies on reservoir releases for the ins project this proposed model can be applied to any multi reservoir system where multiple water sources exist source attribution is particularly very useful in inter basin water transfer to understand how the water from two basins is collectively used to meet the demands and mitigate the water stress and comprehend the implications on the ecology and water quality of the recipient water the results revealed interesting insights that the water transferred through the ins project is being used to transfer further away from nagarjuna sagar which is a consequence of multiple interconnected water transfers our analysis highlights the need to revisit the project design and find ways to reduce the reliance on outside basin water by considering demand side alternatives such as virtual water trade irrigation water management cropping pattern alterations and economic outputs through non agricultural activities in basins reaching the limit of freshwater water use etc water quality and downstream ecology are likely to be critically affected by water transfers but require complex models to understand benedini and george 2013 our alternative framework provides a simpler approach to better understand the processes involved in inter basin water transfers it reveals complex trade offs between the water demands investment costs of interventions to avert ecological damage and ecological health of the recipient basin there is a need to better understand the level of acceptability to the donor in transferring water during water stress periods and designing incentive structures for the donor basins to help manage the water transfers better the source tracking framework can be applied to any reservoir system and operating policy given an increasing discussion on inter basin water transfers a simple framework that can be applied to any water transfer project to better understand the underlying complexities will help enable dialogue between various parties involved credit authorship contribution statement manvitha molakala methodology conceptualization formal

2364,reservoir water balance models are required to analyze the impact of alternative designs and operations on the performance of water infrastructure projects spanning multiple basins however the impact of such projects on instream ecology and water quality of participating basins remains relatively less explored quantitatively from a design perspective this is due to the requirement of the complex systems model to simulate processes which require additional data for parameterization while also increasing simulation time which affects the performance of optimization algorithms here we propose a conceptual framework to quantify the contribution of water from different basins to various reservoir related fluxes in a multi reservoir system these include water released for demand satisfaction maintaining minimum environmental flows and preventing dam failure for a given reservoir we quantify the time varying proportions of water supplied from other reservoirs and from the reservoir s inflows for each release we apply this framework to a proposed water transfer project in southern india that caters to the diminishing water supply of the nagarjuna sagar ns reservoir in the krishna river basin by transferring water from the godavari river basin our results show that the transferred water majorly caters to the additional demands on the ns reservoir to transfer water further south we also find that in general the transferred water has little to no contribution to satisfying environmental flows downstream of the recipient however we do note a very high up to 50 contribution of transferred water to environmental flows at the ns reservoir for a few selected realizations of inflows in the monsoon season based on prior literature these releases are concerning given the substantial differences in the ecological composition of fish species in both basins and may lead to invasive species downstream of the ns reservoir we show how the proposed framework can be used to attribute recipient reservoir releases to donor and recipient inflows and shed light on failure dynamics by identifying fluxes that contribute to failures keywords reservoirs ecological impacts system model optimization water transfers minimum environmental flow data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction large scale water infrastructure projects spanning multiple reservoirs and basins influence the socio economic conditions in many river basins across the globe biswas and tortajada 2001 nüsser 2003 wilson et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 these projects affect surrounding populations that rely on them for water supply protection from floods hydroelectricity generation as well as food production from agriculture the global increase in water stress in the recent decades along with a concurrent increase in extreme flood events has made their impact even more profound lal et al 2020 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 schlosser et al 2014 vörösmarty et al 2000 proper management of large scale water infrastructure grigg 2019 being a potential source of hydroelectricity these projects are also likely to contribute to clean energy initiatives as evident by many planned investments around the globe zarfl et al 2015 thus the attainment of sustainable development goals related to water food and energy in many parts of the world is inherently linked to the planning and management of water related infrastructure such as reservoirs and inter basin water transfers the planning and management of large scale water projects pose a significant decision analytic challenge several factors complicate the identification of suitable design and operational strategies such as the presence of multiple stakeholders with potentially conflicting preferences complex underlying systems models with feedbacks between human and natural processes and unknown future trajectories of forcing variables such as rainfall depending upon the specific project sectors may include a combination of irrigation water supply hydroelectricity navigation fisheries and ecology furthermore as these projects have a lifetime that spans several decades the data and conditions under which their designs are based may not be applicable to future operating conditions to address these challenges advancements in decision analysis methods aim to identify and evaluate alternative designs for multiple stakeholders and under a range of possible future climates herman and zeff 2014 kasprzyk et al 2013 2009 malloy et al 2017 woodruff et al 2013 projects such as inter basin water transfers are typical of large infrastructure projects that aim to satisfy the requirements of diverse sectors spread across basin boundaries rollason et al 2022 sinha et al 2020 they intend to reduce the regional difference in water availability and are anticipated to contribute nearly 25 of global water withdrawals by 2025 gohari et al 2013 gupta and van der zaag 2008 shumilova et al 2018 the main rationale behind these projects is that a basin where the water supply is surplus when compared to demands can divert water to another basin where a deficit exists in india too interbasin water transfers are being explored as possible infrastructure interventions to cater to a reducing gap between water demand and supply in many regions nwda 2021 sinha et al 2020 veena et al 2021 however they remain a topic of debate due to a few challenging issues first historically water surplus basins may face water shortages in the future due to a changing climate and thus several planned transfers may not serve their intended goal ghosh et al 2016 studies suggest that water transfers may be substituted by measures that focus on demand management or virtual water trade ghosh et al 2016 karandish et al 2021 long et al 2021 second past experiences with large reservoirs in general and inter basin water transfers in particular have revealed unforeseen water quality and ecological damages sustained by riverine ecosystems and the displacement of local populations gernaat et al 2017 shi et al 2019 tundisi 2018 thus a framework that allows an assessment of such impacts would be useful in the design stage a systems model that translates design alternatives to measurable performance goals is an integral part of decision analysis for water resources systems guo et al 2020 kasprzyk et al 2013 quinn et al 2019 trindade et al 2017 these are generally reservoir water balance models that track the storage and releases for various purposes in multi reservoir systems guo et al 2020 mahjouri and ardestani 2010 mousavi et al 2017 sadegh et al 2010 however the water quality and ecological implications of mixing waters originating from differing regions and basins are often unexplored when simple reservoir water balance models are used in multi reservoir systems especially inter basin transfers the water originates from another basin in the case of multi reservoir systems within the same major river basin water will originate from different sub basins with potentially different compositions this impacts the quality and ecological composition of water in receiving reservoirs inter basin water transfers are particular examples where the water quality of the donor basin may have a substantial difference from that of the recipient basin mahjouri and ardestani 2010 sadegh et al 2010 shourian et al 2017 explicit water quality modeling and impacts on aquatic ecology in multi reservoir systems would require considerable data support and complex systems models hu et al 2014 park et al 2014 quan et al 2016 an increasing number of studies focus on water quality aspects of reservoir operations bekoe et al 2021 park et al 2014 wang et al 2016 woo et al 2021 xia et al 2018 zeng et al 2015 a notable example includes the analysis by park et al 2014 who employ a water quality model to evaluate the water quality of a parallel triple reservoir system through dam operation several recent analyses focus on the impact of a water transfer project on the water quality of the recipient basin woo et al 2021 zeng et al 2015 while these recent efforts provide a promising avenue for further research the increased complexity of the models employed and their data requirements may pose a challenge in the complex decision context of these projects the application of simulation optimization based approaches relies on running the systems model a large number of times kumar and reddy 2007 reddy and kumar 2006 yang et al 2019 the complex response surface mapping of objective space to decision space in water management problems precludes the ability to derive the true optima analytically multi objective optimization using evolutionary algorithms provides approximate solutions that must be further evaluated to ensure the reliability of the solutions obtained akhtar and shoemaker 2019 hadka and reed 2015 salazar et al 2017 trindade et al 2020 veena et al 2021 furthermore long term planning of water resources considering climate and socio economic changes requires performance analysis of potential designs under a large number of deeply uncertain futures bartholomew and kwakkel 2020 hadka et al 2015 kasprzyk et al 2013 li and kinzelbach 2020 trindade et al 2017 in hydrology source tracking is a well established science that attempts to attribute water in a river into its various sources direct precipitation groundwater etc this partitioning can be done experimentally or via analytical techniques such as travel time distribution models daniel et al 2000 jing et al 2021 such techniques are helpful in the separation of baseflow and in quantifying the time spent by water in the soil matrix which ultimately impacts its quality engdahl et al 2013 there is a potential for a conceptually similar approach in multi reservoir systems that tracks the origin of water under suitable assumptions of mixing a large reservoir possibly receives water from various basins or sub basins and then releases it to canals for demand satisfaction or downstream to maintain minimum environmental flow mef in this study we develop a conceptual framework to attribute the water released for various purposes in a multi reservoir system to its various sources in the proposed framework we devise a way to track the source of water using the concept of virtual storages in addition to the water balance model we propose a conceptual model that partitions each reservoir release into its source components we apply the proposed framework to analyze the water quality implications of an inter basin water transfer project that aims to divert water from the godavari river basin to the krishna river basin two of the largest basins in southern india although water is mainly transferred from other regions with the intention of satisfying demands once it is stored in a reservoir it may also be released downstream as minimum environmental flows it would be essential to learn how much and how often water from another basin is being released directly into the recipient river system downstream these proportions will be governed by the temporal dynamics of inflows and demands in the participating basins and require a systematic approach for quantification which we develop here the main contributions of our study are to develop a source tracking framework that quantifies the composition of reservoir releases in multi reservoir systems to apply the framework to an inter basin water transfer project and estimate the proportion of recipient reservoir releases for demands and minimum environmental flows satisfied using water from the donor basin to analyze the impact of different climatic conditions especially extremely low flow conditions on the proportions identified in 2 and to understand intra annual variations of these proportions 2 the inchampalli nagarjuna sagar ins water transfer project the ins water transfer is a proposed project aiming to divert around 16 426 mm3 of water annually from the godavari basin to the krishna basin in southern india fig 1 nwda 2021 veena et al 2021 the region is monsoon dominated with the water year beginning on june 1 at the onset of monsoon the recipient nagarjuna sagar ns reservoir is the largest in the krishna basin and caters to a large populace predominantly farmers it also supplies water to the hyderabad metropolitan region which is india s major pharmaceutical and software hub according to the 2011 census nearly 20 million people are affected by the ns reservoir the ns reservoir has been facing increasing water shortages due to upstream developments increasing water demands and record droughts increasing the need for additional measures to cater to the basin s growing needs kumar et al 2021 the ins project is a typical example of a high supply low demand donor basin and low supply high demand recipient basin veena et al 2021 apart from transferring water to the ns reservoir the donor reservoir in the godavari basin is also committed to transferring 4370 mm3 of water annually to the pulichintala reservoir further east the ns reservoir is committed to transferring 14 200 mm3 of water annually to the somasila reservoir further south nwda 2021 in addition to specifying the annual transfer volumes the nwda 2021 also provides the intra annual distributions of the transfers 2 1 data sources we obtained the inflow data for the perur gage for the period 1967 to 2012 the site where the donor reservoir with a live storage capacity of 4285 mm3 is proposed to be constructed across the river godavari the data is downloaded from the india wris portal https indiawris gov in wris and is originally collected by the central water commission for the recipient ns reservoir with a live storage capacity of 5733 mm3 we obtained the inflows for the period 1967 to 2016 from the irrigation and command area development cad department telangana india we calculate the irrigation demands for both basins at a monthly resolution by assuming an annually fixed cropping pattern and estimating the net requirements for each crop prasad et al 2006 veena et al 2021 domestic demands were calculated using population data and per capita demand estimates nwda 2020 we assume the industrial demands to be equal to domestic demands due to inadequate information on industrial water use following veena et al 2021 the minimum environmental flow mef requirements downstream of both reservoirs are set as 30 of the mean daily inflows to the reservoir as per the recommendations by smakhtin 2008 a threshold for high flow exceedances downstream is set by analyzing historical records and identifying the maximum downstream releases from the recipient reservoir at the daily time step in the donor reservoir where no reservoir presently exists this threshold is set to the maximum daily inflows across the entire available record 3 methodology the flow of analysis indicating the inputs and outputs at various stages is indicated in fig 2 we first set up a standard water balance model for the ins project which is used to identify suitable water transfer alternatives using stochastic multi objective optimization section 3 1 once the water transfer alternatives have been identified we apply the source tracking approach to apportion each reservoir release in the recipient reservoir to its source section 3 2 3 1 the systems model and identification of operational strategies for the ins project 3 1 1 systems model a standard water balance model updates the storage of the donor and recipient reservoirs which are connected through a water transfer flux veena et al 2021 eqs 1 2 1 s t d s t 1 d q t d mefr t d pr t d tr t dr t d er t d 2 s t r s t 1 r q t r mefr t r pr t r tr t dr t r er t r in eqs 1 and 2 s is the volume of reservoir storage q is the reservoir inflow mefr is the minimum environmental flow

prior committed transfers for other reservoirs superscript d refers to the donor basin superscript r refers to the recipient basin and subscript t denotes the model time step we simulate the water balance at a 15 day time step over a 15 year planning horizon the planning horizon is a typical time period within which reservoir operators are likely to use an optimized policy before considering updates based on new hydro climatic and socio economic conditions the prior committed transfer requirements pr req are obtained using intra annual distributions provided by nwda 2021 the minimum environmental flow requirements mefr req are aggregated from daily time series obtained by using the 30 criterion described before demand dr req values are available at monthly resolution and divided equally to obtain 15 day resolution time series er are released whenever reservoir storage exceeds 95 of live storage capacity the historical inflows at both donor and recipient sites are subject to uncertainty due to the underlying complex hydrological processes and vagaries of the indian summer monsoon therefore instead of using a single observed inflow time series for optimization we generated 10 000 possible inflow q time series for each site to represent the variability in observational records this is important to capture extreme hydroclimatic conditions such as droughts george et al 2009 venot et al 2010 and floods garg and mishra 2019 prasad et al 2012 we use the synthetic streamflow generation method proposed by kirsch et al 2013 which is also employed by other recent studies herman et al 2016 veena et al 2021 the method generates multiple inflow realizations for a period of 15 years by preserving autocorrelation and multi site correlation as quantified from 45 years of observed data at donor and recipient sites between 1967 and 2012 veena et al 2021 for more details on streamflow generation refer to veena et al 2021 3 1 2 objective functions and decision variables in order to identify suitable water transfer alternatives we evaluate various aspects of the performance of the ins project the primary goal of this project is to satisfy demands in the recipient ns reservoir therefore we include three demand related objective functions that aggregate temporally varying demand satisfaction states the reliability resilience and vulnerability of demand satisfaction hashimoto et al 1982 they represent the frequency of successful demand satisfaction states average recovery time from deficit states and magnitude of deficits respectively we also consider two additional objectives for the project that may affect the two basins these are related to maintaining minimum environmental flow mef and preventing high flow thresholds downstream of both reservoirs finally as both reservoirs are committed to transferring water to other reservoirs not explicitly considered in our systems model we include a constraint on satisfying these additional demands considering the critical role mef plays in instream ecology we also constrain its lower bounds during the optimization thus a total of five objective functions and two constraints are considered in the multi objective formulation these follow the optimization setup of veena et al 2021 to enable a comparison of results at a later stage the definition and aggregation of objectives across the stochastically varying inflows are detailed in table 1 the decision variables for the ins project are the monthly transfer volumes of water here assumed to remain the same every year eq 3 3 d v dv 1 dv 2 dv 11 dv 12 in eq 3 d v represents the decision vector comprising 12 monthly transfer decisions from june to may the upper limit of these transfers is determined by the capacity of the water transfer canal 2800 mm3 nwda 2020 3 1 3 multi objective optimization to identify water transfer strategies the pareto approximate water transfer strategies are obtained by stochastic multi objective optimization considering five objectives and two inequality constraints given by eq 4 4 f x f rel d f rel r 2 f res d f res r 2 f vul d f vul r 2 f hf d f hf r 2 f ef d f ef r 2 s u b j e c t t o f pr 80 f er 80 in eq 4 f is the objective function vector and superscripts represent the values of the donor d and recipient r reservoirs for each objective in table 1 each objective function in the optimization experiment is evaluated as the mean performance across the donor and recipient basin to mimic the regional authorities social planner perspective the borg moea a multi objective evolutionary algorithm is used to identify pareto approximate strategies through stochastic multi objective optimization hadka and reed 2013 it is proven efficient and robust compared to other moeas for water resource system problems gupta et al 2020 li and kinzelbach 2020 salazar et al 2016 singh et al 2015 veena et al 2021 in order to reduce the computational demands without compromising the accurate representation of stochastic uncertainties we randomly sample 100 inflow realizations from a larger set of 10 000 inflows for each function call of the borg moea we aggregate the objective function values evaluated for the 100 inflow samples by calculating their mean to represent a risk neutral scenario which is commonly used in earlier studies quinn et al 2017 shapiro et al 2013 veena et al 2021 the solutions obtained from stochastic optimization are re evaluated with the larger set of 100 000 stochastic inflow samples generated independently of the optimization set using the methodology described in section 3 1 1 the convergence of the optimization algorithm is tested by performing a seed analysis these solutions are then used to simulate the various fluxes using the source tracking framework 3 2 the source tracking model the source tracking model is a conceptual model that identifies the relative contribution of water from the donor reservoir to various releases from the recipient ns reservoir it partitions the recipient storage into two virtual storages the virtual transferred storage vts and the virtual recipient storage vrs vts tracks the water transferred from the donor reservoir to the recipient reservoir while vrs tracks the water stored in the recipient reservoir originating from its own inflows both vts and vrs are updated using water balance equations we term these storages as virtual because they do not exist in reality as the water from the donor reservoir is completely mixed in the recipient reservoir however we show that by using the concept of virtual storages new insights can be gained about the impact of the water transfer on the water composition of various releases from the recipient basin water is released from the recipient reservoir downstream into the river channel as minimum environmental flow or excess releases or into canals for demand satisfaction in the command area or transferred further on as prior committed transfers to identify the proportion of releases arising from vts and vrs we make the following assumptions for releases related to minimum environmental flow downstream and demand satisfaction in the command area of the recipient reservoir we first deplete the storage comprising of its own inflows vrs if a deficit still exists additional water is released from the donor s contribution vts this assumption is based on the rationale that to satisfy the recipient s demands and minimum environmental flow requirements first water should be used from its own supply of inflows the prior committed transfer to the somasila reservoir from the recipient ns reservoir is assumed to be first contributed by vts and any remaining demands are supplied by vrs this is based on the rationale that one of the intended goals of the ins project was to allow such benefits to regions further south of the ns reservoir nwda 2021 the deficits that exist after exhausting both vts and vrs are evaluated with these assumptions eqs 5 19 represent the updated systems model and fig 3 shows the procedure we apply this model to water transfer strategies obtained from multi objective optimization the proportions

reservoirs from the vrs pr t vrs and vts pr t vts are calculated using eqs 7 and 8 these transfers from the ns reservoir are first satisfied by the vts and the remaining requirement is supplied by the

recipient reservoir finally the storage in vrs and vts are updated using eqs 13 and 14 the virtual storages and releases of the recipient reservoir are related to the actual storage and releases in eq

the following assumptions 1 the storages vts and vrs are termed virtual as they do not exist in reality practically the water from the donor reservoir is completely mixed with that of the recipient reservoir these virtual partitions are assumed to allow estimation of relative contribution of donor and recicipient waters to various fluxes from the recipient reservoir 2 the model assumes that the inflow to vts is the water transferred from the donor to the recipient reservoir whereas the inflows to the recipient reservoir are added to vrs thus vts is the ibwt water while vrs is recipient reservoir s inflows 3 while releasing water for minimum environmental flows and demand satisfaction from the recipient reservoir water first depletes vrs if a deficit still exists additional water is released from vts this assumption is based on the rationale that to satisfy the recipient s demands and minimum environmental flow requirements first water should be used from its own supply of inflows 4 for prior committed transfer to other reservoirs from the recipient reservoir contributions are first deducted from vts and any remaining demands are supplied by vrs this is based on the rationale that one of the intended goals of the ins project was to allow such benefits to regions further south of the ns reservoir 4 results 4 1 stochastic multi objective optimization we identified 27 pareto approximate water transfer strategies using stochastic multi objective optimization these strategies were obtained by performing the optimization 10 times using a different random seed to initialize the borg moea each time and considering 10 000 inflow time series to represent stochasticity the resulting solutions were re sorted and re evaluated against the larger set of 100 000 inflow time series to obtain the pareto approximate strategies fig s1 the objective function values across all strategies range from 90 to 92 for the reliability of demand satisfaction 37 60 days for the resilience of demand satisfaction and 213 401 mm3 for the mean deficits in demand satisfaction the reliability of avoiding high flow exceedances was constant across strategies at 97 similarly the reliability of satisfying minimum environmental flow was similar across strategies with a value of 97 we visualize the trade offs between the demand related objectives in fig 4 a as there are minimal variations in the other two objectives a range of possible compromises between the three demand related objectives is evident for example the solution attaining the highest performance in mean deficits 213 mm3 results in the reliability of demand satisfaction of 90 and resilience of demand satisfaction of 60 days similarly the solution attaining the highest performance in the reliability of demand satisfaction 92 results in mean deficits of 320 mm3 and resilience of demand satisfaction of 40 days thus significant tradeoffs exist between the three demand related objectives to understand the likely impact of water transfers on various releases from the ns reservoir using the source tracking systems model we first apply the model to a selected compromise strategy we then summarize the results across all strategies the compromise strategy chosen for further analysis attains a reliability of demand satisfaction of 91 resilience of demand satisfaction of 44 days and mean annual deficits of 253 mm3 highlighted in fig 4 4 2 application of the source tracking model the source tracking model conceptually separates the contribution from ns reservoir inflows vrs and inter basin water transfer from the godavari river basin ibwt water or vts to each release of the reservoir here we analyze the contributions from vts to various releases of the ns reservoir and the storage in vts at each fortnightly time step across 15 simulation years for the compromise strategy fig 5 these contributions are evaluated for each of the 100 000 inflow realizations the median as well as the 99 5th percentile values across all realizations are shown it is evident that the median contribution from ibwt water is highest for prior committed transfers pr with values reaching up to 100 during the months of august october on the other hand the outside basin contributions are absent for demand releases dr and environmental flow releases mefr when considering median values however the 99 5th percentile values of the contributions from mefr may reach up to 50 depending upon the specific inflow realization fig 5a these contributions occur during the monsoon season when mef requirements are higher than usual overall we find a strong seasonal imprint on the vts contributions to various releases and considerable inter annual variability of the contributions we now focus on the contributions from vts to mefr as these are directly related to the water quality and ecological effects of the project as contributions from vts show a strong seasonal and inter annual variability we assess how various inflow conditions affect the vts contributions fig 6 to evaluate the impact of seasonality on the contributions we group the monsoon months from june to september as monsoon and the non monsoon months from october to may in the non monsoon category rao 1979 the value of inflow percentiles across all the monsoonal and non monsoonal time steps for 100 000 realizations are calculated fig 6c f we visualize the relative contribution of vts to mefr during non monsoon and monsoon seasons as a function of inflow percentiles fig 6a d for each inflow percentile a range of vts contributions are obtained across time steps in the planning horizon and 100 000 realizations the summary statistics of these contribution values is assessed against each flow percentile the median value of the contribution is nearly zero across all inflow percentiles for both monsoon and non monsoon seasons indicating that in typical flow conditions ibwt water does not contribute to mefr however the 99 5th percentile values of the contributions from ibwt water to mefr are substantial in the monsoon season 0 60 while they range between 0 and 4 in the non monsoon season fig 6a d in the monsoon season the 99 5th percentile vts contribution to mefr increases as inflow reduces the frequency of timesteps contributing to mefr from vts increases with increasing inflows till the 3rd percentile inflow value and reduces below that this indicates that though the frequency of non zero occurrence of vts contribution to mefr is low till the 3rd percentile the aggregated contribution in percentage is high in non monsoon months the 99 5th percentile contribution of vts to mefr peaks in low flow periods reaches 0 for the 3rd 75th inflow percentile and then peaks at around 85th percentile a similar trend is seen in the case of the frequency of time steps contributing to mefr from vts thus the water quality effects of transfers will be more evident during the monsoon season when the environmental flow requirements are higher overall high mefr contributions from ibwt water occur during monsoon season when flow values are low across the 100 000 inflow stochastic realizations the high demands on the ns reservoir in conjunction with reduced inflows during part of the monsoon season resulted in high contribution from ibwt water to mefr in some instances the contribution of ibwt water to irrigation and water supply related releases dr and committed transfers to other reservoirs pr during monsoon and non monsoon seasons against inflow percentile values is similarly shown in supplementary figs s2 s4 similar to the case of mefr the median of contributions from vts to dr is zero across all inflow conditions for both monsoon and non monsoon seasons as inflow decreases the 99 5th percentile contribution from vts to dr increases in both monsoon and non monsoon seasons there is a substantial difference in the patterns of vts contributions to pr when compared to mefr and dr the 99 5th percentile contribution from vts to pr is 100 for all inflow conditions in both monsoon and non monsoon seasons the 99 5th percentile value of the contribution of vts to pr is 100 during monsoon season across most inflows except for inflows lower than the 7th percentile and inflows greater than the 69th percentile whereas in the monsoon season the median value of these contributions reaches 100 only when the 34th inflow percentile is exceeded overall our results indicate a much higher contribution of ibwt water to pr and negligible contribution to dr and mefr in normal median conditions of inflows however when inflows are lower than usual there is a chance of very high contributions from vts to dr and mefr indicating that in a long planning horizon there are likely to be instances when ibwt water is released through the ns reservoir for all purposes we now analyze the volumetric ns reservoir related fluxes at aggregated annual and seasonal time scales fig 7 the figure visualizes each hydrologic flux related to the ns reservoir including vrs vts mefr pr dr er and the water transfer ins transfer the average annual monsoonal and non monsoonal values of these fluxes across all realizations are shown in fig 7a c in order to understand the impact of water transfers during extremely low flow conditions the fluxes are shown for low flow scenarios separately fig 7d f across the 100 000 inflow realizations the flow value at a given time step is classified as low flow when it falls below the 30th percentile of all the values at that time step in the case of monsoon june sept months for non monsoon oct may months the 10th percentile is used as a threshold these thresholds are guided by analyzing the vts contributions across all time steps and 100 000 realizations to identify critical flow values below which significant vts contributions occur fig 6 three main insights are revealed by visualizing the average annual contribution of vts and vrs to each release across the 100 000 realizations and 15 simulation years fig 7a d first during low flow conditions around 14 of mefr green bars are provided by the transferred water vts annually grey shades connecting orange bar to green bars fig 7d however the vts contribution to mefr is only 1 when all flow conditions are considered grey shades connecting orange bar to green bar fig 7a we thus observe that below certain critical flow thresholds ibwt s contributions to mefr become considerable and are likely to impact downstream waters secondly annually 65 of the water earmarked as pr for the somasila project from the ns reservoir purple bars is being met from vts the waters of the donor godavari river basin grey shades connecting orange to purple bars fig 7a during low flow conditions only 29 of the water committed for the somasila project is satisfied by the donor s water while the rest of the requirements go unsatisfied with no contributions from the recipient ns reservoir purple bar fig 7d third the average annual contribution of transferred water to satisfy the recipient ns s own water demands dr is 8 grey shades connecting orange bar to military green bar fig 7a under low flow conditions the percentage contribution from transferred water to ns s own demands rises to 54 grey shades connecting orange bar to military green bar fig 7a thus the ns reservoir depends on the donor s water much more during low flow conditions we now discuss the aggregate monsoonal and non monsoonal contributions at seasonal scales to better understand the difference in dynamics of releases between these two periods fig 7b c e f the contribution to mefr at annual monsoon and non monsoon scales is 1 1 and 0 respectively under all flow conditions however when low flow conditions prevail the contribution from vts to mefr is significant only at annual 14 and monsoon 23 scales low flow conditions in non monsoon months do not result in substantial vts contributions due to lower environmental flow requirements in these months we also find that the contribution from vts to pr is 89 and 43 for the monsoon and non monsoon periods respectively during low flow conditions these contributions reduce to 49 and 5 for monsoon and non monsoon periods respectively across all time steps ibwt s contribution to the ns reservoir s water demands satisfaction is 3 and 12 in monsoon and non monsoon periods respectively during low flow conditions these contributions increase to 63 and 42 in monsoon and non monsoon periods respectively thus ns s increased dependence on transferred water is also observed in extremely low flow conditions to test the generalizability of the results discussed above we further quantify the range of vts contribution across 100 000 realizations at each time step evaluated for all the 27 strategies obtained through optimization fig s5 table s1 overall we do not find any major variations in our results as transfer strategies are altered the contribution of ibwt water to various releases shows minimal variations across the strategies at annual time scales for example across all strategies 6 8 of water to satisfy ns s annual water demands is contributed by water transferred from outside the basin table s1 variation across strategies is slightly greater at the monsoon or non monsoon time scales anywhere between 8 and 13 of water for demand satisfaction is contributed by water transfers during the non monsoon season the highest variation across strategies is observed for low flow conditions when contributions can vary significantly for example in the low flow periods during monsoon the aggregated vts contributions to mefr can vary from 18 to 49 thus the choice of the water transfer strategy has considerable water quality implications under extreme low flow conditions but in average flow conditions the differences are negligible 5 discussion and recommendations studies on inter basin water transfers mainly focus on alleviating the water scarcity in the recipient basin several studies explore other ecological and economic aspects of the water transfer schemes such as the impact of water transfer on the downstream ecosystem and tourism in the recipient akron et al 2017 davies et al 1992 grant et al 2012 karamouz et al 2010 zhuang 2016 in such studies where water transfer projects are proposed to meet multiple goals the source tracking systems model may help to reveal how the transferred water is being utilized across different fluxes from the recipient reservoir the multi basin multi sectoral conflicts are likely to become quite complex under deeply uncertain climate and socio economic changes posing a huge decision analytic challenge bartholomew and kwakkel 2020 gosain et al 2011 herman and zeff 2014 madhusoodhanan et al 2016 our framework allows diagnosis of the water fluxes in multi reservoir systems to ascertain whether they are meeting the intended benefits this information may help water managers to modify operations and or designs for example in the case of the ins project alternatives such as local demand mitigation and virtual water transfers may be considered to reduce the requirements from the ns reservoir to somasilla gao et al 2020 karandish et al 2021 these insights into the flow of water for various purposes and the contribution of various sources to each reservoir release cannot possibly be derived from a simple water balance model due to the time varying nature of the inflows and transfers it is not possible to segregate such effects additionally the source tracking model may also be used to modify the problem formulation of a multi objective optimization problem to include an objective function that minimizes the contribution of the donor s water to releases in the recipient reservoir the source attribution framework proposed here can be used to provide indirect information that can assist in evaluating the extent of impacts on water quality and ecology for example by analyzing the time varying contributions from within basin and outside basin waters to reservoir releases for environmental flows a decision maker may speculate on the seasonal variation in the water quality of downstream river flow nonetheless explicit modeling of ecology or water quality would be a more desirable alternative however the setting up and validation of such models is often challenging due to the unavailability of relevant data also the requisite expertise to apply or interpret the outcomes of such complex models may not be available to planners everywhere in such instances the source attribution framework can be used to provide a quick and approximate understanding of ibwt s impacts which may help guide stakeholder consultations studies have shown that fish species in the krishna basin the recipient basin in ins transfer are already endangered by invasive species of the godavari basin the donor basin in ins transfer due to downstream transfers between the two rivers babu et al 2016 seshagiri et al 2021 these adverse effects on the recipient s ecosystem indicate a need for interventions to avoid the release of the donor s water downstream in the recipient basin our framework helps in revealing underlying failure dynamics thereby we recommend interventions for better management of water transfer fig s6 here we classify the recommendations into structural demand related and policy interventions as below a structural interventions 1 provide separate reservoir storages for the transferred water at the recipient site this reduces the chance of invasive species from godavari waters entering the krishna basin this is a large structural intervention that will incur economic costs and planning to identify another reservoir site however these costs have to be weighed against a potential loss of native fishes from the krishna river 2 structural interventions to avoid entry of invasive species to ns waters arrangements can be made to prevent the fish transfer from the donor to the recipient reservoir for example provision of meshes or other infrastructure arrangements wherever possible b demand related interventions 1 demand management in recipient basin cropping patterns of the ns command area may be revised to better adjust to its own available water this may be coupled with an improvement in irrigation water management to reduce water loss 2 water managers are recommended to revisit the demands from the somasila project and reduce the amount of water being transferred studies show that introducing artificial groundwater recharge and conjunctive use successfully reduces the deficits to a great extent molakala et al 2022 such policy interventions in the somasila reservoir can reduce stress on the nagarjuna sagar reservoir c policy interventions 1 re envisaged water use in water scarce regions water is a resource that can be used for many economic activities agriculture being one by designing policies that train the populace in water scarce regions towards equally beneficial but lower water use activities reliance on water transfers may be reduced 2 connect the canals of inchampalli and somasila directly to avoid negative consequences on the ns downstream ecology this recommendation arises from the observation that a considerable portion of water transfer is used to satisfy the requirements of somasilla therefore it makes practical sense to check whether a canal directly connecting the godavari to somasilla may be feasible this avoids the mixing of godavari s and krishna s water and propagation of species upstream of the recipient reservoir 3 decentralizing water storage and distribution network by providing small scale infrastructures it may be beneficial to rethink the design of the ins project instead of transferring water first to the ns reservoir and then releasing it for demand satisfaction water may be directly delivered to the agricultural sites using secondary water storage such as tank systems tank systems predate modern water infrastructure and have enabled water management in southern india for centuries anuradha et al 2021 shah and sakthivadivel 2019 venkatachalam and balooni 2018 these may be directly connected with the donor to avoid mixing external water into the ns reservoir 6 conclusions this study proposed a systems model to track the contribution of outside basin water to reservoir releases in a multi reservoir project the proposed model was used to analyze the consequences of several alternative water transfer strategies on reservoir releases for the ins project this proposed model can be applied to any multi reservoir system where multiple water sources exist source attribution is particularly very useful in inter basin water transfer to understand how the water from two basins is collectively used to meet the demands and mitigate the water stress and comprehend the implications on the ecology and water quality of the recipient water the results revealed interesting insights that the water transferred through the ins project is being used to transfer further away from nagarjuna sagar which is a consequence of multiple interconnected water transfers our analysis highlights the need to revisit the project design and find ways to reduce the reliance on outside basin water by considering demand side alternatives such as virtual water trade irrigation water management cropping pattern alterations and economic outputs through non agricultural activities in basins reaching the limit of freshwater water use etc water quality and downstream ecology are likely to be critically affected by water transfers but require complex models to understand benedini and george 2013 our alternative framework provides a simpler approach to better understand the processes involved in inter basin water transfers it reveals complex trade offs between the water demands investment costs of interventions to avert ecological damage and ecological health of the recipient basin there is a need to better understand the level of acceptability to the donor in transferring water during water stress periods and designing incentive structures for the donor basins to help manage the water transfers better the source tracking framework can be applied to any reservoir system and operating policy given an increasing discussion on inter basin water transfers a simple framework that can be applied to any water transfer project to better understand the underlying complexities will help enable dialogue between various parties involved credit authorship contribution statement manvitha molakala methodology conceptualization formal
